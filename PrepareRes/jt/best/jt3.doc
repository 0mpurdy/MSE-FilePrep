Pages 1 to 126 "The Remnant in Relation to Prophetic Testimony", 1910 (Volume 10).
READING
@Isaiah 6:1 - 13
J.T. In every dispensation there has been Prophetic ministry. You get it in the first world in connection with Enoch. He was a prophet, and Abraham was a prophet.
R.S.S. Jude indicates that as to Enoch.
J.T. It comes out more clearly in each dispensation when things have declined; when departure from that which God had established in each dispensation took place the prophetic ministry was more in evidence.
R.S.S. I suppose it would come in for the purpose of recovery after departure had taken place. When you speak of dispensation, do you include christianity?
J.T. Certainly. It was in that connection I had the liberty to suggest the thought as bearing on ourselves.
J.P. I suppose you would say the conditions obtain now that call for the application of prophetic ministry. You were remarking that prophetic ministry comes in in the Scriptures when there is a breakdown of that which God may have established.
J.T. I think it is more apparent then. So in our dispensation the book of Revelation takes that character. It is consequent on the decline which set in in the assembly.
W.J.N. Has it only for its object the idea of recovery?
J.T. In the main, I think; but not *only* recovery; it has the character of an address to the whole responsible body of any given era. It places the whole body under responsibility, although they may not understand; it may not be intelligible to them,
{2}
and this may be judicial; but while it places the whole body under responsibility, it encourages the remnant. It establishes the remnant by bringing in God's mind in regard to a future dispensation. Each remnant is allowed to look forward to another dispensation in which their hopes and desires should be established; so that prophecy includes, therefore, the announcement of future things.
J.P. The Lord's ministry in @Matthew 13 has a judicial character, because the very scripture we have read is quoted there.
J.T. And also @John 12.
R.S.S. What do you allude to in @John 12?
J.T. @Isaiah 53 is quoted first in verse 38: "who hath believed our report?" and then the Lord says, "Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart" (verse 40). But you get in the prophetic ministry encouragement for the remnant as to what is future. For instance, Enoch said he saw the Lord coming with ten thousands of His saints. He was evidently alone, but it would be an immense thought that there should be myriads of God's saints, and the Lord should come with them.
R.S.S. Why do you say he was alone?
J.T. The Spirit does not mention any other. It says, "Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him", @Genesis 5:24. He had the testimony that he pleased God.
J.P. Each mention of Enoch seems to present him as alone. There is no expression of any others being in association with him, whether he is walking with God or whether in connection with what the Spirit takes up through Jude.
R.S.S. Does the ministry that is given to the remnant in that way, or in connection with what is future, necessarily affect the remnant themselves, or is it for others or both? I mean that God gives a ministry to the remnant when failure comes in, and
{3}
this has usually what God has before Him in regard to a future dispensation; is that in connection with the remnant themselves, or is it in connection with others?
J.T. I think, as I said, it places the whole public body under responsibility, for God had sent the prophets to the nation. You will find that each prophet as a rule records the date of his prophecy, and it is a very remarkable thing that the last prophet addresses *Israel* -- the whole nation.
R.S.S. As in contrast with Judah or Ephraim.
J.T. You get Elijah and Elisha ministering in the midst of the ten tribes; whereas Isaiah, Jeremiah and Hosea, and others whose histories are not recorded, ministered in Jerusalem. But it is a very remarkable thing that the burden of the very last prophet, who evidently ministered to the recovered remnant from Babylon, is to Israel. I mean Malachi. Isaiah prophesied in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, and his word had reference to Judah and Jerusalem. Evidently he had in view a remnant in relation to God's city.
R.S.S. That is very interesting.
C.A. I suppose you would say the prophetic ministry becomes effective in the remnant while it does not in the people at large.
J.T. It places the body at large under responsibility, God having made a fresh overture to them; but it establishes the remnant in the knowledge of God's interests, and the announcement of a future order of things in which all their hopes should find their realisation.
R.S.S. 'In which their hopes should find realisation' -- that answers my question.
J.T. So you find at the end of this section in Isaiah that their hopes are all realised. They engage in a song of triumph to Jehovah in connection with the realisation of all their hopes. Chapter 12.
{4}
J.B. In every prophetic ministry, would there not be a distinct word of the Lord for the nation?
J.T. That is exactly the point, so that the Spirit gives us the date of the ministries of the prophets. Therefore, in order to understand the conditions over which the different kings reigned, you have to examine the prophets that ministered in each reign. For instance, we might take Josiah's reign as a remarkable one, which it was, and yet the prophet Zephaniah ministered in Josiah's reign, and if you read Zephaniah there is no encouragement as regards the body at large; God was coming in in judgment to remove them. So that you get the internal state of the body at large in the prophet, whereas the record of the king's reign may be very bright and encouraging. In the latter the Spirit is simply putting forward the personality of the king and his faithfulness, whereas the prophet deals with the people.
R.S.S. That is very helpful indeed. So that in reading the Scriptures it would be well to read both the historical part of the books of Kings and Chronicles and the prophets together.
J.T. It is essential to do that if you wish to understand the conditions that prevailed in each reign. You may take any era of the history of the church; God might give a powerful ministry through some servant, and the Spirit might present that ministry to you and encourage you with it, but that servant being removed, the condition of the body at large comes into evidence, and things are not so bright as you might have thought they were. God is acquainted with the state of the people, and you must examine the character of the ministry to determine the state of the people.
J.B. That state is always laid bare by the prophet.
A.R.S. Did the state of the people not depend also on the kind of a king they had?
J.T. No doubt the kings had a good deal to do
{5}
with the forming of the people, but at the same time the low underlying condition of the people in the days of Hezekiah and Josiah is marked in spite of the faithfulness of the king. In this prophecy of Isaiah you see the terrible condition that existed in the people.
W.J.N. And that in the reign of godly kings. Speaking of Josiah, the manner of his death was long a mystery to me. It is helpful to see that the state of the people was beneath it.
L.T.F. A godly king affected the people outwardly. Their inward state came out in another way.
J.T. The state of the people came out in the wilderness; they were idolatrous. God said, "I will carry you away beyond Babylon", @Acts 7:43. That was before ever they went into Canaan. God acted in love towards them, but the state of the people was marked by unbelief from start to finish.
A.A.T. While the state of the people in general was one of unbelief, did you not say the word in the prophets is more directly to the remnant as a word of encouragement?
J.T. It was that, but it was a word to the people at large as well, as we have been saying.
W.J.N. And so the thought of judgment is found largely in the prophecies.
J.T. No doubt, in every prophet.
W.J.N. And there is the same thought in the New Testament prophecies.
J.T. There must be of necessity, because they are introduced on account of declension; where departure sets in God must intimate judgment.
L.T.F. What was the element of encouragement to the remnant?
J.T. You get it in the next chapters. For instance, Isaiah had a son called Shear-jashub, and he was to go to the king with that child, the meaning of the name of the child being
{6}
*a remnant shall return*. There you see how God meets the people. This chapter is preliminary to what follows, because the prophet himself needed light. What enlightens us in regard to the prevailing conditions is the sight of the King, the King seen in His true light; thus everything is seen in its true light; "mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts". Isaiah discovers his own state and the state of the people.
A.R.S. You mean that he got into the presence of God, and there you understand everything.
J.L.J. You would say we need to see the King in the same light today.
J.T. As Isaiah saw Him. The throne had been disgraced by the line of kings. Uzziah was a peculiar character. He became a leper. He had attempted to enter into the temple to minister as a priest, and he became a leper, and we are told he dwelt in a separate house till the day of his death. It was in the year that he died that Isaiah saw the King. Jotham was his son. Jotham was not the ruling king now. The ruling king was Jehovah, and he says, "I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne". The throne had been vacated; Uzziah had died, and what the prophet sees is God upon His throne; that is the sight you want to see if the responsible element fails; "his train filled the temple". He was on the throne, and He was supreme in the temple also, so things were secure.
R.S.S. What would you say King Uzziah set forth? Was it presumption?
J.T. It was presumption for one not a priest to take up priestly service.
R.S.S. So it set aside in that way the holiness of God. None, even the king, could approach Him save a priest.
J.T. It was a denial of the character of the house. Both the throne and the house had been affected, and
{7}
what is encouraging here is that Jehovah is on His throne, and that His train fills the temple; so that He has secured the throne and the temple.
R.S.S. Uzziah really defiled both.
J.P. And it is what marks the moment that gives it such wonderful force; it is in the year that King Uzziah died.
J.T. That is what I was thinking of. Isaiah is to be the vessel for the conveyance of God's mind to the people, and he is furnished at the start with this wonderful vision.
J.B. Is there not always some revelation of God to a prophet at the start?
J.T. Always something that indicates the state of things in which his ministry is to be carried out.
J.B. It is the character of God.
J.T. It is like a man's gift. He gets some particular view of Christ. For instance, Elisha saw Christ, typically, going up, and he saw the chariots and the horsemen; that is, the grace of Christ ascending would fill his soul, and his ministry would be accompanied by the power of God to carry that grace into effect. So here, the throne and the temple were the two features that every right-minded Israelite would have before him, and Isaiah begins with this wonderful vision.
W.J.N. Why are the seraphim here?
J.T. Because it is a question of God's nature. It is a question of the ministry of grace, but in connection with God's holy nature.
J.P. Hence the three-fold ascription, "Holy, holy, holy".
J.T. They surround the throne. I think the vision taken as a whole represents God as in complete control of the throne and the temple. His holiness in that way is guarded; and then you get the activity of grace, with the becoming humility in the seraphim; "with twain he covered his face, and with twain he
{8}
covered his feet, and with twain he did fly". Everything that is suitable to the occasion is there.
J.B. What do the seraphim represent?
J.T. They are connected with God's nature, I think, and in this instance they guard His nature. "Holy, holy, holy". It is a question of guarding the divine nature; but then there is activity in connection with that, and it takes the form of relief; He relieves the prophet.
R.S.S. When you speak of guarding God's nature, would that include love as well as holiness?
J.T. It would now, seeing that God is fully revealed. He is love in His nature; He is love, but it is a holy love.
J.B. Is He not taking into account the earth here and also man in this connection, "the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory"? The question was asked as to the love as well as the holiness, and here God is regarding the Man in whom the love of God is expressed.
J.T. But I think the point is, everything is secured divinely in the presence of the state of the people. The throne and the temple and the nature of God, guarded morally by the seraphim -- all this in the presence of the state of the people. The people were unclean.
W.C.R. The prophet was brought into moral fitness for it by the coal from the altar.
J.T. That is a helpful thought.
W.B. I have wondered if the Lord's appearance to Moses in the bush was akin to this.
J.T. It indicated what would mark his ministry. The bush burned and was not consumed. It refers to the dealings of God with a people in the wilderness -- His discipline; that the bush should be unconsumed, and yet God should be in the midst in discipline.
W.B. I was thinking that everything should be according to the character of God; the place was
{9}
holy, and God wrought to bring His people to that. He never deviates from what He is.
J.T. The tabernacle sets forth that if men were to draw near to Him they must be in accord with what He is.
A.A.T. In what way can we have God's nature guarded as it is spoken of here?
J.T. It is a question now of the priestly state here upon earth, and that is a result of the Holy Spirit.
G.F.W. Is it not that God's nature is really guarded in the affections of the saints?
J.T. I think it is the priestly state. You require that now in order to have divine things guarded.
A.A.T. Is that an individual matter?
J.T. Priesthood is individual. You would not allow an attack on Christ if you love Him. That is the guard against evil doctrine.
G.F.W. You mean an attack in your own heart?
J.T. Or anywhere else.
G.F.W. But that is the main point, is it not?
J.T. You would have to guard against yourself, but the priesthood will not suffer *any* attack on Christ.
A.A.T. I was helped recently in seeing that, although Moses was the meekest man on the earth, yet when sin occurred in the camp, he was very firm.
J.T. The, seraphim represent the agency by which the divine nature is guarded here on earth.
T.A. Would you say, that holiness in the vessel and testimony, are connected in this chapter?
J.T. Yes.
T.A. How necessary it is to be holy before any true testimony can go out!
J.T. What was remarked is very important, that the prophet is put into moral correspondence with the vision through the coal from the altar. You feel that on our side death is necessary if we are to be put into moral relation with the holiness of God.
{10}
W.B. Nothing short of holiness will do for a people in relation with God.
J.T. Quite so; and also if you are to become a messenger to convey the divine thoughts to His people.
J.B. Mary says, "he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name", @Luke 1:49.
W.B. There must be fitness first.
J.T. You feel in ministry, that it is of immense importance, because if ministry is taken up apart from the altar you are sure to get corrupt thoughts in connection with what is ministered. Do you not think so?
J.P. I am sure of it; so this chapter is properly introductory; hence you get first the one who is to be the vessel of this prophetic message; he is fitted; and then the remnant comes to light at the end, the *tenth*, @Isaiah 6:13.
T.A. Is the *tenth* God's portion?
J.T. Clearly. I believe that each prophet sees something at the outset, and what he is to say to the people takes character from what he sees. For instance, Jeremiah saw an almond tree and a seething pot, the interpretation being that God would hasten His word to perform it; so that what you feel you get with Jeremiah is the faithfulness of God. He would carry out His word. And Ezekiel sees something that indicates the power of God; His name indeed signifies '*strength*'.
J.P. And it is what each one sees that stamps its character on their ministry.
J.L.J. How is the live coal applied at the present time?
J.T. It refers to the ministry of grace; this is seen in the swiftness of the seraphim to effect relief. Isaiah says, "I am a man of unclean lips"; that is what we are by nature. You do not want to use anything you may have acquired by nature in your ministry.
{11}
J.L.J. It is applied to the mouth and lips.
T.A. Would it not apply to suitability to set forth the testimony?
J.T. You are in correspondence with the vision, so that now you are ready to be sent.
C.A. The prophet had to become qualified.
J.T. "These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him", @John 12:41. That is the kind of testimony you want to render -- a testimony of Christ as seen in His glory.
W.H.F. Is this the character of discipline in connection with the prophet in order to fit him for his work?
J.T. The light of God in His holy nature shone in upon his soul, and he felt how utterly unclean he was. He had been pronouncing woes on others before, and rightly, but now he sees himself.
W.J.N. As the prophetic word became effective in the remnant, would it have the same effect on them as on the prophet?
J.T. I think so. In chapter 9 you get, "unto us a child is born", @Isaiah 9:6. They come now to see the Child. They come into the light of Christ, but at this point it is a question of the prophet. He sees the Lord in His glory. If you see the Lord in His glory your ministry will produce a people that will speak of Him; there will be response to Christ. In chapter 9 they take account of the Lord as on their side. By the gospel you are brought into the light of what Christ is on our side, so that you claim Him as it were.
C.A. So that it is very essential what he sees of the glory.
J.T. Every minister ought to be very sure that he has seen the glory.
C.A. You see that exemplified in the apostle Paul.
{12}
He sees the glory above the brightness of the mid-day sun.
W.H.F. I suppose there are hardly two that get the same impression.
J.T. Nothing evidences that more than the prophets. Each prophet gets some view peculiar to himself.
J.B. Something distinctive.
W.H.F. So that each one is characterised by the impression he gets from the Lord.
J.T. The prophets are very encouraging in that way, and instructive, too, in regard to the ministry.
W.B. Does that come out in the way of gifts?
J.T. I think gifts are analogous. It is a question of what view a man gets of the Lord.
W.H.F. Do you not think the prophets through in their own spirits the condition of things before God?
J.T. I am sure they did. Isaiah judged the state of things in which he found himself, as well as himself.
A.R.S. Do you not think you get a very good example here of the way the servant is trained for his work? The Lord says, "who will go for us?" and now Isaiah is ready. He had seen the Lord and had his lips touched; he was in moral correspondence, and the Lord says, "who will go?" and he says, "Here am I". He is ready. He has been trained.
J.T. And then the message that he had to carry here was such a painful one; it was a message of judgment; but, although in his affections he might say "Lord, how long?" because he loved the people, yet he was in entire accord with God's holy nature in his testimony.
W.J.N. I suppose one could hardly be the bearer of a message of judgment unless he is himself in accord with it morally.
J.T. Although in your affections you regret that it is necessary to carry it.
{13}
W.J.N. You are in accord with the judgment yourself.
J.T. But you feel for the people.
W.J.N. I mean you are in the good of the live coal being applied to the lips.
J.T. You are in sympathy with God, but you feel for the people. If judgment has to be executed, every right-minded believer thinks of the people on whom it falls. Take Moses as an example. He would ask Jehovah that he might be blotted out of His book rather than that the people should be blotted out, and Paul had wish that he was accursed from Christ for Israel's sake.
W.J.N. So even Christ could weep for Jerusalem.
J.B. Is it not the afflictions of Christ and the sorrows of Christ in that way that came out in these prophets, like the Lamentations?
J.T. It was the Spirit of Christ, but they acquired that Spirit by beholding Him. "These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory", @John 12:41.
G.F.W. Some of the prophets had to go through fearful things. One had to lie so many hundred days on one side.
J.T. That was Ezekiel, and you find Isaiah walked naked and barefoot for a long time. It shows how entirely given up to the divine will they were. They were there for the will of God and nothing else.
R.S.S. And I suppose as an indication of what the people themselves will suffer.
J.T. In each of those instances it was so. The testimony set before the people of what they should go through -- Isaiah referring to Egypt, and Ezekiel to Israel. Instead of God having to employ angels to carry out His will in the midst of the people, He is pleased to take men, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, but they had to go through severe discipline so as to be brought so under the will of God as to be subject to it.
A.A.T. And it is so that God would discipline the
{14}
prophets, each one in a different way, to fit them for that service.
G.F.W. Did they not have to do with the state of the people in some way and in some connection with Christ?
J.T. The thought of God was, that the Spirit of Christ should be set forth in them. Each one sets forth some particular phase of Christ, but God had them so under His control that He could use them in setting forth His mind in connection with the people.
G.F.W. How could the prophet lying on his side have reference to the people?
J.T. It had reference to the judgment of God which was coming on them for their protracted years of iniquity. The message given to Isaiah here had reference to the state of the nation. It was a message of judgment: it says, "Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed". That was a terrible message to carry, but it showed that God was coming in in judgment on the people; it marked the state of things during the Lord's ministry.
R.S.S. But such judgment could come in only where there had been the refusal of the light beforehand.
J.T. It referred to the state of the people. There should be a ministry in their midst that was of God, and yet they could not understand it. That is to my mind a terrible judgment -- the people placed under responsibility by a message they could not understand.
J.B. Is not this the greatest of all judgments, that people should hear and not perceive? Their case was hopeless.
{15}
J.T. There is no hope for such people. So the prophet says, "How long?" and the answer is still more terrible; "Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate".
J.L.J. Would you say there is no hope of getting any better? In the state contemplated they would not accept the message.
J.T. In our own time there has been a message of God going out, and it places the whole body of Christendom under responsibility, and yet as a matter of fact they cannot understand it.
W.H.F. And not only that, but many have really turned aside from the light.
J.T. And we are going on to a moment when God shall send men strong delusion that they should believe a lie (see @2 Thessalonians 2:11).
J.B. How does this correspond with the end of @John 9: "For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind"?
J.T. It is very similar. You get the full result in chapter 12. The Lord had been all day long stretching out His hand, and then quotes Isaiah: "Lord, who hath believed our report?", @John 12:38. John says, "they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes", @John 12:39,40. He quotes from this chapter -- @Isaiah 6. It shows, that God had come in in judgment so that they could not discern His testimony.
J.B. What is the coal from off the altar? Would that take into account the remnant and God dealing with them?
J.T. It has reference to Christ bearing the judgment of God sacrificially. The remnant is all secured through the testimony of the altar. Everything is to
{16}
be placed in correspondence with the vision, and this is through the death of Christ.
J.B. The altar refers to judgment, there is the fire there.
J.T. It is the consuming of what is contrary to God, and the message corresponds with that; till "the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed men far away".
J.B. Cleansing comes from that.
E. Would the judgment be just previous to God's grace coming in in its fulness?
J.T. The judgment is consequent on light having been presented, and refused. God does not come in all at once, and execute judgment because the light is refused, but He introduces a testimony and closes people's ears and eyes, so that they should not hear and see it, that is, this judgment should be seen as righteous.
E. That would apply to this present age.
J.T. That is the solemn part of it.
R.S.S. It was the same with Pharoah. God hardened Pharaoh's heart, but not till he refused light from God.
J.B. Was not the real fulfilment of this when men were tested by the Lord Himself?
J.T. The Lord said: "Now is the judgment of this world", @John 12:31. That shows the Lord was the test; the light was there, and it was rejected; but He immediately goes on to say: "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me", @John 12:32. His death is introduced. It is not His ascension. It is His death.
J.B. It is the manner in which He should die.
A.R.S. What does it mean when it says, "will draw all men unto me"?
J.T. I think it means that He should be the gathering centre, as having died in this way.
A.R.S. Not that every one will be drawn to Him.
{17}
J.P. That all that are drawn are drawn *to Him*. There is no other centre.
S.T. Is it the separating of the remnant?
J.T. Yes. The world is judged, and the remnant find their new centre in Him. *All* are drawn to Him.
W.B. Does not Paul refer to this in the last recorded statement in the Acts, the last appeal?
J.T. That is the last appeal to the Jews as such in the Scriptures, @Acts 28.
W.J.N. Does not John's gospel in a general way contemplate the present day, that is, prophetically? I was thinking of chapter 2. You get His death and resurrection referred to there, and I suppose you get in the following chapters what would be true in connection with the presence of the Spirit here.
J.T. John meets the breakdown in the church. John is the great prophet in christianity. But then his prophetic message runs concurrently with the message of life which the gospel is; so that the remnant is sustained in life, while the prophetic message runs on and places the whole body of Christendom under responsibility. Hence the prophetic word given to John was to be written in a book. It was not a message to each church alone. It was to be put into a book and sent to the churches. Each church was to get the book. So that the whole body of Christendom is placed under responsibility by the prophetic word of John.
R.S.S. I remember you remarked at one time, in connection with the prophets, something that helped me very much. We have been speaking of it while together, in a way. It is that you find the most scathing judgments pronounced, and then perhaps in the very next verse you find words of most beautiful encouragement, and you are surprised to see them side by side; they are almost in the same sentence. But you remarked that in order to read the prophets aright you have to take into account, on the one hand,
{18}
that God is addressing the responsible body; and, on the other hand, He is addressing the remnant.
J.T. That is a most helpful point. Now in the book of Revelation you get what answers to that fully. The Lord is seen by the prophet first of all, in the character of a Judge. That referred to the responsible body. He was in the midst of the assemblies -- the seven assemblies representing the whole responsible body in Christendom; the Lord is there in the midst as a Judge. John falls at His feet as one that is dead, and the Lord says to him, "Fear not", @Revelation 1:17. His word to *John* is entirely different. His judicial garb had no reference to John. John represents the remnant. The Lord says; "I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades", @Revelation 1:18. That is for the remnant. Then in chapter 4 John says, "After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither", @Revelation 4:1. In that way the remnant is encouraged, while the great body of Christendom is left on earth in Laodicea; the door is opened in heaven, and the voice says, "Come up hither". I believe in that way the hearts of God's saints are sustained while there is the announcement of the most terrible judgments on those who have failed.
J.B. Is not the point that God's land should be reserved for the remnant?
J.T. Yes; a remnant should come back, but even that remnant has to undergo the discipline of God; but the point is, "the holy seed shall be the substance thereof", @Isaiah 6:13.
J.B. That is, the substance of the teil and the oak shall be there though the leaves are gone.
S.T. Discipline has always in view the saving of the remnant.
{19}
J.T. And the land belonged to them.
C.A. The door is opened in heaven.
J.T. That is for us.
R.S.S. What does the holy seed represent? Is it the work of God in the saints?
J.T. It refers to what is of Christ subjectively in the remnant -- what is of God. That was the substance.
W.B. "In it". What does that refer to?
J.T. The *tenth*. "And it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof".
W.B. Then the tenth comes out of the nation?
J.T. That is God's portion, but even that should come under His discipline.
R.S.S. "Shall be eaten" -- that would indicate discipline.
J.T. I think so. The substance should remain, which is the holy seed.
W.B. Would Paul be like that? He was the representative of the remnant.
J.T. He spoke of himself in that light: "I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin", @Romans 11:1. God had reserved to Himself a remnant according to the election of grace. The remnant is God's portion. That is important to see. I have reserved to myself seven thousand.
W.B. How do you understand what we get in @Luke 17: ten men cleansed from their leprosy, but only one of them that returned? Have we anything to do with the nine that were cleansed or the tenth?
J.T. You feel the responsibility of the nine was there, and that always holds good; while Christendom
{20}
exists on earth, the responsibility of the total remains. The ten were all responsible. They had received blessing from the Lord, and that placed them, morally, under obligations, whereas only one returned. That one was God's portion.
R.S.S. In connection with Isaiah's question to the Lord, it shows how well he knew God's character. He says: "Lord, how long?" He knew God in such a way that when he spoke of judgment he could ask a question like that. You get that in other servants of God: Abraham, for instance, when God was about to destroy Sodom, raised the question: "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" @Genesis 18:25, when he pleads for the city on account of the righteous who might be there.
J.T. It is beautiful that the prophet says, *How long*?
R.S.S. What do you see in it?
J.T. I think it is the affection that is proper to a servant, to all who are with God; affection for God's people. You care for them in spite of their weakness.
W.C.R. They like to see the judgment delayed.
J.T. It is not that exactly, but you feel for them.
L.T.F. It is the idea that there is an end to judgment and something beyond; a remnant saved.
J.T. It is not that the prophet would like to have the wicked man retained in the land, but the people abstractly were God's people; as we were saying; Moses felt it in that way.
W.B. You get the thought in David in the numbering of the people. His spirit seemed to go out for them in connection with the plague.
J.T. He called them *sheep*. A man that can, with God, look at the saints as sheep.
G.F.W. Is it not that he longed for that line of things to be over and the new to come in?
J.T. You can always tell where a man is when he begins to speak of God's people. You can form an
{21}
idea of where he is in his soul if you hear him speak of God's people. The terms he uses indicate where he is. Now David showed his character; he began with caring for the sheep. He had been caring for his father's sheep, and the truth was that God intended him to be a shepherd of Israel, and he retained this character. "These sheep, what have they done?", @2 Samuel 24:17. But really things were not right with them, and God was dealing with them. He moved David to number them.
J.P. That was beautiful on the part of David; "these sheep"!
J.T. You will always get the divine line marked out in contrast to the evil line; the divine line is marked out by the way in which individuals are occupied and how they speak. Abel was a keeper of sheep, not an owner; whereas Cain was a tiller of the ground. I believe you have in Abel the line of God marked out. He is not self-occupied, he has an object outside of himself; he is occupied with sheep. I believe it was Christ prefigured.
J.B. On the contrary, Nabal was a sheep owner, and those that protected the sheep he despised.
J.T. David and his men were a wall to them in the wilderness.
W.B. @John 10 brings out very beautifully what was prefigured in Abel.
J.T. The Lord really was prefigured in that way in Abel, and you get it always. Take Abraham, he was a keeper of sheep; for he was a keeper of God's people. Although Lot virtually separated from him, yet Abraham loved him, and when he was in trouble Abraham was his friend and rescued him from the enemy. It shows, I think, the spirit of Christ. You will always find that when people are with God they
{22}
care for God's people. And then later you find Abraham interceding for Lot.
G.A.H. Would you say that Moses was not qualified to care for the people when he left the court of Pharoah? He needed forty years¬ discipline.
J.T. He was not *qualified*, but the *shepherd* was there; he would take care of them. He had the right motive. He had the affections. The Spirit of God charges wickedness on the people for rejecting Moses when he first sought to care for them, @Acts 7:25,35.
J.N.H. You speak of one who while exercised for the good of God's people, even acted in self-will.
J.T. Yes; but it is beautiful that God alludes to that incident in the testimony of Stephen. He says, they would not have the deliverer when he was there. It was out of love for the people that he slew the Egyptian, and sought to establish peace between his brethren.
A.A.T. I was thinking that when we are exercised as to the saints in the way we speak of here, as were Moses and Paul, the exercise must be of God, and we must look to Him, and He will come in in response to the exercise.
J.T. It is a great thing to know how to care for the sheep properly. Moses had the right idea, and the Spirit of God does not say anything about the self-confidence that might have been in it. But then it is very important to know *how* to care for the sheep. I believe that David had divine instruction before he had the place. He kept his father's sheep in the wilderness, where there was no one to applaud him. He had to rescue the sheep from the lion and the bear in a secret kind of way, and then he is made the shepherd of God's people Israel; and it is beautiful that he retained his shepherd character to the last. "These sheep, what have they done?"
{23}
C.A. So Peter had to go through a great deal of discipline before being qualified to be a shepherd, but he became one.
J.N.H. I was wondering why you mentioned that it might be in self-will.
J.T. I would not say self-will, but you feel there was irregularity in connection with what Moses did; the time had not come.
M. When Moses started he did so in his own strength, and slew the Egyptian, but after he was disciplined forty years he went forth in the strength of God.
J.T. He could not even speak. You appreciate the man who retires, who refuses the place. He takes it because it is imperative, and there is no one else to do it.
R.S.S. You get the same thought in connection with Paul and the Thessalonians: "But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse", @1 Thessalonians 2:7. That would suggest the same thought. A nurse is not the owner of the children. Paul says: "we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us", @1 Thessalonians 2:8. It was affection. It should be that in every case.
W.B. We should get along better if we were like that.
J.T. Have an object outside of yourself. You are not thinking of yourself, but you are set for the good of others.
J.P. It may be late to ask this question, but what about that expression, "the whole earth is full of his glory"?
J.T. It is a wonderful expression.
J.P. When you come to the details of the chapter it does not look like that, does it? I mean the cities wasted without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the land utterly desolate. I suppose if we get the vision of God as the prophet did, as you said, we see
{24}
He is on the throne and His train fills the temple, and then you get this ascription on the part of the seraphim, and then you get the result, the whole earth is full of His glory. It is prophetic, the full and final result seen in the light of the throne, and God on the throne. When the prophet said "how long?" it would be how long till this result would be reached; and you notice in @Isaiah 12 the result *is* reached -- the whole earth is full of His glory. The earth is mentioned; "in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord", @Isaiah 12:4. "Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth", @Isaiah 12:5. I suppose it is a great thing for us at the present time to see the full result.
{25}
READING
@Isaiah 7
J.T. My thought was that we might see the connection between the prophetic ministry of the Old Testament and the remnant of God's people as seen there; of course, with the view that we might see its bearing on ourselves.
What we see in this chapter is another part of the ministry of Isaiah. In chapter 6 he is engaged with the announcement of judgment, here he is the messenger of glad tidings to the king. This chapter is really for the remnant, whereas the other has a more direct application to the mass of the people; they were to come under God's judgment; but in this chapter you see a direct appeal to faith: "If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established" (verse 9). I believe we have thus indicated the two parts of the ministry of the prophets: the one having to do with the mass of those alienated from God, and the other addressed to the remnant of God's people, to support and encourage them. Ahaz, I suppose, may be taken to represent what was of God. Although personally not with God, he was in the place of leadership of those whom God still owned.
R.S.S. And he was on the line of David.
J.T. Exactly; of the house of David; that is, he was in the place which properly belonged to Christ; and I think that as we go on in the book, we see that Hezekiah answers to Christ -- to Immanuel. He is the foreshadowing of Christ; he cares genuinely for the remnant and through him deliverance comes. He believed. He asked Isaiah to pray for the remnant that was left, and through his instrumentality God intervened and overthrew the Assyrian.
R.S.S. That was in connection with his spreading out the letter before the Lord.
{26}
J.T. I only make these remarks to try and make clear the situation of this chapter. You have, on the one hand, the second part of the prophet's ministry, and then a responsible person as the leader of the people, and God addressing Himself to faith. Everything would be on that principle.
R.S.S. The second part of the prophet's ministry would be that which is addressed to the remnant; the first part that which is addressed to Israel as a responsible body. I suppose at all times God gives leaders or guides.
J.T. I suppose so; it is God's way of keeping His people; from the moment that He had a people He had a leader. Do you not think that is what is needed at all times amongst us?
R.S.S. Quite so; and, on the other hand, that when leaders are there they should be recognised. We should know whom to follow.
J.T. Of course, Christ is the Leader of God's people, and all true guides under Christ would partake of His character.
R.S.S. And so that is what you would look for -- those who really follow Christ.
J.T. And you will find where such an one exists, the object of Satan will be to divert the people from him. It is very noticeable that Rab-shakeh, the emissary of Sennacherib, did his utmost to divert the people from Hezekiah. His effort outside the walls of Jerusalem was to divert them from Hezekiah.
R.S.S. Even speaking in their own language so that they should understand.
W.C.R. It was to weaken their confidence in the king.
J.T. Yes; if the enemy can divert the saints from those whom God would use to shepherd them, he gains a great advantage.
W.B. The word of God is with a leader.
J.T. And I think it is important, as we were
{27}
saying this morning, that a true leader of God's people partakes of the character of a shepherd -- we see this from Abel onwards.
W.C.R. We read in @Hebrews 13:17; "Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls". Is that the idea?
J.T. Yes; then you get in that same passage: "the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep" (@Hebrews 13:20); and in Peter: "Ye ... are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls", @1 Peter 2:25.
G.F.W. That is the idea of a bishop.
J.T. Yes. A good meeting has generally a good leader or guide.
G.F.W. I quite admit the importance of a leader, but I am not so sure about what you say. What I mean is, that some meetings are very small, and without much leadership, yet saints go on happily together.
J.T. Of course, there may be faith in each to lay hold of the unseen One. "The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands", @Proverbs 30:27. But speaking generally, God's way of helping saints is by a leader. If there is blessing and souls are being helped in a locality through the gospel, you will find the need of leaders.
G.F.W. I quite admit that.
J.B. A leader would not be officious; he would help more by influence.
J.T. Every true leader partakes of the character of Christ; he is a shepherd. Like Abel, he is a feeder of sheep.
W.H.F. Such would be more on the line of a pastor.
J.T. He has regard for the saints.
{28}
F.L. I think so. The king comes to us along that line. And then you are speaking of the remnant. I suppose we see the character of the remnant indicated in @Luke 2; there were faithful men, shepherds, watching over their flocks by night, at the time of the darkness.
J.P. So the apostle exhorted the Ephesian elders to feed the church of God.
R.S.S. Referring to the word quoted from @Hebrews 13:17: "Obey them that have the rule over you"; it is not exactly rule; it is rather the thought of a guide. The margin reads *guide*.
W.H.F. There are two passages.
W.C.R. "Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God" (@Hebrews 13:7) and "Obey your leaders, and be submissive; for they watch over your souls as those that shall give account", @Hebrews 13:17.
R.S.S. Is there such a thing as rule in the assembly?
J.T. I think there is. I think the cherubim in the house represent the rule that is there. The cherubim on the walls of the temple represented the rule of God in the house.
J.B. "Neither as being lords over God's heritage", @1 Peter 5:3. That would guard against clericalism.
J.T. "But being ensamples to the flock". It is by moral influence that the saints are ruled. That is the way Christ rules.
M. You would say that any one that was instrumental in bringing you under the subduing influence of Christ is a good leader.
J.T. I think so. It is said of David, of course, as figure of Christ, "So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands", @Psalm 78:72. That is the kind of leader you get in Scripture.
F.L. The Lord had compassion when He saw the multitudes, because they fainted and were scattered
{29}
abroad, as sheep having no shepherd; and it was as the shepherd He was cut off: "smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered", @Zechariah 13:7.
J.T. The connection between the earlier discipline of David, that we have alluded to, is most instructive; he was taken from the sheep. He comes out "From following the ewes great with young ... to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance", @Psalm 78:71. He was taken out of God's school to do that. I only alluded to the thought of leadership in Ahaz here because he occupies the divinely appointed place, although not equal to it.
F.L. He does not in any other way represent Christ, because he signally fails.
J.T. I think Hezekiah did.
F.L. In keeping the Passover he does not restrict himself to Judah and Benjamin, but sends to the whole twelve tribes. This would encourage the remnant that might be amongst the twelve tribes. He was a shepherd in the true sense.
J.T. Well now, what we get in the child of Isaiah (Shear-jashub) has a very distinct voice to us. That is, there was a witness alongside of the prophet as to what God would do for the people.
G.F.W. How is that?
J.T. The child represented the return of the remnant, and that would be the effect of God's work in them. That is the meaning of his name. There are three symbolic children in this section -- that is, in this chapter and the next. The first is Shear-jashub, and the second is Immanuel, and the third is Maher-shalal-hash-baz, and each signifies some special intervention of God.
F.L. I suppose the thought of a child is a new generation. Do you think there is the thought of
{30}
resurrection in view in connection with the remnant? I was thinking of the end of the previous chapter, the seed; the character of the remnant was expressed in that of a seed.
J.T. I think that it comes out in Hezekiah. In him you get death and resurrection set forth.
F.L. I thought that the light of resurrection is with the remnant.
J.T. The testimony was that they should take root downwards and bear fruit upwards. In the word sent to Sennacherib by Isaiah (@2 Kings 19:29 - 31) I think you get clearly indicated death and resurrection; that would be the end of the matter.
R.S.S. You mean taking root downwards and springing upwards.
J.T. Yes. All that took place in Christ, and it took place figuratively in Hezekiah. He had been down to death, he was actually appointed to death; it was not simply that he was sick and recovered, but his life was given back to him by God. It was not natural recovery, but life given back by God; so that the hopes of the remnant are made good in Hezekiah figuratively. He asked life of Jehovah and it was given him, but only fifteen years; but in the antitype you get: "He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever", @Psalm 21:4. But that is the end. You do not get that in chapter 7. What you get in chapter 7 is Immanuel.
F.L. It is significant that every head comes in here -- Ahaz as the head of the house of David, the head of Syria, the head of Ephraim, and then Immanuel.
J.T. I think that the thought of a remnant is not much understood amongst God's people, and one would only venture to take up a passage like this as
{31}
having reference to ourselves, written for our instruction, and I think that what is going on today is that God is securing His portion from amongst the mass of those who profess to be His people.
R.S.S. You say the thought of a remnant is not much understood.
J.T. No, it represents what God secures for *Himself*; that is, His portion is secured in spite of our failure.
R.S.S. But would you not say there is a remnant at the present day?
J.T. That is what I think God is doing -- securing a remnant.
R.S.S. And that remnant would include every true believer.
J.T. In principle it would. "*I have reserved to myself* seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal", @Romans 11:4. That indicates what a remnant is to God. They are those who refuse to recognise the god of this world.
W.H.F. You would say a remnant stands representatively for what the church is before God.
J.T. I think it is God's portion.
W.H.F. Would you apply it at this present time to the church -- the general thing, which of course includes all believers?
J.T. That is what was said, as I understand. Still you would not for a moment exclude from your mind the thought of a right state in the people -- "who have not bowed the knee to Baal". The thought of a remnant is expressed in the leper who returned to God (@Luke 17), and that involves that God has a place in the soul; while you would not exclude a single believer from your mind, yet you must be careful to allow for a *state* in God's people which answers to God.
W.H.F. So that you have not in your mind a distinct class in that way.
{32}
J.T. You would include all believers but at the same time you would be careful to recognise what is due to God, and that involves *state* in the saints. What I mean is this: the Lord speaks of Philadelphia and He says: "Thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name", @Revelation 3:8. These were three things that marked a company. And then He says: "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial", @Revelation 3:10. The Lord would not exclude a single believer on earth from His mind when He said that, and yet with all that there was something there that was noticeable. They had power and did not deny His name; so that you feel, whilst you include all, there is something for the conscience of God's people -- as to whether we are marked by the things mentioned.
W.J.N. Does the acceptance of this place you in separate company?
J.T. I think it does. It is what separates us. You feel that you cannot go on with anything that is inconsistent with God. That is what marks the remnant.
G.F.W. The ordinary idea of a remnant, I think, has been that it was a small class of God's people, and I take it you do not think that.
J.T. No; I think it includes all, in the principle of it. God's people belong to God; but what I think we should be careful about is, to preserve the state that answers to God; it is in that way the saints are brought under exercise.
F.L. It is well to bear in mind what you have just said in regard to Elijah; there were seven thousand, and God knew them, but Elijah did not; they were not morally in the good of what they were in the sight of God or Elijah would have known them. They would have been with him. The remnant, as I understand it, really includes all that belongs to God. "The Lord's portion is his people", @Deuteronomy 32:9. In Philadelphia
{33}
you get what answers to the normal state of the whole church. The remnant there was morally equal to what it is in the sight of God. I do not see that we get this anywhere else but in Philadelphia.
J.T. And it is a great thing to take God into account. The Lord knoweth them that are His. As you were saying, God told Elijah in Horeb about His people, and he evidently did not know about them. God sends him back to anoint certain ones: Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Samaria, and Elisha to be prophet in his stead. Elijah returns, and in the next chapter you get war with Syria. Syria attacks Samaria, and he makes such demands upon Ahab that Ahab cannot evade resisting him, and a prophet comes to Ahab and encourages him to resist the Syrians, @1 Kings 20. Ahab then asks who is going to lead, and the prophet says: *Thou;* the wickedest king that reigned in Israel, yet God sends the prophet to him and says, You are to be the leader. Ahab asks as to those who should fight, and he says: "The young men of the princes of the provinces", @1 Kings 20:14. God gave a complete victory over the Syrians. Now I think it is in this way you learn in the Old Testament what God is, and you are preserved from narrow thoughts about God's people. You can never tell whom God may use.
W.B. Is that illustrated in Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus?
J.T. It is remarkable that they were comparatively hidden and did not share His afflictions, but at the last they come forward and shine on the side of Christ.
F.L. Do not you think that one mark of the remnant, that is, those who are in the good of the remnant spirit, is that they appreciate all that the original stands for in the mind of God -- nothing smaller? For instance, as with Hezekiah when it was a question of keeping the passover; the whole twelve tribes must be brought into view. Do you not
{34}
think the remnant, understanding the mind of God, always appreciates the divine original?
J.T. I think it is very clear.
F.L. So with regard to the assembly, one would conceive that Philadelphia understood, as none other, what the church is in the sight of God.
J.T. So Philadelphia really refers to a state rather than a class of people.
M. The idea of a remnant, then, is that part which is exactly like the original.
J.T. Yes. As was said, they answer to what the original was and what it stood for. The fact is, that if there is love for Christ you will maintain everything that belongs to Christ, and that is how true testimony shines. It is the result of affection for Christ. So the Lord says: "Thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name", @Revelation 3:8. That is because they love Him. He said in @John 14:23: "If a man love me, he will keep my words".
L.T.F. What stands in contrast to the remnant?
J.T. The whole outward mass -- the many.
G.F.W. I have to confess I cannot quite see the application of the word *remnant* if it includes the whole thing.
F.L. If you look at the church historically in connection with Thyatira the whole mass has become corrupt, so that for the first time the Lord has to take account of what is distinctive in character from the whole mass, and so He addresses them: "Unto you I say, and unto the rest", @Revelation 2:24. And in Philadelphia that which is addressed comes out in a very clear and pure light in contrast to Thyatira and Sardis.
J.T. You cannot but see that the Lord thinks of the whole church. "I also will keep thee out of the
{35}
hour of trial", @Revelation 3:10. *Thee* must include the whole church.
G.F.W. What was the original that this is a part of?
F.L. I speak of the original as being that which was set up in divine power at Pentecost, that which shone forth in Ephesus in its undimmed day; I take the remnant historically in Israel as being in the light of the kingdom and the purpose of God in connection with the king.
G.F.W. Speaking of the remnant, then, you have respect to the day of Pentecost?
F.L. Where there are those answering to the remnant, they will value and appreciate the divine original.
J.T. The remnant becomes, in a way, the generic head of the succeeding dispensation. I think that the remnant stands out in contrast to the mass after general defection occurs either with Israel or the church, and they give character to the succeeding dispensation. If you take Noah as an example, I take it that Noah carried through from the first world all the elements of the second world. That is, he brought a remnant through; it was nothing more, but there was nothing left of God in the old world that was not carried through into the new. There were male and female of every kind of animal besides Noah and his wife and his sons and their wives. In principle he brought what was of God through, and thus there was everything there that was requisite for the establishment of another world. So that a remnant is no small conception. It is a very great conception. It contains in itself that which is necessary for the establishment of the succeeding dispensation.
F.L. That is very valuable, and it was really a little on that line I suggested some time ago the idea that the resurrection goes with it; and I think the
{36}
last verse of @Isaiah 6 would enforce it; the holy seed being the substance of the remnant.
J.T. I do not know of anything more interesting. Take Noah. It was there death and resurrection. Everything that was of God in the first world went into death, but was carried through safely and established in another world on the principle of resurrection. So here, as you will see later in Hezekiah, the remnant figuratively go down into death and are taken out of it. They were to "take root downward, and bear fruit upward", @2 Kings 19:30.
A.R.S. If I understand you aright now, the remnant includes every true believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, but there are certain characteristics that should mark that remnant, and that is, that it keeps His word and does not deny His name. Is that right? Every believer is included, but certain features are presented in order that our consciences may be exercised.
J.T. I think that is just it.
A.R.S. So that if a christian is not keeping His word the address to Philadelphia should exercise him.
J.T. I think the prophetic word is intended to exercise us. In this chapter we have: "If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established".
A.R.S. You made a remark about prophecy written in a book and then given to the churches. Is it not remarkable that this prophecy, The Revelation, is scarcely read by Christendom at all?
J.T. Most of them think it is a sealed book! It shows where people are. The Lord says to John: "What thou seest, write in a book", @Revelation 1:11. The whole book was sent to each assembly. The book contained the whole vision, and that was sent, we may say, to the whole of responsible Christendom. The
{37}
question is -- Are they reading it? and, secondly -- Are they affected by it?
J.P. One would expect the enemy to be particularly set against that which the Lord has specially given for the help of His people.
J.L.J. Would you say that we do not get the thought of a remnant apart from failure?
J.T. Yes; it becomes evident because of decline in the mass.
F.L. Another important point in connection with the remnant is, that, in a sense, it is necessary for the glory of God, because the testimony is always connected with it.
J.T. Yes. And then what comes out is so encouraging. Immanuel should appear and should be known in the midst of the people. Now to see the full working out of this you have to consider the historical part in the books of Kings and Chronicles. That is, the full power of the enemy would be seen in the Assyrian. This chapter begins with Ephraim and Syria allied against the house of David, but the full power of the enemy should be seen in the Assyrian, and he should come up to the neck. He should attack. It was all right so long as he carried out God's will, but when he interfered with God's rights in the land he is met with God's judgment. It was Immanuel's land. Then God takes up the conflict with the Assyrian, and the remnant in the next chapter say: "Immanuel" -- God is with us. Directly they discover that God is with them it is all over with the Assyrian. God sends a message to him: "The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee", @Isaiah 37:22. That is beautiful. They discover that God is with them. The Assyrian comes up to the neck. He overflows, but he does not for the moment know that it is Immanuel's land he is treading upon.
{38}
The enemy may be God's instrument in discipline, but when he interferes with the rights of Christ, it is all over with him, because Immanuel is there.
R.S.S. What is the difference between what is set forth in the Assyrian and the Syrian? Here the conflict is between Syria and Ephraim and Judah. The former wished to go up and dethrone the king of Judah and set their own king on his throne.
J.T. Syria and Ephraim represent a certain feature of the enemy's power which is of a religious character. It is directed against Christ and His rights to the throne. The Assyrian is not a religious power, but a political power, and it attacks the whole nation, so that the full bearing of the prophecy has reference to the future. The Assyrian is the northern power, and he attacks Israel -- the whole nation; whereas Ephraim was a part of the people. God was not with Ephraim; God had given him up, and he had become allied to the gentile; so that it is a wicked bond and it is opposed to Christ and His rights in the midst of the remnant. The remnant is in view. "The remnant shall return", @Isaiah 10:21. You can see the same working today -- a religious combination against the rights of Christ in the midst of those who seek to walk in the truth.
F.L. It is very clear, and if we look to the origin of things we shall see that. Syria was of the same kindred as the Jews. When it became a question of getting a bride for Isaac, the servant must go to Syria; and Ephraim was Judah's brother; yet they are allied to fight against Jerusalem where the testimony of God was. It is very helpful to see it is that which was kindred, and therefore religious opposition.
J.T. Quite so. The point is to put another king there besides the one that belonged to the house of David.
F.L. Of course, the Assyrian is the great power
{39}
that God will take in hand for judgment in the last days.
J.T. The king of Assyria said: "I come and take you away to a land like your own", @Isaiah 36:17, that is, he would captivate the people. Syria and Ephraim would put a corrupt king on the throne of David. That is the most dangerous thing. If you have an influence over the saints other than Christ, you will corrupt them.
R.S.S. The distinction between the Syrian and the Assyrian is confirmed very much by that expression, "A Syrian ready to perish was my father", @Deuteronomy 26:5, which shows the relationship existing between Israel and Syria.
J.T. There are people around us that are related to us. There is a certain relation between us and the religious order of things that prevails, but they are allied together against the rights of Christ in Jerusalem. Here the house of David trembled because of the combination.
J.P. It was that that moved the heart of the house of David. "It was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim".
J.T. Who among us would not be moved with fear, apart from knowing God, in the presence of the conditions around us; but God comes in and sends His messenger with Shearjashub; this was, that God would work in the remnant; and then He says: "For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings". That is, God would deal with these two men.
J.P. The kings there referred to the two mentioned in the earlier part of the chapter. Mr Darby's translation makes that more plain than our Authorised Version. The most serious judgment was pronounced upon Ephraim; God announced the time: "Within threescore and five years shall
{40}
Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people"; and it has never been a people from that day to this.
R.S.S. I thought the reference to the child ("Before the child shall know to refuse the evil", verse 16) referred to Immanuel. Now I think it is Shearjashub. It is the child immediately at hand.
F.L. And in the next chapter, with regard to Maher-shalal-hash-baz, you get the same expression. It has reference to the prophet's child.
R.S.S. It is clearly so there.
J.T. I think it is so here; the child immediately at hand.
J.B. Verse 15 would be Immanuel, would it not? We see the same thing as to the remnant later on: "For butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land".
J.T. I should like to get more clearly before us the peculiar danger that threatens God's people now -- a confederacy between Ephraim and Syria. In a sense it is a more dangerous thing than the Assyrian.
R.S.S. The Assyrian was more an open enemy.
J.T. There could be no difficulty about him. He is an open enemy, but Ephraim is not that. Ephraim is the elder brother.
J.P. There is no confederacy about Assyria. The word confederate is brought in here. Syria is confederate with Ephraim; that is the thing.
J.T. Ephraim represented the elder brother. He had a right to the firstborn and he was envious of Judah; that is, envy marked him, and where you get envy it will devise something; it may be hostility to a brother or brothers, but it results in an attempt to place another influence than Christ's over the saints: to put, as we get here, another influence on the throne besides that of the house of David.
F.L. Ephraim established new gods at Bethel and Daniel So that what we are dwelling upon here is more on the line of apostasy -- false gods, and so it is
{41}
distinctly religious; whereas Assyria has the power that God gave politically.
J.T. And Assyria is the rod of God's chastisement. With Ephraim you get the envy of one who is displaced, because God displaced Ephraim in favour of Judah. At the end the envy of Ephraim shall depart; but it has not departed here.
G.F.W. Ephraim was set over Manasseh.
J.T. Ephraim had this place of firstborn and had the birthright; Ephraim was the leading tribe. But God forsook Shiloh and the house of Joseph, and took up David and Judah. I only alluded to that because it is the cause of all the trouble amongst us -- the envy of Ephraim.
J.B. Why are these two called firebrands? Is it not significant?
J.T. That is what Samson used. Your thought would be that they would set things on fire.
W.H.F. Ephraim represents the side of responsibility, and on that line failure comes in; and then David comes in on the line of sovereignty.
J.T. The responsible man always rejects sovereignty.
F.L. "What portion have we in David? ... to your tents, O Israel", @1 Kings 12:16. It is important to see that the two great things that dominate are both satanic; that is, that which is represented in Ephraim and Syria takes its impulse from the *god* of this world; and its initiation was in the golden calves at Dan and Bethel when the ten tribes apostatised. Then the prince of this world is represented in the Assyrian.
W.C.R. Is confederacy taken up when there is a lack of faith?
J.T. You will often find that when a brother is displaced, and God takes up others and uses them, the spirit of Ephraim comes in; God is not with that spirit, so there is always a tendency to confederate
{42}
with others for support. But then, the house of David had Immanuel. This is a wonderful section of the word, because it brings Christ in.
W.H.F. The opposition is to what God brings out sovereignly.
J.T. That was the point of Satan's attack from the time God took up Judah and David. It was God's sovereignty. God chose Judah. "What portion have we in David?"
W.H.F. We have seen that in our own times clearly.
F.L. Will you say a word as to the culminating point of all this? I was thinking of the Revelation, where we get the religious power and the political power and the power of Satan all allied in one vast confederacy; we get the term here in Isaiah, "a confederacy", but that is the true confederacy in the Revelation, where everything is so dominated that men cannot buy nor sell without the mark of the beast; it is the culminating point, as I understand it, in the last desperate attempt to overthrow the power of Immanuel. Does not this line lead up to that?
J.T. Certainly it does. We shall see that more clearly in chapter 8 in connection with Maher-shalal-hash-baz. What I think we may see in this chapter more specifically is God's address to faith, and His intervention in Immanuel.
F.L. The Lord has the name Immanuel in Matthew. This passage is quoted in chapter 1.
J.T. There we have the fulfilment of it.
F.L. It gives character to that gospel.
J.T. The practical bearing of Immanuel is the presence of God in the midst of His people. This was in Christ as Man.
{43}
W.J.N. And that in the present day is the resource in view of what we have been speaking of.
C.A. So when you see these evil elements come in we have the realisation that Christ is with us.
J.T. At the close of this chapter certain things are spoken of which indicate some peculiar privileges of the remnant. God has not yet intervened for the land; the Assyrian is there as the rod of His chastisement. It says: "And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land" (verse 22). The land as a whole is abandoned; it is full of briers and thorns; and if a man is to invade it, he is to come with arrows and bows; that is, it is a place where enemies lurk. There are hiding-places for the enemy in the land. But then on the hills, where there is the mattock and where there is digging, "there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns¦: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle" (verse 25). It seems to me you have there indicated a condition of things like our own. The general state of things furnishes lurking-places for enemies, so that you have to be armed; but then there are the tops of the hills where there is exercise. The digging with the mattock refers to exercise. Things would be very obscure.
F.L. There is much food in the tillage of the poor.
R.S.S. What do the hills indicate?
J.T. I think they refer to the moral elevation to which the remnant attain through exercise so that they are morally free from the attacks of the enemy and there is food there; oxen go forth; not literal
¦There is a difference of judgment as to the rendering of verse 25, but leading scholars sustain the Authorised Version. It is supported also by a footnote in the Revised Version. The context, too, seems to justify the reading in the Authorised Version.
{44}
oxen, but those who serve God's people. "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn", @1 Timothy 5:18. It seems to me to indicate a general condition of things prior to the attack of the Assyrian which chapter 8 indicates.
G.A.H. Will you say a word on verse 21?
J.T. It refers to the Lord's provision for the remnant in those days; so that there is abundance of milk.
J.B. You were about to speak of the butter and honey.
J.T. It seems that in conditions such as this chapter indicates, God forms His people after Christ through this kind of food. I feel at the present time that what saints need is proper food, because it is through this they get discernment. What would *you* say?
J.P. Part of the original description of the land was that it flowed with milk and honey. You could not have butter and cheese without milk. Butter and honey are not produced in the wilderness; they are the proper product of the land; and what makes it so striking is that the butter and honey are available in the midst of a scene of general desolation.
J.B. Available to the remnant -- to the saints now.
J.T. So you see a most remarkable analogy to the present time. You feel you are not safe in any place in Christendom today. Primarily there were no briers nor thorns there, but now you have to go about with a bow and arrow.
F.L. I would like to read a verse or two that apply to the people as a whole before the remnant was in view: "So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him. He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
{45}
of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape", @Deuteronomy 32:12 - 14.
J.B. You get the lesser cattle too.
J.T. It is very encouraging that although there is not the abundance that there was at the beginning of the nation's history, there is all that is necessary for the support of the remnant.
J.L.J. In the book of Chronicles, where the ark was installed, there was plenty to offer and plenty to eat.
J.T. I believe exercise involves moral elevation.
M. Every one that is exercised is able to "nourish a young cow, and two sheep" (verse 21).
J.T. No doubt, in principle. And it is very encouraging to get into a sphere where there is no fear of briers or thorns.
J.N.H. No place for the enemy to lurk.
J.T. It is sorrowful if you come in amongst God's people and find the enemy lurking there.
F.L. Thorns and briers are the evidence of the curse.
R.S.S. "Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good" (verse 15); what would be the application of that to Immanuel?
J.T. There was no possibility of the Lord choosing the evil, but everything in Him was normal. He grew up before God as a Man; He increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and man. Everything in the Lord's history personally was normal.
J.B. The point is here that Christ is looked at on our side. "Unto *us* a child is born", @Isaiah 9:6.
F.L. I think that verse 15 really speaks of what was normal; it is not that the Lord was exposed to temptation, but discernment as to good and evil always marked Him as born of a woman. Taking up
{46}
manhood, He knew how to refuse the evil and choose the good. We see it in the temptation. But verse 16 gives a different thought. It refers to Shear-jashub.
J.T. Exactly. The Lord took man's place, and there was the refusal of evil by Him; it is viewed here on account of what He fed upon. You get in this book also: "The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary", @Isaiah 50:4. That could not apply to the Lord viewed as a divine Person.
G.F.W. Would it be on the line of that scripture, that He learned obedience by the things He suffered? @Hebrews 5:8.
F.L. It is very helpful to see that the Lord came along that line. When He met Satan it was by what He fed upon. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God", @Matthew 4:4. It is very helpful for us that He came that way.
R.S.S. And the connection between verse 22 and verse 15 is that the remnant partake of the same food as He did.
J.T. And they learn how to refuse the evil accordingly.
J.B. Take the Lord in Jerusalem at twelve years of age; He was hearing the doctors and asking them questions. That is something analogous to this.
J.T. He was normal in every stage of His humanity, whether in infancy, in childhood, or in manhood.
J.P. We lose a great deal if we do not take account of the Lord in this way.
F.L. He *learned* obedience by the things He suffered. He *learned* to obey (as another has said) because He had been accustomed to command.
Ques. Would you say it presents His perfect humanity?
{47}
J.T. Yes. He was perfect in infancy, @Psalm 22:9,10. Luke presents the genuineness of His humanity.
T. If you were asked to give a description of the remnant, would you say it is where every divine principle is maintained?
J.T. Just so. Everything that belongs to Christ is cherished there. Anna and Simeon represent the remnant that come down to us from the Old Testament. Simeon, the intelligent side of the remnant, and Anna, the enduring character of the remnant; she continued steadfastly in the house, she departed not from the temple and spoke of the Lord to all those that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
{48}
READING
@Isaiah 8
J.T. The name of the second child of the prophet is somewhat of a clue to the point of view here. Whilst immediately the child refers to the Assyrian, yet it is the Assyrian viewed as used of God for the overthrow of the enemies of the remnant; the Assyrian executing God's judgment upon Syria and Samaria, these two nations forming the combination which the house of David feared so much. So that Maher-shalal-hash-baz represents to us, in a certain sense, the Lord, as intervening for us against our enemies. We have to distinguish between the Assyrian, as executing God's judgment upon Syria and Samaria, and the Assyrian coming up into Immanuel's land. When he goes up into Immanuel's land, that is, when he attacks Jerusalem, then he is the enemy of God's people directly. These chapters, 7, 8 and 9, I think, represent to us certain aspects in which Christ was to be known by the remnant; therefore they become helpful to ourselves, because the means of deliverance for God's remnant in the last dispensation would correspond in the principle of it with the means of deliverance now. Here the remnant *need* deliverance. They are not seen here as *delivered;* their deliverance is in prospect, but you get the means by which they are delivered.
R.S.S. And Judah is looked at as the remnant.
J.T. I think so. At any rate, the remnant was there in Judah; and the quotations from these scriptures in the New Testament connect them directly with the birth of the Lord, and what resulted from that; that is, the gathering of the remnant together around His Person and their being separated from the nation at large; and then His committing to them the testimony of God.
{49}
R.S.S. That is, the Lord separated them.
J.T. Yes. God hid His face from the house of Jacob, and the Lord occupies Himself for the moment with His disciples; the children whom God had given Him, and that marked the introduction of christianity; so that you get an entirely new world in principle, formed out of those few disciples delivered and gathered around the person of the Messiah.
R.S.S. So it is fitting that this should be quoted in @Hebrews 2.
J.T. Yes.
W.B. Peter quotes from this chapter, @1 Peter 2:8: "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence".
J.T. The chapter gives, you might say, almost in detail, the Lord's position in the midst of the Jewish remnant in Israel, and how He delivered them, and how subsequently they became the nucleus of another order of things.
R.S.S. Corresponding with the beginning of @John 10.
J.T. Yes. Whilst He was everything to them, He was "a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel".
C.A. In that way the remnant of the former dispensation was carried over into the present one.
J.T. And every divine thought was deposited there: "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him".
C.A. So in that sense the vessel becomes the vessel of testimony.
J.T. Yes. The present situation, so far as the dealings of God on earth are concerned, is that both houses are abandoned, but the testimony of God is deposited amongst the disciples of Christ, and instead of having the whole nation of Israel He has *children*.
J.P. And the expectation of God coming in finally
{50}
for the deliverance of Israel is maintained amongst the disciples. "I will look for him". You get that in @Hebrews 9:28: "unto them that look for him".
R.S.S. I do not know that I have caught your thought altogether.
J.P. I added to what was said, that not only is the binding up of the testimony and the sealing of the law amongst the disciples, but the expectation of what is stated here is maintained in the assembly -- "I will look for him". This is, while He hides His face from the house of Jacob and every connection between Israel and God is broken off, everything connected with Israel is maintained in the assembly, even the expectation of the Lord's coming, because I do not think it is the rapture in Hebrews, it is just what this chapter warrants. It is a most interesting chapter, especially in view of its connections and the extensive quotations from it in the New Testament.
J.L.J. How would you say the testimony is bound up?
J.T. The binding and scaling refer to the fact that the fulfilment of the promises was deferred. The testimony was carefully deposited among the disciples.
J.L.J. Would you say it was because they were attracted to Himself as rejected?
J.T. I think the disciples loved Him. The Lord will not commit anything to those who do not love Him.
F.L. Do you not think that we cannot very well understand the great importance of that little handful -- the Lord's company -- unless we appreciate the spirit of the remnant? What one sees in closing days, in the end of the years of the Lord's ministry, is that He is getting a small nucleus, preparing them and forming them, and then in the spirit of the last
{51}
chapters of John, He deposits the testimony there, so when He is gone, it is *there;* otherwise, I think, one can scarcely understand, in reading the gospels, why such a handful of men should be so important.
J.T. If the Lord is to communicate anything to persons, He tests them first of all. They have proved by previous tests that they are qualified to be the custodians of it. You see this in Noah; the Spirit of God enlarges on Noah's character. He was a righteous man; "thee have I seen righteous", @Genesis 7:1. The whole world had been alienated from God by wicked works, but, there was one man on whom God could rest and that man was righteous, and God committed to that man all that He treasured on earth; every thought of God as to the earth was committed to Noah. He was the custodian of it all, and you find subsequently that he proved equal to the occasion. He carried everything through the flood; not one thing was lost; all was carried through in safety and established in another world. Then of Abraham He says: "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do ... For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him", @Genesis 18:17,19. He was proved faithful. God could commit His testimony to Abraham, because of what he was personally. I believe in these instances God indicates the kind of men to whom He commits things; so with the disciples, they had been proved by the Lord's dealings with them to be righteous, and to have affection for Himself.
R.S.S. It was especially so with Peter, as we see at the close of John's gospel.
J.T. After he had been fully proved -- "Lovest thou me?" @John 21:15,16.
R.S.S. That confirms what you were saying, that the Lord does not commit anything except to those who love Him.
J.T. So I think you get in that way what the
{52}
assembly was. It was marked by affection for Christ. @Acts 1 shows the Lord with the disciples on the mount of Olives, where He was received from them into heaven; and they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, evincing that the hope of their affections had gone into heaven. You can understand how the Lord could have the fullest confidence in committing everything out of heaven into their hands.
J.P. And that same principle obtains at the present time, does it not?
J.T. I believe it does: that those who receive light from the Lord are those that love Him.
J.B. Is not that what you get here in this chapter in regard to the remnant?
J.T. I think so. That is why I felt encouraged to propose it, because there is an analogy between the remnant and our own times.
W.B. How do you connect that with @Revelation 3? You get a remnant there which refers to the present time.
J.T. You get a remnant in Thyatira, and there can be no doubt that the principles that are developed here have application to them. That is, it is an immense thing to the Lord on His throne, high and lifted up, and His train filling the temple, when you think of the place that Jezebel has and all the corruption in that which has the responsibility of being the temple here upon earth. Then, secondly, to find Immanuel; that is, the presence of God in the midst of the saints, in spite of all that corruption; and then the victory set forth in Maher-shalal-hash-baz. As we were seeing yesterday, the confederacy between Syria and Samaria was to put another influence on the throne instead of Christ; to put another king there, and Maher-shalal-hash-baz signifies God's intervention to prevent that, so that you get the confederacy overthrown. But now another
{53}
question is raised, as to whether those whom God has thus helped appreciate what is of Him; and what comes to light is that they despised the waters of Shiloah that go softly. This comes home to us *closely*.
T.A. What do the waters set forth?
J.T. It was God's provision at that moment. It refers to the pool of Siloam. It was a provision that God had made for the people at Jerusalem, and the question was as to whether they appreciated it. Things may be very small, but they test us as to whether we appreciate them as being of God.
F.L. It is connected with the house of David.
J.T. The prophet says, "Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son", @Isaiah 8:6. That is, there was a treacherous state of things; they were despising what was of God, and in sympathy with the enemy without.
F.L. I will tell you the remedy; that is, to crown Him with the crown wherewith His mother crowned Him in the day of His espousals. This would be recognising Him in the throne of David. Is not that the point that the remnant comes to in the Song of Songs?
J.L.J. That is appreciation of Christ.
J.T. And now that the people are marked as despising the waters of Shiloah, the Assyrian comes up against Judah and Jerusalem; "Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: and he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel", @Isaiah 8:7,8. God is now permitting the Assyrian to come up against them because of their state.
{54}
J.P. If they refuse the waters of Shiloah, they get the waters of judgment, a perfect flood, to the neck.
J.T. That is very searching. He comes up to where David's throne was and where the temple was.
A.R.S. You said the waters of Shiloah were what God had provided for His people; so that when these are refused, the truth that God has given is being refused.
J.T. I think so. It may be very insignificant, but it is of God, and God's provision.
A.A.T. Is the acceptance of the water that which constitutes them a part of the remnant?
J.T. The true remnant would be marked by that. Take the Lord in the midst of Israel. He was God's provision for the remnant. He was a great deal more, we know, but He was for the remnant and the remnant were brought into evidence by Him. Everything in Israel was tested by the presence of Christ, but the true remnant came to light.
A.A.T. I understood yesterday afternoon that all believers formed part of the remnant, and yet there may not be the state of soul in each that corresponds to what we have before us now.
J.T. We sought to distinguish between the state that marks the remnant and those that God takes account of as forming it in His mind. You could not exclude any true believer from God's remnant. It is what God has reserved for Himself. Every believer is sealed by God, but there is something for the conscience in the way the remnant is presented. That is what is to exercise us, and I believe as we read on in the scripture before us we get the marks of the remnant; that is, when the Assyrian comes out in all his power and the people suffer from the "razor", then a certain class of people begin to speak; they say, "God is with us", @Isaiah 8:10. It is not the prophet now; a certain voice is heard, and it says: "God is with us".
{55}
J.L.J. Those are the ones that accept the waters of Shiloah.
J.T. I think if you take it historically, it refers to those that become attached to Christ. They came to a just conclusion that God had visited His people.
W.J.N. As to the remnant of Isaiah's time, I should like a word as to what marked them.
J.T. I think they would appreciate the testimony of Isaiah, as an example.
W.J.N. Would it be right to say that what marks the remnant at any time is that they appreciate what God is giving for the moment?
J.T. That is the point. There is a provision of God for His people, and those who are of God appreciate it.
M. The remnant were drinking the waters of Shiloah, and the same characterises those who are feeding on Christ.
J.T. You appreciate what is of God at any time, however small it may appear.
F.L. There is another mark about them; they appreciate divine order. A great test came in in the division -- the separation of the ten tribes from the two, and you find the true spirit of the remnant in that which follows divine order. It is there that God has more liberty to express Himself, and those that stood by the throne and the house of David are those that really come to light as having the spirit of the remnant. It is very important in a day of disorder to keep clearly before us that God goes along with that which pays respect to divine order.
A.B. Would @1 Corinthians 14:37, be on that line? "If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord".
J.T. Very good. I believe that that which is of God is owned by those who are of God. John says, "he that knoweth God heareth us", @1 John 4:6.
{56}
J.B. Would you say the remnant really took character from David and what David brought in?
J.T. They are marked, it might be said, by appreciation of what God has revealed. They let nothing slip of what God has communicated; and I believe, therefore, that the opening of the gospel of Luke sets before us the remnant that God has reserved for Himself. What marks them is that they were engaged with the things that were of God on earth at that time. Simeon and Anna were both connected with the temple, and then they were prepared for fresh light; anything additional that God is pleased to give is welcome to them.
C.A. I suppose in that light, applying it to ourselves, is it not necessary to be walking with God so that when God speaks at any time we hear His voice?
J.T. Certainly. You are not afraid of light. If a brother has anything more than you have, it is so much added joy to you. It is not his alone, it is yours as well.
J.L.J. What do you mean when you say they are prepared for fresh light?
J.T. It marks the remnant. Simeon was in the temple; he had light.
J.L.J. I was thinking of 'fresh light'.
J.T. He got fresh light. He got wonderful light and he delighted in it; so did Anna.
W.J.N. In one sense he got that which he had been looking for.
J.P. It is, "he that hath, to him shall be given", @Mark 4:25.
W.B. Is not the light connected with Judah: "Judah is my lawgiver", @Psalm 60:7. They had the mind of God. They were nearest to God, and that is so now with those who take a place outside of things here for Christ; the true Shiloah; there the light and refreshment of God are found.
{57}
J.P. I think what you said as characterising the remnant is very important. We see it in our own day. The Lord gives fresh light, and the moment that comes in there is a line of demarcation. On one side you have appreciation, on the other side you have depreciation.
J.T. Yes. It is the envy of Ephraim. Fresh light always tests our state. The true believer always welcomes the light. It cannot detract from him. It cannot detract from any one of us.
A.A.T. Fresh light will stir up the Philistine.
J.T. But it belongs to all the saints.
W.B. How is it that some seem to get the light in these days and then to go back? They go so far and then fall off.
J.T. That is the constant danger, and you feel the weight of an epistle like that to the Hebrews, because the giving up of light is apostasy in the principle of it. Every departure from divine truth and light is apostasy in principle -- "falling away".
A.B.S. Do you not think the reason they go back is, they have ceased to hold this light in connection with God?
J.T. And things in the world become attractive.
W.B. Are there not some true believers who have light but who are so mixed up with things here, that they seem to be prevented from coming out distinctly?
W.C.R. It says in @Hebrews 4:2: "For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it", @Hebrews 4:2. Would that be our difficulty?
J.T. I think so. And "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God", @Hebrews 3:12.
R.S.S. In regard to the division between the tribes, I refer to the Levites and the priests in the ten tribes, it was pretty difficult for them, because
{58}
many of them were true to God, and what were they to do? The remnant was evidently connected with Jerusalem. And so it is recorded that they left their suburbs and their possessions and resorted to Rehoboam -- that is, David's son. It involved great sacrifice. That is involved in the position of the remnant. I suppose it might apply to many of us who found ourselves with light and yet in surroundings, ecclesiastically, that were not according to God. A good deal of giving up was involved for many who are present, but a scripture like @2 Chronicles 11 would greatly encourage us.
J.T. I believe the ten tribes at bottom were always marked by envy from the moment David was taken up. While the Lord acted in judgment on the house of David in rending the ten tribes away, yet when they are carried away captive, God brings it up that they had severed themselves from the house of David. There was envy there, and that always works out in an attack on Christ. We see this in the calves that Jeroboam set up; it was not that Jeroboam was specially an idolater; I do not think he was. What actuated him was self-occupation. He wanted to establish himself. He knew perfectly well that the house of God being at Jerusalem would have the effect alluded to. They would necessarily go to the temple. They would gravitate in that direction; therefore he set up the calves in Dan, simply as a rival system to Jerusalem. That gives a true idea of the conditions that prevail today. Envy and the desire to retain power are at the bottom of it.
J.P. Jeroboam attempted to hold the people together by the calves -- to form a circle for himself.
R.S.S. Why were they calves that he set up? You would have thought the children of Israel had had a lesson about that in the wilderness.
J.T. I have no doubt it is an allusion to that. Note the same expression, practically, on both
{59}
occasions: "Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt", @Exodus 32:4, and @1 Kings 12:28.
F.L. Is not the idea of the calves imitation? A great thought in connection with the temple was sacrifice, and the calves of gold set up by Jeroboam may have been a sort of imitation of that which is of God. But another system was set up.
J.T. The sin of Jeroboam was never judged by the ten tribes. Even Jehu did not judge it, though he was the instrument of God in executing judgment on the house of Ahab. As an analogy, the clerical principle in Christendom has never been judged, even by Protestants. Jeroboam established the sin and it was never judged.
E.S.T. What is the principle you speak of?
J.T. The envy of Ephraim was at the bottom of Jeroboam's sin, and it worked out in rivalry to Christ; the clerical principle is rivalry to Christ.
W.J.N. And what made it so solemn was that the calves were set up at Bethel, where God's house had been.
S.T. That rivalry continued in Samaria down to the Lord's day.
J.T. Quite so; they said that Jerusalem was not the place, but mount Gerizim was the place where men should worship.
J.L.J. Jehu did many things pleasing to the Lord.
J.T. A wonderful vessel so far as he went, although not a spiritual man as we speak of it. He acted most ably in executing judgment on the house of Ahab, even connecting with himself a man who represented the remnant of God's people; he said to him, "Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?" @2 Kings 10:15. And Jehonadab answered, "It is". And he takes his hand and took him up into his chariot. He found a man who was with him, and he associated him with himself in the execution
{60}
of God's judgment on Ahab; and yet with all that he did not depart from the sin of Jeroboam who taught Israel to sin. The clerical principle is the most baneful thing that has been introduced into Christendom.
J.P. And nothing short of a positive work of God in the believer can deliver him from it.
J.T. I think Luther was, in a sense, like Jehu, anointed by God, as it were, to bring judgment on the house of Ahab and Jezebel; and yet the sin of Jeroboam was never judged, and it continues to this day.
J.P. Was it not judged in that young man in Ireland, who, after he got delivered, wrote the pamphlet, 'The Notion of a Clergyman, Dispensationally the sin against the Holy Ghost'? What characterises Christendom at large is the thing we have to be delivered from, and if people come together to break bread and are not delivered from it they will have a hard time of it, because the envy of Ephraim will be found there. You may get a meeting where they break bread every first day of the week and yet there may be the envy of Ephraim.
W.C.R. Ephraim seemed to be jealous of Gideon when he slew the Midianites, and they chode with him sharply.
W.J.N. I was going to remark as to what you say as to clericalism: your reference is to the *principle*. You are not speaking of individuals as such.
J.T. But there the thing is. Jeroboam taught Israel to sin, and the sin was never judged even by the best of Israel's kings. It did not refer to Judah, but to the ten tribes. I refer to clericalism as an analogy in Christendom.
G.F.W. There was a point in the history of the church where the principle of clericalism was established, and it has never been judged by Christendom as a whole since that time.
{61}
J.T. "The works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate", @Revelation 2:6. This may refer to it; at any rate, the fact remains that clericalism exists in Christendom, and it is rivalry to Christ.
J.P. I think it is immensely important to recognise this, because the principle of it may be found even where there is not a clergyman.
R.M.L. Why do you say clericalism is rivalry to Christ?
J.T. Because it involves another Head. Take any *flock*, as they call it, in Christendom under the charge of a clergyman; he is occupying the place that belongs to Christ in that assembly.
R.S.S. He speaks of them as *my flock*.
W.C.R. He usurps the authority of Christ.
J.T. It is anti-christian. Antichrist is that in its fulness. He takes the place that belongs only to Christ.
J.P. And it finds its full bloom in the case where a man openly declares himself to be the vicar of Jesus Christ on the earth.
W.B. It might be seen in any leader amongst so-called brethren who gathers a few around himself, and when a testing time comes they all go with him.
W.H.F. I think we have suffered more from that principle amongst ourselves than anything, else. Look back at the last forty years at the principle of clericalism.
A.McN. Would you say that anything that interferes with the work of the Spirit is clericalism?
J.T. Not quite. There are some things that interfere with the work of the Spirit that could not be called clericalism; for instance, a partisan feeling and the like. What would you say?
J.P. I would say that most certainly.
G.F.W. Would not any desire to be something amongst the saints be clericalism?
J.T. Such ambition would result in it no doubt.
{62}
A.A.T. There are other hindrances that we should be on our guard against besides the clergy.
J.T. I think radicalism is a dangerous thing. That would be the opposite of it, but it would be of the flesh just as much.
A.A.T. It becomes the remnant to keep the house in order. Clericalism and radicalism would be some of the tests.
J.T. The principles in the house of God work by love. If love is in activity it precludes all that is contrary to God.
J.P. Hence the remark made by Mr. Raven in a late reading, that the only thing in us that God would trust is the divine nature; that is love.
J.T. Now returning to @Isaiah 8, the Assyrian was allowed to come up to the neck, but he went beyond his prerogative. He was God's instrument of judgment, to a certain extent, but he went beyond that. He stretched out his wings over Immanuel's land, and from that point you get deliverance and a people in the midst of the land who are conscious of divine support.
J.P. The moment he goes over the line God comes in.
R.S.S. What would the neck represent?
J.T. That he had covered the whole land, coming up even to Jerusalem. As a matter of fact we know that Sennacherib did that; so in order to see the thing fully we have to consider the historical part that shows the invasion of Sennacherib and how God acted for the remnant, but the discipline was there first. The Assyrian really came up as a judgment of God, but he went beyond his limits. He interfered with God's rights.
G.F.W. What did he do historically that amounted to that?
J.T. He blasphemed the living God, @2 Kings 19; and then you get the remnant taking it to heart;
{63}
when discipline comes upon the saints those who are near to God take it to heart. Hezekiah says to Isaiah, "lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left"; @Isaiah 37:4; and when the letter comes from Sennacherib he spreads it out before the Lord, and then you get deliverance.
J.P. That is a great place to spread your letters out.
J.T. The incident is touching. The issue now is between God and Sennacherib. Sennacherib ceases to be an instrument of discipline. He has touched Immanuel's land. He has touched what belongs to Christ.
W.B. He touches Him then in His own land.
J.T. Yes. The remnant then say: "Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces, ... Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us", @Isaiah 8:9,10.
J.P. That is the answer: "O Immanuel". "God is with us".
J.T. As soon as anything of Christ is touched, all the power of God is against what is opposing. It was the end of the Assyrian: "God is with us". He is more than a match for all the power of the enemy.
J.B. Is Assyria heard of any more? Does it not then become Babylon?
J.T. In the last days it appears again.
J.P. Babylon goes and Assyria comes into blessing.
S.T. Is what you were saying as to God defending the remnant a similar thought to what we get in Saul of Tarsus? -- "Why persecutest thou me?", @Acts 22:7.
{64}
J.T. Yes.
F.L. The prophet Zechariah gives us God's judgment in regard to that: "I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. Therefore thus saith the Lord; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts", @Zechariah 1:15,16. And then again he says: "For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye", @Zechariah 2:8.
A.R.S. I was going to say that what the remnant say here is like @Romans 8:31: "If God be for us, who against us?"
J.T. And what is so interesting is they are up to the light that God had given to them. I refer to chapter 7: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel", @Isaiah 7:14. That is the light. Now *they* say Immanuel -- "God is with us". They are equal to the light they have received.
G.F.W. The prophetic voice says: "*Thy* land, O Immanuel" (verse 8). The indignity offered to God is recognised.
J.T. It is very beautiful in the historical part to see how the servants of Hezekiah and Hezekiah himself feel the reproach offered to God by the Assyrian and his emissaries; and then they turn to God. Rab-shakeh says: "I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them", @Isaiah 36:8; and it was true; but Hezekiah turns to God; and when the saints turn to God, woe be to their enemies!
A.A.T. Who raised this cry in verse 12 about the confederacy?
J.T. It is prophetic, but it expresses the exercises of the remnant. They see the rights of God are being
{65}
touched, and they know that God is for them, so He says: "The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee", @Isaiah 37:22. It seems to me a beautiful touch; God acts through the people. The people thus would be the opposing element to Sennacherib.
J.P. He does not act outside the remnant, does He? The destruction of the enemy's power and the deliverance of God's people are brought about in that way in connection with the remnant, but in connection with their great exercises.
G.F.W. Is not that the way deliverance is effected today?
J.T. I think so. God acts through His people.
G.F.W. What I meant was that the enemy is defeated in regard to any one when the claims of Christ are set up in his soul. When any soul is set at liberty in the appreciation of Christ the enemy is defeated.
J.T. And the same thing may be seen more clearly in a company; where the claims of the Lord are fully asserted you may depend on their deliverance.
C.A. So the confidence that God is with us gives us great boldness as a company, because we know we cannot be overthrown.
W.J.N. Why is it that historically the Assyrian was destroyed before Babylon, but in prophecy the last enemy is Assyria?
J.T. I think the Assyrian represents the world-power viewed politically. When the Lord was here I suppose the Romans had the place of the Assyrian.
R.S.S. Has verse 19 of @Isaiah 8 a reference to what the remnant are liable to in the way of departing from God?
J.T. It is a kind of warning to them; but the verses immediately preceding are most interesting as showing how the Lord cared for them in the presence of all these things. He was Immanuel in their midst, and He cared for them. Judaism was given
{66}
up, and they were the children whom God had given Him.
R.S.S. And He shall be to them for a sanctuary.
C.A. Would you say a little as to verse 18: "for signs and for wonders in Israel?"
J.T. That is what the disciples become, I think. The Acts shows how that worked out. They were God's sign in the midst of the nation.
F.L. We must remember, too, all this will be of great importance and value to the remnant that succeeds the church of God. They will take all this up and have the light and the good and the comfort and the encouragement of it. It will have a very great place in the day to come. They will look back and read of the Lord here upon earth amongst His disciples, and the way the testimony was deposited and carried through and has come to them.
J.T. I think so. The prophets will be a great stay to them in that day.
F.L. And they will read them in the light of the Lord's own interpretation in connection with His disciples.
J.P. The healing of the lame man at the beautiful gate is a sign.
J.T. They were to be for signs and wonders in Israel.
J.P. That was both a sign and a wonder.
W.J.N. In the first seven chapters of the Acts they are seen in the remnant character.
J.T. On God's behalf in His long-suffering patience to Israel.
J.L.J. Is that the way Hebrews views them?
J.T. Hebrews is in view of departure, and what characterises Hebrews is that God had opened up a new system, of which the centre was in heaven and not on earth.
F.L. Hebrews goes further than the first seven chapters of Acts.
{67}
J.T. It shows that the Hebrews were introduced into a heavenly system rather than into an earthly one. Hebrews supposes the abandonment of the Jewish system.
W.J.N. And it is interesting that in Peter's preaching heaven is spoken of only in connection with Christ being there.
J.T. It was a provisional state of things that God had introduced in heaven; He would wait on Israel. God would send Jesus Christ to them.
W.J.N. He speaks more of what is here for man: the Spirit and salvation.
C.A. Looking at things in that way it gives the remnant a wonderful place.
J.T. They were for signs and for wonders in Israel. God was bearing patiently with the people still.
W.H.F. What is significant in Stephen's testimony is seeing Jesus at the right hand of God, *standing*, that He might be offered to the people again.
J.T. I think He was in the attitude of waiting.
W.H.F. The putting to death of Stephen closed up the whole thing.
J.T. And then the centre of operations is transferred to heaven. Jerusalem had been for the moment the centre, but after the death of Stephen the centre of operations is transferred to heaven.
C.A. It would seem that the full truth of the church was held back until the testimony to Israel, rendered in such patience, was rejected.
J.T. God graciously waited upon them; but then after the death of Stephen the Lord is seen by Saul on his way to Damascus.
F.L. Up to the time that Stephen sees Him *standing*, Peter expresses it: "Repent therefore and be converted, for the blotting out of your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and he may send Jesus Christ, who was
{68}
foreordained for you", @Acts 3:19,20. He was in the attitude of readiness to come.
J.T. And I think that, taking the Acts in that way, you see how Syria and Samaria are typically overthrown in a moral way. The territory of Rezin and of the son of Remaliah come under the influence of Christ. Immanuel's -- that is, the Lord's -- influence is so extended that He overthrows the great champion of the enemy in Syrian territory. It is as if the Lord had universal sway now; Saul went into the synagogue of Damascus and preached the Son of God. This corresponds with @Matthew 16; the true foundation of the church.
F.L. Philip goes to Samaria, which is really in the land, and preaches Christ. He preaches the anointed Head. Paul goes to Syria, which is outside of the land, and preaches the Son of God, who is the foundation of the church.
J.T. That means that the foundation is of a universal character. The Son of God is in heaven.
C.A. The wonderful triumph of Christ!
J.P. "That I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", @Galatians 1:16.
J.T. That was after He was revealed to him as Son.
C.A. What has come out in connection with the Acts has given development to what has been before us in connection with the remnant.
J.T. You see the great moral overthrow in the territory held by these enemies of God's people. The Lord is in heaven and He has supreme control of the universe.
R.S.S. What do you mean by saying the foundation -- the Son of God -- is universal?
J.T. Because the Son must have universal influence. God "was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", @Galatians 1:16. It was as if Paul, apprehending
{69}
the greatness of the Person, must announce Him universally.
J.P. Hence the opening of Romans: "God's glad tidings concerning his Son", @Romans 1:1,3.
R.S.S. My difficulty is 'the foundation'.
J.T. The foundation of the church is in the gospel. It is a question of what is presented in the gospel. That is where the foundation lies. It is Christ made known in the gospel in the souls of men.
F.L. I suppose the specific foundation is in @Matthew 16; the Son of God; and then the preaching of Paul takes up that point in Damascus; and then you get the mystery -- the church.
J.L.J. Would you say there is a difference in the preaching to the Jews before @Acts 8 and that which follows?
J.T. Certainly. The first seven chapters set forth God's long-suffering to the people; these signs and wonders in the testimony of the apostles; but all that was rejected in the death of Stephen.
W.J.N. Paul preaches much in common with Peter and the eleven; for instance, repentance and forgiveness and the gift of the Spirit.
F.L. But the line of the preaching in the first seven chapters of Acts was in view of the Lord returning to Israel. In chapter 8 Philip goes to Samaria and preaches *Christ;* and then Paul preaches *the Son of God*, who is the foundation of the church.
S.T. You were saying that preaching the Son of God is universal. Is that like @Hebrews 3 -- Christ as Son over God's house? Is not the house of a universal character?
J.T. Quite so.
J.B. The last word of Stephen is, "Jesus standing at the right hand of God", @Acts 7:55.
J.T. That is the last word to Israel. They gnashed on him with their teeth. They were putting him to death when he said that.
{70}
READING
@Isaiah 9 - 12
W.B. Would you say that all that has gone before is leading up to chapter 12?
J.T. This gives us one section of the prophecy; it ends one section, showing that which the remnant is introduced into in the last days; they are in the enjoyment now of what God is to them in Zion. I think that by an examination of the different lights in which the Lord is presented in the previous chapters you can see a double way in which He is known to the remnant; first, as Immanuel, He comes in to meet their condition as needing deliverance; then you get Him in chapter 11 in connection with God's purpose, "there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse"; and then in verse 10, "there shall be a root of Jesse". The Spirit refers to the promises in regard to the King, and then subsequent to that the full deliverance of the remnant, which in a way answers to God's dealings with them at any time. We have to know God in our midst for deliverance.
W.H.F. It will have a present and future bearing.
J.T. Yes. Then we have to know Christ in connection with divine purpose. What do you say?
J.P. That is very important. I think these chapters bring out both sides.
W.H.F. Do you not think the point we need to know more of today is Christ on the side of divine purpose?
J.T. I think so.
W.H.F. On that side you get everything stable.
J.T. In chapter 11 He is seen in connection with Jesse.
W.C.R. And is there any significance as to chapter 9, "Prince of Peace"?
J.T. That is the light in which the saints have
{71}
come to know Him; "unto *us* a child is born, unto *us* a son is given".
F.L. It is connected with purpose there, is it not? It brings in His government, and peace, and His being established in His kingdom for ever.
J.T. It is connected with purpose clearly, only it is the Person simply that is before them. They have come to know this Person and to appropriate Him. He is born to *them*. But in chapter 11 He is viewed in connection with His generation. He is the rod out of the stem of Jesse, and the root of Jesse; showing the human and divine aspects of His Person.
Ques. Would you say that is before God as He stood as a Man: God's purpose in Him as a Man?
J.T. It is a question of the light in which the remnant come to know Him, and the same holds good with regard to ourselves. In chapter 7 He is announced as the virgin's Son, who shall be called Immanuel; that is the way God had intervened on their behalf for deliverance. In chapter 8 they recognise Him in that light; He is Immanuel. In chapter 9 they go further, and they take Him to themselves. He is theirs: "unto *us* a child is born". It is not a question there *of whom* He is born; it is not a question of generation, but the Person they have come to know, and then they go on speaking of what should be set forth in Him.
W.B. What is the difference between the rod and the root, verses 1 and 10?
J.T. *Rod* is the Lord as having sprung from that stock; but then the *root* refers to His deity. Jesse sprang from Him.
F.L. You get that distinction in the Revelation. In chapter 5 it is, "the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David" (@Revelation 5:5) but in chapter 22 He is presented as the "morning star" (@Revelation 22:16); when presented to hope and affection it is "the root and the offspring of David" (@Revelation 22:16); the two are combined there.
{72}
J.T. In regard to the way in which our souls are brought to know the Lord, chapter 9 is very important. They take account of the Lord as born to them, and then you have what He is; "the government shall be upon his shoulder".
T.A. It says in verse 1 of chapter 12, "in that day". What day does the prophet allude to?
J.T. That refers to the future. It is a question there of a prophetic word, looking to the day of Israel's full blessing. But I was endeavouring to point out that in chapter 9 the remnant come to know the Lord personally, "the government shall be upon his shoulder". I think they say that as a result of their acquaintance with Him. That is, to make a practical application, He has become the governor of *your* soul. In every way in which the Lord shall be known publicly He is known to the believer's soul. Here it is not only a prophetic word, but also what He is to them as a Son given to them, a Child born to them.
J.L.J. How are we brought to know Him in the light of divine purpose?
J.T. We come to it gradually.
J.L.J. Were the children of Israel brought to know Him in that light when they crossed Jordan, or at the Red Sea?
J.T. Here He is known first of all as Immanuel, that is deliverance; but when you come to the expressions, *child* and *son*, you have affection in people. You have an expression of relationship; do you not think so?
J.P. The glory of all relationship is affection.
W.C.R. You say, "the government shall be upon his shoulder" means that He had sway over the soul of the believer?
J.T. I think so. But then it is the sway of One known in relationship.
J.P. "Unto *us* a child is born".
{73}
W.C.R. Why does it say, "upon his shoulder"?
J.T. The shoulder being the place of strength, He should there sustain the government. We should know this by *experience*.
J.P. And there is no real anticipation of what He will be publicly except as that is really known individually in the soul.
J.T. That is it. You can bear testimony to the world to come only in the measure in which the features of it are entered into experimentally now.
F.L. The whole realm of power and glory is built up in connection with those who know Christ experimentally. "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me", @John 12:32. It is not compulsion; it is not a law that enforces, but it is attractive power. All that will mark the world to come is worked out in those who are attracted.
J.T. It is beautiful to see here that they speak from the standpoint of affection. They use terms that intimate that. A *child* and a *son*.
F.L. "Everlasting Father", "Counsellor", "Prince of Peace".
J.T. It goes on to that. "His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor". It seems to me that each title given to the Lord here indicates a certain light in which the believer has come to know Him, and I would especially desire that we should get all that is in that verse, viewed from the side of experience.
F.L. Is not the whole idea of the kingdom of God essentially, that which is brought to pass through the power of Christ and the love of Christ in the soul's affections? It works that way; that what is effected for Christ in connection with the kingdom is what has been established in the soul's affections.
{74}
J.T. If you take Simeon in the temple as an example, he had the Child in his arms. He appropriated the Child, as it were. And he appreciated Him. "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given".
F.L. "Mary hath chosen that good part", @Luke 10:42. "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee", @John 21:17, is on that line.
J.T. It is. Then they say, "the government shall be upon his shoulder". When your heart is drawn to the Person, and you appropriate Him, you gladly accord to Him the place of government. You can never appreciate the thoughts of the Lord's governorship except as you own Him in your soul.
J.P. It is affection that leads to the truth of the throne and appreciation of His greatness.
F.L. You crown Him in the day of His espousals.
J.T. It is one thing to be subdued by the Lord; it is another thing entirely when you come to view Him as a Child born, as a Son given. Affection is now present, and you gladly accord Him the place of government. This is the light in which the remnant come to know Christ, leading up to chapter 12.
J.B. Is not this the way the disciples actually did know Him, and that which was afterwards confirmed to them by the Holy Spirit. I mean the way in which He manifested Himself to them in the various gospels?
J.T. I think the greatness of His Person gradually dawned upon them.
J.B. But there was no such thing as doctrine, they got to know Christ in this way by what they found in Him for themselves.
J.T. They came to see that a Child was born and a Son given, and then they recognised His personal glory and all that hung upon that.
J.B. Do we not learn Him in the same way?
J.T. That is the point I would like to make clear.
{75}
The believer who loves the Lord readily accords to Him the place of government. You give Him all the place. You recognise the Lord in everything. He is your Governor.
W.H.F. Speaking of knowing the Lord, would you take it as the result of coming into touch with the Person?
J.T. Yes. And you appropriate Him. "Unto us"; not simply born for, or to God, but to us.
J.P. Appropriation is a step in advance of faith.
J.T. It is beautiful to see Simeon with the Child in his arms; a figure of the remnant appropriating the Child.
F.L. We have a number of cases which show how the disciples were formed on earth. When the Lord was going to death in Judea, Thomas says, "Let us also go, that we may die with him", @John 11:16. It showed the reality of their love. They were ready to die with Him.
W.B. Has this anything to do with the promise to the woman in the garden -- the Seed of the woman? There seemed to be some here looking for this Child to be born. Mary was a favoured woman to be the mother of the Child.
J.T. Only you have to confine it within the circle in which it is found. It is a question of the apprehension of the remnant of Israel. It is not a question of who the mother of the Child was. Mary is alluded to in chapter 7; it is said, "a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son" (@Isaiah 7:14); but here the remnant take Him to themselves. It is after He has become known to the remnant that they appropriate Him as theirs, and then seeing Him in that light they see every thought of God centred in Him; the government and everything that they might cherish is secured in that Person.
W.B. Do you think the disciples with Him in His ministry here discerned that in Him?
{76}
J.T. I think so in measure. Their apprehension was meagre, but the prophetic spirit gives them credit for it.
F.L. The Lord gives them credit. "Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations", @Luke 22:28; notwithstanding that they forsook Him. You were speaking this morning of the envy of Ephraim. In chapter 11:12,13 we read; "And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim". No doubt they become *one* over the Child, and they are formed accordingly.
J.T. But you see in chapter 9 that, after acknowledging Him as given to them, the first thing they say is, "the government shall be upon his shoulder"; and then, "His name shall be called Wonderful". The Lord becomes increasingly great in your eyes. I believe it is as you accord Him His place as Governor you discover greater glories in His Person. He is "Wonderful".
J.P. He would hardly make this known to a soul that did not accord Him His place as Governor; but if you do you will get present compensation in the apprehension of greater glories.
A.A.T. In christianity does "Lord" correspond with "Governor"?
J.T. Yes; and you see the wonderful things He does for you; the difficulties that He solves for you; the wonders that He accomplishes for you. But then, as I said, what He does for each individual He will do publicly in a more extended way.
J.B. Does not verse 7 elucidate governorship?
J.T. It does in regard to a more extended sphere. "Of the increase of his government and peace there
{77}
shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever". That is the coming day of glory for Israel -- the throne of David; but notice, the point of view is what the saints see in His Person. It is not simply a question of God announcing these things.
L.T.F. What is "the everlasting Father"?
J.T. One who cares for you. I think it is a great thing to know the Lord as caring for you. That is very largely the idea of *father* in Scripture.
A.A.T. I suppose it is appreciation of these things that marks them off as the remnant.
J.T. No doubt. You get government, and then that He is Wonderful, and then Counsellor, and He takes the place of Father for us.
W.C.R. The mighty God.
J.B. There were some that said, "We will not have this man to reign over us" (@Luke 19:14) in contrast to those mentioned here.
R.S.S. I suppose Thomas's confession, "My Lord and my God" (@John 20:28) is connected with the mighty God here.
F.L. I suppose the Lord in resurrection amongst His disciples conveys the idea of Prince of Peace. He opens a sphere of peace and puts them upon it in resurrection.
J.T. The mighty God can accomplish anything.
F.L. That is what He does. He comes amongst them and says, "Peace be unto you", @John 20:19.
J.N.H. I suppose the reason that you dwell so much on the first part of this sixth verse is because we are very deficient there. It would be a great thing to have our souls exercised as to how far we are in the good of it.
J.T. When you see that it is the outcome of what the remnant has come to know of the Lord experimentally, it gives it a new character.
{78}
A.A.T. Would the man in @John 9 correspond to those referred to here?
J.T. I think so. You get the idea there. The remnant pass from one point to another, moving on in their apprehension of the Lord till ultimately they reach the sphere of purpose as in chapter 12. Chapter 11 presents Him to us in connection with Jesse, so you are led to God's purpose in the line of David.
L.T.F. "Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" were all wrapped up in the Child. That is the idea, is it not?
J.T. Yes.
J.L.J. After we learn Him as Wonderful, then we take counsel from Him.
J.T. I think we do. It brings in the headship of Christ, because counsel is all in the Head.
A.A.T. You are dwelling upon how great it was for the remnant to see these things in this Person. There must have been some movement in their souls previously, and their eyes opened to Him. I suppose this has taken place with all of us. Is not that a step before appreciating Christ?
J.T. I think that you get in Mary in @Luke 10 the idea of one who valued the Lord as viewed here. She had some sense of what He was. She sat at His feet.
A.A.T. Is it in the measure in which we learn Him now that we shall enjoy Him hereafter?
J.T. I suppose so, but you see His fitness for the place He occupies in God's counsels from your experience of Him now.
J.P. That is very important. I think that prophecy and the prophetic scriptures have been taken up as a kind of study, and there has been nothing more than an exercise of the intellect, and men have acquired a certain ability to express what
{79}
will take place in the future; but I think that the Lord is speaking very distinctly to us at this time, and that is, on the side of the subjective state of our souls, and I think it is of great importance, because I suppose that what we see in these chapters is the progress of the remnant. If it is to be taken up in its application to us, it indicates a spiritual progress in our souls, and I think what has been pressed is very important, "unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given". Unless you can say that, I do not think it will do you much good to recite the rest of the verse; but if there is the appreciation of Him in your own soul it clothes all the future with a wonderful reality.
W.J.N. Is it challenging our affections? Is that the point?
J.P. Of course it is.
J.B. Yesterday we were speaking of the shepherds and the announcement made to the shepherds; "unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord", @Luke 2:11.
J.T. You see the announcement of the glad tidings to the shepherds; then they go and see for themselves. They act upon the light communicated to them through the angel. They go to Bethlehem. They say, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see" (@Luke 2:15) and they went and they saw and then they began to speak in the whole country about Christ. That is, they verified for themselves that the Child was actually born to them.
J.B. They were affected by the testimony.
J.T. They proved it. So in Matthew with the wise men from the east. They heard and they came and sought Him and they found Him.
J.P. It is the man with the Babe in his arms that can tell what that Babe is for Israel and the gentiles; but you must have Him in your arms to do that with any effect.
{80}
C.A. So I was thinking in order to be in the good of this -- "unto us a child is born", there must be that state of soul which was found in the remnant.
J.T. What I see is, that you "*go*". There is movement. If you preach the gospel because another has told you about it, you will not have any power. The shepherds heard the gospel and they said, "Let us now go". Now it seems to me that is what we have to do. They went to Bethlehem and they found the Child and His mother, and then they preached. Then when you come to Simeon you get a further movement, that is, he goes by the Spirit into the *temple* (he does not go to Bethlehem) and he finds Jesus in the temple, and then you get a most wonderful unfolding of what should be set forth in that Person. But in each case you have to *move* if you want to come into contact with the Lord.
C.A. Will you kindly explain the movement?
J.T. I think when light comes to a person it involves that he is to move, and if he moves he moves in the direction of Christ, because the gospel makes clear where the Lord is to be found. The angel intimated that He was born in Bethlehem, in the city of David; the place was intimated; the gospel always indicates where the Lord is to be found. Simeon was led by the Spirit into the temple and he found the Lord there.
W.J.N. Light has come in to produce movement.
J.T. And the movement will lead you to the source of the light.
T.A. Where will you find Him?
J.T. That is a very proper question.
S.T. It seems the shepherds and wise men were both directed of God.
J.T. Yes; the latter by the stars, and the shepherds
{81}
were guided by the angel's word as to where he was; in, David's city.
J.P. The light indicates where He is and desire moves the soul to find Him.
G.F.W. Anna was already there in the temple.
J.P. I was thinking about our brother's question about movement. I think you will find in Scripture that spiritual movement is always in desire. An old writer said that desire was to the soul like the sails to a sailing ship; you may have a well-rigged ship and there is a favourable breeze, but if the sails are not spread, there will be no movement; it is the desire that moves the soul. I remember in a certain place where I was, not long ago, a young sister followed me out into the street and said, 'I can truly say I desire that which you have been setting forth'. 'Well then', I said, 'you will allow me to congratulate you; you are moving'.
J.T. The psalmist said, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I *seek after*", @Psalm 27:4.
J.P. You will generally go after the thing you desire.
F.L. What about the answer to that question?
J.T. I was thinking of that. You will have to consider as to where the gospel presents the Lord now. He is not in Bethlehem, nor in the temple in Jerusalem. I would say the gospel presents Christ at the right hand of God as an Object for *faith*. I was going to add that it is a great thing to have the heart set in connection with the centre, and I believe the Spirit of God in the gospel presents to us Christ in heaven as an Object; but on the other hand, as to where affection finds Him, I believe He is found where Simeon found Him, and that is in the temple.
J.L.J. You mean found in a centre down here.
C.A. That is very important: the difference between faith and affection.
J.T. I think we ought to make it very clear that
{82}
the divine centre is in heaven -- that is, as we have had it this morning, transferred from earth to heaven. Our citizenship is in heaven -- "Jerusalem above", @Galatians 4:26. This refers to the divine centre on high. Whilst you find the Lord in the temple on earth, you maintain the connection with heaven. Would you say that?
R.S.S. I would.
G.F.W. What about the statement of the gospel presenting Him as available for every one?
J.T. That is for faith. Evidently He is not here personally. He is presented for faith.
C.A. Faith views Him at the right hand of God, but affection seeks Him amongst the saints.
J.T. Certainly.
W.C.R. The apostle spoke to those at Colosse, "Since we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints", @Colossians 1:4.
J.T. The two things go together. Faith connects you with heaven. Faith has no reference to anything on earth, but affection has reference to what you find here in the sphere of the Holy Spirit.
W.H.F. Would you say that faith lays hold of Christ where He is, seated at the right hand of God, in the place of supreme exaltation; and the other line is you reach Him in the assembly by the power of the Spirit?
J.T. I think that presents it, but you never disconnect what is available on earth, as privilege, from heaven; because today it is a heavenly system you are connected with.
F.L. The only statement of the gospel that the Lord gives us from heaven is helpful on this line. I would like to read @Acts 26:15 - 18. The point of it as I understand it is, Christ Himself is the object: "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest" (@Acts 26:15), "faith that is in me" (@Acts 26:18), and then, "inheritance among them which are sanctified" (@Acts 26:18), which latter is the other side; and it
{83}
is the Lord's own statement from the glory as to the elements that Paul should preach.
J.T. Therefore you would say that the inheritance is found amongst the sanctified ones.
W.J.N. Is there not a heavenly side to the inheritance as in @1 Peter 1:4: "an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you"?
J.T. The inheritance is reserved in heaven. Heaven is specially prominent in epistles written to christians from among the Jews.
G.L.S. The question was, Where will you find Him? John's disciples said, "Where dwellest thou?", @John 2:38.
J.T. Quite so. He said, "Come and see", @John 2:39. He did not tell them, because the road, as it were, that they were *on* leads to that. Follow the road you are *on*; there is no name to His home. Where the divine home is is not formally indicated. It is to be found out.
J.L.J. Because it has reference to a sphere.
J.P. And it is moral. The point is, "Come and see". You will find it.
R.S.S. @John 1:18: "The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father".
J.T. Quite so. It is a moral sphere, but the point is, "Come and see".
J.B. It is not a certain place.
J.T. You could not define the place; the wise men had to follow the star.
J.H.C. They sought and they found.
J.T. Yes.
W.J.N. Do the two things go together, that is, light from God brought into the soul by the word, and then affection for Christ?
J.T. I think so, normally.
W.J.N. I was thinking about the multitude in @John 2; it says they believed when they saw the
{84}
works of power; works of power do not necessarily bring the soul into contact with God.
J.T. It has to be moral. The Lord did not attach value to them. What the Lord did attach value to was a man who came to Him by night. That man was in need of something. These things are all outside of the natural intelligence. You can only discern them by the result produced, as the Lord says, "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth", @John 3:8. It is outside of our knowledge, but you see the effect of it.
J.P. I was thinking of Butler's Analogy and Paley's Evidences; they are two notable books, but I do not suppose they ever brought a soul to Christ. They are products of cultured minds. I was thinking of it in connection with our brother's remark. What is of God is outside of everything that is of man as such. The mind of man has asserted itself in the history of christianity and it has been given a great place; a great many people recognise it, but it does not bring people to Christ. It does not set them in divine motion.
F.L. I suppose it was a very small percentage of those benefited by Christ who followed Him and were counted as the fruit of His ministry; the benefit of christianity to the civilised world has been gigantic, but as to its moral effect it is very small.
J.T. You may see the saints here and in other meetings, and you may say -- That is the house of God, but after all you do not see it all. "God's dispensation which is *in faith*" (@1 Timothy 1:4); that is, His dispensation has reference to His house. It is a system of things which has a moral feature to it, and that is altogether outside of man.
E. I suppose the question asked by Thomas called forth the true answer from the Lord. "I am
{85}
the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me", @John 14:6.
J.N.H. What is the thought about *night* being connected with Nicodemus? He is represented as one who came by night.
J.T. There can be no doubt that he did not wish to be seen coming, but he came to Jesus. He had light, for he recognised that the Lord was a teacher come *from God*.
F.L. The night may be an allusion to the moral darkness that existed. The light shone in the darkness.
G.A.H. Why would you say that there is not more movement? It may be the object is not properly presented in the testimony. John's testimony, to Christ -- "Behold the Lamb of God!" (@John 2:26) directed souls to Him.
J.B. Would you say that lack of affection would be another hindrance?
J.T. There are many things that one might speak of that hinder. Nicodemus did not come out fully as a disciple until the Lord died.
S.T. It may be we are not as much in the state for the Spirit to direct us as Simeon was.
J.T. It becomes a question for each conscience as to what is hindering, as to why there is not more movement.
A.A.T. Mr. Stoney used to pray that the hindrances might be made manifest to him.
W.H.F. Coming to Christ in connection with the soul's need is one side, but there is another side -- affection and the desire to be with Him.
J.T. There are those two sides in the history of the believer's soul; that is, you come to Christ for relief, and then you come to Him as the living Stone.
W.H.F. I was thinking of that. Peter on the water has often been referred to in connection with coming to Christ on the line of affection. He wanted
{86}
to be *with Him*. It was not a question of getting anything, but he wanted to be in His company.
J.T. When you come to @Isaiah 11, verses 1 to 9, the Lord is presented, not according to what He was to them, but as related to the line of David, and what He would effect as such. Then in verse 10 it says: "And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious". Now I think that in this chapter the Lord is viewed, not now as born to the people, but in connection with divine purpose, seen in the line of David.
J.H.C. Looking forward to His reign, I suppose.
J.T. Yes. The first part of the chapter refers to what will come in more directly in connection with Israel, but the second part shows His universal position.
J.P. Verse 12 says, "the outcasts of Israel" and "the dispersed of Judah" besides the nations.
Ques. Is there a spiritual application of this to us now?
J.T. I think so. I think you get the Lord as an ensign, as a gathering centre lifted up, and envy departs under His influence; as it goes on to say in verses 12 - 14. You see there the tribes brought together in unity under the influence of Christ, and I believe the same thing holds good now.
G.F.W. That is, unity is brought in under the influence of Christ.
J.T. Yes.
W.C.R. Was it similar to David reigning in Israel? All were brought into unity through his reign.
J.T. And you will notice, as we have had it already, the envy of Ephraim departs; but amongst God's people there is not only the envy of Ephraim, but in Judah that which vexes Ephraim; that has to be seen to. We have dwelt upon the envy of Ephraim, but you may get, with those God has taken
{87}
up in His sovereignty, a want of thoughtfulness and consideration for Ephraim. Judah does not vex Ephraim any more. They had been accustomed to do so.
J.N.H. The thoughtfulness of love.
J.T. I think so. What is presented is the wonderful effect of the influence of Christ over them.
J.P. There is nothing one-sided.
S.T. I suppose we find that in the counsel that Rehoboam got. Ephraim was vexed by Judah.
J.T. A very good point. Had he considered the advice of the older men the situation might have been saved.
F.L. I think we often see that.
G.F.W. To get it brought down to where some of us can get hold of it, would that principle come out when a christian who had, or thought he had, a good deal of light was inconsiderate of others?
J.T. Sometimes the older ones are displaced, and there is want of regard and consideration for them.
F.L. There is that which is corporate here too. Perhaps we may be set for the right thing, but the way in which things are handled and brought out may be wrong, and it sorely distresses the honest spirit and conscience of others. You are set for the right thing, but the way in which you do it does not commend itself, and the conscience of others is alienated. Any one who has been with us for years can look back and recall times when the right thing was done but the spirit in which it was done was not right.
J.T. God may be with a person, or a company of persons, in the main, and yet they may not be devoid of vexing their brethren unnecessarily.
F.L. It was only recently a matter came up where
{88}
one had to say to the saints, 'Is the thing that has been done right?' 'Yes'. 'Well, try and not mind the spirit in which it has been done'. Still Ephraim had been vexed.
R.S.S. When does this take place?
J.T. It is the future. It is the recovery of the whole of the tribes of Israel under Christ.
R.S.S. Would this be the introduction of the kingdom and the millennium?
J.T. I understand it so. And then you see in the closing verses of chapter 11, "And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt". I think you have an allusion there to death; that God overthrows it for them, so that they come up to Zion.
F.L. Now there is a highway. The thought is extremely beautiful as bringing out the effect of the death of Christ.
J.T. It is a wonderful thing to see the divine highway. There is no, room on that highway for the flesh. The divine highway is opened up through death and resurrection.
J.L.J. @Joshua 3 corresponds; the ark stands in the midst of Jordan and all pass over.
W.C.R. Would not the first part of this chapter have a very practical application now, where you get the subduing of all these different elements which are natural, so that they dwell together in peace?
J.T. Yes. You get the wolf and the lamb dwelling together. A wonderful thing to have two such animals brought together!
G.F.W. The lion eating straw like the ox.
{89}
J.T. The nature of the beast is changed. In the assembly of God, under the influence of the Lord, nature is reversed; the wolf is not what he was -- things become altered.
F.L. I would like to add to what you were saying about there being no way for the flesh, a verse from @Isaiah 35: "And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there: and the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away", @Isaiah 35:8 - 10.
J.T. It is a magnificent passage. It is the highway to Zion.
R.S.S. It is very remarkable that all that will be established here on earth.
J.T. Yes. It is earthly blessing that is in view. It is God's great triumph for the remnant, and they are brought into it. This chapter is not limited to Judah, it is the whole twelve tribes; a way opened for them through death and resurrection into Canaan.
R.S.S. Are others not brought in?
J.P. Yes; the nations. "An ensign for the nations"; that group of nations which in the prophetic scriptures is always connected with Israel.
J.T. It is, however, the remnant that is immediately before the Spirit here; "there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people".
J.P. So chapter 12 is really the celebration of the remnant.
R.S.S. Does that close the section?
J.T. Yes. So now they say, "in that day ... I will praise thee". You feel how God has got His
{90}
full portion in His people. "O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me".
W.J.N. Would you say that in chapter 11 you get the remnant in principle apprehending Christ in the light of God's purpose, and then you get unity, and then praise?
J.T. What I think chapter 11 sets before us is the Person of Christ as the Offspring and Root of Jesse, and the effect of His great influence over Israel and universally. Every trace of the serpent disappears.
W.J.N. In principle, good today.
J.T. In the assembly; and then you see how the remnant is specially brought in on the ground of death and resurrection, so that they go to Zion.
J.P. And they are in the good of @Exodus 15; "God is my salvation".
S.T. I was thinking you have indicated that these wonderful things which will come to pass are no greater than Jew and gentile brought together in one body.
J.T. Not so great. What we have now is connected with heaven. We have all they will have, but we have something they will not have.
J.H.C. "They shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him", @Zechariah 12:10. Is that brought in before this?
J.T. That will be the same time, but it presents a different side of the truth. Here it is God's intervention for the remnant and what He does for them; He opens up a highway into the land, and as in the land, in life, they praise.
F.L. Zechariah presents more the repentant side in them.
J.T. Yes. The Lord's persecution in the midst of Israel is not in view in this section of Isaiah.
{91}
F.L. Here it is a question of God coming in for the remnant.
R.S.S. Verse 11 says, "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people". What is the reference to the second time?
J.T. It is an allusion to the first taking them out of Egypt.
J.P. It is like the last clause of the last verse of chapter 11.
A.R.S. Would this highway in verse 16 correspond to the opened door in @Revelation 3:8?
J.T. An opened door is an opportunity, an opportunity that love embraces. The Lord has set before us an *opened* door and no one can shut it. It is a wonderful thing that a handful of people are enabled to go on and bear testimony. The highway here is out of captivity and death into life.
A.R.S. What would correspond to that today?
J.T. I think what is announced in the gospel through the death and resurrection of Christ. God has opened up an highway for man out of death and bondage into life. Chapter 12 contemplates a sphere of life in which God gets His praise.
G.F.W. "A path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen", @Job 28:7. Would that correspond?
J.T. There it is; a path known *only* to faith.
G.F.W. That would be the way today. It is the resurrection path.
T.A. What is the distinction between chapter 12 here, and the song that the children of Israel sang when they crossed the Red Sea?
J.T. There is one difference in verse 1: "though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me". This does not appear in @Exodus 15. This song contemplates a more intimate knowledge of God than @Exodus 15. Here the people
{92}
are in the land and in Zion. But they are in the good of what @Exodus 15 presents, "God is my salvation".
J.P. You were speaking of its being a sphere of life. I suppose that praise is the proof of that, as a beautiful line in one of the hymns expresses it, *Praise issuing forth in life alone*; here you have praise issuing forth in life.
J.T. And in Hezekiah: "The living, the living, he shall praise thee", @Isaiah 38:19.
C.A. Praise only issues from the living.
J.T. And then you have activity in verse 3: "Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation". It is not an irksome thing. It is not that which they did in the days of their bondage; "with *joy* shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation".
J.B. Has this any reference to the waters of Shiloah?
J.T. This is the divine fulness. The waters of Shiloah were God's provision, but they were not wells of salvation. Here you have *wells*. A well is an inexhaustible supply.
F.L. That is what the man of resurrection brings in -- Isaac. He digged the wells.
T.A. They could not sing verse 6 on the bank of the Red Sea.
J.T. "Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee". They are dwelling in Zion here. There in @Exodus 15 it was, "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established", @Exodus 15:17. That was anticipation; here it is actuality.
C.A. In verse 5 you get, "this is known *in all the earth*". What about that?
J.T. God's great works are known universally.
{93}
G.A.H. But the company convened in worship goes beyond this, does it not; the christian company?
J.T. Yes, it is connected with heaven.
J.L.J. Because you get the value of His ascension there.
J.T. I should like to come across a company up to this. I should regard that as a place in which to stay. Salvation is in great fulness, where it could be characterised and spoken of as wells of salvation. It is not here simply that there is no fear of briers and thorns; it is that the thing is in such fulness that it is spoken of by the Spirit in this way.
J.P. There is "neither adversary nor evil occurrent" (@1 Kings 5:4) here; they do not need bows and arrows.
C.A. Would not this be in connection with the rivers of living water?
J.T. Living water conveys a different thought. "Wells of salvation" refer to deliverance from the enemy's power, and it is in such fulness in Zion, that it is presented in this inexhaustible way. But the water of life has life-giving power. That is Ezekiel's point of view.
S.T. I was thinking of what was engaging the Jews at the time the Lord spoke in @John 7. Was it not a special occasion at that time?
J.T. It was the feast of tabernacles; the greatest day in Israel. It was the great day of the feast. But I do not think it is there a question of salvation, but of life. "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water", @John 7:38, showing the greatness of the believer; that the believer in Christ in his own person should be greater than the feast of tabernacles. This was a great testimony to Christ.
S.T. I was thinking of it more in contrast, as you have brought it out.
J.T. It is not only that Christ is greater, but that even the believer in Him is greater than man's greatest day.
{94}
W.J.N. Is not the last day the eighth day?
J.T. It was the *great* day of the feast.
R.S.S. But here it is not a question of life. We have been considering the remnant in their difficulties, and the way God comes in for their deliverance, and therefore it is wells of *salvation*.
C.A. Would you say Simeon was drawing water out of the wells of salvation when he took the Child in his arms?
J.T. He had salvation in his arms, but he was going to die. It was all in the future in his case; but it was there in the Person of Christ, although not effective then.
F.L. It strikes me as the exuberant joy of those who were brought into the security and the peace and the blessing of God; not that their enemies were simply driven back, but they do not exist; it is the culmination, it is the point to which they have been brought, so it is expressed in language which implies there is no end to it; it is overflowing and there is nothing whatever to dim it.
J.B. In full accord with their song.
J.T. There is testimony as to what God has done; "make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth".
J.N.H. Is it true that salvation is always connected with the earth?
J.T. I think so. It has reference to the overthrow of the enemy's power.
J.P. It seems as if the last two verses are almost like an exhortation: "Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth". What the Lord has done, the excellent things, that Jehovah has done, call for a song; then the fact of His being in the midst of Israel calls for crying out and shouting: "Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of
{95}
Israel in the midst of thee". I suppose that, in principle, you might say verse 5 is what is called a believers¬ meeting, and verse 6 the assembly. Mr. Stoney used to call a meeting where they only praised the Lord for what He had done, a believers¬ meeting; but it is on account of One who is in the midst when you come to the last verse.
J.T. That is a very helpful distinction. It is all right to praise the Lord for what He has done.
J.P. But it is a greater thing to cry out and shout because of His being in the midst: "Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee".
{96}
GO UP HIGHER
@Luke 14:7 - 11; @Revelation 4:1
The passage in @Luke 14 was especially pressed on my mind in connection with the need for keeping lowly in this world, and that the testimony of God is connected with those that are lowly. You will find in the Scriptures that those who are thus lowly, and so qualified to be the custodians of God's testimony, receive elevation. Now it is just with the thought that we might close with that, that I venture to say a word.
I believe it is a thought that is carried through Scripture from the beginning; that God in the sovereignty of His ways reserves a *special* place of blessing. You will find it in the garden of Eden. Eden was a wonderful place, but the garden was eastward in Eden, specially prepared of God as the abode of man. Then you will find in the ark, @Genesis 6, an allusion to relative elevation. The ark was prepared according to divine appointment, and so was to be made with lower, second and third storeys; that is, God was indicating that in the order of things which should obtain before Him there should be degrees of elevation. And so in the tabernacle; there was the holiest of all, the holy place and the court. There you have, whatever way you view it, degrees of moral elevation, for in one sense the holiest of all refers to heaven. You get the same order in the temple, and in addition to that you have three tiers of chambers; the third more elevated than the second, and the second more elevated than the first. So in that way, I think, God indicates to us in the Scriptures that in the order of things that is to obtain before Him there are to be degrees of elevation.
{97}
Now what I wish should remain with us in a special way is that in God's sovereign ways we come in for that which is highest. We cannot say why it is so. The parable in @Luke 14 contemplates, in a sense, the whole universe. God is supreme in it. It is His house. There are high rooms and low rooms. What I would like to convey is, that God produces in this present dispensation an order of people that are morally qualified for the highest place; that is to say, they come into the house in the most lowly character. How do they come into the house? They come in by invitation. We have all come in by invitation. If you will observe one who has really received the invitation from God, so as to come to Him through Christ, he comes in in a lowly character. Christ was the lowliest of all who ever trod the earth, and the message takes character from the vessel. A man that has been really affected by the gospel has a distinctive character as he comes in; he is lowly; he takes the lowest room. That is a sure mark of one who has rightly received the gospel.
The gospel is God's means of inviting; the house is large; it has many rooms, and the man who has rightly received it proves his reception of the gospel by the way he behaves himself directly he enters the house. So the moral of the parable is: "whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted". Now I think that in the house today the great effort is self-exaltation. Naturally everybody is set for that. If we cannot attain it in the world, very often it happens that the church becomes the field for our ambition. It is so in the history of the church. There is no doubt about it. The fact is this, that the conditions at the present time in Christendom afford a wide field for human ambition; from the See of Rome down to the smallest parish a wide field is
{98}
offered for the ambition of man. Men often choose the church as a sphere of activity, and they come in with all their talents, with all their education, and what is the end? Self-exaltation.
Well now, God is the owner of the house. It is a very wide sphere, but God rules it and one day He will, as it were, inspect the house. The guests will be taken account of. These will include everybody in Christendom, for professedly all have responded to the invitation. But the upper rooms are all filled and the lower are nearly all empty. Now when the Owner comes in, things will be reversed. The few who occupy the lower rooms shall hear the words of Christ, "Go up higher". That is what awaits those who, in humility, take the low place now. That is what awaits the remnant of God. The remnant are really brought into existence by the gospel. It is the gospel come to man through Christ that brings about a people here upon earth who are morally of heaven. A man who is morally of heaven, who bears the heavenly character, takes the lowest room on earth; and the lowest room on earth means the highest in heaven.
Now John in Patmos was in a very low room. He was there "for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus", @Revelation 1:9. He represents the remnant. What produced John? Acquaintance with Christ. John was the product of acquaintance with Christ, and that is what the remnant is. John knew what it was to be near to Christ. He leaned on Jesus¬ bosom. He lived near to Jesus, so near as to become like Him; he became heavenly, and if Jesus was away, every interest of His was precious to John. He was in exile for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. But he was *visited* there! He had a visitation. The Lord is the Owner of the house, and He was moving about in the house; He came to John, who, as I said, occupied, as it were, a low room. In that
{99}
room he received the Lord. He was in the Spirit on the Lord's day and he heard a voice behind him as the voice of a trumpet. He had a visitation from the Lord.
*We* may expect a visitation also. We can only get it in the lower room. Chapter 4 is the upper room; the Lord is up there, but in chapter 1 He is down below: He visits John in prison. If there is anything that I should like to make clear, it is the sovereignty of Christ. He acts according to His pleasure. You cannot govern Him. He is sovereign, and if He visits John it is according to His sovereign pleasure: He comes to him. Then He indicates to John what was going to happen: "What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia", @Revelation 1:11. But He had also a word for *John's heart*. He says, "Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore", @Revelation 1:17. The Lord thus encourages His servant, and confirms him in his position. As suffering for the testimony we get divine visitations and fresh accessions of light.
When you come to chapter 4 John's release has come. The Lord had been walking in the midst of the assemblies. Do you not think He took notice of the people in the upper rooms? Do you not think He took notice of the church dignitaries, of their pomp and their pride? He walked in the midst of the golden candlesticks. He was inspecting, and He knocks at the door of the last church. It does not say whether anybody lets Him in. He knocked, and if any man would hear His voice and open, He would come in to him. The man who would open would, no doubt, be in the low room. The Lord would come in and sup with one who opened to Him, and he should sup with Him. This refers to the Lord's attitude at the present time.
{100}
When you come to chapter 4 He has gone on high; the trumpet voice heard on earth in chapter 1 is heard in heaven in chapter 4, and what does it mean? John says, "I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven". The Lord is opening the door of the *upper storey*, so to speak. He has reserved the upper storey. Noah's ark had a third storey, as I was pointing out, and the temple suggests the same thought. God in the sovereignty of His ways has reserved the upper storey for the saints of the present dispensation. They are a heavenly family; they are of heaven, and the Lord has reserved a place in the upper storey for those who are heavenly; but, as I said at the beginning, the heavenly are marked by lowliness on earth. They partake of the character of the heavenly Man on earth. "Behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet". It was the voice that had sounded on earth. It is the same voice, it is the voice of Christ saying "Come up hither". It is really, in the principle of it, what we get in @Luke 14: "Friend, go up higher".
May the Lord greatly help us! We have had before us as to the conflict for the testimony. It *is* a conflict, but the armour involves lowliness here. The conflict is not carried on by those in the high places of the earth, but by men such as John who are in the isle of Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus; but the moment is coming when we shall see the door opened in heaven. The moment is near. It is not far off. John had to wait, and we may have to wait a little longer, but in the meantime, as faithful to Christ and His testimony, we shall get heavenly visitations; and we shall soon see the door opened in heaven and hear the voice like a trumpet talking with us, saying "Come up hither".
{101}
THE ASSEMBLY: ITS HEAVENLY CHARACTER
@John 12:20 - 34; @John 20:14 - 20
J.T. What I have chiefly before me is the heavenly character of the church as the vessel of testimony; the testimony in her hands takes a peculiar character; it is now in the hands of a heavenly company, and is maintained here after a heavenly fashion. Also, that as maintaining the testimony in the absence of Christ, there is suitable elevation resulting from it; that is, the book of Revelation shows that the church has a heavenly place, and as seen in heaven, and coming out of heaven, she is identified as the bride, the Lamb's wife. She had graced the house in His absence, had taken care of things, as the "virtuous woman" in @Proverbs 31, she had seen well to the ways of her household in the absence of the Lord -- hence the corresponding glory.
J.B. You would say also that the testimony itself has a heavenly character.
J.T. It has, only that it embraces all that had preceded it. Every thought of God from Abel onwards was deposited in the church. "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples", @Isaiah 8:16.
J.B. I was thinking of @John 3:31, where John says, "he that is of the earth is earthly", and the Lord is referred to as the One who came from heaven, and what He had seen and heard, that He testified.
J.T. The Lord coming in took up everything that God had given expression to and put it all together; indeed, it all referred to Himself, so that things took form, and in that way the whole of the testimony partakes of a heavenly character. The fact is that the ark was typically that in which the divine testimony was preserved. The Lord took up everything that God had given expression to and maintained it,
{102}
and He committed all that to the disciples: "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples". What I would like to see clearly is that the New Testament shows that the disciples were elevated morally as partaking of the heavenly character, so that they were qualified to take up the testimony during the absence of the Lord.
R.S.S. It was that which you were seeking to bring before us this morning in connection with Sarah and Rebekah, Rebekah really filling the place that had been left vacant by Sarah, and much more.
J.T. That is it. I think that two passages help to show how the disciples, as coming into the light of Christ's resurrection and ascension, became practically heavenly. Chapter 12 does not go beyond resurrection, but chapter 20 does. It presents to us the heavenly Man, and it shows that these who should be His associates are also heavenly.
R.S.S. I was hoping that we all got the benefit of what you said this morning, calling attention to the fact that it is resurrection in chapter 12. The man whom the Lord had raised from the dead, Lazarus; but then, as you are saying now, in chapter 20, it is a further thing; not only the Lord risen but ascended. It is *as such* that He enters.
J.T. That is a very important distinction; I have only seen it lately, because I have been accustomed to connect chapter 12 with the assembly; and there *is* a connection, as the assembly participates in the resurrection as well as Israel; but Israel does not appear in chapter 20 till the second appearing, verse 26. In the first appearing, verse 9, it is the saints viewed in the light of being the associates of the ascended One.
J.P. Israel, as such, never will be a heavenly company, will they?
J.T. No. I think that following the course of the Scriptures the first allusion to the church is Eve, in @Genesis 2, and it does not go on to what is heavenly;
{103}
it is simply a question of the *derivation* of the church; she is derived from Christ. But when you come to Rebekah (directly Isaac is seen as risen you get the genealogy of Rebekah), her genealogy is presented, and when you come to chapter 24 Abraham makes Eliezer to swear that he is not to take a wife for Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites. He is to go to another country for her. So that I think you have a step further seen in the fact of another country, that she comes from another land.
R.S.S. A heavenly one.
J.T. Yes. Not only of the *stock* of Isaac, but she comes from another land. And therefore I think one can see her typical dignity as coming into Sarah's tent; how she would grace that scene; how she would fill Sarah's place.
W.H.F. Suitability is connected with being of Isaac's kindred; she was of his kindred.
J.T. And Abraham, in @Genesis 24:1 - 4, speaks of where she must come from.
R.S.S. Would you lay emphasis on "*my* country"?
J.T. Although Canaan was the promised land, it is here viewed as the land of the Canaanites, answering pretty much to what the Lord found in Israel. It was really the land of the Canaanite, a strange place to Him; so the church comes into view, not as taken out of that land, but out of another; His own land.
A.A.T. I do not know if I am anticipating you in connection with Rebekah -- how Isaac was comforted in the response of love there, having lost his mother.
J.T. That comes in; it is a question of the Lord's affection being met and satisfied, but, as you say, it is a bit in anticipation. It is very important to get clear *where* she comes from; not only what stock she belongs to, but where she comes from.
J.N.H. Do you see there the thought of the "better country" that Abraham looked for?
{104}
J.T. Not quite that.
J.N.H. I do not quite see your meaning: he was speaking of the country that he had been told to leave.
J.T. The country in which he dwelt is for the moment regarded as the Canaanite's country, @Genesis 12:6, and 24:3. It is not viewed for the moment as the land of promise. Typical things do not always have the same meaning in Scripture. When he says here, "go unto my country" (verse 4), we have to interpret that from a spiritual standpoint. It was Abraham's country. When the Lord was on earth the land of Israel was His, but the inhabitants were strangers really; and so in @John 12 you get the judgment of the system of things there: "Now is the judgment of this world"; the inhabitants were foreign; there was nothing there out of which the Lord could derive anything for Himself, hence the necessity for a new generation; "my country" I think, refers to heaven.
J.P. I was thinking how perfectly the gospel of John shows out all you have been saying, because, as has often been remarked, in John's gospel the Jew is the world morally, and the Lord is seen in the midst of the Jews as a heavenly stranger; how could He derive anything from that scene?
J.T. It is alluded to in @John 3 that no one could witness of heavenly things but He that came from heaven. He was a heavenly Man and "in heaven" morally; and John bears testimony to Him that, "he that cometh from heaven is above all", @John 3:31.
J.P. "He who has origin in the earth is of the earth, and speaks as of the earth. He who comes out of heaven is above all", @John 3:31.
A.A.T. In what way is it true that Rebekah came from heaven?
J.T. It is a question of a spiritual application.
{105}
All that the church is morally is the product of the Holy Spirit forming us after Christ in heaven.
C.A. The formation in the saints has a heavenly character.
J.B. You would attach a good deal of importance to "*my* country" and "*my* kindred".
J.T. That is it; and John the baptist, who was pre-eminently the earthly minister, recognised that a heavenly Man must take precedence, and he says, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom ... rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice", @John 3:29.
J.N.H. I have often thought about Rebekah and her people: literally, *they* would not represent a heavenly people.
J.T. The point is, it was *Abraham's* country and Abraham's kindred.
T.A. Does not @Genesis 24:14 characterise the church in a way?
J.T. It sets forth her *grace*.
W.H.F. So you see that Rebekah was not only kindred to Isaac, but came from another country -- from heaven.
J.T. That is a point of great importance; none other could be suitable.
W.J.N. It is important, too, when you speak of the church as heavenly, to distinguish between what the saints are as men in flesh and blood, and what they are as formed by the Spirit of God.
J.T. As formed by the Spirit you are formed after Christ in heaven. The condition made by Elijah in answer to Elisha's request was that if he should see him when he was taken up he should get the double portion of his spirit; it was conditional, and I believe what is alluded to is that the Spirit is the Spirit of the ascended Man. When Elijah was taken he was taken *up*, and you may depend upon it, Elisha was on the alert; Elisha had walked and
{106}
talked with the *risen* man, but he saw the *ascending* man.
W.J.N. And as a result Elisha comes out as the heavenly man here.
J.T. He comes out with a double portion of the spirit of the ascending man, and what followed on that was that the mantle fell. He did not ask for the mantle.
R.S.S. Your point is, that when Elijah passed through Jordan and Elisha with him they are then on the ground of resurrection; but then it was when he saw him ascend that he received the double portion of his spirit. It depends on more than resurrection; that is, on ascension.
J.T. So that Elisha went back into the land morally from heaven, with the spirit of a heavenly man; and then in addition to that the mantle of Elijah fell from him. Elisha had not asked for that, but it fell from Elijah and Elisha took it up.
R.S.S. I suppose we have a further confirmation of that from the fact that the Spirit has been given by an ascended Christ.
J.T. That is what is alluded to. As they were gathered together there came a sound *from heaven* as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting. "From heaven". It was something new introduced from heaven, and it filled the house where they were sitting, and sat upon each of them: so that you have the anointed vessel, anointed with the Spirit from heaven.
L.T.F. Was that what Elijah's mantle typified?
J.T. The mantle has to be distinguished from the Spirit. The Spirit is what is inside of you, whereas the mantle is outside. The mantle is your dress, that which men see, and in each case it is what has fallen from heaven.
J.P. It is the heavenly character coming out in the saints.
{107}
W.B. Do you get that in Ephesians?
J.T. Yes, in chapters 5 and 6, etc. It is what is external.
J.B. The garments would express the spirit of the man, they are more outward. John the baptist's clothing is mentioned.
J.T. The mantle refers to that which was seen in Christ in the gospels.
F.L. I suppose there is a further point: that upon that which is external comes the anointing of the Holy Spirit which goes down to the skirts of the garments from Aaron's beard.
J.T. That would be an additional thought -- referring to the Spirit coming from Christ in heaven to the saints on earth.
F.L. And, I think, a thought of great meaning -- the anointing. As to the marriage, the relationship and country, is it not rather interesting to see how much that line of things comes out in Genesis? Sarah's tent is occupied by Rebekah; following that comes in Keturah, I suppose indicative of the taking up again in a day to come of Israel after the church is removed; and then if we follow on we find that Esau, a profane man, takes wives from the Canaanites which were a grief and sorrow to Isaac and Rebekah, and he took wives from the daughters of Ishmael; he got a near imitation to the real thing; it was kindred to Abraham according to the flesh, but a purely fleshly one. It is what we see around us.
J.T. Ishmael's daughters would have the character of "Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children", @Galatians 4:25.
F.L. Man according to the flesh thought he was getting near the right thing when he took up the natural kindred, but it is very different from going
{108}
and getting Rebekah from Syria and bringing her to Sarah's tent.
R.S.S. @John 12 refers, you say, more to resurrection.
J.T. That is what I understand: "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit".
R.S.S. That is resurrection.
J.T. Yes, it involves resurrection.
F.L. That is a further thought than the resurrection you get at the beginning of the chapter.
J.T. The scene in the opening verses refers to Israel.
F.L. It is resurrection brought into view to make association possible.
J.T. The antitype of @Genesis 2. I think you will go with us.
F.L. Quite, and I suppose it lies at the root of @Hebrews 2, "all of one".
J.T. But it does not go as far as @John 20.
W.B. Does not association imply ascension?
J.T. In John it does although in a certain sense Israel will have that place according to the earlier verses of chapter 12: "Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table *with him*" (@John 12:1); Lazarus being the risen man. Would you go with that?
J.P. Yes, I would.
J.T. Israel will have a peculiar place; no doubt the Song of Songs would show that.
F.L. I suppose the idea of association comes in upon resurrection ground, and then the heavenly position of the church is a further thought than that.
J.T. Association for *us*, I think, is only on heavenly ground.
R.S.S. But for Israel not so.
J.T. No.
J.S. I was going to ask about the Greeks here:
{109}
"Sir, we would see Jesus". Does it bring in something entirely new, and the Lord goes on to speak about His death, that on the ground of His death the gentiles were to come in?
J.T. Just so. "The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified". The Greeks suggested that to Him; they suggested the place He had in God's counsels as the Son of man; universal dominion belonged to Him, but for the moment He could not take that up; He has to die.
J.L.J. Do you make a difference between the supper in chapter 12, and His coming into the midst in chapter 20?
J.T. Chapter 12 refers to the affection found in the remnant of Israel, Mary and Martha and Lazarus forming a sort of picture of the remnant at Bethany; there was affection for Christ and if there is affection for Him you will signalise it in some way; there is something done for Him, so there they made Him a supper; and then the Spirit tells us that Lazarus was one of those that sat at the table with Him. It is an allusion to the last days, when the Holy Spirit will have formed affection for Christ in the earthly remnant, and they will signalise it. The Song of Songs are a great help in that direction, showing the relations between Christ and His earthly bride; the presence of Lazarus points to the fact that they would be in relation to Christ on the ground of resurrection. But in chapter 20 they are gathered as having the testimony of Mary Magdalene.
J.P. And this was a testimony to ascension as well as a testimony to resurrection.
J.B. John often anticipates things, does he not?
J.T. Yes. I believe it is very important to see in chapter 20 that Mary had told them she had seen
{110}
the Lord and that He had spoken these things unto her. She told them what He had said to her. He had sent her with a message and she delivered the message.
W.J.N. There was not only the message then as to association, but the thought of new relationships came out in it: "unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".
J.T. "I ascend unto my Father". Not only that the Father was theirs, but that the Father was in heaven. He was ascending to Him.
R.S.S. If you look at the phraseology of the passage critically, is not the point of the passage "*I ascend* unto my Father"?
J.T. That is what I think; the emphasis is on *ascending*.
F.L. Also that it is equally true that the Lord gives immediate effect to what He had said in the end of chapter 17, in addressing the Father: "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them" (@John 17:26); and so the fulfilment of what you were calling attention to this morning in @Psalm 22.
J.T. But I think it is the Father as in heaven that He declares. He had made the Father's name known to them as the Jewish remnant.
F.L. And then He says, "I *will* declare" (@Psalm 22:22); the ascension and the declaration necessarily go together.
J.T. The thought of ascending gives character to the revelation of the Father in relation to the church, because He had already brought the Father in. He taught the disciples to pray to the Father. The Father will be known undoubtedly in the millennial state of things by the Jews.
F.L. The whole point from chapter 13 on is that He was going to the Father, and therefore everything that He would do takes character from that; and
{111}
so the declaration of the Father's name and ascension go together here.
J.T. So that it is God known in heavenly relationship as Father.
R.S.S. And was not that the point in connection with Mary: "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended"?
J.T. The relations could not be resumed on earth; they were broken, but they would be resumed in relation to the Father in heaven.
C.A. The fact that He was going to ascend gives the church a heavenly position.
R.S.S. In the company He does not tell her not to touch Him.
J.T. There is no restriction there. You can see in @Genesis 24, the assembly's place as from heaven; and here also, inasmuch as the saints are viewed as the brethren of the heavenly Man, and His Father is their Father. Abraham said, "go to my land and to my kindred" (@Genesis 24:4); the saints are morally from heaven.
F.L. It is striking that in @Matthew 28 the message He sent to the disciples is, "go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me", @Matthew 28:10. It is not "I ascend unto my Father".
J.T. That helps us greatly, as showing the difference between the two gospels. In Matthew He does not ascend.
W.C.R. When the Lord was here He told the disciples to rejoice because their names were written in heaven. Was that in anticipation?
J.T. I think so. Luke does not present the church strictly, but the place that *man* is to have as showing the excess of grace -- a place in heaven.
R.M.L. Is that the sense of being *enrolled*; that is, where they belong?
J.T. Yes; but John shows the origin of the church as to the stock from whence it springs and the country
{112}
from whence it has come; so that it is here for the moment in the way of testimony; it graces the house.
C.A. In that sense the church comes from and goes back to heaven.
J.T. Just as the Lord, in a sense.
J.P. In @John 20 they rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
W.C.R. In chapter 14 where He says, "I go to prepare a place for you" (@John 14:2), is that heaven?
J.T. I think so, only it is more a question of relationship -- "my Father's house"; but *their* place would be special.
J.H.C. Do you say His connection with God as Father will be shared by saints in the millennium in the same way as by the church?
J.T. Not in the same way, but you get "The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named", @Ephesians 3:14,15. All the families are in relation to the Father, but the Scriptures show that from the outset God had indicated that there should be something special. This is a question of God's sovereignty: what is special is reserved for those to whom He pleases to give it.
S.T. These things agree with what has often come out in connection with John's writings -- that he brings things out of heaven.
J.T. He brings heaven into view. It is what is heavenly upon earth, but it reverts to its own place.
R.S.S. Would what we are speaking of now help us in our apprehension of the Lord as coming into the midst; that He comes not merely as the risen One but as the ascended One?
J.T. That is most important; it is the heavenly Man that comes into our midst.
J.L.J. He brings into the midst all the value of the Father's name.
{113}
J.T. He does. He brings the atmosphere of the heavens.
A.A.T. Is it possible to come in in resurrection apart from association?
J.T. It is not possible now because He has ascended.
R.S.S. Many of us may have had difficulty in regard to @John 20 as to this point; that, as a matter of fact, between the time that He spoke to Mary and the time that He came to the disciples on the evening of that day, the Lord did not actually go to heaven. But as I understand it, @John 20 presents things in the form of a pattern.
J.T. It does; historically, the ascension took place subsequent to all this.
R.S.S. And we get in this chapter the pattern of that which afterwards took place. He breathed on them; this is also pattern.
J.T. So that you have to put @John 20 and @Acts 2 together to get the two sides of the truth. @John 20 is an inside view. It really took place in @Acts 2, but it is an inside view. @Acts 2 gives the outside view; what was apparent.
F.L. The Scripture is very careful in that respect; it does not say the Lord did not ascend to the Father, but just leaves it; because what is given is the moral force of the thing apart from the question of time.
J.T. It is not a question of what is historical.
F.L. It is not a question of time; it has nothing to do with time; it is the moral sense of the thing. I suppose Paul doctrinally refers to this order of things when he says, "if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer. So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation", @2 Corinthians 5:16,17. Doctrinally that is the same idea.
J.P. I am thankful for the remark as to omitting thought of time, but association comes in in
{114}
verse 17, and if we accept it as a divine pattern we cannot omit it from what follows; if you omit it from verse 19 you are marring the pattern. It comes in in verse 17, "I ascend"; it is not a question of time; it is brought in in its moral characterising power, if one may speak so.
J.T. What is here presented in pattern really took place in @Acts 2 in a spiritual way, only that this is the inside view of it.
L.T.F. He took that character at that time, the ascended character.
J.T. Exactly. It is the pattern; but historically, in @Acts 1, Christ ascended, and the Holy Spirit came in @Acts 2.
S.T. Does John give us what comes out of heaven?
J.S. Does not the Lord speak of ascending very early in John's gospel; "What and if ye shall the Son of man ascend up where he was before?" @John 6:62. Ascension is in view from the beginning.
J.T. Certainly; but in regard to our brother's remark, what I think comes out in the Scriptures is this, that what goes to heaven comes out of heaven. It is the second Man that came out of heaven.
S.T. I thought that was the character of John's writings; he brings things out of heaven.
J.T. That is it; they are brought into this world for the moment, but they revert back, as I understand it. So, for instance, @Revelation 12: the man child is born of the woman, but he belongs to heaven, and therefore he is caught up to God and His throne; and really that includes the assembly.
J.B. In @2 Corinthians 12, the man in Christ goes to heaven -- "caught up to the third heaven", @2 Corinthians 12:2.
J.T. It is that kind of a man who goes; you get the third storey there.
R.S.S. Of course, one would speak with great reverence, but even in connection with the Lord
{115}
Himself in His condition of flesh and blood in the body in which He was pleased to be here, that even did not go to heaven; that is, flesh and blood did not go.
J.T. He took that condition for a purpose, but as regards His Person; "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?" @John 6:62. You feel it is beyond you; and again in chapter 3, "the Son of man which is in heaven".
F.L. So in @1 Corinthians 15:47: "the second man, out of heaven".
J.L.J. Do you get the thought in @Ephesians 2:10: "we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus".
J.T. Quite so. If we are "created in Christ Jesus" we are created in Him as in heaven.
F.L. @2 Corinthians 5:2; "clothed upon with our house which is from heaven".
J.T. And, quoting from the same chapter, as you were saying, "henceforth know we no man after the flesh", @2 Corinthians 5:16. Paul did not know the Lord after the flesh.
F.L. This is a verse one would rather have expected to have found in Peter, for instance, instead of Paul.
L.T.F. Does not that mark out Paul clearly from the twelve?
J.T. He laid hold of Christ as the heavenly Man, and his great commission was to bring in the heavenly bride, not in an external aspect, but according to what she is in her relations to Christ, so he says, "that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11:2.
C.A. I was going to say what you have before you is a step in advance of what we have been accustomed to. We have taken account of the Lord as a risen Man coming into the midst, but it is the *ascended* Man.
J.T. That is clear from this passage.
{116}
J.B. Does not the description of Rebekah, when Eliezer calls her; her beauty and grace and conduct, all indicate that she partly belonged to Isaac?
J.T. You feel the servant would engage her with Isaac. In Paul you see the energy of the Spirit in gathering out a bride for Christ that he might present her as a chaste virgin. He was in dread of the power of the serpent to beguile the saints as he had beguiled Eve.
F.L. I think that Paul comes remarkably near to the spirit of Eliezer in that sense, in the spirit in which he goes out to find what belongs to Christ, and the character of his ministry to preserve and keep it so that it should be presented in that way.
J.T. I think from the way he presents the mystery to us he is the only one who fully answers to Abraham's servant. In him the energy of the Holy Spirit was seen as answering to Eliezer.
F.L. And I was thinking with regard to ministry in the present time, that it is a great help to have a proper appreciation of what the bride is really to Christ, and what the thought of Christ is with regard to the bride. I think we thus catch something of the spirit that Paul expressed in the verse you quoted.
S.T. Is there not a point in @Genesis 24 in that the servant is not named?
J.T. The name is not given. We know who it was, but we do well to note what you say. "Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had", @Genesis 24:2. That is, he was the most important servant; the one he could trust most.
R.S.S. Could you help us a little on a point that is very important and comes in in this Scripture we are looking at now; as to how we apprehend the Lord in the midst? We have been saying, this chapter is a pattern of what exists now of the assembly, and if it is a pattern of that, I am sure we want to get the good of the reality of it now.
{117}
J.T. I think chapter 20 is, properly speaking, what you might call the inauguration of the assembly. It presents to us the assembly as inaugurated here upon earth, but as heavenly. If one might use the simile, it is like the king opening parliament. He may open it in person, but then parliament is left to its own resources in a sense; it is organised and has all that is necessary to enable it to carry on its business. It acts for the king, but he opens it. Now I have thought of it in this way, that the king might return at any time; at any rate, I know the Lord has that right. In enacting the laws parliament would have the king's moral support, for the speech from the throne indicates what is in his mind; and what is done receives his sanction. Although he might not be with them in person, he would be with them morally; and I think that as acquainted with the Lord, any time He would come, we would recognise Him. Due deference would be paid to Him. I believe that the saints, as knowing Him, would pay due deference to His presence. The presence of the Lord is not an imaginary thing. It is real. It is our greatest privilege.
E. He is only seen by the spiritual eye.
J.T. That is true. Not but that almost any one would be affected by the presence of a divine Person, yet I believe that state is requisite in order to enable us to realise His presence.
J.B. Would you say the assembly is convened on heavenly ground as well as on resurrection ground?
J.T. I do not quite say that. The assembly is properly brought together by the Lord's supper, and I distinguish that from gathering together in His Name, in @Matthew 18. The Supper, I believe, as has often been said, is the rallying point or means the Lord has for calling us together; @1 Corinthians 11 says so: "When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper", @1 Corinthians 11:20. It is
{118}
easy to see that he implies that it *ought* to be to eat the Supper. They were not conducting themselves properly, therefore he says, "this is not to eat the Lord's supper". But normally the convening of the assembly *is* to eat the Supper.
R.M.L. In what character are the saints there?
J.T. I think it is as in our wilderness character, as in the scene where the Lord is absent, and because He is absent.
J.P. And the convening of the saints takes account of the saints in their *actual* condition, and hence you could hardly say they are convened on heavenly ground.
J.T. No, we are even in the presence of the world. The Supper is partaken of in the presence of the world. It is testimony.
J.P. And we are not actually on resurrection ground.
J.T. But in the Lord coming into our midst the ground is changed. What takes place then is spiritual, and so, in a way, hidden ("your life is hid", @Colossians 3:3), whereas the Supper is outwardly seen by all. It is what we do in a material way, and is therefore under the eyes of the world, but the presence of the Lord is spiritual; that is not seen by the world; "the world sees me no longer", @John 14:19.
J.P. That changes everything.
A.A.T. What is the occasion of His coming into the midst?
J.T. The Supper, the breaking of bread.
A.A.T. Then we are in the wilderness up to that?
J.T. I am afraid to define things too much; the assembly convened is not strictly the wilderness, but it may be regarded as in a contrary scene, and in it we are identified with the Lord's death. The Lord's death is an historical fact, which can be taken account of in the world. We come together knowing that
{119}
the Lord is absent, but then He comes to us, and in His company we may be withdrawn in our minds and hearts from what is contrary; from the consciousness of it.
R.S.S. We are here on the earth, and what we do is under the eyes of the world; it is a testimony; we are connected with the Lord's death, and we announce that.
J.T. The Lord *is made known to us in the breaking of bread*, and that leads to what is heavenly.
R.M.L. In what character would the saints be viewed then?
J.T. As the companions of Christ.
R.M.L. And previously more as a redeemed company.
J.T. Just so; those who have benefited from His death. We are His disciples. The *disciples* came together to break bread.
A.A.T. How long does the Lord remain with us in the midst?
J.T. I do not think we are entitled to say anything about that, but I am clear that what takes place in a material way is under the eyes of the world; the bread, the cup, and the box refer to the wilderness -- the place of Christ's absence.
C.A. So that any unbeliever in the world can take account of that.
R.S.S. You distinguish between the Lord's supper and coming together to pray.
J.T. Any number of the Lord's people might come together in His name; it may be better that some should be absent, but you cannot have anybody absent in the assembly; it is for all. The Supper is for all, therefore gathering together in assembly refers to the assembly, every member of it.
R.S.S. But in coming together for prayer that is on somewhat different ground; you are gathered in the Lord's name in connection with His interests.
{120}
F.L. So it should be those who are exercised; they are more concerned about His interests.
T.A. Is it necessary for each to be in the light that we are as a whole company gathered as one?
J.T. The Supper helps in that way; it puts us into proper relationship with each other practically.
J.B. It is the *Lord's* supper.
J.T. The very expression shows us it is not a heavenly position.
E.H. Does the thought of new creation come in there at all?
J.T. The thought of new creation brings in the land. It is in the fact of new creation that we are able to join Him. You are risen together with Christ in Colossians, but you are also *quickened*; it is in virtue of being created anew in Christ that we have moral power to join Him.
W.H.F. In connection with coming together to remember the Lord, it is what *we* do; we come together to break bread; we come together as brothers and sisters, and after that is over things are rather connected with the Lord as Head.
J.T. Yes.
Rem. And this produces worship.
G.A.H. Would you make a difference as to a hymn before and after the breaking of bread?
J.T. You have to do with the Lord before, and the thought of righteousness comes in: the box is therefore right; it is in relation to our position here in this world. Many may participate in that who do not pass over to the other side, because the other side depends on a state formed by the Spirit.
R.M.L. At the outset, before the breaking of bread, would you speak of forgiveness and such like?
{121}
J.T. It might not be out of place.
G.A.H. Nor a hymn not connected with purpose so much, but more with redemption.
J.T. And having reference to the Lord personally and His rights over us; His rights of love.
J.B. Mr. Stoney used to say you greet the Lord with a song.
W.C.R. Does not the actual breaking of bread and partaking of the cup especially bring the Lord before us, as in @Luke 24?
J.T. I think so.
F.L. That is @1 Corinthians 11; chapter 10 is more our side.
J.T. The Corinthians were not celebrating the Supper in an orderly way; therefore the apostle says, "this is not to eat the Lord's supper", @1 Corinthians 11:20. It should be carried on in an intelligent and spiritual way. Paul says, he received it from the Lord, and what he received was what the Lord did in the presence of His disciples.
A.F. Is it not the love that led Him into death that comes before us?
J.T. You love Him and so feel His absence; you want Him to come again; He has promised to come to us.
F.L. As a figure, Mephibosheth would help us. If he knew a place where he could meet David quietly, and David could come there I think he would have been delighted. He was there all the time in the sense of the absence of David: *we* have a sense of the absence of the Lord. He has appointed a place where we can come and meet Him, and we are delighted to do it.
R.S.S. You said a little while ago that in regard to the apprehension of the Lord's presence the question of state came in.
J.T. I think the convening of the assembly includes *all* the saints. You could not exclude any
{122}
believer from the assembly because in the mind of God it includes all. I am speaking now according to the normal conditions, as at Corinth; but then many may come and yet on account of not being quickened by the Spirit, there is no ability to leave seen things. The assembly properly realised is out of view; it is spiritual, and many are not morally strong enough to abstract themselves from what is seen and to enter on the unseen.
C.A. So it is of great importance that we should desire to be great enough to enter into that.
W.J.N. From the moment that the bread is broken; that is, when things are in a normal condition, you would say the Lord takes the place of Leader.
J.T. He must if he comes in. Every right minded believer recognises that Christ must take precedence.
W.J.N. Till then it is more the Lord on our side of things.
J.T. Yes.
W.B. What are the restrictions which prevent many believers taking part in the Lord's supper? We do not see them all together.
J.T. The restrictions are clearly indicated in Corinthians. If a man is participating in evil he cannot be allowed to participate in the Supper. But then there are those whose privilege it is to partake of it, and they do not partake of it, and that is a very solemn thing for them.
F.L. I think in the present day that it can all be summed up in two words; ignorance and moral state. Every believer could break bread, but for his ignorance or his moral condition. They are the only two things I know of.
{123}
J.T. And you feel their absence, do you not?
F.L. The older I grow the more I feel it. I used to think I had got the right company; now I feel a great part of the right company is not there.
R.S.S. "He shewed unto them his hands and his side". What is the application of that now?
J.T. I take it to be the marks of His death; the proof of His love; the way He makes known His love to us.
R.S.S. Would that be expressed in the loaf and the cup?
J.T. I think so.
R.S.S. They form a double witness in that way; His hands and His side.
E. What does @John 6; eating His flesh and drinking His blood; have reference to?
J.T. I think that is a question of *life for the individual*. It is not a collective thing.
R.S.S. Evidently the Lord's purpose in showing His hands and His side was that they might identify Him.
J.T. That is it; as the very One who died; He makes Himself known to them in that way. They could not doubt it was He.
R.S.S. I think the Lord would now identify Himself to us.
J.T. And does He not do that in some way? There is some indication that it is He Himself and not another.
R.S.S. I would like help on that.
F.L. In John's gospel is there not a special meaning in the *side* being mentioned? the blood and the water came out of His side.
J.T. It was out of Adam's side that the rib was taken, out of which Eve was formed.
F.L. In John's gospel the soldier pierced His side, and "forthwith came there out blood and water", @John 19:34.
{124}
We do not get that in Luke's gospel. It is His hands and feet there.
J.T. I believe that John gives us the last Adam.
F.L. I was thinking of John's epistle in connection with it.
J.T. I have no doubt as to the side of Christ, we have been taken out of it; we are formed out of it.
R.S.S. I do not expect there is anything greater for us, in a spiritual way, than apprehending the Lord's presence, and I am sure where there is desire in that direction that the Lord would immensely help. You feel as though He wants to be known, to be identified, to be recognised by His people, and I am sure He would respond to every simple desire in the simplest way.
J.T. And He would not disappoint affection. In the Song of Songs He came to the bride, and she was not ready and He withdrew.
R.S.S. I think sometimes saints get a little discouraged on this line, and think there are others who are more up to it, and they are troubled about it, but I am sure that as apprehending the Lord's thought and heart for you He greatly encourages you in responding to it.
J.T. At the same time the Lord would gratify our expectation. It is a very holy expectation, that we should look for the presence of the Lord in the midst of the gathered company, and He would always answer such an expectation.
W.H.F. J.N.D. said we should know when the Lord comes in and when He goes out. And Mr. Stoney remarked he knew when the Lord went out, but it was not so easy to tell when He came in. I believe the importance of the truth that we have under consideration now is very great.
J.T. How are the saints to be maintained in heavenly garb? It is only by coming into contact with a heavenly Person. It is not merely by knowing
{125}
Him by faith as presented in the gospel; you have to come *into contact with the heavenly Man*, and the presence of the Lord in the midst of the assembly imparts the heavenly character to us.
T.A. For the soul that is bound up with Him in affection there never exists any distance in a certain way.
J.T. No, in a certain sense; but there is something special for the assembly, and that is the presence of the Lord. I believe that the book of Numbers presents a heavenly people upon earth, and one injunction was that there should be a ribband of blue attached to the borders of their garments, showing that the testimony in the wilderness was to be heavenly, @Numbers 15:38.
F.L. I think what you were saying about not knowing the Lord as by faith in the midst is very important. We have often heard that the Lord is there by faith; that does not do. We do not know it by faith only.
J.T. No, it is a real Presence.
J.N.H. And it is important to see that @Matthew 18 would not be the same thing.
J.S. Would you say a word on @John 20:22; "he breathed on them"?
J.T. It is presented in relation to His Person; that He is the last Adam.
J.P. The disciples were quickened into His own life to enjoy the association which the Lord established.
J.T. Breathing the Spirit of that heavenly Man is a wonderful thing.
Ques. Does the Lord not come till the breaking of bread?
{126}
J.T. The Lord is Sovereign and you can never restrict Him; but I do say that the assembly convened is the place in which you would expect Him to be; and you have scripture for saying, "he was made known to them in the breaking of bread", @Luke 24:35.
J.N.H. If I understand you, the assembly convened is to break bread. That would confirm what has been said, that there are no other assembly meetings, strictly speaking.
J.T. I think the assembly is *properly* convened to break bread.
J.N.H. So when the disciples came together they came together to break bread. It is often used in connection with prayer and the reading meeting.
F.L. You would not say the assembly is *only* convened at the breaking of bread; there are *abnormal* circumstances; the trumpet might sound and the congregation be gathered together for something special; for discipline, for instance: @1 Corinthians 5.
{127}
ELDERSHIP
@Revelation 4:4; @Revelation 5:5,8 - 10; @Revelation 7:13 - 17
I wish to say a word, beloved friends, in regard to eldership, and so I have turned to these scriptures. I take eldership to be the result of *experience acquired in identification with the testimony of God*. Hence it is that which lies at the end of christian experience. What I have to say therefore will take the form of the consideration of experience through which God passes His people.
When God gives an expression of any feature of His testimony, you will find that a course of experience follows, so that the divine thought should be worked out in man. God never forgets His testimony; it stands out as the standard with which the experience consequent upon it has to agree. The Lord Jesus Christ was the Son as man here upon earth, and every feature of God's testimony was expressed in the Son *becoming man*. God took occasion to call attention to Him as "my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased", @Matthew 3:17. There was the proclamation from heaven in regard to His Son, and every testimony of God found expression in Him.
Now the Lord has left the earth, but ere leaving it He set up the divine standard, and the history of the assembly under divine teaching and culture is to bring out in result, in the experience of God's people, that which agrees with what was set forth in Christ. Hence the great importance of experience; as the apostle Paul says, "I have *learned*", @Philippians 4:11. We have to come to that; we have to *learn*.
The Lord in @Matthew 11, having borne testimony to Israel, was rejected, and He looks up and thanks the Father in the presence of His disciples. He is in all the liberty and dignity of a Son with a Father; and He is going to carry out all the Father's thoughts
{128}
in that liberty and dignity. Furthermore, He speaks of revealing the Father, and thus He stands forth as the model, directing attention to Himself as the Son; He says, "learn from me", @Matthew 11:29. The Son is the great model, and we have to learn from Him. We have to take the yoke of the Son upon us, which He says is "easy, and my burden is light", @Matthew 11:30. There we have set before us the divine standard; and the heavenly city is the answer to it.
The heavenly city comes down from God in the liberty and the dignity of the spirit of sonship. She *comes down*, she is not sent down; and she has the glory of God. She comes down, the most wonderful spectacle conceivable, the answer to the divine standard set forth in Christ, and the marvellous product which through all these centuries God has been working to produce. He never deviates from His standard; He works patiently in our souls so as to bring us to that which is in perfect agreement with His standard, and that is seen in the heavenly city. The heavenly city is very much on my mind, having been suggested by what some of us have been considering, but I only touch on it now in connection with the position taken up by Christ in @Matthew 11. He is the only standard; the Son in all the consciousness of the Father's affections is the model; we have to learn from *Him*, and God never deviates from His standard. The outcome of it all is seen in @Revelation 21 -- the holy Jerusalem, the heavenly city. It is a marvellous picture, and it is the result of the experience wrought out in God's people by His Spirit.
Turning back to the Old Testament for a moment, we shall see how these principles obtain *there*. I may say here that all the saints from Abel downward were in the light of the Son in *some* sense. I am not prepared to say in what measure, but I have no question about it, that in some way or other there
{129}
were glimmerings of light in regard to Christ as the Son, and some trait of His character was in measure set forth in every man of faith from Abel downward. Abel is an example. To say nothing of his offering, *he* was a keeper of sheep. That was the foreshadowing of a trait of Christ, for the Lord Jesus Christ, beloved friends, is the true Shepherd. Thus some trait of Christ is seen with every man of faith. They were, so to speak, *elders;* by faith "the elders obtained a good report", @Hebrews 11:2. The character of Christ was being built up into their experience; this is what marks an elder.
Now if God gives expression to any feature of His testimony, He is never diverted from it until He brings it to pass in the experience of man here upon earth. I wish especially to speak of government; for the elders here, as you will observe, are connected with the throne. God gave expression to His thought in regard to government in Noah. God deposited in that man a testimony; he was to rule over the new world. We know how he failed, and how he was unable to rule *himself;* he was devoid of the experience of a ruler. He had affection for his house, and he prepared an ark for the saving of his house, but he was devoid of the ruler's character, for he was unable to rule himself. But the testimony of God must be maintained, and hence the next man of faith, Abraham, *has* the spirit of the ruler; he has it in his conception of government; as if God had said, It fell to the ground in Noah, but it shall be maintained in Abraham. He took Abraham into His confidence on the ground of the fact, among others, that he would "*command his children and his household* after him", @Genesis 18:19. There you get God reverting to His testimony committed to Noah. He had not forgotten it. He knew Abraham, He knew that He had put something into that man;
{130}
that He had formed him in such ways that he would maintain His testimony in his own house.
Well now, we find subsequently that God intervened in connection with Abraham's seed, and having delivered them out of Egypt, He would be their Ruler. He never departs from any of His thoughts; He would be the Ruler of His people. That began with the ministry of Moses. Moses, as we know, represents not only the Lord Jesus Christ as our Deliverer, but also as our Ruler, for he was "king in Jeshurun", @Deuteronomy 33:5. Though not an official king, he represented the authority of God in the midst of His people; God was King. That state of things continued until the days of the judges, which brings to light the solemn fact that in spite of all their privileges every man was his own king; "there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes" (@Judges 21:25), and there was complete departure from God's testimony.
Elimelech, in Ruth, is the typical Israelite of that day. His name signifies that Jehovah was king, and yet we find him leaving the land and going into Moab. That shows he was but little in the light of what his name conveyed. In the book of Ruth God amends that situation by the introduction of the king in *prospect*. Obed was the father of Jesse, who was the father of David. In other words, before the people sought a king, as recorded in the book of Samuel, God had already prepared the king. He knew Abraham beforehand, and He knew David before He anointed him; before God chose him, David was a man after God's own heart. What we find in the history is that God set up the kingdom in Saul. The people wanted a king; it was better to have one king than to have every man a king, and so God acceded to their wish, and helped them to acquire a king. It was wonderful grace, but God had His own thought in it. He was giving them an
{131}
opportunity to see what He could do in regard of His testimony, as under rule in His king. There was complete breakdown in Saul, but God had David in view.
Now what I want to show is that even in David you find the same principle; that there must be experience and exercise. After he was anointed he had to spend a long period of time going through the most terrible experiences; so that, as thus disciplined and taught of God, he should become a qualified vessel to maintain divine rule. David is the typical king, and hence the Spirit of God takes him up to convey to us in inspired words what a king should be. "He that ruleth over men", says David in his last words, "must be just", @2 Samuel 23:3. That was in his *heart;* it had been wrought out in his experience, so that he could tell what a king should be: "ruling in the fear of God, and he shall be as the light of ... a morning without clouds", @2 Samuel 23:3,4. But David could not come up fully or answer morally, to the divine idea. A "morning without clouds" could only find an answer in Christ, but it is very beautiful that in the last words of David we get that perfect expression of what a king should be, @2 Samuel 23.
We have in these instances a confirmation of what I have been saying in regard to the New Testament. Both Abraham and David found their full and complete answer in Christ. We have in Christ, One who ruled His house perfectly, and One who exercises the power of the kingdom perfectly. Now eldership must of necessity be the result of experience wrought out in our souls in the light of what shone so perfectly in Christ, and I have taken these verses in Revelation as giving a true idea of eldership. It seems to me that it is the goal, as it were, to which each of us should look forward. As the Lord Jesus Christ takes us up, making the truth of the gospel a reality in our souls, and relieving
{132}
us of every soul trouble, He would direct our attention to Himself. We see an illustration of that in @John 9. The Lord says to the man to whom He had given sight, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" and the man replied, "Who is he, Lord?" "Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee", @John 9:37. Thus the Lord reveals Himself to him, and he worships Him! That man is *captured*, beloved friends, and Christ henceforth is his model. We need to have that before us.
The "twenty-four elders" in @Revelation 4, represent the whole company of God's people, as I understand it, from Abel onward, but it is God's people viewed in the light of having *acquired experience* in suffering, toil and conflict. The Holy Spirit directs our attention to the experience that is to be acquired by learning from Christ. Now there is a great deal of experience that is *not that;* experience that results from our eye being on another model, and there is no growth as the result. If you have a slave in your house, that slave has the spirit of a slave; he has not the spirit of your child. There are many slaves among those known as God's people, and there is much experience among them which is not that which produces eldership; there is legal experience. The great thing is to see Christ in the presence of the Father -- to see *the Son*. If God wishes to express that which is most precious to Him, it is the *Son;* not simply the Person, but the Person who stands in that relation to Him as Son. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son", @John 3:16. It is the Person who stands in that relation to God. We need to get hold of that; it is the kernel of the gospel; to get a hold in our souls of the position that Christ has as Man with God in sonship. It expresses on the one hand the gift; He who was most precious to God the Father, has been *given;* and on the other hand,
{133}
that Man stands in all the liberty and dignity of a Son with the Father.
Now that is the true starting-point of christian experience; any other leads to "Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children", @Galatians 4:25. That is seen in Christendom. Jerusalem which now is, is in type mount Sinai -- a legal system, and God has a perfect title to cast her out at any time. He *will* do so, for Jerusalem which is, is in bondage, is a *slave*. Hagar was a slave, and Abraham had a right to cast her out of his house; but the true wife remains in the house. Jerusalem which is above is *free;* her place is in the house for ever, and she is "the mother of us all", @Galatians 4:26. We remain in the house with our mother. It is the conception of sonship as seen in the Lord Jesus Christ as Man with the Father. That is the true beginning of christian experience, but that experience becomes very wide. Testimony branches out, I might say, but once you are in the liberty of sonship in your soul it is wonderful how every feature of experience takes character from it. There is a certain dignity about you. In everything that you do, in everything that you say, in all your manner and deportment there is a heavenly dignity; and it increases; there is constant increase, beloved friends, until, as John puts it, you attain to the degree of a "father", and nothing more need be said to you than, "I write unto you, fathers, because ye have *known him* that is from the *beginning*", @1 John 2:13. He wrote unto them, in other words, because of what they knew, and of what they had acquired by experience.
Now what we find in @Revelation 4 is the result of the experience which we acquire here upon earth as the sons of God, as having learned from Christ. Having taken His yoke upon us, we are "meek and lowly in heart"; we have found rest to our
{134}
souls, @Matthew 11:29. In the gospel of Matthew there is a wonderful sphere of activity opened up. I cannot touch upon it now, except to show how the Spirit of God supersedes the legal system, with which the testimony of God *had* been connected, by a system established in the liberty and dignity of sonship. On the mount of transfiguration in chapter 17 the Father announces the Son. Others had spoken -- Moses and Elias, but here was the Son! "This is my beloved Son ... *hear ye him*", @Matthew 17:5. Peter would have made three tabernacles, but the true tabernacle was there, the Shekinah glory was overshadowing it, and every testimony of God was centred in that Person. The Father directs attention to Him. The tabernacle of God is in sonship; the testimony is there, and the Father's cloud is there; the cloud that was over the tabernacle in the wilderness was there, but here it was the *Father's* voice, not Jehovah's. The Son was there with all His affection for the Father, and every testimony indicated that the tabernacle was there. And then the voice says, "hear ye him", @Matthew 17:5. Every communication is from His lips; there is no other speaker save the Son. The gospel and all the divine counsels are what are spoken; everything proceeds through the affections and through the lips of Him who is in the consciousness of sonship with God. And then -- wonderful grace! in the end of the chapter Peter is a son; he who would have made a tabernacle for Moses and Elias on the mount is placed on the platform of sonship with Christ. The Lord says, "Then are the sons free ... that take and give it to them *for me and thee*", @Matthew 17:26,27. The sons are free. Jesus was the Son, and Peter and the disciples were sons; they were brought into sonship. In chapter 18 we find that which answers to the city. In chapter 17 its foundations were laid in principle in "the Son of the living God" (@Matthew 16:16) and in chapter 18 we have the administration worked
{135}
out here upon earth by those who are sons. That is for the present moment. It is a wonderful thing to come into contact with such people. The early chapters of the Acts show a company of such sons here in this world, in the liberty and power of the Spirit. Never had there been such a spectacle as that; all divine administration went out through them, and it was to be continued. If we are to have it now, it must be according as we are formed in the liberty and dignity of sonship.
I must go on to @Revelation 4 for a moment. You will notice in these elders what I have been saying; they are in entire sympathy with the throne and with Him who sat upon it. I think God delights in that! We know how the Lord delighted in the sympathy of His people when He was here. Indeed, we read that He looked for sympathy and found none, @Psalm 69:20. He had to accomplish the great work of atonement alone, without sympathy, but He *sought* it, and where He found it He valued it, as in Mary in @John 12. She had sympathy with Him; she thought of His death. The atmosphere was rife with the spirit of murder, but there was one there who thought of Christ, who had sympathy with Him; she anointed Him for His burial. Well, the elders are in complete sympathy with the throne. I do not go beyond that in chapter 4, save to show that they fill their position divinely. Their seats were prepared for them; there were twenty-four thrones, and they were occupied by twenty-four elders. One could dwell upon their sitting there in all the dignity acquired by their experience upon earth. They had crowns of gold; they were not only inwardly in sympathy with Him who sat upon the throne, but in every respect they were in accord with that scene. Their crowns I need not say are moral crowns; they are the effect of the work of God in them. A crown is what one's heart cherishes.
{136}
They were crowned with golden crowns, which sets forth what is of God.
I will just refer briefly to the other chapters which I read, to show what marks them. In chapter 4, as I have said, the elders are seen in their dignity, and in sympathy with the throne. Now in the next chapter they can tell you about Christ; they can explain the whole situation. "One of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book". They know about Christ, and you will notice that when He took the book their hearts were moved. One is affected in seeing the intense interest in Christ which marked them. They give ample reasons for their homage and their praise, and everything they do is in affection and intelligence. They can tell you about the Lord, and they can give a full account of what they do. All their movements are governed by affection and intelligence; just as Paul says, "I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also", @1 Corinthians 14:15. That is to say, they are completely governed in regard of themselves, and everything that they do is in the full light of the divine intelligence which they possessed. Then in chapter 7 we find one of the elders giving an account of the saints.
I might speak of the vials or bowls full of odours in chapter 5 and the harps. It is all intensely interesting, and indicates the characteristics of the elders. The living creatures are coupled with them; on the living creatures I do not dwell except to say that the golden bowls are filled with prayers. They are not only sympathetic with Christ, but they are sympathetic with His people, and have sympathy with the prayers of the saints upon earth; they have harps also, with which they sing.
Then in chapter 7 as I have said the elders can give an account of the saints. The inquiry is, Who
{137}
are these? Now an elder in the assembly ought to know about all the saints; that is his business, so to speak. He ought to know their histories and where they live, etc. A true elder can give an account of the saints, so here we find that this elder knew all about these saints. He raises the question as to who they were and "whence came they", and the prophet replies, "*Sir, thou knowest*". Then he proceeds to enlarge upon *what* they were. They had come through great tribulation, and they had washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. He goes on to say what God will do for them; they should have a place in His temple, "and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes". To my mind it is very beautiful, and how one *longs* to see that spirit among God's people, a care for the saints, to have their prayers in your heart, and to know all about them. The Lord Jesus Christ knows them; He is the *great* Elder, the *great* Bishop; He has them all written down in His book. As Paul said, "The Lord knoweth them that are his", @2 Timothy 2:19. He knows them all, and every elder takes his pattern from Christ; He knows who they are, and all about them, and their blessings.
In closing I would say, you may depend upon it that the truth cannot be maintained without *experience according to God*. Everything is set forth objectively in Christ, and it is worked out subjectively in us. The city -- eldership -- is the result of the work of God in the souls of God's people.
{138}
THE "WALLED CITY"
@Leviticus 25:29; @Acts 20:17 - 38; @1 Corinthians 4:11 - 17
As to the connection between these scriptures which I have read, my thought is to set forth a little in regard to the character of that into which the gentiles were introduced. They were introduced into a *walled city*. I refer to the passage in @Leviticus 25, as setting forth in type the assembly as set up here, and the scriptures in Acts and Corinthians as setting forth the character of the ministry by which the city was formed *internally*. The apostle shows that his ministry and ways were in entire accord with those of Christ. Paul had been brought into acquaintance with Christ in heaven, and all his ministry has that in view. The city was established on earth in all the dignity of sonship as known in Christ in heaven. He brought the glad tidings amongst "the nations". Paul's ministry took the form of the announcement of the Son; he preached the Son of God. The "walled city" was already there; the city established by the ministry of the twelve apostles, which will appear in the future in glory. The city as established by them existed morally before Paul's testimony, and by him the gentiles were introduced into it; they were marked by the ministry of Paul. The ministry of the twelve went on also, they were apostles of Christ, and represented His authority; they maintained Christ's due. They loved Christ, and all their service was performed out of love for Christ. Their ministry brought to pass an order of things which was all of God, and a city was reared morally with a wall of protection excluding all that was evil.
The apostles were entrusted with the testimony, and they treasured it, and saw that it was protected.
{139}
They not only reared walls around it, but the gates were kept; there was vigilance in the exclusion of all evil, and everything contrary to Christ was refused. It was set up in the midst of Israel -- "a walled city". Israel lost her opportunity. She had, as it were, an opportunity to "redeem" her place within the city; in the type we see in @Leviticus 25, that a full year is given to redeem it, and, failing that, it passed out of the owner's hands *for ever*. The gentile comes in for that possession; not in a "village or in an open field", but *in the city*. He may acquire land, and he has acquired it in the "open field", which I regard as earthly possession. Barnabas had lands there, and sold them, for he wished to have a residence in the walled city. He recognised the authority of the apostles, and he sold his land, and gave the money to the apostles for their disposal. He was in sympathy with the testimony, and he sold his land, preferring a place in the walled city. He knew he would have to give up his land sooner or later, and whoever bought it from him would also one day have to yield it up, and would get nothing back for it. The land goes out free in the year of Jubilee.
Today God is really owner of the land, but one sees how the nations claim the land and advance their flags to the utmost limits of their territory. They lay claim to proprietary rights; to the land which in reality belongs to God. I want a residence in a "walled city". Barnabas¬ land will return to God, its rightful owner, in the year of Jubilee. Barnabas did what every Israelite should have done. The walled city established in their midst was open to them, and gave them a great opportunity to embrace a wonderful place of privilege. The nation refused it, but those who accepted it "continued steadfastly in the apostles¬ doctrine" (@Acts 2:42) in complete accord with the city, and the Lord "added" them.
{140}
The Israelites had the city in their midst, and abundant opportunity was given to them to redeem their place in it. Jerusalem was their city, but the door of the assembly was thrown open to them, but they spurned and rejected it, and the gentile has come into their possession.
In @Leviticus 25:30 you see what we have come into; what we have been introduced into. You have taken your place in the order of things established here for God, and it is yours *for ever*. Earthly possessions will have to be surrendered, but if you have found a residence (in a sense you have to purchase it), a *place* in the walled city, that place is *secured* to you *for ever*. It shall not go out. Walls are essential to a city. In the heavenly city (@Revelation 21) the measurements of the walls are given; the length and the breadth and the height of them, and the walls are garnished with precious stones. The walls are a most essential feature in a city, for the inhabitants are secure within the walls.
But now we want to know what is *inside* the walls, and to have some conception of the *interior* of the city. In @Psalm 107:7 God speaks of guiding His people by "the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation". The walls are around the city, but here we get the inhabitants referred to. God directed and guided His people in the wilderness, that they might *go* to a city of *habitation*, and as God forms us in His light, we *seek* "a city which hath foundations", @Hebrews 11:10. Abraham sought something stable and immutable, and as he learned and apprehended God he saw the unstable character of everything here. He looked for a city whose Builder and Maker is *God*. The light of God coming into our souls loads us to *desire* the city. Many believers have not found the city. We read in the blessing of Moses, "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people", @Deuteronomy 33:7. That sets forth in
{141}
figure the character of the inhabitants of the city, and if we read these scriptures in Acts and Corinthians in regard to Paul's ministry we shall see that Paul gives, as it were, the inhabitants; that is, the inhabitants of that heavenly city are formed and developed by the ministry of Paul.
Paul had received light from Christ in heaven outside the territory of Israel. The centre had been removed from Jerusalem and from Israel; the centre of everything was now in heaven, where was the "light above the brightness of the sun", @Acts 26:13. The result of light *from* heaven is to lead back to heaven. Nothing is more desired by my soul than that a little bit of heavenly light may be the impression given in one's ministry. The present situation is not understood unless you see that things proceed from heaven. Paul first apprehended and appreciated the *Son of God;* that Person *touched* and captured his heart, and thus his preaching was spontaneous. I know he was an apostle, and that he was sent to preach; nevertheless he preached out of affection for Christ, and he "preached Jesus that *he* is the *Son of God*", @Acts 9:20. The testimony of Paul was "that I may announce *him* ... among the nations", @Galatians 1:16. The result of that testimony is to set the gentiles in the dignity and affection of sonship. We are all sons of God. This gives you an idea of the inhabitants of that city; they are heavenly, formed by heavenly light, and they are *sons*. Sons have the liberty of the house. We shall never lose our place, not only on account of His purchase of us by His blood, but also because we are sons. The Lord as man was the Son of God. He could go up. He says, "I ascend", @John 20:17. And the sons are accorded the liberty of the house; they are heavenly, and they are sons. Paul's ministry was pre-eminently the ministry of a *son*, it expressed Christ. Everything Christ did was done in the dignity and liberty of a Son, and marked by a
{142}
heavenly character, and so it was in a measure with Paul.
Ephesus sets forth the city in principle. In @Acts 9 we get the start, and the finish in chapter 20. There was liberty, and it was used for the service of God. In Antioch there was spontaneous response; there was liberty there too. Barnabas had full sympathy with Paul, he rejoiced in the work of God at Antioch, and he brings Saul to where the work was; he went out in liberty. The Spirit of God says, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul", @Acts 13:2. There was a spontaneous response, and the Spirit of God recognises it. That is the source through which the gospel came to us.
Look through the chapters that intervene, and you will find that the testimony moved forward until it was enshrined at Ephesus, and at the conclusion in chapter 20, the assembly was set up in the full light of what had been revealed in Paul's soul. We cannot enlarge on what he says, but it is indicated that he had moved about among the Ephesian saints according to the character of Christ. He brings out that "it is more blessed to give than to receive". It is on the line of *gift*, not of *demand*, and that was the line of the Son of God. Paul laboured and preached, and all that he did was in accord with Christ. The Ephesian saints were affected by his ministry, and the proof of it was, how profoundly affected they were that they should see his face no more. His ministry had produced affection. Why do they love him? Because there was a reproduction of Christ in him. The internal features of that "city" are found in Paul.
God's city is a wonderful place to have a residence in and to have company in. We shall all have a residence there. At present we are dwelling in tents, and but for a time, liable to be dissolved at any moment, but presently we shall *dwell* in a building
{143}
from God, a house not made with hands. Where? *Eternal in the heavens*. Every believer will have a permanent fixed abode in that city, eternal in the heavens, and a residence that he will never lose, for it is secured to him *for ever*. The inhabitants of that city will be instinct with life, each one exhibiting some trait of Christ, and expressing some feature of Christ. The wonderful line of thought began down here in a man to whom Christ had been revealed; a man who was in reproach, but who moved about in the dignity of Christ, and whose ministry was of Christ. We may have ten thousand instructors but only one father. The inhabitants of that heavenly city will in that sense have one father, for they are begotten, as it were, by the ministry of Paul. Paul was the father of the Corinthians, but they were very unlike their father. Paul could not go to them himself, so he sent Timothy, his dearly beloved son in the faith. Timothy reflected Paul. The Spirit of Christ produces in our midst the character of Christ as shown in Paul and Timothy. Some of the Corinthians were puffed up; they were not in accord with the spirit of that city. "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus", @Philippians 2:5. Our citizenship is in heaven. The lowly man on earth is the only suitable man for heaven. The lowest place here corresponds to the highest place there.
Suitable conduct is required, and Timothy is left in Corinth to set things in order. Paul is exercised that things should be after the order of Christ. A heavenly city, a walled city -- and occupied with heavenly inhabitants -- come down from God out of heaven, and in accord with Christ, and "having the glory of God", @Revelation 21:10. This is the product of the ministry of Paul -- she "comes down out of heaven, from my God", @Revelation 3:12.
Our residence is secured in that city -- and secured to us *for ever*.
{144}
CITIZENSHIP
@Hebrews 12:22; @Philippians 3:20
I desire, beloved friends, to say a word to you in regard to citizenship. Citizenship of necessity has its centre in a city, although it is not confined to a city. The idea of a city arose very early in the history of humanity. It did not arise from any divine conception, so far as we know. The first city that Scripture speaks of was that built by Cain, and it is a well-known fact that, while Cain built the city, he did not call it after his own name; he called it after the name of his son. I connect that in my mind with the position of the Jew as having murdered Christ, for Cain was the type of the Jew guilty of the murder of Christ, and Barabbas is properly the production of judaism. The name Barabbas, as you know, signifies the son of the father; that is, he bears the characteristics of his father. It was a dreadful thing that the people whom God had taken out of Egypt, before whom all His wonderful signs had been set forth, to whom the oracles of God had been committed, that they should be possessed of a murderous heart. When His beloved Son appeared in their midst Barabbas was the product, as we may say, of that system of things. Now Cain's city was called after the name of his son; that is, the son of the murderer, and that son was in type Barabbas, who, beloved friends, was the choice; *man's* choice in preference to Christ! Now in that you have one feature of the world-city: it bears the name of the son of the murderer, who was according to his father, because he was the son of the father. I speak of that because it conveys to us some idea of the character of the world city.
The next city that we find is that of Babel. I speak of these cities so that you may have some
{145}
conception of the world with which you have to deal. It is of great moment that believers should be alive to that which exists in antagonism to the testimony. The thought of Babel is negative. I do not want to be negative. I hope by the Lord's help to set forth what is *positive*, but I wish to bring before you that which marks the Babylonish world with which we have to do. What marked Babel was that it was the banding together of men. There seems to have been a leader: "A man said to his fellow". There was one who led humanity; the object was centralisation, and the purpose was, "Let us make ourselves a name"; "Let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens", @Genesis 11:4. We are not told after whose name it was called. *God* gave it a name; when He divided their tongues God showed its character, and it was called Babel, but that which prompted the building of the city was "Let us make ourselves a *name*"; "Let us build ourselves a city and a tower". There, I believe, you get the characteristics of the Babylonish system with which we have to do. It is marked, as I have said, by murder; that is, by murderous opposition to Christ; however fair its appearance, however wonderful its works, however much the ingenuity of man marks it, that which is *behind* it is murderous opposition to Christ. Men would band themselves together; you have it in the cities of this day; the endeavour is to band men together. *We* know that it is anti-christian.
Well now, in connection with Babylon you will observe a certain energy, and that energy finds its expression in Nimrod. We are told that the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and that he was a mighty hunter before the Lord. In the present Babel system, the present feature of the world system, you will find the energy of Nimrod. There are many mighty hunters today. I need not enumerate
{146}
them; they may have varied pursuits, but they are all after the same thing. They are hunting with all their might, with all their energy; they are after something for their own exaltation; they are pursuing all that which adds to their dignity in this world. It is a spirit that is often found even among God's people. Nimrod was the full expression of it, he was a "mighty hunter before the Lord", @Genesis 10:9. It was *before the Lord;* and that which goes on before the Lord will come under the righteous judgment of the Lord. So the mighty hunters of today; all the untiring energy that man puts into the pursuits of this life, the commercial life, and the other pursuits, you may depend upon it nothing escapes the eye of God.
It is the greatest comfort that everything comes under His eye. He is the sovereign Ruler, and everything that happens is under His eye. The saints may suffer from it, and they do suffer, for a "mighty hunter" will disregard the rights of God, he will trample the saints under foot, as we know has been done, but the souls of the martyrs are under the altar (@Revelation 6:9 - 14), and they cry to the sovereign Ruler, "How long, O sovereign Ruler, holy and true". God's eye is over everything on earth, all is "before the Lord". Now that conveys to us some idea of the present state of things, and one feels how solemn it is as time goes on. While these terrible Babylonish characteristics are becoming stronger and more in evidence, what a solemn consideration it is for the saints of God as to how we are to shape our course in the present day in regard to it. I believe the Lord would speak to our hearts about it all. You cannot allow yourself to recognise that system in the least degree, for in the measure in which you recognise it you are unfaithful to Christ.
Now I want to show you, if I can, the means of
{147}
preservation for the saints. I wish to dwell upon the positive side, and that is, that God takes account of His people; and in *His* world there is going to be a counterpart to all that exists in man's world. You will find, that whatever there may be in this world built up by man's energy to captivate the saints, there is something to answer to it in God's world. Whilst citizenship necessarily centres in a city, yet it involves a country. I happen to live in a country where citizenship is a great feature. The citizen is supposed to have title to all the privileges of the nation. And now I want to show you that God opens to us an order of things which every privilege is opened up to the believer. The first thing that meets one on becoming a citizen of any country is the constitution. You cannot become a citizen of the United States unless you have some idea of the constitution.
I want to say a word on the constitution. The first element that presents itself to the believer, as I said, is the constitution. The constitution is the fundamental principle on which any nation rests. Every country has its constitution. I want to show you what is the constitution or order of things into which the *believer* is introduced. The constitution of GOD'S world is *sovereign mercy;* everything is on that basis. It is a wonderful thing that on the principle of faith you have come into an order of things, the first element of which is the principle of sovereign gift. There is no nation like that in *this* world. If you go to any nation under the sun and seek citizenship, you will not find anything on the principle of sovereign gift; but what God supplies *us* with is all on the principle of sovereign gift. It is the first thing that God impresses us with, and it has a wonderful effect on our souls. If the light of God's sovereign mercy enters into one's soul it has a marvellous effect upon us. But you must have it
{148}
*in your soul*. It is necessary that the constitution should be understood, that it may become, not simply objective, but part of our being, and give character to us. It is sovereign mercy, made known in Christ, entering your soul that gives character to you, and enables you to be a suitable citizen of God's order of things.
Now the next thing that is presented to you is the *city;* that is, you *have* a city; you are said to have *come* to a city, and that city is "the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem". There are two things which mark that city. The first is, it is constituted in life, it is the city of the living God; and the second is that it is heavenly, "the heavenly Jerusalem".
I want to say a word in regard to the heavenly Jerusalem. My conception of it is that it is inwardly the outcome of the ministry of the apostle Paul. Historically it was built by the ministry of the twelve apostles; their names are in the foundations, @Revelation 21:14. The foundations and the walls are historical. They were built under the eye of man; they were reared up by the testimony of the twelve. The walls of the city are detailed and may be traced in the early chapters of the Acts, but the inward part of that city is private; it is, as it were, formed in affections through the ministry of Paul. I take the formation of the inward part to date from chapter 9 of the Acts; it is introduced in connection with sonship. You can never understand the heavenly Jerusalem if you do not understand sonship. The city is formed inwardly in the light of *sonship*. It was established outwardly in *life;* it was the city of the living God, but it is also in the dignity and liberty of sonship. Sonship has not reference to protective walls; walls are protective, but sonship has reference to *relationship;* that is to say, sonship has to do with our affections; the inward affections
{149}
of the saints are formed in the light of sonship. As such it is the *heavenly* Jerusalem; it is pre-eminently heavenly, and it *comes down* -- that is it is in liberty, it is free. How is it free? It is free on account of sonship; it is formed in the light of sonship, and is free; it *goes up* to heaven, and it comes down from God *out of heaven*. Prophetically John saw it; he says, "I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven", @Revelation 21:2. What a wonderful spectacle! A city established in life, and inwardly formed in affections, and it comes down from God out of heaven. It is a very wonderful thing to have a city like that, and I would enlist the sympathy of the youngest believer in it. That is what you are *come to;* you are come to the city of the living God, and moreover it is heavenly, and it is free as being heavenly.
The next thing is the "universal gathering". I will not enlarge upon that; the best illustration I can give you is the houses of Parliament. Parliament is the convening of the representatives of the nation. I allude to it for a moment to show that it is a large enough thought for any political mind. I use the word political advisedly. You may say you have not a political mind, but you will have it by God's grace as you advance in your christian experience in God's things; that is to say, you will be interested in the principles and the legislation of God's world.
The next thing you come to is "the assembly of the firstborn" (@Hebrews 12:23); these are the privileged ones. You come into society beyond anything upon earth; you come to the privileged ones; they are "the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven". In other words, you come into touch with the saints viewed in their heavenly character; they are a wonderful company, and you belong to them. The disciples did not appreciate what was in
{150}
God's mind for them when they were elated by the power by which they overcame the wicked spirits, @Luke 10. The Lord says, "in this rejoice not ... but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven", @Luke 10:20. The saints of this dispensation are viewed in that light. We have the firstborn's portion, we are come into the position of the firstborn ones; we are the true Levites of God. The Levites were taken in the place of the firstborn; they had no inheritance; they had cities. Cities in Scripture refer to buildings; that which is distinguished from the land -- the country. The Levites had *cities*, but no inheritance. We are the true levites of God, and our place is in heaven: "the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven". That is wonderful society! Can the world offer you anything to equal it? God provides for you whatever your heart craves as formed by the Spirit. There are many desires, and God meets every desire every desire that the Spirit produces in your soul is met. God provides for all your desires in His own country.
Then you come to God *Himself*, the universal Judge. He is the "Judge of all" (@Hebrews 12:23); there can be no question but that we shall get justice. As come to the Judge of all, you need not fear any charge brought against you; you need fear nothing; you have come to the Judge of all the earth, and He will do right. I have not any doubt that every cause of mine will be fully vindicated. You need not attempt to vindicate yourself; *God* will vindicate you. He is the Judge of all. It is a wonderful thing to have come to God in that light; it puts your heart at perfect rest in regard to the malignity of the enemy. God will take care of you. The Lord Jesus Christ knew that. He left everything with God. Paul left things with God. The Judge of all the earth will do right.
{151}
Now I will go on to the "spirits of just men made perfect" (@Hebrews 12:23). What gives character to a man is his spirit; it is all a question of his spirit. What kind of a spirit has a just man? The Lord Jesus Christ was the just Man; He was the just One. What kind of spirit had Christ? His was a wonderful spirit, but, beloved friends, the Spirit of Christ is the spirit of all "just men". Is not that wonderful; a humanity after the pattern of Christ? That is the spirit of "just men made perfect". So we come into touch with a humanity which is after Christ -- the spirits of just men! a wonderful fellowship, a wonderful communion! It really refers to the humanity that God will have in His presence. If He is the Judge of all no humanity can remain in His presence except the *just* humanity, and we have come to the "spirits of just men made perfect". I look at it morally. I do not deny that it is the entirety of the divine system. It speaks of the principles of the divine system which is before us. It is a wonderful thing that in it there are men that are "just", and we have come to their spirits; and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant.
Jesus is the great central attraction in the midst of that humanity -- the lowly Jesus, and it is "Jesus the mediator of the new covenant", @Hebrews 12:24. In the midst of all that scene of glory it is the lowly Man you have come to; it is *Jesus;* not the Son of God, not the Christ. It is the *Man*, it is the One whom Luke presents to us. Where is the christian who has not read the gospel of Luke with delight? It is the *Man*, it is Jesus, beloved friends, in the midst of humanity, in relation to a *just* humanity.
And then we are told that we are come to the "blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel", @Hebrews 12:24. The heart turns to Jesus with delight and pleasure; for amidst the vast scene of glory that God has before Him, the one central
{152}
point for the affections of the heart is *Jesus*, the same as He was on earth. There is no change in Him, and it is Jesus who has effected the new covenant. The apostle Paul presents Him to us as the One in whose face the glory shines. The love of God, expressed in the death of Christ, shines in His face. As the apostle says, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", @2 Corinthians 4:6. In the face of that Man, *that* is the glorious shining. I do not think you will ever have a conception of the glory if you do not see the position of Jesus here upon earth as Man, the most approachable of all men. He is the Mediator of the new covenant. He took up the cause of man. He took up the covenant, and His glory is that He has made it effective; the glory shines in His face, and you have come to *that Man*! It is a wonderful scene in that world, in God's country, but the great central figure is Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant.
We were dwelling this afternoon on the blood of Christ: it was the life, the blood was the life, that is, the blood of Christ represents the surrender of His life, and when I say that I am not simply speaking of His physical life. That was of course involved, but His life morally consisted in affection in connection with the bonds that had been formed here on earth in connection with Israel. The Lord laid down all that, He surrendered all that, and the blood of sprinkling speaks wonderful things; it speaks "better things than that of Abel"; it speaks of God's love. Abel's blood cried for vengeance, but the blood of Christ speaks of all God's love. That is what we have *come to*. I hope I have made it plain; I think it is very needful to the understanding of it that you take account of it as a country -- God's country, with all its blessings, so that you should
{153}
see that you are a citizen of it, and that as a citizen you have title to every part of it, every privilege of the country. And what wonderful privileges are opened up to us in this chapter!
I wish now to say a word about Paul's remark in the epistle to the Philippians. Paul as to his aspirations was set for God's calling, but as to his position in this world as a disciple of Christ, he was on the down line, he was possessed of the mind of Christ, and as a man in this world he was *going down*. Jesus went down. You will find in chapter 2 of Philippians that the mind of Christ found its expression in Paul, Timothy, and Epaphroditus; they were willing to surrender completely their own things for the good of God's people. The Lord Jesus Christ has gone down in regard to the saints and God's glory. Paul had *His* mind. Timothy had His mind. Epaphroditus had His mind. Timothy "naturally" cared for the saints (@Philippians 2:20), and Epaphroditus was grieved because the saints heard he was sick; he was not thinking of himself or of his recovery, he was thinking of the saints; he had the "mind of Christ", @1 Corinthians 2:16. Paul surrendered all for the *good of the saints*, and counted everything loss for Christ, that he might have Christ for his gain. Christ was everything to him. That is the man who has Christ for his goal. And he had aspirations too; he pressed towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. That was what he had before him, and then he goes on in regard to others, that they *might be like-minded*, and he shows that our citizenship is in heaven. I close with that. I leave that with you.
May the Spirit of God draw our hearts heavenward. It is a wonderful escape from the present order of things. We await from heaven Jesus as Saviour. Our citizenship is there, and our expectation is that Jesus will appear from heaven as Saviour, "and
{154}
transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory", @Philippians 3:21. That is the road that is opened up to christians, so that there is a perfect way of escape out of the darkness of the present Babylonish world which we have to do with.
I have referred to the thought elsewhere that in the Scriptures you will find that from the very earliest date God had indicated a *special* place. In Eden there was a garden; it was *in* Eden, and that indicated that there was a special place in God's mind for man. So in the ark there were one, two, and three storeys, indicating the same thing. In the tabernacle there was the holiest of all, the holy place and the court. In the temple there were three tiers of chambers. Now I believe that in all these things God indicated that He had reserved a special place, and I need not add, beloved friends, that that special place is for *the assembly*. The Lord says, "in my Father's house are *many* mansions" (@John 14:2) and He adds to those who share His affections, "I go to prepare a place for you". For those who share His rejection He has prepared a special place.
May the Lord set our hearts on it now. The hour is not far distant when we shall hear what John heard -- the "voice ... as it were of a trumpet ... which said, Come up hither", @Revelation 4:1.
{155}
THE RESULT FOR GOD OF THE TESTIMONY OF HIS SON
@John 3:35; @John 4:10,19 - 26; @John 20:17 - 23
What I have on my mind to bring before you is the thought of what is for God on the earth as a result of the testimony of His Son. The gospel of John presents the Son not exactly in relation to anything that existed upon earth before, but in relation to God Himself. The gospel of Matthew also presents the Son, but there it is the Son in relation to that which had existed before on the earth. Israel had had the place of son with God. God had sent a message to Pharoah demanding that His *son* should be released. "Let my son go, that he may serve me", @Exodus 4:23. So we see that Israel had the place of son with God upon earth, but Israel utterly failed to correspond with that wonderful position. Matthew introduces the Son, not exactly to establish the truth of His Person, but to show that in Him God could take up and maintain every thought of His in regard to Israel. Presented to Israel in this way, and rejected, He establishes a system upon the earth that should supersede Israel. That is what Matthew presents: a system set up in the liberty of sonship, and subsisting in life as founded upon the Son of the living God. That is to say, the assembly is established in life, and also in the liberty and dignity of sonship; and therefore it is a suitable vessel with which to connect the testimony of God.
Coming to Mark we again have the Son; "the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God" (@Mark 1:1) but there it is the prophetic ministry. All ministry is now carried on in the liberty and dignity of sonship. There had been a prophetic ministry before; God had spoken to the people by the prophets, but
{156}
henceforth all ministry should be carried out in sonship. We have divine ministry maintained in the Son.
Luke, I need not say, presents Christ neither in relation to the testimony that had been committed to Israel, nor yet the prophetic ministry, but in regard to humanity; humanity is taken up in Christ. In John, as I have already said, we have the *Person*, and that, not as in Matthew in relation to anything that existed before, but in relation to God; and hence the results must of necessity be *for God*. The Spirit in the opening chapters of John presents us with the Person in that light. "No man hath seen God at any time" (@John 1:18), it was something entirely new; there had been much revealed in the Old Testament, but no man had seen God. Moses desired to see Him, but no man had seen God. God had dwelt in thick darkness; no man had seen Him, but "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him", @John 1:18. That is the point of view in which the Spirit of God introduces the Lord Jesus Christ in this gospel. It is a question of the revelation of God, and hence the results must be for God.
In chapter 1 He is marked off. John the baptist says: "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him", @:John 1:32. He who sent him to baptise with water had said to him: "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit" (@John 1:33) and he adds, "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God". The Son is marked off as the One upon whom the Spirit came to *remain*. God, as it were, had found a permanent resting place here upon earth. As of old the dove of Noah had failed to find a resting place for the sole of her foot, so, I take it, the Spirit of God, prior to the introduction of Christ, had failed to find a resting place.
{157}
He had been active in divine operations; the heavens had been garnished by Him; but there was no resting place. But the introduction of the Son upon earth involves a permanent resting place for the Spirit. That was a wonderful spectacle; that a Man should be marked off in this world in the eyes of others as One in whom God could rest. He was the Sabbath of God. Then He begins to move upon the earth; there never had been such a movement seen in a man before. He who saw the Spirit descending and remaining on Him saw Him walk, and we are told that looking upon Jesus as He walked, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!", @John 1:36. The Lamb of God is one who is most precious in God's eyes. He walked in that light here upon earth, and thus He became the attractive centre for the saints. In what I have said, you can see the wonderful position occupied here in manhood by the Son, and it is in that Person that the gospel as presented by John comes to man.
In the beginning of chapter 3 He is approached by Nicodemus. All the instruction, and the wonderful light that comes out in that chapter, is the result of His being approached by a man who had a measure of light. A "master in Israel", Nicodemus came to Jesus by night in the recognition that He was a "teacher come from God", @John 3:2. I can only touch in the briefest way on a point or two in the chapter. In the early part of it what strikes one is the authority of this Person. In the end of chapter 2 we read that He knew all things; He knew what was in man; He knew what was beneath the surface, and needed not that any should tell Him. There were those who believed on Him because of His miracles, but He did not commit Himself to them; their faith was worthless. The Lord did not judge by outward appearance, but by what was below. He knew what was in man, and did not commit Himself to
{158}
him, but He opened up the truth to Nicodemus. You will observe it is a question of what Jesus says: "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, ... it is needful that ye should be born anew", @John 3:5,7. There is One here now with divine intelligence, and who can speak with authority. The Old Testament had intimated what the Lord said to Nicodemus, but the Lord did not appeal to it in that way, it was a question of *His Word*. He knew what was in man and what man required; it was no question of the authority of the Old Testament, but of the Speaker. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, ... it is needful that ye should be born anew", @John 3:5,7. That is what we see at the introduction of the testimony to men by the Son; He had perfect knowledge of what was in man, and a perfect knowledge of what man required. Then there is the unfolding of God's love. I do not dwell upon the necessity of the cross: I can only touch upon it here, but the manner in which it is presented is in accord with what I have been saying. The Lord says, "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so *must* the Son of man be lifted up", @John 3:14. It is not a mere evangelist speaking, but a *divine Person*, in divine intelligence making known what was necessary, and that was the lifting up of the Son of man. Then He declares His divine authority. He says, "We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven", @John 3:11 - 13.
Then He goes on to God's love. How was God's expressed? I suppose every christian would answer, 'By the gift of His Son'; but in making that answer I think we forget to ponder *who* the Son was. The point here is what the Lord
{159}
Jesus was here upon earth under God's eye; that Person upon whom the Spirit could descend and remain, upon whom the heavens had been opened, and to whom the voice of God had declared: "This is my beloved Son", @Matthew 3:17. It is a question of the intrinsic value of that Person here upon earth under God's eye. *And He has to be given up*! "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life", @John 3:16. The Lord would call attention to what He had been to the Father, what He had been to God. I am not overlooking what He had been with God eternally, but what is presented in testimony is what had come out here upon earth. God had declared His delight in that Person, and had made known to man what He thought of Him. He had given a public declaration that He had reached in Man here upon earth, all that His heart had been set upon; and He surrenders that Person, the Object of His eternal love, in death. He surrenders Him in order that man should have life eternal.
But I must pass on. There was responsibility flowing from this: the Lord says, "He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God", @John 3:18. That Person had acquired renown upon earth; it was the renown of the only begotten Son of God. I want you to consider, beloved friends, what it was to have such a Person upon earth. What a walk was His! What works! What ways! What words were those words of Jesus! He acquired renown thus; and the man that spurned it, the man that did not believe on His name, was condemned; it was moral condemnation. Think of what the gospels present in that Person, and as you gather that up you have some conception of the
{160}
name of the only-begotten Son of God. There can be nothing but condemnation for him who refuses to believe on *that* name. Condemnation was the portion of the Jew, for the One who moved about in their midst on behalf of God, as the only-begotten Son of God, they refused to believe.
Whilst the mass of the nation saw no beauty in Him and refused Him, there was that in Israel divinely wrought, of which I take the liberty of regarding John the baptist as the representative. He was the greatest of those born of women, but, beloved friends, he retires in the presence of *this Person*. Where does he retire to? Instead of having a position on earth as the greatest of those born of women, the Acts show that *that which he represents*, even the remnant of Israel, came into the heavenly portion. One can see the spirit of it in Stephen, who in his address in @Acts 7, in divine intelligence gathers up all the ways of God with Israel, and presents them so as to convict the nation. His face shines as he looks up to heaven and sees the heavenly Man; he sees Jesus and the glory of God. It was well worth while to retire in the presence of that Person, for Stephen found a place with Jesus; he is taken care of by Him. It is a most touching thought to me that his *spirit* was taken care of by Jesus. He says, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (@Acts 7:59); and his *body* was taken care of by the saints on earth; devout men carried Stephen to his burial. It was the transition point between that which was the testimony of God on earth in connection with an *earthly* centre, and the testimony of God in connection with a *heavenly* centre. John recognised the importance of the latter. He said, "He that cometh from above is above all", @John 3:31. "He must increase, but I must decrease", @John 3:30.
John had his opportunity to express his estimate of Christ and he embraced it nobly; he recognised
{161}
the heavenly, and he said, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom ... rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice" (@John 3:29); his joy is fulfilled; that is to say, John had heard the voice of Christ in His affection for Israel. The voice of a bridegroom is the voice of one actuated by affection; he is no bridegroom if he has not affection. The Lord Jesus Christ was the Bridegroom. He was in the midst of Israel actuated by divine affection for the nation, and there never had been such a voice heard in Israel as that of the Bridegroom; it was the most melodious of all voices. There is a peculiar touch in the thought of the Bridegroom; a man is always at his best in that position. You will remember how the Lord Jesus is typified by the sun; there is a tabernacle made for Him in heaven and He comes out as a Bridegroom, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race, @Psalm 19. His influence is universal. It is the influence of a bridegroom. That is Christ. The voice of the Bridegroom is the voice that John recognises here; his joy, therefore, is complete.
Now the Person who has this honour is presented at the close of the chapter in the position of administration: "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand", @John 3:35. Here it is not the anointing, nor is it a question of the exaltation of Christ, although doubtless the latter is included. The point is, "The Father loveth the Son". Is it not wonderful, beloved friends, to think of all things in the hands of *such* an One! The One who is the ineffable joy and delight of the Father's affections. The Father loveth the Son, and He has committed all things into His hands. That marks the present moment.
Then in chapter 4 the Lord in effect says to the woman, Did you but know the situation -- the gift of God, you would have had confidence, and you
{162}
would have asked of *Him*. What would He have given? The very best gift possible, a gift commensurate with His position as seen in chapter 3. He was in the affections of the Father, and the Father had given all things into His hand. He says, "thou wouldest have asked of him"; it is not a question of *what* you would ask for, but that you would *ask;* "and he would have given thee living water". I only touch on that to show that the gift *to* us is commensurate with the gift *for* us. It is not a question of official administration; it is the administration of love; and if love acts, it acts from itself and gives its best; so He gives living water. The chapter shows that the result of that would be something *for God*, and that is worship. God acts in love, as I said, *from* Himself, but it is *for* Himself, so the gift reverts to Him.
I understand the living water to be the Spirit as taking up the affections of the believer, affections which had hitherto drunk deeply from a world of corruption. The Spirit takes up those affections and centres them all in a divine Person. The woman raises the question of worship. She says, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship"; but the Lord says, "Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews". In saying that, He maintained what was due to God in regard to what had been at Jerusalem; Mount Gerizim was not on the same level. The Samaritan worship had no place; it was an ignorant worship. He shows what is true worship. God had established a centre at Jerusalem and Christ maintains it; but He says, "the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers"; those in whom every affection is gathered up by the Holy Spirit and directed into divine channels, directed by the Spirit to the Father; these "worship
{163}
the Father in spirit and truth: for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers".
I pass on to chapter 20 to show briefly what is for God as seen there. I have been endeavouring to show what the result of the gift of the Spirit is; that God gets His portion from our affections; but then God seeks more than that. He seeks to have a generation here on earth like that Son who delighted Him when He was alone upon earth. In a word, I desire to show you the full church position, and also to show you what the church is essentially as that which is for God. I take the few verses in chapter 20 to show the full result of the Lord's death and position as set forth in this gospel. He had been down into Jordan; for that is the aspect of His death at the end of John; the brazen serpent comes in at the beginning of the book. Jordan overflowed all its banks. Satan had marshalled all his power against that Person, but the Ark of the Covenant went into Jordan and its waters disappeared. He meets Mary on resurrection ground. He is a risen Man, but she must not touch Him on that ground; everything should proceed from heaven, and the Lord says, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father". He sends her with a message to His brethren as the ascended Man, and the most wonderful light that was possible to enter into the heart of man is contained in it. He says, "I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God". It is the Son in all the dignity of His Person as having come up out of Jordan. He has perfect liberty to ascend; it is a question of His Person, and the Son of necessity has full liberty in all the house.
You will find in Scripture that that which is most elevated is regarded as the place of the greatest
{164}
privilege, and the Lord, being the Son, has perfect title to go to the highest point. In John it is not that He is *received* up, He *ascends;* He goes up to the Father in the dignity of His own Person as the Son: and as going there He sends a message to His brethren. The message, beloved friends, involves their association with Him in that dignity. It is not simply that they are associated with the *risen* Man, they are associated with the *ascending* Man; in other words, they are the companions of Christ viewed as the heavenly One. I dwell upon that because it indicates the position of the assembly. The assembly is a heavenly institution upon earth, and it is composed of those who are the companions of the ascending Man. *They* are not ascending; the time for that will come, but they are the companions of that Man *as ascending*. And more, that ascending Man comes into their midst and breathes into them the Spirit; it is the Spirit of an ascending Man that we have, the Spirit of Christ in heaven, and we are set up here upon earth in that dignity and Spirit. We must not dissociate the position from the Spirit who maintains the position. The position is that of the ascending Man, for He ascends to His Father and our Father, His God and our God; but the Spirit of that Person is breathed into the disciples so that they should be maintained here in the full height of the position. They are the brethren of that Person and set here upon earth in His Spirit so as to maintain for Him during His absence. That is what I understand to be for God here upon earth; not simply a risen company, but a company in association with the heavenly Man, possessed with His Spirit, and set up here in testimony. Think of the testimony that would flow out of such a company! I repeat, not merely a risen company, but a heavenly company. What a testimony! It is a testimony in accord with His. He
{165}
says; "as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you". Beloved brethren, have we any conception of the affection with which the disciples were sent out? They were sent out from the circle where the atmosphere of heaven was breathed; it is not apostolic, it is a question of what they were as in that circle; they were sent out from that sphere of affection.
You may say there is not much of that here now, but I verily believe there is something of it, and the Spirit of God would promote it in us. We can never have the practice and the service becoming to those who form the assembly unless we maintain ourselves in the full light of our position. If I may speak for myself, I never surrender the full light of the position in which by God's grace I have been placed, and I believe that the Holy Spirit would promote that in us. Oh, that we might have a clear conception of the dignity of those who are to be for God upon the earth! God would have you maintain that in the faith of your soul. If it *is* maintained in your soul, and you come short of it, you are humbled and exercised. Light is intended to exercise, and exercise brings in soul progress, so that we are led on subjectively to correspond with the position in which God has placed us in association with His Son. I do not say it is a question of sonship, because the sons are *to God*. He has predestinated us to sonship by Jesus Christ *to Himself*, but *brethren* are in relation to Christ. We are Christ's brethren; that is to say, God has extended the circle. That which was so precious under His eye in the Person of Christ has been extended to the circle of the brethren of Christ, so that we come under God's eye in that light; but how essential that we should recognise the Spirit, so as to be in accord with it! We should be practically marked off in this world as those who are in relation to the Man upon whom
{166}
God opened the heavens, and whom He declared to be His beloved Son.
I trust that these few thoughts may be intelligible to you. It is a question of what is *of* God and *for* God, and what is of God must correspond with what came out in Christ personally when here upon earth.
{167}
CHRISTIAN UNITY
@Genesis 11:1 - 9; @Acts 2:41 - 47; @Acts 4:23 - 37
I wish to say a word in regard to christian unity. It is a subject of all importance, for it is bound up with, and is properly the outcome of, the gospel. The gospel involves the revelation of God, and when God is revealed we come to see that unity is in the Godhead; that is what has come to light in the Son become Man. Thus the Persons in the Godhead come into view, and we see the wonderful spectacle of divine unity; so that in the proclamation of the glad tidings the unity of the Godhead is brought into evidence. God is One, and all unity upon earth flows from that. God will not tolerate any other unity upon earth than that which is the result of His testimony.
Now, beloved friends, I desire as briefly as I can to convey to you some idea of the character of christian unity. You will have observed in the chapter which I read in Genesis that the descendants of Noah had unity before them; they would band themselves together in defiance of God, their object being their own exaltation; that was the end in view in the structure which they proposed to build; a structure which has many counterparts today. The object in view was to build a city and a tower to reach to heaven, so that man should have a name. You have there the germ of all human workings; you have indicated the object in view in all human activity away from God from that day until this.
Man as isolated feels himself of little importance; he feels himself a very little speck on the earth, and hence he would promote unity with his fellows; a unity by which his fame should be increased, by which his reputation should be augmented. And you have, as I said, in that the germ that has given
{168}
birth to every earthly empire and combination of men from that day to the present; the end in view is that man should have a name. That is what lies at the bottom of all centralisation; the fame of man after the flesh. There is no thought of benevolence in it: every empire that over existed is a "beast" according to Scripture; and not even a tamed beast, but a wild beast. Now a beast has no conscience, no heart. The empires of men are marked by selfishness, and the same principle applies to every corporation, every banding together of men, whether trades unions or business corporations; all have in view the establishment of a name and greatness for man.
Now God will not tolerate that; and it is a sign of the last days that the present moment is one of centralisation, brought about by men to establish their own greatness on the earth; and every bit of ground they gain is taken from God and from Christ. I only mention this as, a warning; men are returning rapidly to that which God overthrew in the plains of Shinar; and the whole will culminate in anti-christ, "who opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God", @2 Thessalonians 2:4. They are working in this land and other lands, and every day brings its own development of the denial of Christ's claim.
Now I wish to show you what God brings to pass. God has brought to pass a unity of His own, and nothing in a way more evinces His blessed nature than that in the formation of *His* unity on earth He should have in view the blessing of all these families who were banded together against Him at Babel. The first mention of the gospel had reference to these families. I dwell on this so that you may have the character of God before you. God took Abraham out of the midst of this Babylonish world, which had departed from God, and the gospel of
{169}
which He spoke to Abraham had in view that all the nations of the earth should be blessed. God looked out on the families in revolt against Him, and He had thoughts of blessing for them. Abraham saw Christ risen to be the vessel of blessing; that in him all the nations of the earth should be blessed. God said, as it were, 'You are trying to bring about a unity: let Me bring unity to pass'. And this is the advice one would like to give to all men. No true follower of Christ could have part or lot in any unity apart from God's unity; *that* unity which God brings to pass; and if any one of you is in connection with any such unity, I would counsel you to abandon it. God has formed a unity.
The Lord Jesus Christ became Man; He has answered God by His death in regard to the lawlessness of Babel, and He has gone up into heaven. But before He went up to heaven He formed a company of men here upon earth; they had been attracted to Him, and as He was received up into heaven they gazed on Him; their affections were completely won. As here upon earth, they are marked by subjection to the only authority that remained upon earth, now that Christ was in heaven; that authority was the Scriptures. They had abandoned lawlessness; the Righteous One had brought them into righteousness, and hence into unity. They were subject to divine authority, and therefore they were suitable for God's unity. They were subject to the Scriptures, and were together "with one accord", and the Holy Spirit came down from Christ in heaven on that company, and He formed unity here upon earth. It involves blessing to all the revolted families. That is the magnificence of God's grace, that He formed His own unity here in the presence of men, and the Holy Spirit came in such a character that tidings should reach the revolted families, so that all the different families
{170}
represented there should *hear*. They heard spoken in their own language "the wonderful works of God", @Acts 2:11. *God's* name, *God's* reputation, is what marks *that* unity. The wonderful works of God were spoken of. The wonderful works of *man's* genius to which he points with pride were not before them; within that circle we hear of the wonderful works of God; these are worth hearing about. And they are proclaimed in the tongues of the revolted families, that all might hear of the wonderful works of God.
Well now, I want to show from @Acts 2 that unity, practical unity, flows from the fact of souls coming under the influence of the gospel. We are told that "they that gladly received his word were baptised". Peter's word came to them from that circle. I need not enlarge on his sermon. The point of it was that God had made Jesus both Lord and Christ; that Man was in glory, and the result of the presentation of that glorified Man was that three thousand were subjected to Him. I do not dwell upon it, I only want to show the result: "they that gladly received his word were baptised"; they severed their connection with the lawless world. They came into what God had established, as separate from the lawless world, and above all from the world of judaism, which was Babylonish, which receives the glory from man and not the glory that comes from God only. It was a lawless world, and "they that gladly received his word were baptised". It is a peculiar touch, to my mind, this forty-first verse; they severed their connection with the lawless world.
Well now, many things are said of them, but I would only touch on one or two things which marked them. You will see at a glance that what marked them was a happy and holy unity. I wish to show that the effect of the gospel rightly received severs from the world and results in a divine unity
{171}
here upon earth. It is not viewed in chapter 2 exactly in connection with the testimony as it is in chapter 4, but it is simply the blessed and happy effects of the divine nature. This is what chapter 2 presents; the results of the gospel received in their souls. In verse 44 we read: "all that believed were together, and had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need". Now, I regard that passage as presenting the result of the gospel; a company brought together, happily engaged in the things of God. They valued the things of God and enjoyed them, and there was evidence of affection and care for one another. Each man thought of his neighbour; there was among them the activity of the divine nature. I want to distinguish between this and the unity in chapter 4, and then I shall close.
Chapters 3 and 4 show us the character of the apostles¬ testimony; that is, that they were not engaged with their own reputations, but with *Christ's name*. What marked the christian unity was that *His* name was to be great instead of our name. Wherever you find a man, be he christian or not, who has his own name before him, he is Babylonish; he is virtually a Babel-builder. But what marks the apostles is *Christ's* name -- "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk", @Acts 3:6. Peter said he had neither gold nor silver, and he had no reputation, but Jesus of Nazareth had a name of renown. Peter boldly states in chapter 4 that there is none other "name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved", @Acts 4:12. That is what marked Peter and John in their testimony. Now, Satan was against that name. The injunction of the religious leaders in chapter 4 was not simply that they should not hold certain doctrines, but that they should not teach or preach in *that name*.
{172}
But the divine intention is to *maintain* that name.
Now I want to show you that the end of chapter 4 presents to us a unity in support of that testimony; not exactly a unity seen as formed by the gospel, as in chapter 2, but a unity in support of the testimony. I feel that is what should exercise our hearts. "Being let go, they went to their own company". Alas! many in our day have no company, but in the early days the preachers and teachers *had* a company, and they went to it and found sympathy. When things are according to God the preachers and the company are in unity; hence we find they went to their "own company". And what was in that circle? Their prayers indicated that they were exercised about all the counsels of God. They quote @Psalm 2. You can always tell where people are by their prayers. The whole world was banded *against* God and Christ; and this company was *for* God and *for* Christ. I wish just to read their prayer: "And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou *art* God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, by stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus".
{173}
Is not that a wonderful prayer? I need not enlarge on the chapter. That company was in entire sympathy with God's testimony. And then God answered. God is for that company in power, and we read, "And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together". That was the company which God supported; the company that were thinking of His testimony; of the "name of thy holy servant Jesus". All the power of man's empire levelled against that company could not touch it. The place was shaken where they were assembled. The shaking was not like the shock of an earthquake; that would inspire terror; but it was indicative of the power of God that was *for them;* it was from God's hand, and inspired confidence in the company assembled; and "they spake the word of God with boldness". Another mark of the company you will notice was that they sold their possessions, not only that distribution might be made, but they "brought the money, and laid it at the apostles¬ feet". They recognised the apostles who represented the authority of Christ. The surrender of property in chapter 4 has reference to the testimony, the donors indicated their sympathy with the testimony.
Well now, I have done. I hope I have made clear to you the marks of christian unity. It really flows from the Godhead. But the unity which God proposes is unity in *variety*. In the future the whole universe, with all its different families, will be united. All the courts of the tabernacle were joined together by golden taches so that it should be *one* tabernacle. This speaks of the whole universe being bound together in divine love. There will be all the different families, but all will be bound together in a unity of variety. All will be pervaded by the spirit of sonship.
{174}
SYMPATHY IN THE TESTIMONY AND AUTHOIRITY OF THE WORD OF GOD
@Luke 8:1 - 21
My thought is to say a word in regard to sympathy with Christ in the testimony, and in connection with that to seek to show the importance of the word of God. What you can see here is that the Lord stands forth in connection with the testimony, not only as individually connected with it, but as associating others with Himself; and you will observe that whilst it states that the twelve were with Him, there were also others, and these were women. You will find in the Scriptures that what represents divine authority, as the apostles, is associated with what is subjective; and the feature in which the subjective side appears here I take to be that of sympathy.
Now I think you will find in the perusal of the Acts that these two lines are found together. Most of us here are aware that Luke wrote to confirm Paul. It is indeed essential to a right understanding of Luke to bear that in mind, and you will find in the Acts that which corresponds with this section of his gospel; namely, the position and ministry and authority of the apostles, which I take the liberty of designating as official, it being the result of divine appointment.
The apostles were divinely appointed, but they were tried men. The Lord took them up in perfect discrimination; they were men whom He knew, and who had been tested, so that He appointed them as qualified. What corresponds with the official position of the apostles is the Spirit which indwelt them. That is to say, although divinely appointed, they were not to exercise their apostleship apart
{175}
from the Spirit. They were to remain in Jerusalem until they should be endued with power from on high; and I think you will find by a consideration of @Acts 1 that they were in every way equal to their mission. Their hearts were attracted to Jesus; that wonderful Person had been brought to their attention and had completely won their hearts, so that when He is taken up from them they are found gazing up into heaven. In other words, the apostolic ministry was marked by affection for Christ.
Then you will find that whilst awaiting His promise, the gift of the Spirit, they recognised the authority of the Scriptures in the choice of an apostle to fill Judas's place; the Scriptures being the only authority left upon earth, seeing that Jesus had gone into heaven. To these men the Holy Spirit came, and as endued with power from on high, they carried on their ministry. The Holy Spirit coming down from heaven, we are told, sat upon each of them; there were others there as we know, but I speak for the moment of the apostles. The Holy Spirit came into the company, and His sound filled the house where they were sitting, and He sat upon each of them. Peter in the power of that Spirit stood up and testified for Christ. Now that is the apostolic position; it was characterised by affection for Christ, by submission to the authority of the Scriptures, and energised by the Holy Spirit come down from heaven. That continued through the Acts, I might say, up to chapter 15. They were in complete identification with Christ, representing His authority here upon earth.
What I wish to show is that side by side with that there appeared a spontaneous element, which is represented in Barnabas. I am not overlooking the fact that Barnabas was called an apostle; he was an apostle in virtue rather of what he was morally than by official appointment; that is, he was
{176}
sympathetic with what was going on. Barnabas first appears in @Acts 4. We are told that he had lands and he sold them. Now we might have thought he sold them because he cared no longer for them; that, in the light of what was heavenly, brought in by the Spirit, he who had title to the earthly possessions surrendered them; but *that* is not the way in which the Spirit of God presents the matter to us. Barnabas had a true estimate of his property, I have no doubt, and did not undervalue it; we are told by the Spirit that he *sold* his lands. Why did he do that? Clearly because he saw that he could use the price for the furtherance of the testimony. He was taken up with the testimony, and he brought the money and laid it at the apostles¬ feet. That is to say, he recognised the authority of the Lord in His apostles. They were there with power to administer, and he brought to them what he had; he had land, he sold it, and devoted the money to the service of the testimony. It was not exactly Levitical service, although he was a Levite; his gift was not spiritual for the moment.
You will recall how in Israel the Levites were divided into two classes: there were those who carried the holy things upon their shoulders, and there were those who had waggons. I take Barnabas¬ gift in a sense to be a waggon; he recognised the necessities connected with the testimony, and he brought what he had got for his lands and laid it at the apostles¬ feet. What came to light in connection with his action indicates the Lord's appreciation of what he did. He was sympathetic with the testimony, and the apostles named him, his name had been Joseph, but they called him Barnabas -- "Son of consolation", @Acts 4:36. Now that is what I understand to be an evidence of his sympathy with the testimony.
As we proceed in the Acts you will find that the testimony moves on, and it is when the movement
{177}
takes place that Barnabas shines. He shone in connection with that which was official at Jerusalem, but the testimony moved on; and when we are genuinely moved in regard of Christ we shall follow the course of the testimony. The testimony moved out to *Antioch*. An independent action of the Spirit took place *there*. There were no apostolic labours bestowed upon Antioch, as far as we know, prior to the movement there, but chapters 11 and 13 show us that Levitical service, and, indeed, priestly service, had moved out among the gentiles. That was a great triumph for Christ. There were found at Antioch certain men who *ministered to the Lord* and fasted; that is, they were in the liberty of service outside of Jewish territory.
Now Barnabas, who was a "good man and full of the Holy Spirit", @Acts 11:24, recognised this work; he recognised the movement of the testimony and he was in complete sympathy with it. What did he do? He went down to Tarsus to seek out Saul. He was instinctively in the mind of God, and recognised what God had done, and how the testimony had moved. He sees that Saul is the man for the occasion; he goes to Tarsus to seek him out, and he takes him, not to *Jerusalem*, but to *Antioch*. Thus the testimony moved on, and correlatively the authority of Christ in the apostles, until we come to chapter 15. That is to say, the service of God was set up among the gentiles, and you will find in tracing these chapters that the Spirit of God pursues it until it is enshrined at Ephesus.
I make another remark in regard to Ephesus: the economy of the house of God is in connection with Ephesus. Timothy was at Ephesus when Paul wrote his first epistle to him, and it is this epistle above all others which should govern us in relation to the house of God. The house of God, beloved friends, is a heavenly institution. The
{178}
assembly at Ephesus was set up in the light of its heavenly position, and hence you have the true basis for the development of the house of God. The house of God is in the good of what is in heaven; the first mention of it in Scripture shows it was the connection between heaven and earth: @Genesis 28:17 - 19. We need to maintain the light of that in our souls; it is the sphere in which the affections of God flow; a heavenly institution upon earth, so that it was a question of Timothy's conduct there. We have to be regulated by heaven in regard to our conduct. So Timothy was to know how to conduct himself in the house of God, which was at the same time the assembly of the living God; it was also the place of strength -- "the pillar and base of the truth", @1 Timothy 3:15.
In this eighth chapter of Luke's gospel we have what in a measure corresponds with all that I have been saying; that is, we have the apostles; they are *with* the Lord; and then there are those also who represent the subjective state; the sympathy that would sustain the testimony. These had been benefited by Christ, and the names of some of them are given to us. It is said of them that they ministered to Him of their substance; they were in complete sympathy with His position in connection with the testimony.
I just refer for a moment to what follows in this chapter, and that is, the authority of the word. One might speak of it in another way, in connection with *sowing*, but I refer now to its *authority*. The fruit of the word is spoken of as a hundredfold; those who "in an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it". There is a peculiar touch here, which is confined to Luke's gospel. It is only in Luke that the *hundredfold* is spoken of. In the gospel of Matthew the result of the seed sown in the good ground is said to be an hundred, sixty, and
{179}
thirty. Matthew contemplates things *set up* in perfection and a perfect result -- an "hundredfold", but there is decline from a hundred to sixty, and from sixty to thirty; whereas in the gospel of Mark it is presented in the reverse order; that is, there is fruit, thirty, sixty, and an hundredfold. Mark presents increase of energy. Mark had at first failed as a servant (see @Acts 15:38), but having been restored he was stronger at the end than he was at the beginning. Now Luke gives the full and perfect result of the testimony of God in the soul of man; it is not a question of our responsibility in that respect, or of the history of the church. What he is presenting is the ministry of grace; the effect of the Lord's ministry. In other words, he is presenting the full testimony by Paul; the *word of God*. When Paul went out from Antioch, it was to preach "the word of God", and Luke shows us that the word of God produces a perfect result.
I now want to dwell a little on the "*light*" in regard to the word. "No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light". Now there cannot be light unless we are governed by the word. The Lord says, "Take heed therefore *how ye hear*". The man that brings forth fruit is the man who with an honest and good heart, having *heard the word*, keeps it. I need not say that no son of Adam has that; God alone can produce an honest and good heart. The Lord says, "having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience". I wish to emphasise the importance of the recognition of the word, for we cannot have the light unless we are regulated by the word. The word of God entering into an honest and good heart is kept with patience, and bears fruit an hundredfold;
{180}
and the result of that is that there *must* be light. Light is morally the character of God coming out in the christian.
I now pass on to where the Lord's relations are referred to. It is good to have the light in our souls of our relation with the Lord as the result of His death and resurrection. One cherishes the thought that we are the "brethren" of Christ, not only of Christ as risen from the dead, but we are the brethren of the One who could say, "I ascend" (@John 20:17), which in a certain sense is the most wonderful light that can possibly enter into the soul of a man. He who says, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father", also says, "My brethren". It is a divine Person speaking in the liberty of sonship. The Son has the full liberty of the house, and He can say, "I ascend"; and at the same time He associates us with Him as His brethren. I repeat, that no greater light can enter into the soul of man. But here in @Luke 8:21, we have the other side. The Lord says, "My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it". I am not introducing @John 20 into this passage; I referred to @John 20 as showing the full light of our place. One can see in the Acts that the Lord in the course of the testimony indicates, that the earthly relations were abandoned, and that the new circle took form at Antioch and Ephesus, where divine relationships were established, which were connected, not with an earthly system, as Jerusalem was, but with heaven. The enemy saw it, and he essayed, by introducing legality, to capture the glad tidings of that wonderful liberty of sonship in the presence of God which was enjoyed at Antioch; but the saints were mercifully preserved, so that we see the full light of it in Ephesus.
But how are we to be marked off *in this world* as related to Christ? The Lord's word is, "My mother and my brethren are these which hear the
{181}
word of God, and do it". We have to maintain clearly and distinctly in our souls our position as the result of the death and resurrection of Christ, and the Holy Spirit is given to us to that end. But what is to be the rule for us here upon earth? *The authority of the word;* the word of God is to be the rule for us, and it is to be *acted upon;* the Lord says, "these which *hear* the word of God, and *do* it". The Lord recognises those who hear and do it. You may ask me, *How* does He recognise them? *He comes to us;* He distinguishes us, He manifests Himself to us. The Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word"; and "I will love him and will manifest myself to him ... my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him", @John 14:21,23. We are marked off in that way as submitting ourselves to the word of God.
May the Lord bless these simple thoughts to us. It seems to me to be a great thing at the present time to be in sympathy with the testimony. Things are much reduced, but the Lord is moving on, and He takes account of the twos and threes of His people here and there who recognise the authority and rule of His word and are in sympathy with His testimony. It is not a question of numbers, though Scripture makes a great deal of the vast number of the *redeemed*, but evidently the great point for us as upon earth is the authority of God and His word. If there are but a few christians in a city who are governed by the word, you may depend upon it that the Lord will distinguish them by manifesting Himself to them, and they will be in sympathy with His testimony.
{182}
THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN THE BOOK OF ESTHER
@Esther 2:5 - 18; @Esther 10:3
There are three books in the Old Testament that bear a certain relation to each other, in each of which there is established a marital relation, and where we find that as a result of exercise and of God's dealings, it is evident that affection has to be brought into play. God acts upon us in two ways: upon our minds and upon our affections; and in the three books in question the latter is what the Spirit of God draws our attention to. I refer to the books of Ruth, Esther, and the Song of Songs.
I propose to take up the book of Esther, and especially to make clear the manner in which the Spirit of Christ is set forth in that book. There could be nothing so interesting as tracing the Spirit of Christ in the Scriptures; the Spirit of God delights to enlarge upon it. You will find it presented in a variety of ways, for in truth no other spirit shall obtain in God's world. It began with Abel. We are told that he was a keeper of sheep; that was the Spirit of Christ, for Christ is the great Shepherd; He keeps His sheep. When I speak of the Spirit of Christ you can easily perceive it is not a question of the Holy Spirit as we know Him at present; it is the Spirit of God expressed in a man. Now that involves a great deal. It is the nature and character of God finding its expression here upon earth, in a man; it is a wonderful thought. God by His Spirit garnished the heavens (@Job 26:13); but His Spirit was to take form in a man, and it was indicated from the outset that the man that should obtain in the presence of God should be controlled by that Spirit. Any other spirit is obnoxious to God, so that we are told that, "If any one has not the
{183}
Spirit of Christ he is not of him", @Romans 8:9. It is a very solemn thing to consider that if devoid of the Spirit of Christ we are absolutely outside the pale of christianity viewed essentially, be our profession what it may, but the Spirit of Christ possessing us renders us acceptable to God and to man. That was seen in Jesus; He found favour with God and also with man. I do not say with the natural man, but with man according to God. Men who have divine instincts appreciate the Spirit of Christ.
Now I want to show how that Spirit is traced in the book of Esther; I shall dwell more particularly on Esther as the object, as it were, of the Spirit of Christ. I speak of Mordecai as also expressive of the Spirit of Christ, but he is more than that; we may all express the Spirit of Christ, but in Mordecai we have also a type of Christ.
The first point I would call attention to is a very important principle which is established in chapter 1. Mordecai does not appear there; it is a gentile scene, but there is a principle established which I may say governs God's world; namely, that a man should bear rule in his own house, and that he should speak in his own tongue; in other words, that his rule should be perfectly intelligible in house. That was the decree issued by the king; see verse 22, and it was universal. In order to seize the import of the book, we have to gather up the instruction in the preface, and that is what we find there: a man should rule his own house. We may apply this principle to the Lord Jesus; it is evident that He rules His own house, and speaks in His own language; that is, His articulations are perfectly intelligible to His house. No one can make himself understood as the Lord does, and He rules His own house.
Following upon that we may see how Christ is in type set forth in Mordecai. In the first place,
{184}
we are told that he sat in the king's gate, and that there he defended the throne. You may think that these are strange thoughts to put into a book in which the name of God is absent, but the book describes certain conditions under which the people of God were found; they were driven out from their inheritance and from Jerusalem; they were far away from the land of promise, and were scattered throughout the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of the Medes and Persians.
Now those conditions enable the Spirit of God to present that which is for our comfort; that is, that on the one hand God is ruling in favour of His people providentially, and on the other hand the Spirit of Christ is active in their behalf, although not acting among them *officially*. There was neither priest nor Levite, tabernacle of witness, nor ark of the covenant; all were absent, but the Spirit of Christ was there, and the people of God can never be deprived of that; it shone in Mordecai; he sat in the king's gate, and as there he protected the throne. You will find in the end of the chapter, verse 21, that there were those who conspired against the king, and Mordecai had the matter exposed and the offenders brought to justice. One could enlarge on how that spirit shone in Christ: how every right of God's throne was defended by Him, how He went into death in order to overthrow the enemies of the throne, and how completely He has overthrown them! But I must pass on.
The next thing we find in Mordecai is his absolute refusal to recognise Haman the Agagite. That also is the Spirit of Christ. It shone in Him personally; He refused the Agagite at every point. We are all more or less acquainted with Agag the Amalekite, of whom Haman was the representative. Haman had gained great ascendancy in the empire, and that is a marked illustration of our own day.
{185}
We see that order of man in the place of rule today, and he has attained a wonderful position of ascendancy. Now what I would especially point out is the refusal on the part of Mordecai to bow to him. He sat in the gate; he defended the king; but never would he recognise the Amalekite. Haman represents a principle or element that dominates the christianised world. I want to make it as practical as I can for we all have to do with him. His boast was the multitude of his children, chapter 5:11; it was one of the leading features of his greatness, and there are ten of them specially mentioned by the Spirit. I need not enlarge on that. Now here is an exile Jew under reproach, yet sitting in the gate without any outward support, and he refuses to bow to Haman. Die he might, but recognise Haman? Never! That is the Spirit of Christ.
Now I want to show you how that Spirit acted towards the people of God, for you may rely upon it that that which defends the throne, that which refuses satanic power, will take care of what is of God. These two things go together, and we find that what illustrates the character of Mordecai more than anything is his attitude towards Esther.
In my apprehension of the book, Esther refers to the remnant of the people of God as they then were. Her father and mother were dead. We have to do with conditions that are exceedingly like this. God will not own the public body today; He hides His face from it. One can easily see that from the addresses to the assemblies in the book of Revelation; but I only just state here that the public body is no longer owned of God. It has become a huge Babylonish system dominated by the spirit of Haman, whose children and the multitude of whose sons are distinguished therein. But has God abandoned His people? Never! God is unchangeable. He is ordering things in our favour, and you may depend
{186}
upon it that all the political movements in the world are guided providentially in our favour. The more you know of God the more you can pray to Him in regard of the world, for He is the sovereign Ruler of the world. He never gives up that place, and He rules it on behalf of His people. He is hidden behind the scenes, but He has His eye upon us, and correlatively the Spirit of Christ is active, although not *officially*. It is useless and unsuitable to pretend to officialism today; the day is over for that. In the ruined condition of things there is no officialism, but the Spirit of Christ remains. Thank God for that! I am sure every soul in this room has been conscious of, and affected by, the Spirit of Christ as active here upon earth.
As I have already remarked, Esther may be taken to represent the remnant of God's people. She is deprived of her parents, and is in a state of orphanage, and what we find is that Mordecai comes forward. Now the light of God entering the soul is intended to produce movement. If the light is received there must be movement, and directly you are moved by the light, you have to abandon certain things that you have leaned upon for protection. You are deprived, speaking morally, of your parents, of all that which supported you naturally. Well, Mordecai comes forward, and he takes Esther, and he not only provides for her in his house, but he takes her to be his daughter; there is affection. He may have had a sense of obligation to look after her, but it was affection that led him to take her to be his daughter.
It is a touching thing that you find affection springing up in the heart of Christ which is ready to express itself on your behalf so that you suffer no loss for what you have lost naturally. But further, he not only takes her to be his daughter, he would promote her. The Lord Jesus Christ is set for your
{187}
promotion. He is set for the promotion of the whole assembly. Without coming forward in what one may call an *official* way, He acts for the promotion of His own. Now that is a wonderful thing to be going on for us at the present time, and in this world too. As to the type which I am dwelling on here, it is not a question of who sat upon the throne; it was in fact a gentile potentate, but that is not the point. It was the *throne;* the throne of God really, and the Spirit of Christ in Mordecai was set for the promotion of Esther, *of God's people*, and on account of that they have to go through a certain course of experience or exercise.
Now Mordecai had light. It is a great thing to have light, a great thing to know what to do. Many christians are hampered because they do not know just what to do. Mordecai understood the situation and recognised the elements that were available, and what would be for the advantage of Esther. There was Hegai, the keeper of the women, a notable man; one who was acquainted with all that was in the house of the women. Without making things too literal, I am free, in using them as types, to say that the Holy Spirit is acquainted with all the resources of the house, and with all that there is for our advantage, and I think that the Holy Spirit is set forth typically in Hegai as taking account of Esther. She *found favour with him*, and as she progressed in her experience in the palace she was wise enough to recognise him; she declined to take anything save that which he prescribed.
Now I use these things as illustrations. The Holy Spirit is acquainted with all that is in the house, and He endows you with that which makes you presentable, so that coming forth as clothed, and adorned, and perfumed by Him, you are presentable; and as you are presentable you are promotable; you must be presentable in order to
{188}
be promotable. Esther was fair to look upon by nature, I dare say, but she became more desirable by the attentive service of the keeper of the house of the women; and finally she is *presented* to the king. I do not enlarge upon that, although a good deal might be put into it; but the result is that she is not only presented to the king, but she obtains the place of honour; she is the queen! Now that was a wonderful feat to accomplish. Mordecai was a wonderful man, as we shall see further on, but here it was a wonderful feat, to place a lonely orphan, as queen upon the throne of the Persians! But what the Lord Jesus Christ accomplishes with every believer is greater. We may think lightly of it, but it is a wonderful thing to be placed presentable before the king, and it was all the fruit of the affection and wisdom of Mordecai.
Now I pass on to the last chapter, because, after all, whilst the Spirit delights to set forth the effect of Christ's work, His great aim is to bring in the glory of Christ. You can never reach the divine end unless you apprehend the glory of Christ, and Christ reaches the pinnacle of glory whatever be the road He travels. In every path which the Lord takes up He reaches that end, and what we find here in type is that He reaches it by His prowess. That is to say, it is not presented in an official way. What we have set forth here in Mordecai is Christ in the exercise of His care for His people, and His wisdom in carrying it out. Ultimately Mordecai comes into recognition in the empire, and Esther greatly aided him in that. You may say, that in applying the types to Christ, it detracts from the glory of Christ to imply that we might aid Him in reaching this wonderful position; but what I mean is, that as we are adorned by the adornment of Christ we *commend* Him.
I desire to be exceedingly guarded in what I say,
{189}
but it was Mordecai who had put Esther in her place of honour, so there can be no question as to who was the greater of the two. And if the Lord Jesus Christ has adorned you with His graces, what is the effect? He is made known in public. By whom? By you and by me. One great point in the holy city in Revelation is that she is "the Lamb's wife", @Revelation 21:9. But it was He who *formed* her. The heavenly city is the product of Christ, the product of His quickening power, and she is the Lamb's wife. The Lamb is the sufferer; it implies the Lord Jesus Christ in rejection. God honours Him, and His wife comes down from heaven adorned with His graces. She, too, honours Him, and what He has made her promotes His glory. As it is said of the wise woman in @Proverbs 31:23, "Her husband is known in the gates". And so I may say here as to the type, Esther becomes the means of Mordecai's exaltation, and eventually Mordecai appears as next unto the king.
Now God has exalted Christ to His right hand. Before ever the assembly existed historically the Lord was placed in the highest pinnacle of glory, in the right of His own Person, in the virtue of His own work, apart from the assembly, apart from the saints. But it is a wonderful thing, to my mind, to see how that His own formative work here upon earth sets forth His glory in another way. The product of His quickening power brings into the universe that which is the living expression of Himself. But personally He is rejected, He is the sufferer, and so she descends out of heaven as the bride, the *Lamb's* wife. I think if there is anything that I shall cherish in that day it is, that as the result of His own quickening power, I add something to His glory. He is praised in His own works; they promote His glory. We find later in the book that Esther made known to the king that Mordecai was
{190}
related to her, and as a result Mordecai became supreme, universally influential in the empire of the Medes.
Hoping that I have made clear what is in my mind as regards the Spirit of Christ as set forth here, I want just to dwell upon what marked Mordecai at the end. He is said to be "next to king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews". He had not previously been great among them evidently, but he had *acquired* a greatness among them. That has a peculiar application to our day. The term Jew, I take it, has reference to the people as coming under reproach. It was not a term known in Solomon's day, it came in later. From the use of the word in the addresses to the assemblies it seems to refer in our day to what is genuine. There are those "who say that they are Jews, and are not", @Revelation 2:9. We want to find the *Jews*, beloved friends, the genuine ones; and what we find is that Christ is great among them.
I am sure it is to our advantage to recognise that the Lord has a great place among us. He ought to have a great place among us. I am not speaking of His death, of all that He has accomplished for the assembly and for the universe, but of what He has accomplished for *ourselves*. What has He not achieved for us! Hence He has obtained a supreme place amongst us. If you have come into contact with Him in your soul, He acquires a *great* place with you. It is said of Mordecai that he was "great among the Jews". I trust that the Lord Jesus Christ is *great among us*. We cannot add to His greatness. He is far above all principalities and powers in the heavens, but He also becomes great to us, through His care for us and His interest in us.
Then He is acceptable to all His *brethren*. I need not say that we have that place. Genuine christians
{191}
are the only true Jews upon earth today, and genuine christians are the only true brethren that the Lord Jesus Christ has upon earth. And "he is accepted", we are told, "of the multitude of his brethren".
Then we read that He is "seeking the welfare of his people"; their deliverance was complete. We can thank God for every deliverance. Every deliverance is the result of the Lord's interest, but besides that He 'seeks our wealth'. You may be delivered and yet be poor. Many nations have obtained deliverance and have become poor through it. These Jews, who were scattered throughout the empire were *delivered*. Mordecai had effected complete deliverance for them, but they needed to be made wealthy. Now Mordecai is said to be seeking the *wealth* of his people. I do not think that we should be poor. It is true that the Spirit of God in Zephaniah refers to the remnant as "an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord" (@Zephaniah 3:12); but the Lord is seeking to promote our wealth in His own riches. He who was rich for our sakes became poor, that we through His poverty might be enriched. The Lord has never given up that; it is not His thought to leave us poor; He is seeking the wealth of His people.
To proceed a little on that line; if the Lord brings you into wealth spiritually, what is the result? I am speaking in a very practical way. You can afford to bring a bullock if you are wealthy; that is to say, the wealth that He endows us with reverts back to God. I do not know anything in the book of Ruth, for instance, more interesting than that the result of her union with Boaz was a *worshipper;* Obed was a worshipper. You may depend upon it that Obed was a wealthy man, for his father was wealthy, and the wealth of the father, we may be sure, descended to the son. Your worship will be
{192}
greatly limited unless you are spiritually wealthy. I repeat, that the Lord seeks the wealth of His people, and, if *you* are wealthy spiritually you have something to bring to God when you come to Him. You come with a bullock. A bullock was a very large offering, and could only be offered by one who owned one. You could not offer a borrowed one; the bullock must belong to you; and so, when you are wealthy, you draw near to God with a bullock, and God gets His portion, and the saints get theirs.
Finally we read of Mordecai, that he was "speaking peace to all his seed". I suppose we may be regarded as "his seed" in that light, for the saints are viewed in different ways. We are Jews as genuine; we are Christ's brethren; and we are His seed. The Lord regards us in all these lights, and the Spirit of God closes with this presentation of Mordecai -- he was "speaking peace to all his seed".
May the Lord continue to speak peace to us! The seed of the righteous will never beg bread, @Psalm 37:25; will never suffer loss, but it is a wonderful thing that the Lord speaks peace to us. If you hear the voice of trouble, you may depend upon it that it is not the *Lord's* voice. The voice of trouble is very prevalent, muttering discontent; but it is not the voice of the Spirit of Christ. The Lord speaks peace to us, and wherever His Spirit prevails it is the Spirit of peace. We are told that the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of those that make peace.
I think you will see from what I have said that this book sets forth in some way the conditions in which we find ourselves; the resources that are available for us in Christ; and how intensely active the Lord is, as I have been showing, not officially, but as *speaking peace*. It seems to me it is continuous; there is the speaking of peace to all His seed, and that will continue to the end.
{193}
May the Lord bless His word to us! What one feels is the great need, for young christians especially, to apprehend what is for them in Christ, and how constant and enduring it is.
{194}
AFFECTION AND INTELLIGENCE
@Numbers 27:1 - 11; @Numbers 36:1 - 13
I hope to be brief in conveying a thought before me. I wish to show how the Spirit of God views God's people in this book in relation to the inheritance. You will recall the two numberings of the people. All the males of twenty years old and upwards; those who were able to go forth to war, were numbered twice. At first they were numbered as having reached manhood, and as having been placed in relation to the testimony in the wilderness; see chapter 2:1. In chapter 26, you get the second numbering, when the people are taken account of, not only to support the testimony, but to enter on the inheritance. The type of the brazen serpent and springing well intervened between these numberings. That indicates that the people are to be taken account of as possessing the Spirit and being according to purpose.
The distinction between the two numberings is important, but I do not dwell on that. In the second numbering they are taken account of according to purpose, and not according to responsibility. The old man having, in type, been crucified, and the Spirit given, they are suitable for the land of promise. The people as from twenty years old and upwards are viewed in the light of manhood, and the male side being viewed gives the idea of the saints as formed in intelligence, and thus the inheritance is taken up in this way; it is to be entered into intelligently. "Twenty years old and upward" (@Numbers 26:2) refers to believers as having the Spirit, that is, as *matured*. I do not refer to the *work* of the Spirit, but God takes account of every believer who possesses the Spirit as having reached manhood; and thus
{195}
as being qualified to take up the inheritance, and each one has a place there.
The blessed God has specially designed a place for you in His land; there is a definite place for you there. There is ample room there, and we are not placed there promiscuously; we are placed according to divine appointment. All is ordered according to sovereign wisdom. We may have a place in the kingdom, but divine wisdom will control everything, and I need not add that no believer would have it otherwise. The place He has designed for you is the best possible place for you, for He is perfect in wisdom and love.
The daughters of Zelophehad bring in the *female* side which sets forth the subjective side. The people had despised the pleasant land, notwithstanding the testimony to it in the grapes of Eshcol. God resents despisal of what He gives. Christendom is in this position; it is essentially infidel in regard to God and heaven. We must not stop short of the full height of what God has prepared for us. We are warned against an evil heart of unbelief.
Now in these women I see appreciation of the inheritance given of God. They come forward to lay claim to the inheritance of their father. God delights in His people drawing near to appreciate what He offers. Canaan was prepared for Israel, and they were taken account of to possess it; these women appreciated God's gift, and God delighted in their appreciation of it. They came to seek and substantiate their inheritance. All real prayer is on that line. Why is so much made of prayer in Scripture? It is because God loves to see the result of His *own work* in us. Christ died to make the inheritance ours. He went to infinite cost to secure it for us, and He loves to see our appreciation of it.
I see the importance of @Numbers 27 as following on chapter 26. It is the *state* of the people. Why
{196}
are they not like their fathers who died at Kadesh-barnea? Typically, in the brazen serpent, the man after the flesh had been set aside, and now there is a *new state*. The springing well sets forth the gift of the Spirit. The flesh despises the things of God, but the flesh is condemned; the brazen serpent was lifted up, and what follows is that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled; it is fulfilled by those who have the Spirit; but more, by the Spirit there is appreciation of the inheritance, of the purpose of God. These women represent the subjective state which would lay claim to the inheritance given of God; so God *commends* them. He says, "The daughters of Zelophehad *speak right*". God will always commend the effect of the work of His Spirit. God commends what is the spontaneous result of the Spirit's work in us. Prayer and worship are spontaneous, and God delights in these. So God fully commends the demand of these women. He says, they "speak right", and there is made thereon a statute in Israel, that "If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter" (verse 8). God establishes a law, a statute, on the ground of the spontaneous result of the workings of His Spirit in His people. It is as if God would say, The results of the exercises in My people by the Spirit are entirely in accord with My mind. Thus there is perfect agreement between the mind of God and the mind of the believer as *wrought upon* by the Spirit. They are in perfect accord. Well, the inheritance is secured to these women in answer to their demand. It is not only secured to them by the purpose of God, but by its being *made over* to them.
I pass on now to chapter 36. The point in this chapter is the question of marriage, whom they were to marry. The intelligent side now comes forward. The chief fathers of the families of Joseph
{197}
come near and speak before Moses. The question is raised as to the inheritance of the daughters of Zelophehad passing to another tribe in the event of their being married to any of the sons of the other tribes of Israel. The affection side must be regulated by the intelligence side. The word of the Lord was: "The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. This is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry". Things must be kept within divine limits. The inheritance is not to pass out of its own tribe. Marriage is a type which sets forth the relation of God's people to divine Persons.
Oftentimes people enter on the inheritance and have it confirmed to them; they are endowed in that way, but the affections suitable to it are not regulated. These women had the inheritance of their fathers confirmed to them, but the question now is, how are their affections to be regulated? You have to be very careful as to where your heart is moving. You may be moving out of your orbit, and, as it were, carrying your inheritance with you out of your tribe. If the inheritance is ours we have to see to it that in the affections of our hearts it is not diverted from *Christ*. We want to see to it that our affections are *undivided;* that is, that all that has come to us as the result of the death of Christ in the gospel is kept connected *with Christ*. The inheritance must not pass out of the tribe. The church took up other husbands than the divinely appointed One. Marriage in Scripture was often between relatives, as, for instance, in the cases of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Abraham's wife was his relative, so too was Isaac's and Jacob's. In God's ordering marriage ought to be on equal grounds. In regard to the church, she is suitable to Christ,
{198}
because as in association with Him she is of *His rank*. In the case of Joseph, which is different in type, it is a gentile bride which is in view. These women were not to marry outside their father's house. They married their uncle's sons so that the inheritance might not be diverted from its tribe.
The history of the church is that she -- that is, the responsible church -- has carried into the world that with which the Lord adorned her. She ought to have preserved what was of God within its own circle. We have to be jealous of our hearts so that our affections may not be diverted from *Christ*. He is the only legitimate Husband. Boaz purchased Ruth; he redeemed her; and no other had any title to her. He did not marry her as a Moabitess, but as a redeemed one; and there is no other claimant to us save the Lord Jeans Christ. So He is the legitimate Husband of His people. If we have our affections kept towards Him, all that He has endowed us with *remains* to Him. Speaking in a large sense, the heavenly city will come out fully endowed and adorned, but every element of glory which will mark her is *Christ*. It all belongs to Him. As recognising the claims of Christ, all He has endowed us with must be kept for Him.
I have great exercise as to the affections. Wherever you get *son* or *daughter* in Scripture it is an appeal to the affections. Our affections are appealed to, and all is in view of being brought to *rest*. It is the rest of affection in the marital relation to Christ. You accord your affections to Christ; you surrender them to Him absolutely, and you recognise, that He and He only has a right over you.
{199}
HOW THE FULL TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL IS REACHED
@Deuteronomy 33:1 - 25
My thought is to show that the blessing here outlined in regard to Israel's tribes may be viewed as a foreshadowing of the way in which the believer now comes into the full truth of the gospel; that is, that the blessing of each tribe sets forth some phase or stage of the blessings of christianity.
I take the liberty of using it in that way, knowing full well that it refers to God's people Israel. I am encouraged in doing so, knowing that the principle of His ways do not vary, and so His ways with Israel serve as a type of His ways with us. I shall have to take up the subject in a superficial way, for it is very great, and I can only give a very general idea.
First of all I remark, that it is the blessing of Moses the man of God. Jacob called his sons together, and he conveyed to them what should befall them in the latter days, and not in the way of blessing, although you cannot exclude that. But Moses speaks *only* of the blessing of the people. Moses is a figure of Christ. He is said to be a "man of God" (verse 1), and he was "king in Jeshurun" (verse 5). These two expressions apply absolutely to Christ. He is pre-eminently the Man of God, and He is the King. Having accomplished redemption, the Lord Jesus Christ is in the position of King, and hence He is able to bless. It is of all moment that we should apprehend Christ in this way. The Lord Jesus Christ when He came here carried out every divine thought, cost what it might, even unto death. He is "king in Jeshurun", not officially, but as indicative of the present moment. He is King to the tribes when gathered together. Well, He is there and ready to bless.
{200}
Now the blessings recorded in this chapter are what is in His heart for *us*. Christ has borne the curse, He has borne the full weight of God's judgment as due to the people for their wickedness and corruption. All the judgment due on that account fell upon Jesus. He went into death for it, and He glorified God in regard of it in every respect. Now the answer to that is the glory that shines out in the form of blessing. In this blessing of Moses you have the Lord indicated as in the position in which He can bless, and the outline of blessing is given in connection with each tribe. The first is "Let Reuben live, and not die". He deserved to die. The Lord Jesus Christ died, and it is in the mind of God that man should not die. Man became a fountain of corruption, but the Lord bore the judgment, and now the attitude of God towards man is *life*. "Let Reuben live, and not die". The Lord is in relation to man. He is the Son of man and He has discharged every liability of man, and now His thought is that man should *live*.
The next is Judah. "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah". If the light of the gospel enters your soul, it will produce a *cry;* it will produce an articulation from your soul, for it is evident that God must begin there. It is like the state of creation when chaos marked it. If the light of God enters your soul, it reveals a state of corruption which is appalling, but it is with a view to life. God commands the light; the light is in the face of Jesus. If the light shines into your heart, you see the corruption, and you cry; hence in *Judah* you get "Hear, Lord, the *voice* of Judah". That cry enters heaven, and the hearing of it in heaven gives you recognition there; you are taken notice of; you are *known* in *heaven* as having cried. Repentance has taken place; you are undone; you have no hope save in God. That is the true effect of the
{201}
light of the gospel. God, the source of the light, is the only One who can help you. Thus it is "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah". And what next? "Bring him unto his people". You want to be alone when you cry, but you do not need to *remain* alone. Isolation is only for the *leper*. The Lord Jesus Christ found a leper in his isolation and He touched him, and the leper was cleansed, and as cleansed he was fit for the congregation. No one need remain a leper; God goes out to the leper in His grace; the leper was outside the camp. Isaiah was a leper; he was "unclean" (@Isaiah 6:5); but the seraphim flew *swiftly* to relieve his need. If you are exercised, God will hear your cry, and then the next thing is, God brings you to your *people*. You are cleansed, and you do not need to remain isolated. You had been a leper, but as cleansed you are to come to your *own* people.
So next we come to *Levi*. Levi has *found* his own people, and he disclaims his natural relations. God brings you to your people, and, finding them, you no longer turn to or regard your relations after the flesh as your people. Hence Levi is separated to God. You can see how that takes place in the history of the believer. You are not *asked* to drop your natural relationships, but you find another circle, so that you, in a sense, disregard natural relationships; you say to your father and mother, "I have not seen him". I do not dwell on that further. This is followed by "they have observed thy word". They value God's word.
Now I pass on to Benjamin, "The beloved of the Lord". Clearly we are advancing here. Levi kept God's word and His covenant, and hence Benjamin is the "beloved of the Lord". Is it not wonderful that you, a believer, should have that place? "The Lord shall cover him all the day long". Have you become acquainted with this phase of blessing?
{202}
It is more than merely "live, and not die", but that, as in separation to God and to the people of God, and as you are governed by His word, you come into the consciousness of what *Christ* is to God, and of what *you* are to God. He "shall dwell in safety by him". Safety is nowhere else; safety is in dwelling with God. God is the protector of His people; "God is known in her palaces for a refuge", @Psalm 48:3. Who can touch you if you dwell where God is? "The Lord shall cover him all the day long". What a wonderful place to dwell in, the place of strength!
I can only barely touch on Joseph. "Blessed of the Lord be his land". There we have *the place;* heaven is touched. "For the precious things of heaven, ... the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon". The precious things of heaven and of the sun, that which flows from the sun in heaven, and of the moon; the good of it all is for the man who was "separated from his brethren".
Then you come to Zebulun. "Rejoice ... in thy going out". The believer is now prepared for testimony, and so he dwells in a *tent;* this latter is set forth in Issachar -- "and, Issachar, in thy tents". That is what is suitable for those who are identified with the testimony. Zebulun and Issachar are at the source of wealth. They dwell on the seashore. They can "suck of the abundance of the seas" and "treasures hid in the sand". They were men who had great wealth, and they have liberty, they go "in and out". They are prepared to sacrifice too. "There they shall offer sacrifices", and they can *afford* to do so. They sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness. A believer can give his body for the brethren, and if he has wealth he can place it at the disposal of his brethren.
The next is Gad. The blessing of Gad shows
{203}
*enlargement*. "Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm". I do not venture to enlarge upon that save to show that as you advance on the line of the gospel you are enlarged. "He executed the justice of the Lord, and his judgments with Israel" (verse 21). There is power for righteous discrimination. Believers require what we get here in Gad. "In a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated" and "his judgments were with Israel". We require a Gad. The divine economy requires the spirit of judgment, not in the sense of government, but in the sense of discrimination. For that you require a Gad. "He came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord". These things all came out in Christ. They are all wrapped up in the gospels, and what should mark the believer is the spirit of discernment.
Then see verse 22: "Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan". That is divine strength and agility which are very important in connection with the divine testimony on earth.
Then Naphtali comes to the *supreme* blessing. Put your own name in there. "O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the Lord". Not only is every need of your heart met, but your heart is perfectly *satisfied*, and satisfied with *favour*. "O Naphtali, satisfied with favour ... possess thou the west and the south". Such a man is qualified to take up the inheritance, surely.
Then we come to Asher. "Let Asher be blessed with children"; that is multiplication. "Let him be acceptable to his brethren". This latter is a very important element. Children in the Old Testament were an evidence of divine favour, and will be so in the future. In our dispensation it is a question of *spiritual* fruitfulness. We do not want to cut across the consciences of our brethren. It is well for us that we have our brethren. They will
{204}
take care of us; and it is well that we should be acceptable to them. 'Foot dipped in oil'; that is the evangelist; but you do not use your foot until you are acceptable to your brethren. The foot dipped in oil is the tread of a spiritual man.
It is well for us that we have our brethren; we want to be acceptable to our brethren. It is a wonderful thing to find the brethren and to study to be acceptable to them. It is a wonderful tread the step of a man whose foot is dipped in oil. The Lord Jesus is the true example of it. We read: "Jesus increased ... in favour with God and man" (@Luke 2:52). No man in the world could walk like that. In Luke the point is how He *talked*, and in John it is how He *walked*. All His movements were acceptable. They were the movements of a Man anointed by the Spirit; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened upon Him. In John it is not how He talked, but how He walked. He was the true Asher. The Spirit of God begins with the *feet* of the preacher. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace", @Isaiah 52:7. He goes after the sheep on the dark mountains. Christ was the true Asher and we may walk in His steps. I have no confidence in the preacher who has not "beautiful feet".
I have preached in view of a company of christians. I do not want you to stop short of one feature of what is in the heart of the Lord as blessing for you. If we are in the "fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ" (@Romans 15:29) then our ways and our walk will be after the pattern of Christ.
May the Lord bless His word to each of us.
{205}
THE INWARD AND OUTWARD EFFECT OF THE SPIRIT
@John 20:17; @Acts 2:1 - 4,41 - 47
I want to speak of the Spirit given to the saints in their relations *Godward* for the satisfaction of God's heart, and the Spirit given to the saints in their relations *manward;* in other words, the "*inward*" and the "*outward*".
It is important that we should see that there is the inward aspect; that is, that which is for God's heart, and there is also the outward aspect, which is for man; the two lines are seen respectively in John and in Luke. That which comes out in the saints is first of all seen in Christ.
In John you have the Lord as Son, and the Spirit comes to Him in that relation; that is, the Spirit comes to the Lord in John in relation to His *Person*. What is said of the Spirit is that He descended and *abode* upon Him; that is to say, the Spirit of God found a permanent resting place in the Son. The Son is for God. In the Son God rests. The Spirit had hovered over humanity for centuries in the activity of grace, but like the dove sent out of the ark by Noah in @Genesis 8, had found no resting place; but now the Spirit found a *permanent* resting place in the Son. John brings out what is for God's affections.
I am not saying that John limits himself to that, but that is evidently the prominent thought before him, and the saints in John's gospel are seen in the same connection. You will find that the Spirit in John has, in the main, though not entirely, reference to us *inwardly*. I am not overlooking the fact of the anointing in John's epistle, and there it is connected with teaching, whereas anointing is generally connected with what is external. But the way in which
{206}
the Spirit is presented in John has reference to what is *internal*. In chapter 4 the Spirit is viewed internally as that which springs up in affection towards divine Persons. He is the living water. The effect of that is seen in chapter 7, in what is external in the way of water flowing out, but it all flows *from the internal*. "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (@John 7:38) and then in chapter 20, He is the Spirit of life, and that is internal.
Now what I gather from John's gospel is that the Son becoming Man is for God's affections; God has rested in that Person, and the effect of His work, of His ministry, is that there is a company produced of His kind whom He regards as His "brethren". That is what I consider to be the internal aspect of the assembly; what is formed in relationship with divine Persons. What I am coming to presently is the anointed vessel here before men, but evidently the primary conception of the assembly is that it is *for God*. There is a company formed after the pattern of Christ; a company viewed as great enough to be accorded the place of His companions. They are companions of Christ, not only as raised from the dead, but as the ascended One. The message He sends to them is, "I ascend to my Father", that is, He, the Son, the object of His Father's affections. He is in all the liberty of sonship, and He has title to ascend to the highest point in the house. What a wonderful position, beloved friends, to see in a *Man*! And He says, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend [not to *heaven*, but] to *my Father*, and your Father, and to my God and your God". It is to heaven, of course, but the *point* is that He is the Son, and as the Son He has title to ascend. He might have remained upon the earth, but He goes on high to the Father, and in going on high He associates the saints with Himself where He has gone; that is to say, God has
{207}
now extended the circle to which His affections apply. The Spirit not only descended upon the Son, but it *remained* upon Him. In the other gospels the Spirit descends as a dove and comes upon Him, but in John is added, that He *abode* upon Him.
We should get into our souls that the Son is the divine resting place for God; the Spirit rests there. God has, as it were, at last found a resting place; a permanent resting place for His affections -- and those affections will never again be disturbed. I have no doubt Adam was an object of God's affections. He is called the son, or offspring, of God in @Luke 3, and as such he was an object of God's affections, but those affections were violently disturbed. Adam left his place, and God found no sabbath on earth from Adam's day until the Lord Jesus Christ appeared on earth. God's sabbath was broken. He had to work instead of resting in Adam, who was the inaugurated head of creation; everything was put into his hands, as if God had delegated everything to Adam. He was head of the race, and all should have stood connected with the head under God's eye for His pleasure, but all that was broken up. God's sabbath was broken up, and it was never renewed until the Son became Man, and *then* you have God's sabbath, beloved friends, never again to be disturbed, because it is in *the Son*, and whatever takes form in the Son is there permanently. If God rests in the Son, of necessity that rest can never be broken or disturbed. I want you to *see* that.
If you would understand the position of Christ here upon earth you must contrast Him with all that went before. God found no resting place before. The Spirit was here like Noah's dove; He found no resting place until Christ appeared, and then He *remained* on Him. That Man has brought in a
{208}
generation after His own pattern. They have no part, it is needless to say, in His deity. He is alone in that; equal with the Father, but He has brought in a company after His own kind and pattern *as Man;* those whom He calls His brethren.
No greater light can enter our souls than the light conveyed in the message by Mary Magdalene. No greater light can enter into the souls of men than that the Lord Jesus Christ, as the ascending One, should send us a message and designate us as His brethren. It is the very foundation of christianity viewed *inwardly*. I am not overlooking atonement, which is, of course, the foundation of everything, for the foundations of the tabernacle were in sockets of silver; the *foundations* were in silver, but I am speaking of the divine formation, the inward formation, which hinges on Christ as the ascended Man. Christianity is a heavenly conception. We are brought in as the companions of the heavenly Man, and as such we are the objects of the Father's love. That is John's point of view. What you get in @John 20 is not the Spirit as the anointing but the Spirit of *life*, and not simply the Spirit of life, but the Spirit of the *Man* who had ascended up, for in principle the Lord's coming into the midst was as the ascended Man. The message was to prepare and qualify them for the visit, and He came in following on the message: the message constituted them great enough for the visit. They were qualified for such a visit by the light conveyed by the message. The Lord came in to communicate to them His own Spirit. He breathed on them. I think those touching verses, 19 to 22, have their own significance; it is a question of relationship. The Lord breathes into them. He breathes the Spirit into them. He says: "Receive the Holy Spirit", @John 20:22. That gave the character of what they received, for it was His Spirit. We have not only the light conveyed in the
{209}
message, but we have the power by which we are maintained in accord with the light.
Now Luke presents to us the *anointed* Man. There it is not exactly God's resting place; the Lord is seen there as *praying;* being baptised He prayed, @Luke 4. Evidently that is another view; that is to say, Luke presents to us *the Man*. He is in man's place throughout. He submits to baptism, and when He comes out of baptism He is praying. Wonderful spectacle for heaven! There is a Man in accord with heaven. He is dependent. The Lord Jesus Christ introduced into this world what may be called the principle of heaven, and a taste for the principles of heaven. He taught the disciples to pray, "Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven", @Matthew 6:10. He introduced the principle of obedience. It is the Lord Jesus Christ here in entire dependence upon His God. I take that to be manna. That is, I think, the "bread", the "food of angels". In @Psalm 78:25 we read that God opened the windows of heaven and rained down manna, "angels¬ food", upon them. Angels¬ food was rained upon earth. It refers to Christ in the place of obedience; it was a question of obedience. The Lord Jesus Christ was here before the eyes of men and He was praying. He was in the position of obedience, and especially of dependence upon God. And the Holy Spirit comes upon Him; in other words, the Holy Spirit anointed *that* Man. He was manifestly qualified to be anointed. He was praying, and He was anointed by the Spirit. Now what Luke presents to us are the external evidences of the anointing; the external evidences of the coming of the Spirit upon Christ.
In chapter 4 the Lord stands before men and He says: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me", @Luke 4:18. That is Luke's line. He presents to us in that way what is for God, but it is *before men*. That was a wonderful spectacle for God, but it was for Him *before men;*
{210}
and hence Luke enlarges upon the character of the Vessel. The Lord begins to speak, and what the Spirit dwells upon is the *character* of the speaking. The book of the prophet Esaias is handed to Him, and He stands up to read. There was a Man standing up to read the Scriptures in the power of the Spirit. A wonderful scene! The scribes were accustomed to read the Scriptures, but it was entirely new to them to have it read in this fashion; read by the anointed Man. There never had been such a reading before as the reading of Christ as anointed by the Spirit. He handed back the roll and sat down, and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened upon Him. It was the anointed Man! What does anointing signify? It is the means by which God distinguishes man upon earth. The Lord Jesus Christ was distinguished as a divine Person, but there never had been such a Man upon earth before. Necessarily He was alone as a divine Person, but in Luke He is the anointed *Man*, moved and actuated by the Spirit. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon Him; that is, the anointed Vessel. The anointed Vessel is distinguished. God marked off Christ, and He marks off us in that way.
I have spoken of what is internal as the springing well in @John 4, and of the Spirit of life in @John 20, but the anointing is external. You will remember in the parable of Jotham, in the book of Judges, the olive-tree declines to remove from its place because by its fatness it honours God and man. The oil gives distinction; it puts honour upon man. As a figure it is the effect of the Spirit as seen by man's eye. That is what Christ was as *anointed*. "The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him", @Luke 4:20. Then He began to speak, and they "wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth", @Luke 4:22. I never refer to this passage without profound pleasure, because it is what Christ was as
{211}
Man. How attractive He was! His mouth was anointed, and they "wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth". It was not exactly *what* He said, the point was the *kind of way* in which He said it.
Now Luke continues the same line in the Acts in regard to *us*. There the assembly is taken account of as anointed in this world; it is for God, just as the two wave loaves in the feast of the firstfruits were for God, @Leviticus 23:17. They were the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, but they were *for God*. They were told to bring two loaves out of their habitations, and the loaves were to be baked with leaven; that is, the effect of the Holy Spirit leads to individual self-judgment, and the result was that there was a company upon earth in which sin, though present, was rendered wholly inactive. I wonder if we take that in? It is not the saints viewed as the companions of Christ, although they are the firstfruits, because you cannot connect sin with the brethren of Christ; they are wholly derived from Christ. But *here*, saints, viewed as having to do with a sinful creation, are brought in as firstfruits for God, as the result of the death and resurrection of Christ, and the coming of the Spirit. The wave loaves were to be taken out of their houses and to be baked with *leaven*. It presents to us the saints as having received the Spirit from Christ in heaven; a company here upon earth in whom sin, though present, was rendered wholly inactive by the fire. The leaven was there, but it was rendered wholly powerless by the fire. That is what the assembly is historically. It is a figure of the assembly formed of those who had a previous history on earth connected with sin. We must take account of the saints on these two lines; on the one hand as the brethren of Christ, with whom sin cannot be connected, and on the other hand they may be viewed historically.
{212}
The first is John's line, and the second is Luke's. The saints, viewed as having had their part in a sinful world, are brought into the very place where they had dishonoured God. Where sin had been active it is rendered powerless, which was a triumph of *grace*. The saints were not taken at once to heaven, but were left here; but sin was rendered powerless by the power of the Spirit. Such a company is a wonderful triumph for God.
Now this company is presented to us in @Acts 2. The Spirit comes not *into* them, but *upon* them. You will understand that I am not denying the Holy Spirit indwelling them; that is a cardinal truth of christianity. I am only speaking now of what is *external*. It says, "Suddenly there came a sound from heaven". You have there the effect of His coming, He came *from heaven*. This sound filled all the house where they were sitting. There was this remarkable effect of the new power; and then it says, "And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them". There never had been such a thing seen before in this world as the coming of the Holy Spirit. He sat upon each individual in the company. Every individual upon whom the Spirit sat was distinguished. There is the collective character, which is a truth we have to hold fast and defend; the Holy Spirit brought in practical unity, but at the same time the individual identity is recognised. In the coming of the Holy Spirit, God took account of each individual, and distinguished each by the Spirit. I use the word *distinguished* not as covering everything, but what I am trying to point out is, that they were marked off before the eyes of men as the result of the coming of the Spirit. He "sat upon each one". It is not *breathed into*, as in @John 20, but *sitting upon them*. Here was established in this world an anointed vessel; that is Luke's line.
{213}
Luke shows us in the first chapter of Acts what kind of people the Spirit came to. They loved Jesus; they were attracted to that Man; they were led up to mount Olivet, and they were found gazing up into heaven after Him. They loved Christ. Then there were other marks in this company, and especially *one;* that is, they recognised the authority of the Scriptures, and thirdly, they were of one accord, of one mind; they were united. That was the kind of material which God anointed. God will not dishonour Himself. What God anoints is rendered worthy of the anointing by the work of Christ. He had formed them, and formed them in affection. They loved Him and recognised the authority of the Scriptures, and they were united; they were of one accord, therefore they were suitable for the anointing. The Spirit comes upon them, and there is the vessel, in the presence of man, marked off by God's Spirit. That is the assembly, as the first fruits for God; that is, they were for God, but they were for God in *relation to man*. They were suited for the anointing, and in being anointed they were distinguished. You will remember Moses in the wilderness, @Exodus 33:16; he sought God that He would go up with His people; and he said to God, "so shall we be distinguished". We are distinguished by the presence of a divine Person; we are thus marked off from all others. God has come in by way of the anointing in the power of the Spirit.
Now what was established here in the beginning of @Acts 2 is continued as the circle enlarges. Luke expatiates on the wonderful result of the work of God before the eyes of men. The same characteristics show themselves as the circle enlarges. Three thousand gladly received the word and were added to them. The same character was seen; those who received the word were baptised. There was
{214}
something in it. The reception of the word was accompanied by the power of the anointing.
Beloved friends, it was on that ground the gospel went out. If you are not anointed you cannot preach the gospel. A preacher should be anointed by the Spirit, and as anointed he is distinguished by God. He is not preaching in his own ability, but in the power of the *anointing*, so his ministry is worth something.
The word was received in @Acts 2:41, and those that received it severed their associations with this world. They were baptised every one of them. Baptism signifies that which was before men. The power of the Holy Spirit was so manifest by Peter's preaching that three thousand were affected, and they at once severed their connection with the world; they were baptised, and not only that, but they cast in their lot with what the apostles were going on with. They not only received the gospel, but they, so to speak, said to the apostles, *We are with you*. They were *in* the thing heart and soul. "They continued stedfastly in the apostles¬ doctrine and fellowship". That is, they maintained the walls of the city; they were in the testimony; they were in fellowship with all that is of God, and exclusive of all that is not of God. Fellowship signifies the exclusion of all that is adverse. It a shows how wholly they were in the testimony. It does not mean they broke bread. They broke bread also, but breaking bread, while it depends on fellowship, refers to our *affections;* it is because we love Christ; it is what the Lord enjoined His own to do. If you love Christ you break bread, because the breaking of bread suggests Christ to you.
Jesus was anointed, and they were anointed, and then they had all things in common. The wonderful world that had been in God's mind in
{215}
purpose has been brought in morally. Love reigned among them; they loved Christ and loved one another. "All that believed were together, and had all things common". That was the kind of moral world which the Spirit of God brought in in answer to Christ's work. And they continued "with one accord". There they were manifestly in relationship with God, recognising God, and praising God, and yet in favour with all the people. That is the anointed vessels. I hope I have made it clear. It is a question of what is internal and external, inward and outward; and we want to maintain both.
{216}
CONDUCT IN GOD'S HOUSE
@1 Timothy 3:14,15
What I desire to speak of is that in which we are called to set forth divine behaviour. I do not intend to enlarge on the behaviour, but rather to show the sphere, or the character of the sphere, in which it is to be carried out; and that sphere, as you will observe in this epistle, is God's house. Now I desire by the Lord's help to say a word in regard to God's house viewed in that light; as the sphere in which christian behaviour is to be manifested. And what I shall have to say centres largely in the house as formed by Paul's ministry. My apprehension of it is that the house is properly formed by Paul's ministry; I shall come to that directly, but I wish to point out a feature or two of the house as indicated in the Old Testament Scriptures.
As you will be aware, the first mention of the house of God in Scripture is in @Genesis 28, and there you have indicated a very important feature of it. The house of God is connected with the earth, and is introduced primarily in connection with Jacob. There are two features which appear in the introduction of it, which are carried all through; indeed, in every subject introduced in the Scriptures you will find the salient features at the outset.
Now what appears in @Genesis 28 in connection with the house is divine interest in man upon earth; that is, Jacob was an object of interest to God. The heavens were opened upon him as he lay a lonely wanderer upon the earth with a stone for his pillow; he was the object of the interest of heaven; and then, his appreciation of the house consisted in God being in it, and hence it was none other to him than the house of God and the gate of heaven. That is to say, although it was a terrible place to
{217}
him, because of his state, nevertheless he recognised that it was God's dwelling, and that it was in close proximity to heaven; indeed, it was the "gate of heaven", @Genesis 28:17.
Genesis in that way presents to us the house; although not actually formed as a structure, nevertheless it is presented to us abstractly. God had, as it were, indicated His mind in regard to Jacob, and you will find that when God introduces light, those to whom the light is given have to go through a course of exercise until they are formed according to it. Jacob came back to Bethel, but the *full* course of exercise only ended with David. At Ephratah (@Psalm 132) David had received light in regard to the house, and he connects the light that he received with @Genesis 28; he would build the house; he would give no sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he found out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. The light that David received at Ephratah was connected with the light that came to Jacob as he fled from his brother Esau. David referred to that.
Now I want to dwell for a moment on two features that come out in connection with David and the house. The first is, that the foundation of the house was connected with sacrifice, and the fact that at that place Jehovah's sword was sheathed. You will recall that when David numbered the people (@1 Chronicles 21) he brought down the wrath of Jehovah. But God in grace directed him to rear an altar to Him on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. There David offered sacrifices, and there Jehovah accepted him; hence David instinctively recognised that that spot was the only proper location for God's house.
If you will look at @1 Chronicles 21 and the beginning of chapter 22 you will observe that David decided
{218}
that that spot was to be the site of the house. In other words, the foundation of the house is in the place where sacrifice is accepted. It is laid in the death of Christ; the judgment of God is there exhausted. I am not saying that judgment may not be connected with the house, judgment *begins* there (@2 Peter 4:17), but God's house is properly immune from judgment; its foundations are laid upon the spot where the sword of Jehovah was sheathed. You will notice that, the site being indicated, David prepared with all his might to rear a structure.
Now another feature that came out in connection with David is that *he* was not allowed to build the house. He had the desire to build it but the house of God is not built by a man of war. It is built by a *Son*. I want you to take notice of that; it is built by a *Son*. You will remember that the first child of Bathsheba died under divine judgment. David would have saved the child; he lay all night upon the earth, in hope that God would have mercy upon him and spare the child, but the child died, and David bowed to the judgment. He said, "now he is dead". The child was never to be revived; "I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me", @2 Samuel 12:23. He says, virtually, 'not only has the child died, but I am going that way also'. He bowed to divine judgment, and then there is another child; and Jehovah named *that* child. Jehovah loved that child, and He sent by the hand of the prophet Nathan and named him Jedidiah, which signifies *The beloved of the Lord*. It is the Son, the beloved of God, that builds the house. We speak of Solomon and his glory, and he is a type of Christ. He is Christ in relation to the millennial world; but we must not overlook that Solomon was a *son*. Solomon was the object of affection, and the house is built by the beloved of the Lord, and *what* a house!
{219}
You will remember that Solomon spoke of everything in creation from the cedar-tree to the hyssop. He was acquainted with nature; he was in that way qualified to head the millennial world. All the beauties of nature and the secrets of nature that men spend their lifetime and their means to bring to light now will be spoken of definitely by Christ. He will show what they signify in regard to God. Solomon spoke of all these things, but he was also *the son*, and it was as such that he built the house. Now, beloved friends, that is what the house of God is; these features that I have intimated suggest to us what the house is; and I would specially dwell upon the fact that it is built by the Son.
Now that leads me to the Acts of the Apostles, where you have the development of the course of the testimony; and I take it that in the earlier chapters of Acts we have that which refers to the city and its walls. It seems to me that it awaited the ministry of Paul to bring in the house according to its true character, and my reason for saying that is this, that Paul preached the *Son of God*. That is, he brought in Christ, not exactly officially (although you find that also in his preaching) but he preached the Son of God. He says, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", @Galatians 1:16. That is, Paul preached a Person who was in relationship with God as Son, and the effect of his gospel is to bring in *sons*. The house is formed in view of relationships which involve affection; a man's house is not an official place; his house is a place of relationship; a man's house is where his affections flow, and in order that you should see God's affections in flow, you must see the Son as man in relationship with Him, and you must see the *sons* who are brought in as His brethren.
{220}
Now what I see is, that the house of God, although upon earth, is composed of what is heavenly; not simply of that which has come out of the death of Christ, but also of that which is heavenly. It is composed, in other words, of those who are the companions of Christ. As the companions of Christ, we are the companions of a heavenly Man. You will remember how that the Lord said to Mary Magdalene, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father" (@John 20:17); thus intimating that there should be no links upon earth; that all links henceforth should be with Him in connection with heaven, or rather as the heavenly One. He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", @John 20:17. He is the ascending One; He is the One who is in all the liberty of the house. He has the title to ascend, and He does ascend. None but the Son could speak thus! He says, "I ascend". He is the glorious One, beloved friends, of whom we are the companions. He is the Son, and hence He is in the liberty of the house; and He goes to the highest point. In John it is not that He is *received* up, but He *goes* up; it involves the liberty of sonship: and we are the companions of that glorious One; and it is as the companions of Christ in heavenly glory that we form the house of God upon earth.
Now, in confirmation of what I have been saying, I refer to the assembly at Ephesus, in which assembly Timothy was when this epistle was written to him. Ephesus is the end, as it were, of the course of ministry that began in @Acts 9. Paul began with announcing that Jesus was the Son of God; he had received heavenly light into his soul; it was a light from heaven that entered into Paul's soul. That meant that there was a new centre, and that light was now emanating from it; a heavenly centre, not an earthly one. Jerusalem as a centre was
{221}
abandoned, and everything was now from heaven. The light that came into his soul from heaven works out in a ministry that places believers -- the sons -- in heaven. You will never understand the assembly in any of these features unless you see that its position is in heaven. Hence Ephesus is the end of that course of ministry. Chapter 20 of the Acts is the great climax of Paul's testimony, and in writing to these christians he tells them that they were not only raised *with* Christ, but seated in the heavenlies *in* Christ.
That is the first half of chapter 2 of his epistle to the Ephesians; the second half shows that these same people are here upon earth as a habitation of God; in other words, a heavenly people upon earth. In these people you get all the features indicated in the house in the Old Testament; but there is one feature of supreme beauty, and that is, that in that structure Jesus is the chief corner stone. "Ye ... are built", says the apostle, "upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone", @Ephesians 2:20. God placed Him on high, as Peter tells us; the One that the Jews refused is made the Head of the corner; but He has now obtained that place in the affections of the saints. Christ is supreme in that circle. He is the Head of that structure -- the chief corner stone. That is to say, Christ is the Son, and He is honoured as having the supreme place in that circle. God dwells in it. God dwells there in *affection:* he that dwells in love dwells in God and God in him. The ministry of Paul brought about upon earth a company of people formed in divine affections; that is, formed in the affections known in the Son. Affections flow from relationships, not relationships from affections. The relationships are made known in the gospel preached by Paul; he announced the Son, and affections were formed according to the
{222}
light of the relationships, so that there was a circle in which divine affections flowed. God dwelt there. God dwelt at Ephesus; He dwelt in that company; there Jesus was the chief corner stone. It was a wonderful triumph of the gospel.
Now you may ask me how I know that Ephesus had reached that point. Well, there are various answers to that question, but the most conclusive to my mind is that Paul was loved at Ephesus. He was not generally loved at Corinth; the Corinthian saints were not characterised by love for Paul; but at Ephesus Paul was loved. You remember how he sent from Miletus to Ephesus and called for the elders; and he calls their attention to the character of his ways and of his ministry; these were after Christ. Paul was a vessel entirely formed after Christ. I do not believe that we shall rightly understand his position unless we see this, for as so formed he was a test for the saints, and hence you will find that he frequently refers to himself as such. You will find it in his letters to the Corinthians habitually, and in his appeal to the elders of Ephesus. Speaking to the Ephesian elders, he concludes with recalling the word of Christ, with which he was in full accord; that "It is more blessed to give than to receive". He says, "remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive", @Acts 20:35. There you have the character of Christ, as it were, condensed, and Paul was entirely in accord with it; his ministry and his ways were in complete agreement with that character. I need only refer you to his letters as a proof of what I am saying; he was christianity livingly expressed.
The elders loved Paul -- they fell upon his neck and wept sore. Notice it was the *elders*. Difficulties invariably arise from the leaders, so that we may conclude that seeing the elders loved Paul the mass of the saints loved him also. I take it, therefore,
{223}
that the Ephesian saints were formed by Paul's ministry. There are other evidences; namely, his epistle to these saints; the character of the truth set forth in that epistle shows that the Ephesians were advanced in the truth, that they loved God, and they loved Christ.
Well, now, if you have followed what I have said you will have some idea of the circle in which christian conduct is to shine; and I refer to it for a moment so that we might be exercised as to whether we are equal to it. Paul's word was, "if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house", @1 Timothy 3:15. We ought to take note of the word *delay*. It puts us to the test. You will remember how Saul was tested by delay; he could not wait for Samuel: and so we are tested by the absence of Christ. So Paul says, "if I delay, in order that one ought to know how to behave oneself". It is not simply that *Timothy* should know, but that we all should know how one ought to behave oneself in the house of God. What a dignified position to be introduced into! The passage was written with a view to acquainting christians as to conduct that is suitable in the house of God.
I cannot enlarge upon it, and I did not intend to; my thought was to show, as I said, the character of the house, and if the character of the house is rightly understood you have the divine standard. The divine standard of everything is Christ -- the Son. He is the model. It is as One in the affections of the Father; One who could lift up His eyes to the Father and speak to Him as Son. It is the Son in the presence of the Father that is the model. See @Matthew 11:25 - 30. He is the standard, and it is beautiful to see how Paul was in accord with that standard; he was formed after Christ.
Another beautiful touch which I would call your
{224}
attention to is this; that Timothy was formed after Paul; Timothy was begotten by Paul's testimony. You will never understand Timothy's position in the Scriptures if you do not see that he was Paul's son in the faith. The Corinthians were naughty; they were like naughty children in a house; they knew not how to behave themselves in the absence of authority. Now Paul says, I am not coming to you, but I am sending my son Timothy to you; he is like me; he is my son, and he will put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, @1 Corinthians 4:17. Only a son could do that. One might learn the apostle's doctrine and expatiate upon it, but who can put you in mind of Paul's ways as they were in Christ? Paul would suggest Christ to you; he was formed after Christ, and Timothy was formed after Paul; he was Paul's son, and hence he could suggest Paul to the Corinthians.
What we require, beloved friends, is that our ways should suggest Christ: that is the test before men; it is a question of how we are formed by the truth; it is not what we *say*, as we have often heard, it is what we *suggest;* it is what we put people in mind of; if we are like Christ, we remind people of Him. I have referred more than once lately to Gideon's interview with the Midianitish kings after having vanquished them. He said, "What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor?", @Judges 8:18. Their reply was, "As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king"; and Gideon answers, "They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother", @Judges 8:19. That is, they had taken character from their mother, as Gideon had. Now we christians have all one mother, and that is "Jerusalem above"; it is *that* which gives character to us. Jerusalem above is really formed in the light of sonship; it has reference to liberty; "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother", @Galatians 4:26. God's house is
{225}
composed of those that are like Christ, hence you have there the shining out of God. If we are not formed after Christ, we are likely to be unruly, like naughty children; but if we are formed after Christ, we maintain divine order, and we are in sympathy with God. As I was saying in regard to @Genesis 28, heaven is interested in earth. God is interested in all men, and so he would have the saints interested in all men. God is shining out in Christ towards men, and as formed after Christ we are sympathetic with God in His desire to "have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth", @1 Timothy 2:4.
Well, now, all that is to be in the house of God. And then it is "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth". That I take to be a kind of check, or safeguard, for in evangelical desire we might go beyond the truth. Many are evangelical at the expense of the truth. The nearer we are to God the more divinely evangelical we shall become; but being in the light of the assembly as the pillar and base of the truth becomes a safeguard, for you cannot do violence to the truth if you recognise that the assembly is the pillar and base of the truth.
May the Lord use these truths to form us; light is intended to form us; it is intended to exercise us; and as there is exercise there is formation.
{226}
THE "EARTHLY TABERNACLE HOUSE" AND "THE BUILDING FROM GOD"
@2 Corinthians 4:16 - 18; @2 Corinthians 5:1 - 5
I desire to say a word in regard to the work of God as having reference to us inwardly and outwardly, and in this connection to seek to point out the distinction between the bearing of the first and second epistles to the Corinthians. The second epistle is restorative; it is a question of restoration, and hence *the Son* is brought in. The faithfulness of God is established in the *Son*, and the new covenant is introduced; whereas in the first epistle the point is the *authority of Christ*.
Now it is helpful to compare these two epistles with the first giving of the law by the hand of Moses and the second giving of the law. In connection with the first giving of the law, Moses was absent from the camp. He had received certain communications; he had received the law from the hand of God, as is recorded in @Exodus 20 to 23 inclusive, and he "wrote all the words" (@Exodus 24:4) and left them with the people when he went up to the mount to God; he left with the people the divine commandments; and Aaron and Hur also remained with them. So we see there the people of God left, as it were, to themselves, to be regulated by God's commandments, and that became the test. The withdrawal of Moses from the camp put the people to the test. His absence became a test to them, and they said: "as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what has become of him", @Exodus 32:1. They professed not to be able to tell what had become of the mediator, and hence they would have another leader and another god, and thus the most serious situation conceivable resulted.
{227}
I compare that with the first epistle to the Corinthians. The apostle Paul was the representative of Christ's authority. He had communicated to the Corinthian saints the divine commandments and had left them, and his absence from the people became a test to them. Now what puts *us* to the test is the absence of Christ; that is the position in which the assembly has been left here on earth. The Lord has gone on high, and our affections are put to the test by His absence, and as it happened with Israel so it has happened with the assembly.
When the apostle wrote his first epistle things had not completely gone, but there was the danger of the introduction of idolatry. Out of regard for the saints at Corinth Paul remained away. Had he come to them it would have been serious. Now what I want to show you, beloved friends, is that a condition of that kind renders it impossible for Christ to come in in the light of *Head*. Moses was on his way down from the mount with the most wonderful disclosures of God's mind. For forty days God had been speaking to Moses about Christ. He had been unfolding to him what was in His mind to establish in Christ, and all that wonderful disclosure was about to become the property of Israel, but the state of Israel wholly precluded Moses from introducing it. In like manner it is impossible that we should come into the good of the headship of Christ, that we should come to know Christ as the One who unfolds to us the wisdom of God, unless there is loyalty of heart to Him. Everything depends on the affections. Now we see the Lord Jesus is gone on high, and hence there is the unfolding of all that is in God's mind, and the saints are put to the test by His absence. I take it that the Lord's supper stands in that connection. It contemplates the absence of Christ from this world. And the Lord, in His gracious love, would in that way revive
{228}
the affections of His people to Himself week after week.
Moses breaks the tables of the covenant. It was utterly impossible for him to communicate the instructions regarding the tabernacle to Israel on account of their state. Instead of that he took the tabernacle that had existed in the camp and pitched it *far from* the camp. In other words, there had to be *separation* from the state of things that had arisen because of the lack of loyalty of heart to Jehovah. And that is just a picture of what we have to do with today. Christendom has become a camp; a camp, I need not say, marked by idolatry, and there is not only idolatry in it, but it is anti-christian: there is rivalry to Christ; another captain has been chosen.
The affections of the people of God have become diverted from Christ, and if they are to get into the light of God's mind in Christ there must be *separation*. We cannot be in the light or good of the headship of Christ apart from separation. It is those who love Christ that know Him as Head. His headship is known by affection, and affection for Christ is marked by separation from all that disputes His authority. Whatever it be, there must be the refusal of all that disputes the authority of Christ, otherwise our affection for Him is questionable. It is a very serious thing that there should be cause for any suspicion being cast upon our affections for Christ. The Scriptures throw suspicion on a certain class of believers. The epistles of John, for example, throw suspicion not only on our affections but on our christianity, and surely we do not want that there should be *room* for any doubt, either as to our affection for Christ, or our christianity.
Well now, that is what I see in regard to the first epistle to the Corinthians. The apostle Paul refrained from going to Corinth out of consideration for the
{229}
saints there; had he gone the result could only have been judgment. The jealousy of Christ had been aroused. They had been espoused by the ministry of Paul to Him, and had been diverted from Him, and "jealousy is cruel as the grave", @Song of Songs 8:6.
The affections of God's people today have been diverted from Christ by the doctrines of Balaam, and the issue is tremendous. It is appalling to think of the consequences of the issue that has arisen between Christ and Christendom. Paul asks, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?", @1 Corinthians 10:22. The result will show that Christ is stronger. Well now, Paul remained away so that the Corinthians might escape, and thank God they *did* escape, and we may thank God that *we* have escaped. The only escape now from the result of the burning jealousy of the Lord is separation. We take sides with Him against idolatry and the spirit of Anti-christ, and as we take up that position we attest our love for Christ, and that results in our getting divine disclosures; that is to say, those who show their love for Christ, their loyalty of heart to Him, get into the light and good of what He is as Head.
Now in the second epistle you have what corresponds in a sense to the second giving of the law. Although the same law was given, it was given under different circumstances. It was a law given by Jehovah as One who was sovereign in mercy; so that in a certain sense it was a new law, and in that respect there is in it an allusion to the new covenant. It was not the new covenant, but there was a partial foreshadowing of the new covenant in it. There was a shining in the face of Moses in connection with the second giving of the law; that is, there was some outshining of Christ in it.
That is what you get in the second epistle to the Corinthians, and what I wish to show you for a moment is that Paul corresponds with his great
{230}
type; namely, Moses. Moses takes the ground of representing the people before God; he says, "if thou wilt forgive their sin ... but if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book", @Exodus 32:32. He was actuated by the Spirit of Christ. There is no man in the Old Testament who possessed the Spirit of Christ in a more pronounced way than Moses. A man who can wish to be blotted out of Jehovah's book rather than that Jehovah's people should be blotted out was actuated and controlled by the Spirit of Christ; and that is what you see in Paul also. His attitude towards the Corinthians was prompted by his affection for them, and he was in entire accord with God's character; that is, he was *true* and *God was true*. They had questioned Paul's veracity at Corinth; he cared nothing for that; *God was true*. He had preached the Son of God to them, and *He* was true. "The Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us ... was not yea and nay, but in him was yea", @2 Corinthians 1:19. Paul was in entire accord with what he had preached. He was bent upon the complete restoration of the Corinthians. Where there is departure God will never give up His ways with us until there is complete restoration.
And where is the faithfulness of God seen? *In the Son*. I should like to enlarge on that for a moment. It opens up the whole question of the position of Christ here on the earth. He was the Son of God. No other man save the Son could carry out and maintain and establish the faithfulness of God. The Son here in manhood was the guarantee for everything for the Father. The Son accomplishes everything in affection for the Father. He is not merely an official; He has affection, and here on earth He maintained everything for God on that ground. Paul preached the Son. God revealed the Son in Paul that he might preach Him, and in preaching the Son he preached the faithfulness of
{231}
God. Every promise was Yea and Amen in that Person. It is a most wonderful consideration to my mind that in the Son becoming a man you have the guarantee of everything for God. The Son will do all. He is not simply there to accomplish something specific; He is there in the full enjoyment of the heart of God. He entered into all the Father's thoughts, and He has carried out everything and established everything on the ground of affection. You cannot have true recovery apart from that. Departure from God is in the affections being diverted by some object, and recovery is in the Son.
And then you get the writing of God. The writing of God is a most interesting consideration. There was writing on the tables of stone; that was the writing of God; and there was the writing upon the ground by the Lord Jesus in @John 8; that was the writing of God; and there is the writing upon the heart of man. The stone was simply the heart of the unregenerate man; it was the heart of adamant, wholly unsympathetic with the writing. There is no sympathy whatsoever in a stone; you may engrave something upon it, but it is utterly without sympathy. The Lord Jesus Christ wrote upon the ground. He wrote twice; the first writing excluded the Jew, put him out completely. We read, "they ... went out", @John 8:9. The second writing retained the sinful woman and preserved her from judgment. The second writing signified the death of Christ. He wrote upon the ground. When He rose up the second time there was no one present but the sinful woman, and He says to her, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more", @John 8:11. The writing on the ground secured her from judgment; that is to say, it indicated the preservation of man apart from sin through the death of Christ, and I have no doubt that that is the result of God's covenant.
Then chapter 3 of this epistle shows that the
{232}
shining in the face of Christ brings in a new order of man here. The apostle speaks of the Lord as the spirit of the covenant, and His face shines. We all, looking at the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image. We are all made alike by beholding the glory. There is a generation here upon earth produced by the shining of the face of Christ. So that you have a wonderful generation. They are all alike in one sense, and yet in another sense there is infinite variety. According to chapter 15 of the previous epistle, "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead", @1 Corinthians 15:41. The difference is simply a difference of glory. It is a marvellous thought, beloved friends. It is the world that God has in His mind, a world out of death, each one in it having a body divinely given, but it is a body according to God's pleasure.
Well, it seems to me you have recovery set forth in all that. The effect of glory is to produce agreement; we are changed into the same image. The word *same* in Corinthians has reference, largely, to something in common. There is the idea of the same Spirit; we all partake of the same loaf; we all drink of the same cup. It is useless to talk of recovery, beloved friends, unless there is unity, and unity is in affection. The shining of the glory is really the display of God's nature, and it produces similarity in His people down here.
Well, what I see in chapter 4 is the character of the minister. Paul was a minister, and he was in entire accord with his ministry, so that we may take him to represent the *inner* work of the Spirit. He says, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our *hearts*", @2 Corinthians 4:6. That is inward. It had shone into Paul's heart for the
{233}
shining forth. I take it that he in that way represents the effect of the inward shining. This produced similarity to Christ outwardly. The allusion really is to Gideon. The testimony that came out in Gideon was that he was a leader, and that his followers were all to act as *he acted*. He said: "Look on me, and do likewise", @Judges 7:17. Now what has Christ done? He is our great Leader. What has He done? He has died. And what will the Spirit of Christ do in the believer? He will work out in him the same kind of character. The character of Christ is reflected in Paul. Christ was his Leader, and he followed Him closely. It was a question of the shining forth of what was of God. The Lord Jesus Christ went into death that there should be the shining forth of the love of God. He wanted to make that known, and hence He died. Well, Paul was on the same line, so that the vessel, the "pitcher", as it were, was broken. He says, "we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us", @2 Corinthians 4:7. To Paul it was altogether a question of following Jesus.
Now in chapter 4:13 he touches the point of faith. He says, "having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak". From that point he is led on to the full fruition of God's work. There was the *inner* and the *outer*, the former having reference to the great future; the great eternal future. Paul compares his body to a tabernacle, as contrasted with that which he shall have eternally. What we are at the present moment by the work of God internally is far in excess of what we are externally. The first verse of chapter 5 shows that he regarded his body as a tent -- a tabernacle. The allusion is to the tent in the wilderness. There was nothing imposing about the tabernacle in the wilderness; it was no
{234}
building of outward show. It was simply a tent in which the divine treasures were; God's testimony was treasured there.
Now the buildings of Solomon present an entirely different view; the point in the temple was magnificence and glory, and it was *abiding* -- a *building*. And so our present bodies are simply tents, temporary abodes for God's testimony; that is their only value. The Lord takes care of our bodies; but the death of a christian always reminds me of the taking down of a tabernacle, which has finished its career on earth; it has served its purpose for God's testimony. But the *man* is to reside in a *building;* the man that had been in the tabernacle is to reside in a building; and hence the apostle says, "if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens". We have all seen the dissolution of the tabernacle; *God* takes it down. The death of a christian is never an accident: it is God terminating that aspect of His testimony, but we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
Now I wish to dwell on that for a moment, and I will close. You will recall, perhaps, in @Leviticus 25, that if a man sold a house in a walled city and failed to redeem it within a year, it remained with the purchaser for ever; but if he bought a field, the field returned to its owner in the year of jubilee, regardless entirely of whether the original owner redeemed it or not. I take that as a type. The earth belongs to Israel, and to Israel it returns. The gentile possesses it for the moment; he lays claim to it; but he has to surrender it. The year of jubilee is coming in which all will return to the original owner, but the Jew failed to redeem his place in the walled city. Israel failed to redeem it when God, in His patience, waited upon them, and
{235}
it remains in the hands of the gentiles. We, on earth as believers, have a place *not* upon earth. Like Barnabas, we have surrendered the earth. I do not know who bought Barnabas's land, but Barnabas secured a place for himself in a "walled city", and that place remains to him eternally. And so it is with each of us. We have a *residence*, a building from God, eternal in the heavens, a place secured for us for ever. I do not enlarge upon that. I have only wished to show you the course that God takes with us in restoration, and how that course ends in regard to the believer. *Now* he is only in the tent character, liable to be taken down at any moment, but he will have a house eternal in the heavens. That is the goal. The apostle says, "he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit". In the meanwhile we have the earnest of that which is eternal, and so Paul did not look at anything else; he knew that everything in this scene was passing away, and therefore he looked at what is eternal. In the power of the Spirit he was able to anticipate the joy of eternity.
Well, beloved, that is all I have to say. One is exercised that the Lord's people should get a bit of heavenly light, for really it is, perhaps, what we need most. The Lord would revive in our hearts the wondrous place that we have in God's thoughts, and it is intimated here in the expression "a building of God ... eternal in the heavens".
{236}
DIVINE LOVE FINDS ITS EXPRESSION IN SELF-SURRENDER
@John 18:8,9; @2 Timothy 2:10
I desire to set before you the way in which divine love finds its expression in God's people here upon earth. It will find different outlets in the future, where there are no needs, but I want to show you how it works out in a scene of *need* and where there is opposition. Let us see how it found expression in the Lord Himself, and also in the apostle Paul. It works out in the way of self-surrender and for the good of others. *We* need this, and this involves christianity. Christianity is the simplest of all things, for the essence of it is love, and there is nothing simpler than love. There is nothing simpler in the universe of God than love.
The apostle Paul was concerned lest the Corinthians should be beguiled from simplicity as to Christ, and that simplicity I believe to be *love*. The Lord set up His disciples here in that way; they were put under obligation to *love one another*. The service of love found its perfect expression in Christ Himself, and it was expressed in the apostles also in their measure, and in the men of faith in whom God wrought. Love has an object outside of itself. Abel is an example in figure. He was a "keeper of sheep" (@Genesis 4:2); he had an object outside of himself. That may seem a commonplace observation, but I believe the Spirit of God in that way sets forth a trait of Christ. Cain disowned moral obligation. He said, "Am I my brother's keeper?" @Genesis 4:9.
A christian is one who has a sense of moral obligation to others although he has no claim upon *them*. The same trait existed in those who followed in the line of faith, although it may not have appeared. Abraham is the first who is spoken of as engaged in
{237}
conflict, and it was conflict for the recovery of his *brother;* he had the sense of moral obligation to his brother. Lot had no claim upon Abraham, for he had voluntarily departed from him, but he was one of God's people and Abraham acted on this fact. I should not enter on any conflict which has not the whole assembly in view. Conflict is not only for the preservation of those with whom we may be walking, but we should be concerned for the *whole* church. Paul was concerned for the "elect", that they might "obtain the salvation", @2 Timothy 2:10. He had the sense of obligation to *all* the people of God.
Abraham is a wonderful model of the man of faith. He was under the sense of moral obligation, and hence he entered into conflict for the recovery of his brother. Abraham was ready for every emergency. He had trained servants in his house; he was ready for the emergency, and he was successful. He was not only prepared for conflict, he was also prepared for a divine visitation, and one which was wholly unannounced. See @Genesis 18. "Jehovah appeared to him ... and he sat at the tent-door". If you have the sense of the obligation of love you will be prepared both for the conflict and the privilege. Abraham was prepared when the Lord appeared to him at the tent door. Sarah, too, was ready, and the servant was ready. You can never tell when a dark cloud may appear in a clear sky, and you have to be in readiness for it and in readiness too for opportunities for entering into privilege. *To be in readiness is to be exercised*.
We find the same traits in Jacob and in Joseph. They were marked by the shepherd character, and so much so that they as shepherds were an "abomination to the Egyptians", @Genesis 46:34. The man who lives in the flesh hates a shepherd; he lives for himself, he has no object outside of himself. Joseph had the true spirit of a shepherd; he was the preserver of God's
{238}
people, especially of the remnant of Israel. In saying the remnant of Israel I refer to the passage prophetically. You will find the same character in Moses. Directly he is in the wilderness he is engaged in regard to God's flock, and he was the shepherd to lead the people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
I now come to David. He was the shepherd king. To be the king he *must* be the shepherd. If a man is qualified to be a shepherd give him the crown, for he is qualified to *rule*. David is introduced to Samuel as a *keeper of sheep*, not as an hireling who fleeth when he sees the wolf coming. He was a *keeper*, he was faithful when the lion and the bear attacked the flock, and when he left the sheep to go to the camp of Israel he left them in the hands of a *keeper*. He had the spirit of the shepherd. Well, that man is the man for the throne. He is recognised as king and he is crowned. He goes to Jerusalem. A shepherd must be a warrior, so David went to Jerusalem, where the Jebusite was. In Scripture Jerusalem prefigures the heavens. It was the scene from which government would be administered on earth. There could not be peace on earth till there was peace in heaven; so David went to Jerusalem, dislodged the Jebusite, and took the place of the supreme point of government. He takes the vantage point to administer protection for the sheep of Israel. The Philistine would hold the people of God in bondage, and David smote the Philistines and subdued them. He took Metheg-ha-ammah, the 'power or bridle of the capital' out of the hand of the Philistines; @2 Samuel 8:1. If the *bridle* is in the hands of David, the people will be guided aright. He *led* them and he *fed* them; "he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands", @Psalm 78:72.
The Lord Jesus Christ went into death to secure
{239}
the controlling power here upon earth -- the *bridle* is in *His* hand. The influence of evil in the heavens is dislodged, and the power of evil is broken; that is the present situation. He went down into death, and from that point He goes up on high, having led captivity captive, and from *thence* He administers. That sets forth the present situation.
@John 18 shows us the Lord Jesus Christ in moral supremacy. The forces of evil are there, but His enemies had no power against Him; see verse 6. John does not record the spiritual powers which the Lord had to face in Gethsemane. In his gospel it is the dignity of the Person which comes into view. We get Gethsemane alluded to in verse 1, but not His agony when Satan brought the power of death to bear upon His spirit. Gethsemane brought out that He was here *absolutely* for the Father's will, but He came out victorious. In John's gospel He stands forth in the dignity of His own Person. The political enemies came forth against Him. The Lord says, "I am he", and they have to go backward and fall to the ground; but at that moment the Lord says, "If therefore ye seek *me*, let *these* go their way". In a crisis what is wanted is self-surrender. The enemy is set for the captivity of God's people, but love, divine love, expresses itself in a crisis in self-surrender. "If therefore ye seek me, let these go their way". Love is the *one* thing that *never fails*. It is the great stand-by.
Take the two epistles to the Corinthians. The Corinthians were exposed to spiritual captivity. Paul acted in love; love was *his* stand-by. He says, "though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved", @2 Corinthians 12:15. Paul writes as one who has love; he had it in store. He recovered them by love. Divine love is behind conflict, and that is set forth in perfection in the Lord Jesus Christ. With regard
{240}
to ourselves, if we are to be keepers -- shepherds -- of one another, it must be by *self-surrender*.
I pass on now to what we get in Paul. The same trait shines forth in him. He is *enduring "all things* for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory". That is far beyond ourselves, but it indicates the spirit which is to animate the servant. I believe the present moment *calls* for that service, the service of love. There are different orders of service, but the Lord has left a household here, and the servant who loves Him is exercised that the household should be fed. The Lord commends a servant who is thus exercised; one who can give the household a portion of meat in due season. It is a ministry of *food*. There are various kinds of food. Before the flood no flesh was eaten, but after it, the requirements were greater, and flesh was eaten. In the wilderness the people of God ate angels¬ food, the food of the mighty, heavenly food. In the land they had different food, the old corn of the land. Now the Lord commends the servant who ministers food in *due season* to His household. Every true servant of Christ thinks of the church; all his concerns and exercises are as to the church. He is concerned to keep in the pathway himself, but he is also exercised as to the church.
I believe at this moment the Spirit of God is on the line of cultivating bridal affections in the saints. The apostle says, "I have espoused you unto *one* man", @2 Corinthians 11:2. He had set *one* object before them, not *two*. The ministry of Paul was like that of Abraham's servant when he went to seek a bride for Isaac. Paul was near enough to the Lord to apprehend the Lord's desire in regard of the bride, and the theme of his ministry was the *one Man*. He presented that Man in the gospel as Son of God,
{241}
and he captured the hearts of the saints for that one Man. The great aim of ministry is to attach us to Christ, and the Spirit of God is working to this end that there may be unity, for that can only be by our having *one object*. They did all eat "the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink", @1 Corinthians 10:3,4; if we feed on the *same* food and drink the same drink there must be similarity, there must be unity.
Then in the second epistle you get them beholding *one Object*, the same Object; and so they were all being changed into the *same image*. If we follow along that line we shall be found on the line which makes for peace and we shall find a way whereby we shall help and edify one another. It is my conviction that the Spirit of God is working to this end.
{242}
THE BRIDEGROOM
@Psalm 19:4 - 6; @John 3:29 - 31; @Revelation 22:16,17
The thought of Christ as the Bridegroom is that He has an influence and a *voice*. The great need, especially for young believers, is to come under His influence, and His influence is universal. No influence is so touching. He has affection, and His affections are in activity. That is the way this scripture presents Christ. But His influence goes beyond the bride. Every one at the marriage feast is influenced by the Bridegroom.
@Psalm 19 sets forth the way that Christ was received in heaven. He was rejected here, but the Father has set a "tabernacle" in the heavens for Him, a special place; and He comes out of His "chamber" in the character of the Bridegroom, animated by affection, and "rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race", in the energy of divine strength. "His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it". He is in the position to influence all on earth; "there is nothing hid from the heat thereof". All come under the direct and blessed influence of Christ.
Now John the baptist took account of Christ as the Bridegroom. How did he get that thought? By being *near to Christ*. The Lord's servants get divine impressions by being near to Christ. If you get near to Christ you will find that He is absorbed with one object, and that object is the assembly. John the baptist got near enough to Christ to hear His voice. And what kind of a voice was it? It was the voice of affection in Christ for the nation. That is the way John knew Him as the *Bridegroom*. So he says, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom". The Bridegroom alone has title to the bride. John heard the voice, and his joy was
{243}
"fulfilled"; he "rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom". He shines out in *full sympathy* with Christ. He disappears in happiness, having heard that voice, and he says, "He who comes out of heaven is above all".
The voice of the Bridegroom is now no longer in Israel; it is heard *from heaven;* and that voice produces a *bride* here whose voice also is heard. It comes out in Paul and the universal character of the testimony. The heavenly bride is formed by the ministry of Paul. Paul not only heard the voice of the Bridegroom, but he brought in the bride. He espoused the saints as a chaste virgin to Christ -- *to one Man*.
The voice now is, "Son, give me thine heart", @Proverbs 23:26. That voice is heard in the gospel. The apostle Paul says, as it were, I have given you to the Son; "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11:2. This was his great desire, for he was in the full light of the desire of the *heart of Christ*.
The saints should be captured for Christ and wholly apart from this world. Paul knew that as the serpent beguiled Eve so the enemy would seek to corrupt the saints from the *simplicity* that is in Christ, the simplicity of affection for Christ. Nothing is so simple as affection for Christ.
We see at the close of the book of Revelation that the Lord triumphs notwithstanding all the devices of the enemy. That book presents His triumph. He is seen as the Lamb in chapter 14, the One who was rejected, and the saints are in sympathy with Him. John was shown the "bride, the Lamb's wife" (@Revelation 21:9) the trophy of His triumph. She comes out of heaven in dignity and glory, and her influence is universal. Chapter 21 shows her as to what is *without;* chapter 22 what is *within*. In
{244}
chapter 22 *she* has a voice, in response to the voice of the Bridegroom, and she is in full accord with the Spirit, inviting Him to come. That is a marvellous triumph for Christ! Not only the Spirit, but the bride says to Him, "Come". But *her* voice is the result of *His* voice, His influence. She, in company with the Spirit, says to Him, "Come". The unity of the Spirit is the unity of affection; there is no other.
May we be responsive to His voice!
{245}
READING
@Acts 27
D.L.H. There is a kind of twofold interest in this chapter, one referring to Paul personally and his conduct in an extremely trying moment; the man of faith who had to do with God; and the other the way in which the incident may be viewed in relation to the history of the assembly.
J.T. We may trace the Spirit of Christ in the apostle in relation to the Jews in these chapters, and also in relation to the assembly. The latter, for instance, is seen in chapter 20 in the manner in which recovery is indicated through the attitude of the Lord to the assembly. But then we also have set forth in the apostle the Spirit of Christ in its unvarying interest in the Jew. It is especially manifest when he arrives at Rome. He called the chief of the Jews together, and shows his untiring interest in them. From chapter 20 right through to the end we see the unflagging interest of Christ in the Jew.
D.L.H. But actually, at the end of chapter 28, they refuse their last chance, and a solemn judgment is pronounced upon them, and the salvation of God is sent unto the gentiles; *they* would hear the testimony. The long-suffering of God lingered with the nation, and gave them every possible testimony.
J.T. The visit to Jerusalem, whilst it appears to be somewhat mistaken, the Spirit brings forward as showing the exercise of the Spirit of Christ in the apostle in relation to Israel.
D.L.H. One sees how God was above the mistakes, and allowed this final testimony to be given.
J.T. It would be a testimony against the Jews, that after the vicissitudes of this dreadful voyage
{246}
his interest in them was unflagging. At Rome they had heard nothing against the apostle and he declares that he had no charge against the nation: he had only affection for them and interest in them.
D.L.H. With regard to the assembly, it is very wonderful to see how God maintains His own counsel and purpose, and brings that which is of Himself right through in safety in spite of all the wreck and ruin that has come in.
J.T. And everything seems to depend on the ministry of Paul.
D.L.H. His ministry ham been the salvation of the church in a sense.
J.T. God gave to him all those that sailed with him. The voyage suggests @Psalm 107, "They that go down to the sea in ships ... these see the works of the Lord", @Psalm 107:23,24. God permits us to get into extremities, which has been the continuous history of things in the church. So it is better to be at the end as we are, for we can see what God can be for us at the moment, and thus learn to "praise the Lord for his goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men", @Psalm 107:31.
W.J. There are sweeter notes at the end than at the beginning; the greater the difficulties the more we can learn what God can be for us.
J.H. It is wonderful in that connection to see the energy of the Spirit of God in Simeon and Anna at the close of the day.
J.T. In the Old Testament we continually find the interest of the Lord in His people, even when God could not publicly own them, as in the book of Esther. @Psalm 107 suggests the importance of taking advantage of blessings that are to be gained in the history of the church; one sees the wonders of the Lord, His mercy and what He can be to His people, so that it results in praise.
Reverting to Esther, it shows the interest of the
{247}
Lord; the Spirit of Christ in His care for His people without showing Himself as such. There is nothing official in the book; the Lord Himself does not appear, yet there is great activity on the part of Mordecai, indicating the exercises of the Spirit of Christ in caring for the Lord's people and His interests. Now in @Acts 27 we read that neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, which seems to indicate that the Lord is not seen in His official glory, and perhaps, too, the absence of guides, and yet God's hand is over things.
W.J. If they had listened to the counsel of the apostle in the first place, they would not have removed from the harbour; the church got away from seclusion into something more public.
J.T. If Paul is not listened to, where are we? We have lost the church; we have lost everything that regulates the church, because Paul gives us the structure. If the structure is not held in the soul, the order that is due to the house of God would not be maintained, and things would go adrift; they drifted about in Adria. "Sirs", Paul says, "ye should have hearkened unto me". They turned a deaf ear to Paul, and hence they got into a position where they gave up all hope.
D.L.H. The apostle Paul's line of ministry was the first thing that the church gave up, and it is his ministry that has been recovered in these last times.
J.T. His voice is raised again in this chapter; he regains a certain influence.
D.L.H. For a fortnight he seems to have been perfectly quiet; nobody said anything and they got no guidance. "Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand", we read at the end of @Psalm 107, and if we wish to see where Paul is, we must go on to the next psalm: "O God, my heart is fixed", @Psalm 108:1.
P.R.M. That is where the man of God comes to,
{248}
because he sees everything in the light of purpose; that is, "the firm foundation of God stands", @2 Timothy 2:19. The other is, "Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things", @2 Timothy 2:7.
Ques. What do you mean by the structure of the church through Paul?
J.T. I refer to the general way he takes it up, more particularly as it is seen in Corinthians, the order that is needed for guidance. I thought also of "neither sun nor stars ... appeared". There is no reference to the moon, which is the church at the present moment. The omission was intentional. One could not look for guidance in the moon in that broken state of things. To speak figuratively it is possible to have the sun and stars without the moon. That is, Christ in His authority in the heavens, and those whom He raises up. Luther was a star; a star in Scripture is a guide.
E.McB. That is confirmed in connection with the seven assemblies at the beginning of Revelation; the seven angels were the seven stars.
D.L.H. The fourteen nights answer very much to what is called the dark ages.
W.J. The church lost separation and desired expansion, and the moment that was the came a soft wind blew for the time, and the thought they had gained their purpose.
J.T. Then Satan took advantage of their folly and raised the storm. It is not only that we suffer when we disregard the word, but Satan takes advantage of our blunders, so that the sufferings are multiplied.
E.H.C. The winds were contrary, and consequently progress was slow and dangerous.
J.T. We can understand how the malice of the enemy would take advantage of a disregard of Paul's doctrine, and endeavour to overwhelm the church. But God never withdrew His hand, and
{249}
it is in that point that @Psalm 107 is so touching, because they are brought to their wit's end. Then they recognise Paul.
D.L.H. In chapter 20 we have the resource: "And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace", @Acts 20:32. That is the resource now.
J.T. It connects itself with Paul's remark in this chapter: "I believe God". There is a clear outline as to the result after Paul regains his place and influence and is listened to, and then everything goes well.
D.L.H. The voice that spoke for God at the outset, and appears to have been silent for a whole fortnight in this voyage, is now heard again and in a commanding way; he carries things.
J.T. Paul suggests food; John's teaching comes in the way of food. There is no hope at all if we do not regard Paul, because you have no order, and if divine order is not maintained God cannot be with us.
D.L.H. In actual fact it is Paul's ministry that has been recovered. The Lord made known to J.N.D. the truth of union with Christ; it was Paul's line of ministry.
H.T. At the end J.N.D. drew our attention to John.
D.L.H. After Paul's doctrine had been ministered with great freshness and power for a number of years, J.N.D., as he was passing off the scene, warned the saints that they must not neglect John. His observation was to this effect: 'Let not John's ministry be forgotten in insisting on Paul's. One gives the dispensation in which the display is, the other (John) gives that which is displayed'.
J.T. The effort of the enemy since J.N.D.¬s death has been to set John aside; whereas the more recent attack is against Paul; a question of the
{250}
order of the house. Paul and John have to be held together. The line of attack in connection with the receiving of the Spirit, in America, was against the subjective side, which is John's line.
W.J. Spiritual sustenance, food, is largely supplied by John; he gives us the fatness of God's house.
J.T. John gets a survey of Paul's work in connection with the seven assemblies; there is perfect design in the way the truth is presented. John comes in to meet the breakdown and he sees the heavenly city.
W.J. The book of the prophet Habakkuk connects with this chapter pretty much. It is desolation, but he can joy in God.
J.T. We reach a point in verse 34 that is important. Sustenance is needed. Not only Paul's *light* is needed, but *food*. The saints need to be fed. John presents food; he speaks of the "bread of God", @John 6:33. The Scriptures make a great deal of food; there is food for each position which we occupy in regard to the testimony.
A.S.L. Paul's line of things, even in its objective character, properly taken up, would be food.
J.T. All ministry is food, but the Scriptures are so perfectly set, and there is food in different positions. In @Psalm 78 we read that God opened the windows of heaven and rained down manna upon them and gave them of the corn of heaven and "man did eat angels¬ food" (@Psalm 78:25), the bread of the mighty. It was a most remarkable thing because of the nature of their circumstances; they were in the wilderness and they needed food. In this chapter it does not say what it was, but they needed food.
A.S.L. In connection with Paul's line and John's line of ministry, it cannot be said that the former is exclusively objective; Paul is quite as subjective as John.
{251}
J.T. John's gospel sustains Paul's teaching. Internal evidence would tend to show that it is the last of the inspired writings.
D.L.H. We cannot lay down an iron rule, and what has been said as to John's line and Paul's line refers to what is characteristic.
J.T. But Paul presents Christ personally as much as John.
A.S.L. One could not be in the truth of John and disregard Paul.
J.T. A great deal of energy is required under the conditions indicated in this chapter, food and strength are needed. It is so like the great Shepherd of the sheep to nourish His flock.
P.R.M. What marks the giving of food here is that the apostle gives thanks before all. Food is of no use without that.
D.L.H. The tendency of his action was to bring the fear of God before them. "I believe God". The way in which this faithful servant is sustained is very blessed; all the ship's company and the men of authority are dependent on him. Having the fear of God before him he is in the mind of God at the close, and he does not quail in the presence of extreme trials, though all who had knowledge of the sea were greatly frightened.
J.T. God used the shipwreck to restore Paul's influence. We have to take account of the humiliating history of the assembly, and that greatly helps in restoring Paul in his place before our eyes and hearts.
W.J. There is to be no insensibility as to the state of things, but on the other hand the heart is to be fixed on God's side of things.
D.L.H. The ship has to go to pieces; there is nothing official or dogmatic that will carry things, but what is of God never goes to pieces.
J.T. The question is, what should be done under
{252}
these conditions? Paul had the mind of God. In a crisis, the great difficulty is knowing what to do. When God has done His work in discipline there is invariably a crisis.
A.S.L. The company reaching the shore represent all that is of God safely landed.
P.B.M. There were those who could swim, and it required vitality to do that; they could breast the elements.
F.H.B. There are two sides in evidence. Utter breakdown of what is connected with man in responsibility; *that* keeps us humble and lowly; on the other hand, there is what is connected with God's purpose, and *that* would encourage us. We have the two things in 2 Timothy. It needs much grace to hold the two in even balance.
J.T. The exercise of the Spirit of Christ in these conditions, and what exercises Paul must have gone through, is seen in Paul because he was with God, and God answered his exercises. He cared for everybody in the ship, and God gave him *all*. We need to keep the whole circle of saints before our souls. The exercise of the Spirit of Christ in regard to the assembly must include the whole; one could not restrict it for a moment.
E.McB. In that sense if we have a separate boat it is cut off.
P.R.M. We learn a lesson here as to the folly of carrying about superfluous information with us; it is only what we appropriate that is of use to us. They had to cast out the wheat into the sea. It is of no use to carry about mere information from Genesis to Revelation. If you begin to eat of Christ, you begin to unload.
D.L.H. Everything that was vital got safe to land, and everything that was otherwise was broken to pieces. Verse 31 seems to involve that every help has to be taken advantage of. The sailors were
{253}
men who knew what to do; they could deal with anchors, and could steer the ship. There are people who are guides in that sense, and we are glad to take advantage of them.
P.R.M. The last two chapters give us the main attempts of Satan in assailing what is of God. In chapter 27 he fails in regard to what is corporate, and then he returns to attack the individual servant. The saints are carried through a crisis in safety, and when the corporate attack fails the enemy will single out the individual servant and attack him. It is illustrated in the last chapter. Paul contributed to the comfort of the rest, and the enemy took occasion by it to attack him in the viper coming out of the heat and fastening on his hand.
J.T. There is great encouragement here in consideration of the assurance that all that sail with Paul should be saved; we are not despondent or pessimistic in the light of this. There is neither elation nor depression.
P.R.M. If saints are depressed they are not in a condition to appropriate divine food, and if they are elated they are not in a condition for it, but the Lord seems to work to bring us into subjection that we may be able to appropriate the food He has for us, so that His work may prosper in our souls. There is no elation at the end; Paul did not pass into Rome with flying colours and banners waving; he just thanked God and took courage. We may all take courage. Whilst few could stand with Paul, he passes this on to Timothy: "in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee" (@1 Timothy 4:16); so that the weakest one may stand in the light of this salvation and be the source of salvation to others, to all "them that hear thee".
J.T. The Spirit of Christ is in exercise in Paul
{254}
in regard to the saints; it is not restricted to any circle of christians. The Lord's affections include all, and those affections are practically expressed in the exercises of the saints. The Spirit of Christ is seen all through Scripture. "If any one has not the Spirit of Christ he is not of him", @Romans 8:9.
D.L.H. All the people got safe to land as individuals; it is a question of individual faith and energy. It is very interesting to know how many there were. "The Lord knoweth them that are his", @2 Timothy 2:19.
J.T. For us at the present moment, while we would like to know them all and care for them all, it satisfies the heart to know that the *Lord* knows them that are His.
P.R.M. He cares for their hair too; "there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you"; every detail is taken account of that represents vitality.
J.T. They all safely reached land. Land is always in contrast to the sea; it is a sort of standing ground, connected doubtless with God's purpose.
W.J. Some people are preserved by influences, and not by swimming, their own vitality or faith.
P.R.M. Many are carried on in that way in connection with others who are a help to them.
D.L.H. One would rather be a swimmer.
{255}
SONSHIP
@Galatians 4:1 - 7
J.T. It has occurred to me that sonship is spoken of in two ways, one as a truth that affects deliverance from bondage, legality, as in Galatians; and on the other hand as setting forth the height of God's thought in regard to us, as in Ephesians.
J.V. Do you mean "marked out beforehand for sonship"?
J.T. Yes, "by Jesus Christ to himself", @Ephesians 1:5. That would be the highest thought perhaps that we could conceive as to blessing; that we should be before the face of God for His pleasure.
W.J. I suppose sonship is the peculiar blessing of christianity.
J.T. It is a very wide thought, and has a very wide bearing. It is applied to Israel, for instance, but whatever application it may have to others, as applied to the church it involves wonderful privilege. Anything applied to the church must have a distinctive character.
J.V. I suppose it was more national with regard to Israel. "Israel is my son, my firstborn", @Exodus 4:22.
J.T. Yes, that was an expression of God's purpose. It was not really so then; it was only in His mind in regard of them. Sonship could never really exist until Christ became man.
J.V. You do find the remnant using the term in Isaiah; "Doubtless thou art our father" (@Isaiah 63:16) and then you get God expressing Himself, "Ephraim, my dear son ... a pleasant child", @Jeremiah 31:20.
J.T. God predestinating us to sonship by Jesus Christ to Himself is a wonderful thought, and necessarily involves a heavenly position. He "has
{256}
blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ", @Ephesians 1:3. It is heavenly in regard to us; but then the light in which it is brought forward in Galatians has rather in view deliverance from legality.
W.J. The passage, "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed", @John 8:36, suggests liberty.
J.T. The Son abides in the house for ever.
E.H.C. Do we come into sonship consequent upon Christ risen entering into the presence of the Father as Son?
J.T. I think it is on the ground of redemption, "that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship"; but the Spirit of it is received from a risen and glorified Christ. "because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father". Chapter 1, it seems to me, gives us the call. Paul says, "it pleased God ... to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen", @Galatians 1:16. We have there a true announcing of Paul's ministry which delivers from all sectionalism. The Jewish saints would naturally become attached to Jerusalem. We all more or less become attached to our own section, but sonship is a truth that is universal in its bearings; that is, it involves Jerusalem which is *above*, the heavenly metropolis; and the influence of that metropolis must be universal.
H.T. We are not predestinated to be children, but to sonship.
J.T. Our position as children refers to our position here upon earth. We are here upon earth under the care of the Father; the objects of the Father's love.
H.T. I thought that we were predestinated to sonship by Jesus Christ to God; that is, for His good pleasure; and that all who have the Spirit
{257}
know the Father; but that entering into sonship was something in advance of that, entering into association with a glorified Christ before the Father's face; but the way you seem to put it is that all believers are sons.
J.T. I think all believers are sons, and sonship refers to our place with *God;* whereas our place as children has reference to our position here in the world as the objects of the Father's care.
J.V. In several cases where the term children is mentioned it is distinctly applied to our position here: @Romans 8:17; @Philippians 2:15; @1 John 3:1, etc.
J.T. The position of children is connected with our position here in an adverse world. Sonship is the great thought of *purpose*, because it is a question of abiding in the house.
W.J. Heirship goes with the sonship. One is what we are *with* God, and the other is what we are *for* God.
J.T. You are in the good of the inheritance now by the Spirit, but the Son is the heir. If it is the Son of man, He is the heir; He is the heir to *all* that falls to man; and if it is the Son of God, He is the heir.
A.S.L. John never uses the term "son" except in @Revelation 21:7.
J.T. It is the family with John.
A.S.L. It is remarkable that John uniformly employs the term "children", but Paul nearly always "sons". For instance, the disciples were children while the Lord was with them, but they were brought into the place of sons when the Lord in resurrection came into their midst after the message He had given to Mary.
J.T. I think that is right, but they were sons in the mind of God: "Then are the sons free", @Matthew 17:26. Matthew develops the truth of sonship.
{258}
You get the Son in chapter 2: "Out of Egypt have I called my son", @Matthew 2:15. That is to say, God reverts to His thought in regard to Israel. Christ was the true Israelite; He was God's Son. Then in chapter 3 He is proclaimed from heaven as the Son: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased", @Matthew 3:17. In Luke it is "*Thou* art my beloved Son" (@Luke 3:22); in Matthew it is "*This* is my beloved Son". The Son is brought forward, and He pursues His course on to the mount of transfiguration. Then we have another proclamation: "Hear ye him", @Matthew 17:5. The Son is to be *heard:* He is to be the Speaker. All communications proceed and come to us from a Person in the relation of Son. Moses and Elias were not sons; they had spoken, but they had not spoken as sons. Now christianity takes its character from the Person who spoke it; see @Hebrews 1. So that if you have the truth brought out in the Son, others are brought into it. The moment the Son speaks, then the sons are brought to light. Hence in @Matthew 17:26, you get "the sons". The saints are brought in. The Lord says in connection with the tribute, "Then are the *sons* free ... give it to them for *me and thee*".
W.J. That is the key to the epistle to the Hebrews. The expression "for me and thee" characterises the epistle; we are companions of Christ.
E.H.C. "Behold I and the children which God hath given me", @Hebrews 2:13.
G.R. You said some years ago we are in the day of sonship.
J.T. That is important, because it dismisses the thought of the necessity for state; sonship is light; sonship *produces* the state; it is light, but the light is to produce state.
W.J. Satan is always seeking to defeat that, because it is the peculiar blessing of christianity.
{259}
He is always assaulting it and trying to keep us back from it; he does not object to other things so much as this most important truth; that is, the peculiar relationship in which we stand. As a matter of fact, I think we are very defective in regard of the consciousness of it.
J.T. Yes, and souls should be made acquainted with the fact that God takes account of us in that light. "ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", @Galatians 3:26. There is nothing lower than that now.
J.V. "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman", introducing a new order.
J.T. Yes, you have to see the Son here. You could not understand @John 3:16 without seeing the position of the Son here, what He was to the Father, the One who was manifestly so precious to His heart. God *gives* His Son: "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son".
Ques. So the question is one of faith. Is that the meaning of "Ye are all God's sons by faith"?
J.T. It is a question of light, though we are all the sons of God by faith. The Galatians, despite their state, were in that position; they were *sons*.
E.H.C. Sons in Christ Jesus on the principle of faith in contrast to law.
W.J. He is sent forth as Son for that very purpose; that we might receive sonship.
E.H.C. It carries the affection of the heart with it: "because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your *hearts*, crying, Abba, Father".
J.T. I suppose relationship always produces affection. It is a wonderful thing to see that you have the liberty of the house. It gives you a footing in God's house, and you are perfectly free there. The Son abides in the house for ever; a servant may be cast out at any time.
{260}
Ques. Have the disciples the spirit of sonship in @John 20?
J.T. No doubt, in pattern. We must distinguish between the brethren of Christ and the sons of God. John gives us a company of people on earth who were the brethren of the ascended Man. The brethren of Christ and the sons of God are not the same thought. One is our relation to God, the other is our relation to Christ. They are the same people. The Lord having become man, He has a place in God's house permanently. Setting us free is really setting us free in sonship.
E.H.C. Does that apply in the Scripture: "I will be his God, and he shall be my son", @Revelation 21:7?
J.T. I suppose so; that would be a very precious thought to any one here now in responsibility.
W.J. Say a little more about the Son making us free.
J.T. It is based on the fact that the Son abides in the house for ever. The Lord having become man, He has a place in the house permanently; and I suppose we may apply the thought in Hebrews that He is Son over the house; so that, setting us free, it is really setting us free in sonship.
J.V. Do the ring and the shoes in @Luke 15 illustrate it? The ring gave him conferred authority and the shoes involved the recognition that he belonged to the family.
J.T. We are set free really in sonship; that is, "in freedom", @Galatians 5:1. You have to add that in @John 8.
A.S.L. The liberty of the house is found in the life of Christ risen.
J.T. In the life of the *ascended* Man. He sets us free from the upper storey, so to speak; everything begins from the top with God. There were three storeys in the ark. The Spirit of sonship is from Christ in heaven, from the glorified ascended
{261}
Man. Christianity is all from a heavenly platform. We are not only on resurrection ground, we are on ascension ground. You cannot understand @John 20 unless you see that christianity is inaugurated from heaven by the ascended Christ. I think we have lost sight of the heavenly side of things. We have to see divine thoughts indicating a special place for us. God gave evidence at the outset of a special place both in connection with Eden, the ark, the tabernacle, and the temple. He planted a garden in Eden, but Eden was a wider sphere than the garden; the garden was special. The ark was built with three stories. The tabernacle was made with the holiest as well as the court; and in the temple there were three tiers of chambers, the nethermost, the middle, and the third. So it is with regard to the assembly. I think we want to get hold of the special place that God has for us; the wonderful place that He has given the assembly, nothing could exceed it. "I go to prepare a place for you", @John 14:2. The emphasis ought to be on *you*. "I go to prepare a place for *you*".
Ques. In referring to ascension ground, do you mean that there is something beyond resurrection?
J.T. Certainly; christianity is inaugurated from heaven. We have a resurrection scene in @John 12. The Lord sat at the table and Lazarus was one of those who sat with Him. It is a risen man in association with Christ as such. But when we come to @John 20 He says, "I ascend"; and the Lord entered into that company as having said that. Though He did not actually ascend, He came in principle as the ascended Man. It is a pattern. How could you get the Spirit without that? He breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit", @John 20:22. We are brethren of the heavenly Christ.
E.H.C. In principle it is the gift of the Spirit.
J.T. It is. When we come to @Acts 2 we have
{262}
the actual descent of the Spirit. We leave out the greatest thought if we leave out "I ascend". The Son has the liberty of the house, and He ascends. He has full title to go anywhere in the house, and He ascends. It is not merely that He is *received* up, but He ascends up. Christianity is inaugurated from heaven. There is nothing more important than that.
E.H.C. John is complete in itself. We need Acts to complete Luke. John would not be complete without the gift of the Spirit, and we cannot have the Spirit apart from ascension; so ascension is involved in John.
J.V. "For their sakes I sanctify myself", @John 17:19. Did He have ascension in view?
J.T. You could not have the power of sanctification here without the ascension.
Ques. Does the ascension bring in the peculiar place of the church?
J.T. I think so; the peculiar place the disciples were brought into. Resurrection is not the ground on which the assembly stands; that does not go beyond the earth. Resurrection in itself does not involve what is heavenly. Ascension is the ground on which the church stands. Sonship involves ascension. That is, the Son can go anywhere in the house; He can go up. He says, "I ascend", and He has power and liberty to do so.
Rem. When you come to association with an ascended Christ, you have sonship.
J.T. The *name* is not so much, it is the *thing* you want. You have ascension in John. You have not the historical account of it there, but the Lord says, "I *ascend*". It is a question of the *things* with John; he deals with things essentially without calling them by name.
Ques. Does sonship involve a new system?
J.T. It involves a city -- "Jerusalem which is
{263}
above is free, which is the mother of us all", @Galatians 4:26. It came out historically in @Acts 9 when the Lord appeared to Saul. Saul called Him "Lord", but in truth he knew Him as Son.
W.J. It is the opening out of a new metropolis diverting from Jerusalem.
J.T. The house of God is universal. Place and country limit the affections to a section. Sectionalism has a great place among the people of God, but that is all wrong. That evil came out in @Acts 6. The house of God is pervaded by the Spirit of sonship, and the affections which belong to it, and therefore our affections should be universal.
The Galatians had come under the influence of bad teaching. They had first heard a gospel announced by a man who had sonship in his soul. Paul says, "God ... revealed his Son in me, that I may announce him", @Galatians 1:16. They did not want anything more than that for gospel, but the erroneous teachers said, 'You require something more'. They wanted to introduce the spirit of slavery into the house as well as the spirit of sonship; that is, to keep Isaac and Ishmael together.
E.H.C. Paul calls it going back to weak and beggarly elements.
F.K. Why does sonship involve a city?
J.T. That Person, the Son, must have a centre, a metropolis; and so it is introduced in this chapter. Jerusalem had been the centre. Going back to the types; if a man purchased a house in a walled city, and it was not redeemed within a year, it belonged to the purchaser for ever; see @Leviticus 25:29. If a field were sold he could redeem it, and if he did not do so it had to return to its original owner in the year of jubilee. Israel had wonderful privileges, but they did not take advantage of them. We have come into the inheritance, however, and we shall *not* lose it. We have come into certain blessings
{264}
which belonged to Israel, and they have not been redeemed within the year, so they belong to the church for ever. If we go in for earthly possessions we *shall* lose them. Barnabas sold a field, an earthly possession, and he got a place in the city.
J.V. What answers to the year during which the man might redeem his possession? Is it God's longsuffering with Israel after the ascension of Christ?
J.T. So it appears to me. The gentile has come into the "walled city", and is placed there eternally. The truth is seen in connection with the types. We do not want to be fanciful, but if you have the truth of christianity in your *soul* you are safe in using the types.
J.V. They are but illustrations, but very forcible ones, and there may be many applications.
J.T. Yes; the "commandment is exceeding broad", @Psalm 119:96. If you have the *thing* you can use the *types*, but if you attempt to use the types without the things, you make havoc.
It is a great thing for a young believer to see that he has a title to be in God's house. Many believers are on the ground of legality; they feel as they come in amongst us that there is a tax upon them. If we expect from one another we impose a tax. We have to be *givers*. To give occasion to the thought that we expect from one another is damaging, because that puts people under a tax.
W.J. The enjoyment of life always precedes the expression of life. In the thought of the house we have a place of privilege and enjoyment.
J.T. God's thought of a family is delightful: parents and children with reciprocal affections flowing out. If you are in the dignity of sonship you would not *demand* from anybody; you are great enough to *impart;* you become wealthy in love.
{265}
Rem. "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another", @Romans 13:8.
J.T. If you are in the good of sonship you have plenty of that.
Rem. One would not then complain about there not being much love in a meeting.
J.T. The only one to complain about would be one's self. "Jerusalem ... above ... is the mother of us all", @Galatians 4:26. It gives us character; we are formed by it. A child begotten of a slave such as Hagar, would have the spirit of a slave. In other words, a christian brought up under legal conditions, a believer in judaism, is formed by the spirit of slavery and fear. Hagar could be cast out at any time, and rightly, as we know she was.
W.J. In @John 8 they are Ishmaelites.
J.T. Exactly; they were about to be cast out, whereas the Son was there and would remain.
E.H.C. Do we get sonship in @Romans 8? "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God", @Romans 8:14.
J.T. @Romans 8 treats of the Spirit of God more than of sonship, but it introduces sonship among other things. The apostle says, If you recognise the Spirit, that marks you off as a son. Sonship is one of the blessings involved in the Spirit.
Ques. Does sonship involve state?
J.T. Certainly; you cannot think of God having sons without state, but you must have the *light* before you can have state. Sonship is light, but it produces state. In Galatians is really the gospel; the gospel is the announcement of God's Son, "that I might preach him", chapter 1:16.
A.S.L. "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings". Would that involve that by the reception of the gospel they would be brought into sonship?
J.T. You are not content with your converts if they are not brought into sonship; and you must
{266}
have the house of God for the enjoyment of sonship, because it is there that the relationship is enjoyed.
Ques. Is there a connection between "Christ liveth in me" (@Galatians 2:20), and the enjoyment of sonship?
J.T. That is an allusion to Isaac. Isaac occupied the house.
A.S.L. It is really the life in which sonship is known and enjoyed.
J.T. Quite so; you give him all the place in your heart; you are not thinking of yourself. When the feast was made Isaac was everything in the house; he occupied all the house.
A.S.L. Then you have the blessed consciousness of being before God in the life of the risen One. "No longer live, I, but *Christ* lives in me", @Galatians 2:20.
J.T. The apostle says as much as he can about those to whom he is writing. He says of the Galatians that they are sons, but then he also says, "be as I am; for I am as ye are", @Galatians 4:12. They were sons as he was; but he wanted them to be in the liberty of sonship, that they should be led of the Spirit. We are led of the Spirit if sons.
A.S.L. Christ formed in the saints is the normal state.
J.T. The apostle's first exercise, the preaching, had brought that to pass in them primarily, but then they became affected by bad teaching. The introduction of the gospel requires great exercise on the part of the preacher. The apostle had to travel over the ground again, and it involved a great deal of exercise to him.
A.S.L. Christ being formed in the saints, they would understand what it means for Ishmael to be cast out and Isaac to be supreme.
{267}
J.T. What a scene it was in Abraham's house when the feast was made! Isaac was everything; he was weaned. I have no doubt that Abraham saw that Christ was there, in type, *in that house*.
A.S.L. The natural effort is to keep both Ishmael and Isaac in the house.
J.T. In Christendom it has come to that.
A.S.L. The man after the flesh "persecuted" the other. It is a remarkable expression to use, for when we come to Genesis we find that the persecution was merely mocking.
J.T. Isaac had no power to persecute. Ishmael could mock, he was fourteen years old, he had power to persecute; but Isaac was a babe, and he could not persecute. One who is in the good of sonship can never persecute. It is the man after the flesh who persecutes.
{268}
THE HEAVENLY CITY
@Revelation 21:9 - 27; @Revelation 22:1 - 7
J.T. It has been suggested that we might look at the church as the heavenly city. I should like to take it up in its *bearing* upon us *now*, not merely as it will be in the future.
For those who were not here this afternoon it may be well to say that sonship was the subject before us, and the subject of the heavenly city was suggested as suitable to follow on. There can be no question that sonship is connected with the city. The gospel of Matthew is intended to show that what existed before in connection with an earthly system is now connected with what is heavenly.
In Mark we get service taken up in the Son. "The gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God", @Mark 1:1. Everything that has been connected with man in the flesh is now taken up and connected with the Son. In Matthew's gospel we get what illustrates how things which were formerly connected with an earthly system are now connected with what is heavenly. Up to chapter 17 sonship is developed. The Spirit shows how the divine thread is taken up. Sonship is taken up in Christ; it was indicated in Israel, "Out of Egypt have I called my son", @Matthew 2:15. In chapter 3 He is proclaimed from heaven as such; "*This* is my beloved Son" (@Matthew 3:17) and in chapter 17 He is owned from heaven on the mount of transfiguration as Son. Moses and Elias did not speak as sons, but now the Son is here. So the *speaking* now is to be *in the Son*, and hence the character of the message -- "Hear ye him", @Matthew 17:5. Then you get the Lord associating others with Himself as sons. He says to Peter, "that take, and give unto them for me and thee", @Matthew 17:27. "Then are the sons free", @Matthew 17:26. Then in chapter 18, you get
{269}
that the sons form the assembly, and that is the *present aspect* of the city. There you get the transference of what was connected with earth to what is heavenly. I do not connect chapter 16 with the truth of sonship as in relation to us. There Christ is the "Son of the *living God*", @Matthew 16:16. But what I have before me now is sonship in connection with our coming into liberty.
A.S.L. How do you distinguish between life and liberty?
J.T. The Spirit of sonship has to be taken account of in both aspects, liberty and life. The "Son of the living God" is in contrast to all that went before; the legal system was characterised by death, so nothing subsisted. In Christ things subsist, and everything is established in Christ. The resurrection is the great evidence of God's power, but *liberty* comes from heaven.
P.R.M. We are never sons as He is Son. We are sons by adoption.
J.T. Quite so. In Matthew that is carefully guarded. I only refer to that to bring it home in a practical way. To have to say to the things of God we must know liberty. Christ took up the will of God, not as a legal obligation, but in the consciousness of sonship, in the liberty of affection. The things of God must be taken up in that way. The gospel of Mark is beautiful. Everything there is done suitably. Divine service is carried out perfectly. Christ's *heart* was in everything He did.
H.T. "The Father seeketh such to worship him", @John 4:23. "To serve the living God", @Hebrews 9:14. Is it not service in the sense of worship?
J.T. I was thinking of @Matthew 18 as showing what corresponds on earth to what is above. Jerusalem above has what answers to it on earth. Ananias in @Acts 9 is brought into accord with heaven in regard of what was upon earth. The principles
{270}
of the heavenly city *now* are what is before us. The heavenly city comes down from God out of heaven. She is marked by liberty. She is not *sent down;* she *comes* down. The Lord says: "I ascend", @John 20:17. He is in liberty. I admit it is in virtue of His Person that He ascends, but there is also the idea of liberty, and the heavenly city is in liberty; she "*comes* down", @Revelation 3:12. So in the city we get sonship; she comes down from God *out of heaven*. She is in liberty, the liberty of sonship. The formative work is going on now; that is to say, the residents of that city are in view now. In 2 Corinthians we get some idea of the character of the inhabitants of the city. Our present condition, our present abode, is referred to as a tabernacle, "our earthly tabernacle house"; whereas the building from God is "eternal in the heavens", @2 Corinthians 5:1. The residence in the "walled city" is eternal; that which you never lose.
Ques. In what way can we view the saints at the present day as a city?
J.T. In the Acts the assembly as built up by the apostles became the centre of all divine operations. Jerusalem was the centre from which everything had proceeded; but from chapter 9 you get a turning-point; from that point everything *begins* from heaven, and everything is *directed* from heaven.
P.R.M. Why does Paul's name not come into the foundation of the heavenly city?
J.T. The *inward* work was what Paul had to do with. Her shining with the glory of God is the result of Paul's work. "For the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", @2 Corinthians 4:6. The light of the glory of God in that passage is a question of what shines in the face of Jesus Christ. The Son only could make the covenant effective. The glory in @2 Corinthians 4 is that the covenant was made effective, but the Son only could do that.
{271}
When Paul saw the turning point, that all is directed from heaven, he preached that Jesus is the Son of God. That makes it universal. The full effect of the gospel is to form the heavenly city. Divine administration is to be carried on here on earth, and for that we must be in sonship, so that we may handle things in the dignity and liberty of sonship. It is a great thing to have things taken up in the light and liberty of sonship.
The assembly superseded Jerusalem upon earth. Barnabas was a good man and he rejoiced in the work of God going on outside Jerusalem, and he went and sought out Paul, as much as to say, he is the man who has the light for the moment. Then you get the results of the apostle's ministry in Ephesus, "fellow-citizens of the saints", @Ephesians 2:19. There you get the city, and every thought of God is gathered up and established in the structure brought about by Paul's ministry. When saints are brought into the good of sonship the administration is what is before them. Sonship is what prepares for divine administration.
Ques. What is the "temple"?
J.T. It is where the light of God is maintained. The light which came into Paul's soul was Christ as God's Son; "to reveal his Son in me", @Galatians 1:16. That was the light which shines in Christ as Son; but the element of authority was necessary because Paul was rebellious. In @Acts 9 the *lordship* of Christ is asserted, but when Paul *spoke* of Him, he spoke of Him as the "Son of God". "He preached Jesus that he is the Son of God", @Acts 9:20.
McK. What do you preach?
J.T. It is easy to preach when you love the Person of whom you preach. It is a wonderful moment when you confess Him as the Son of God. He will take you up then; He can use you then.
E.H.C. Peter had the revelation of Christ as
{272}
the Son of the living God, but he *preached* Him as Lord and Christ. Paul knew Him as Lord, but He *preached* Him as the Son of God.
J.T. Peter did what he was called to. He had to administer the kingdom and so he had to announce the *King;* at least, Christ as *Lord*.
W.J. Behind all true administration is sonship.
J.T. That is most important. If we do not get hold of that we shall not understand the gospels.
S. What is the administration in view of?
J.T. It is for the will of God, and all rule is in view of that. The Son has taken up the kingdom; all administration is in His hand. The Father is the sovereign Ruler, and He hath given all things into His hand; everything now centres in Christ and the "babes". See @Matthew 11:25 - 27. The administration is positive. The gift of the Spirit is administration.
A.S.L. The formative work is going on now.
J.T. The light of sonship and the city is to form us for that administration. It is all the exercises that go on in this scene. I think the exercise is connected with the twenty-four elders. They were elders, they had experience. In taking up the obligations that belong to our position here as connected with the testimony the exercises we go through help to form us. If we go on with the work of administration here we shall not find it a strange work by-and-by. The twenty-four elders are in sympathy with the throne; so, too, are the living creatures. I think the latter represent what God secured for Himself in creation; the elders represent intelligent sympathy as the effect of exercise and experience. The elders are experienced; they represent all the exercise in connection with the testimony all the way down from Abel. The disciples were put into the place of administration. He sets us, too, to do things; the work is really His, but He
{273}
gives us help with it, like a father who sets his son to do something, and he comes and gives a hand to it, but it is his son who is doing it.
Ques. What is administration? Is it in connection with the world or with the saints?
J.T. Well, we are to be beneficent towards the world. Forgiveness is to mark us, and what is done on earth is ratified in heaven. All divine operations on earth are centred in the assembly. Read the Acts and you will see that. "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them", @Acts 13:2. There is no difference in principle between administration now and in the future. There will be no imperfection in the heavenly city, but in principle the administration will be the same. I think administration is a question of influence. Rule should be influence. Nothing is more important in the household than influence, and it is the preponderating principle in the heavenly city. It is rule by influence.
P.R.M. Is that the force of *coming down* -- ever shedding its administrative influence?
E.H.C. There is no depth in the city in @Revelation 21. There is length, breadth and height.
J.T. I suppose it does descend to the earth. In Ephesians you get depth, but there it is the question of the domain of Christ.
{274}
DIVINE WRITING
@2 Corinthians 3
J.T. There are two divine ways of communication; speaking and writing. God *spoke* before He *wrote*. Speaking necessarily comes before writing. In creation God's voice is heard; @Psalm 19 shows this. "There is no speech and there are no words, yet their voice is heard", @Psalm 19:3. God had a voice in the creation for man. Writing necessitates material, and I think this epistle to the Corinthians shows that God has now found the suitable material on which to write.
Ques. Do you mean that the speaking produced the material?
J.T. The speaking is an objective thought. Speech, we may say, is for the moment; but a writing is permanent. Therefore I think that God wrote on the tables so as to leave the declaration of His will among men permanently. The voice in the creation reminded man of His eternal power and divinity; all it does is to suggest certain things. The creation is a sort of index to the spiritual world, so that men are set in motion by its suggestions, exercise is produced, and nothing is perhaps more interesting in the physical world than the variety it suggests -- infinite variety.
Rem. If the creation of the world suggests variety, then we may expect variety in the new world?
J.T. Yes; man has had nothing to do with the creation of the heavens and the earth; God has done it to suggest, so to speak, what is in His mind for His pleasure.
In regard to resurrection, what comes to light is that God gives to it a body as He pleases, @1 Corinthians 15:38. There will be a world out of death, and this
{275}
will be marked by variety; it will be for God's pleasure.
Rem. In what is coming in there will be the heavenly and the earthly.
J.T. Yes; there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon", @1 Corinthians 15:41. There is variety in flesh, too: "one flesh is of men, and another flesh of beasts"; all indicating the variety of things that is in God's mind in regard to His world. I think creation is an indication of that.
Ques. How do you connect the writing with that?
J.T. I was speaking of the voice that God has in creation. In order to write you must have material, and I think that the first writing of God on the tables of stone showed the character of man's heart; it was hard and unimpressionable. There was no suitable material for Him to write on. It was touching that Moses came down from the mount with the writing, and the tables were written on both sides, "written with the finger of God" (@Exodus 31:18); as if God were saying that He would write all He could for man.
Ques. Do you mean that the stone on which God wrote was an indication of the state of man's heart?
J.T. Yes, it was unimpressionable and unsympathetic with what was written upon it, whereas the renewed heart is sympathetic and impressionable. It is most touching to think of Moses coming down with the tables in his hands. He knew well what he had was God's mind for the people, but they were unprepared for the divine writing, and hence he broke the tables of stone; but still you have there the thought of God to place amongst men permanently, the transcript of His mind, but He intimates in the using of the stone that the right material was not there. Israel were no ordinary stones; Israel had been taken up and *cultured* by
{276}
God; and the stone had been formed by God Himself.
Ques. *They* were the tables of stone?
J.T. Yes; but God formed them Himself; that is to say, He had wrought upon Israel: they were in God's *culture*, they had had great advantages, but the tables of stone intimated the character of the heart of man even under divine culture and care.
Ques. What is the thought of their being put into the ark?
J.T. The tables represent the divine law, but I was thinking of the *material* of the tables; the writing was precious. The ark was typical of Christ. He took up the law and put it into His heart; *His* heart was not stone. The ark was typical of Christ in that respect, that He had the law of God in His heart.
Rem. It was the ministration of death and condemnation.
J.T. I was speaking of the *material* on which God wrote; if Israel had had renewed hearts, God would not have written on the stones. He wrote on the stones, because there was nothing better, and the stones intimated the character of man's heart.
Rem. It was as unimpressionable to grace as to law. When the Lord was here He wrote on the ground, and His whole ministry of grace made no difference on man.
J.T. Quite so. I think the Lord's first writing on the ground in @John 8, put man out. He stooped down and wrote, and then He stoops again, and when He rises they had all gone out; the first writing put man out; and the second writing, in principle, retains man. The woman is retained in the Lord's presence, and the Lord says to her, "Neither do I condemn thee", @John 8:11. The second writing, I think, refers to His death. In His death He established a ground
{277}
on which man might remain before God -- man without sin.
Rem. On the principle of law man must go, but if he is to be retained it is on the principle of grace.
J.T. Quite so, and the Lord's second writing on the ground refers to His death. How could He retain man otherwise?
Rem. His death put the first man out.
J.T. But they *went* out. His word, which referred to the law, convicted them. I think their going out is not the thought of man being removed from God's eye judicially; they were convicted and went out. But after writing the second time He asks, "Has no one condemned thee?", @John 8:10. No one is left, but Himself, but He is going into death. He is the only One who had title to condemn, but instead of condemning He writes, and that indicated His *death*.
Ques. God has spoken in the last days in Son. What is the connection?
J.T. That is objective, but He left something here on earth in writing.
Ques. Is it the speaking that produces that?
J.T. It is by the Spirit of the *living* God. But we must have the heart of flesh, otherwise grace would have effected nothing, any more than law, because grace was there in Christ, and it only produced hatred, hence there must be a heart of flesh. God speaking is objective, but what I see is that God has *written*, and He has left the writing here as it were. It works out in christian affection.
Rem. Ye are the epistle of Christ.
J.T. Yes. Now you get what is responsive. Paul shows what the thing means; he says, "*Ye* are our letter, ... known and read of all men".
Ques. They were written in his heart. How does that work out now?
{278}
J.T. He indicates what the writing meant; that is, they were in his heart, and he says, "*Ye* are our letter, ... known and read of all men". Then he goes on to say what they were; they were Christ's letter.
Ques. There are then two thoughts in it?
J.T. I think the first is that the Corinthians were Paul's letter written in his heart, not in their hearts, but in *his* heart. Wherever he went he spoke well of them.
Rem. The Lord would have the principle hold good for us in affection for the saints, carrying them about in our hearts.
J.T. I think that is what is meant by "Ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ". Paul had the saints in his heart; that is the thing to get hold of. You will never understand the second epistle unless you see that Paul is formed after Christ; he had affections similar to Christ. Christ had the saints in His heart, so that He died for them.
Rem. Then he wants to bring them into line with himself.
J.T. Yes. The second epistle of Corinthians is the restorative epistle, and therefore the importance of the *writing*. The feature in the first epistle was that the apostle could not come to them, because if he came, it would have meant judgment. He loved them so much that he did not come. Now Moses *did* come into the camp. It was impossible for Moses to have remained away, because idolatry was actually set up. With the Corinthians it was not quite so bad as that, but they were getting into that condition, so Paul did not come into their midst. He stayed away in order to give them the opportunity to repent. With Israel the condition in the camp was so bad that the only thing for Moses was to come into their midst in judgment, but in Corinth
{279}
things were not quite so bad, and instead of judgment there was restoration. The two epistles correspond with the two givings of the law in the book of Exodus.
Rem. It was out of affection that Paul did not go.
J.T. That is the point. Paul was there formed after Christ. He says, so to speak, 'It is out of affection for you that I have not come'. The first epistle corresponds with Moses coming down the first time. He had set the people up under law, under the first covenant; he had left the divine injunctions with them, and he went up into the mount. In that way they were tested. The question was whether they could obey during the absence of the mediator. The first epistle to the Corinthians is on that ground. The apostle had left the Corinthians, but had left with them the divine commandments, and the question was whether they had kept the commandments. He could not come to them. Paul was prepared to come in with the divine thoughts. Moses came down from the mount with wonderful thoughts; he had all the divine light in regard to Christ set forth in the tabernacle, but he could not come into the camp with it because they were not prepared for it. Think of all the wonderful things as to Christ that God had in His mind to set forth, all that was to be communicated to the people, but their state was too bad. So it is today; if there is not loyalty of heart to Christ, you will not get the light of God's counsel; you will not come into the good of headship.
Rem. If we are to know anything of the privileges to which we are called, the foundations must be right.
J.T. I think so. If we cannot obey we are not prepared for headship. Headship involves the opening up of divine wisdom and counsel, and Moses had *that* in his possession when he came down from
{280}
the mount, but Israel was deprived of it all on account of their state. It is a serious thing to be wanting in affection to Christ, for if we are wanting in it we disregard His commandments, and then we get no light, and consequently we do not get the good of His headship.
Ques. What does headship imply?
J.T. It means the opening up of God's mind. You see it in figure in David communicating to Solomon all the details of the temple. Solomon had only to carry out the directions left by David. Israel never got the good of headship until David was recognised as king. It is when he is recognised as king, not only at Hebron, but by all the tribes, that he brings up the ark, and then he opens up the divine thoughts in regard to the *house of God*.
Rem. The close of his life had reference to the building of the house of God?
J.T. Yes, he gives all the instructions to Solomon. Solomon has only to carry them out.
Ques. Does that come out in the second epistle to the Corinthians?
J.T. The second epistle shows that the people were restored. Instead of going into the camp, like Moses, Paul had stayed away in affection for them. The result was their recovery. The first point of recovery is in the Son; the Son is the point of recovery. Paul shows them that God's faithfulness is in the *Son*. He shows that the Son of God is not yea and nay. It is a question of faithfulness being in a Person in the relation of the Son, so that the affections of the saints are so touched that recovery comes in. Departure takes place in the heart; "thou hast left thy first love", @Revelation 2:4.
Ques. Why does he begin with glory?
J.T. The second epistle answers to the second giving of the law. The first epistle had reference to the first giving of the law. Moses was actuated by
{281}
the Spirit of Christ, and he had to come in in judgment. Paul, too, was actuated by the Spirit of Christ. Moses stood in the breach, and he asked to be blotted out of God's book instead of the people. That is the Spirit of Christ. Paul was actuated by the same spirit, so he remained away, for he knew if he came into their midst it would be judgment. The second giving of the law is what we have here; so we have the shining of Moses¬ face. Moses pleads for the people and God reveals His name, and then He acts in sovereign mercy; so when Moses comes down the second time his face is shining. Moses was Christ in figure and prevails with Jehovah; God comes out in mercy, so Moses¬ face shines.
Ques. "Hew thee two tables of stone", @Exodus 34:1. Is that what you mean?
J.T. Yes; the second tables are formed by Moses. There would be a new covenant, and the second giving of the law pointed to the new covenant. The second giving of the law was not the same as the first. The second tables were made by Moses and his face was shining. There was the mixture of grace in the second giving of the law.
Rem. They were then in a condition to receive divine communications.
J.T. Yes; after Christ has obtained His place in our hearts we are in condition to be led on. The second epistle prepares us for headship. "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image". That involves that you are won by Christ; your heart is captured.
Rem. That is very beautiful; there is no such thing as getting an apprehension of things unless we know what individual contact with Christ is in the affections of our hearts.
J.T. I think so. This epistle is a question of recovery; everything is on that principle now, so
{282}
this epistle is exceedingly interesting, and the point of recovery is affection. If God wins your heart He will do something with it. What God wants is men's *hearts*. He wants the suitable material on which to write. He wants to write on them by the Spirit.
Ques. Is there a connection between the first and second part of chapter 3, in this, that it is by occupation with Christ in glory that the transformation takes place?
J.T. But you get more than the writing; you get the writing in the first part of the chapter and you get the *order of man* in the second. We are all looking at the *same* thing, and we are changed into the *same* image. That is not His image, though that is involved, but we all become alike and we are of the same order, as He is, and that is more than writing.
Rem. I had not seen that before; we are changed into the *same* image.
J.T. God has brought to pass here a race that are all alike, and that is brought to pass by beholding the glory of the Lord.
Ques. "Not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God". Is that the Spirit writing Christ on the heart?
J.T. I think so.
Rem. Stephen "looked up stedfastly", @Acts 7:55.
J.T. Yes. The word "same" is very important; it lays the basis for unity: similarity renders unity possible; we are all changed into the *same* image.
Rem. It is the writing on the heart that produces it.
J.T. First of all God gets your heart. If God gets your heart He will write upon it. You will be marked by interest in His people, you are concerned about the saints, you love the saints; that is the writing of Christ.
Ques. What is "beholding the glory?"
{283}
J.T. You are now engaged with *Him*. He is an object to your heart, and therefore you are changed from glory to glory. Marvellous thought! A race of men upon earth formed in that way all after Christ, and yet there must be variety in them, but they are all formed after Christ.
Ques. Is it *moral* glory; the traits of Christ coming out?
J.T. Yes; and it is from glory to glory, there is no end to it; it is from one glory to another.
Ques. Is that headship?
J.T. I think it makes way for it. You are now looking at the Lord, and hence you are prepared to be led on into divine thoughts. The glory of the Lord here is that He effected the covenant. He made good God's love. That is the glory that shines in the face of the Lord. "The same image" refers to the saints being formed in divine love. I believe it underlies unity; you cannot have unity apart from *sameness*. We are united, not because we agree together, but because we are the *same*, we have drunk into the *same Spirit*. Here we are beholding the *same Lord*. There is no other family like christians.
Ques. How would it affect us, supposing the assembly today were like the Corinthians? How would it affect you today if you were one of that company? We have not the apostle here now. How would you order things?
J.T. Love never fails; and as a matter of fact what marked Paul was that he acted in love. His was a most remarkable situation; his apostleship was disputed, but he did not resort to authority, and his stand-by was *love*. His apostleship would not have met the case at all, so that it is very encouraging that here we have what never fails. Paul had the authority and the power to go in person, but instead of that he falls back on love.
{284}
Rem. And love never fails.
J.T. It never does, and never will; however serious the crisis may be, love succeeds; that is what God is. He has devised means by which man will be recovered. He met man's rebellion in love.
Rem. That was where the Corinthians failed -- in love.
J.T. That is why Paul brings love in abstractly in chapter 13. He could not say that it was *there;* he puts it forward as a test. I believe the point of departure is want of love for Christ.
Ques. Is that the way the material was secured for writing?
J.T. I think so; you yield yourself to Christ. "Son, give me thine heart", @Proverbs 23:26. The terms "son" and "daughter" indicate God's way of appealing to the affections. God wants man's *heart*. It is a wonderful thing that the Lord has material here on which to write, and that material is our hearts.
Rem. There could be no assent at all without affection for Christ, because by nature we do not love God or Christ.
Ques. Does the writing go on continuously, that the result may come out by-and-by; Christ expressed in His people?
J.T. Just so; but the result is to be seen *now*.
Ques. How does "liberty" come in in verse 17? "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".
J.T. It is the atmosphere, so to speak, of Christ. It does not refer to the Holy Spirit exactly. You come into touch with Christ. We all throw out an atmosphere about us. The Spirit of the Lord is *liberty*. It is what you come into in coming near to Christ. It is the Spirit that pervades the assembly. It is the Spirit of the Mediator of the new covenant. It says, "Now the Lord is that Spirit".
The point of recovery is in the Son, who is in the affections of God.
{285}
THE DIVINE GIFT
@John 4:1 - 24
There are various connections in which the Spirit of God is introduced. We have here the Spirit presented, as showing the value of the divine gift. "If thou knewest the gift of God". It expresses the nature of the gift. The gift here is commensurate with the position in which the Lord is viewed in chapter 3. He is viewed there are having all things given into His hands; the Son is seen as receiving all the Father had. In order to rightly esteem the full import of the gift we receive, we have to see the position in which the Lord is viewed in John. He is not viewed there in relation to anything that existed before, but as in regard of *God*. "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him", @John 1:18.
As becoming Man on earth, Christ is the Object of divine affections, and this in the presence of men. In becoming Man He appears as One whom God has marked off as His only begotten Son. It is of great importance to see what it was for God to have a Son on earth. We often speak of the Spirit as on our side; what He is to us, but we must see Him as commensurate with the position given to the Son.
Ques. What connection has the Spirit with "all things"? Chapter 3:35.
J.T. God's giving is according to Himself; not simply to meet the needs of our souls. "If thou knewest the gift", or manner of giving, as we may say; the attitude of soul in asking is answered according to the divine situation, that is, the relation in which the Son stands to the Father as having
{286}
received all things from His hand. All divine operations in the saints are by the Spirit. The gift of the Spirit shows the nature of divine giving.
Rem. The gift is to enable the soul to enter into the full blessing.
J.T. What the woman *might* have asked for is not the question; the giving would be in accord with that which is established in chapter 3. What is set forth there is "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand", @John 3:35.
Ques. Is the gift of the Spirit to enable us to enter into the things that are revealed?
J.T. Yes, but He is greater than all results. It is not an official order of things in chapter 3; it is an order of things established in divine Persons as such. The gift is greater than any result; what the Lord had in His mind was the greatness of the gift of God. It is a question of what divine Persons will do.
The earlier chapters show a divine Person on earth. God's Spirit had always been in activity during the Old Testament times, but never found a *resting place* (like Noah's dove) till the Son became man; so the Spirit descends in the form of a dove upon Him and *remains* on Him. God has reached His Sabbath in the Son; a permanent resting place. It is before man's eye; God would show what He thinks of Christ. It is not a statement of what Christ is eternally, but what God found in Christ on *earth*. I believe that unless we see the position in which the Lord is viewed in manhood, as the Son, we shall fail to see the greatness of the gift to us. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" (@John 3:16) -- that is His gift *for us*. It is not stating what is involved in *God* having the Son here on earth. The earlier chapters show this.
In the beginning of chapter 3 the Lord was dealing with man and shows that He is perfectly acquainted
{287}
with what is in man. "He knew what was in man", @John 2:25. In chapter 3 He shows He knew what man *needed;* it is not simply what the Old Testament taught: the Old Testament taught the necessity for new birth, but that is not the point here. It is, "*I* say unto thee", @John 3:3,5.
Ques. Why emphasise that?
J.T. Speaking as a divine Person He is not simply instructing from the Old Testament; it was a question of what *He* said. He shows that Nicodemus ought to have known these things. In speaking to Nicodemus He tells him what man needs. He must be born again and the Son of man must be lifted up. The Spirit is characteristically the Gift; as the Son is given *for* us, the Spirit is given *to* us. If you ask from God, His gift is not restricted to what you ask; His giving is in accordance with His nature. "If thou knewest the *gift* of God ... thou wouldest have asked". The Lord does not say *what* she would have asked, but He tells her what she would *receive*. The Father had now found One whom He could trust, and He loves the Son, and all things are given into the hands of that One whom He loves. I would like to convey that as clearly as possible. The things are in the hands of One whom the Father loves. The place the Son has with the Father is the situation, and the Spirit is given as commensurate with this situation. In result God has His portion. If things are given into the hands of the Son, it necessarily follows that God will have His portion. That is worked out in this chapter. There is that which is *for God*. John presents things *for God*. God *had not* been known, but He *would* be known, hence "the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, *he hath declared him*", @John 1:18. The gift is connected with the position in which the Son is with the Father. What kind of giving would it be from a Man in the full
{288}
favour of the Father? It is divine Persons acting for themselves.
Ques. Does chapter 4 show the result for God -- worship in spirit and in truth?
J.T. Yes; the Father has His share. "*The* Son" is *the Person;* as *the* Son He stands alone, but the expression "Son of God" opens up the door for others.
Ques. Does the gift of living water give life?
J.T. It springs up into everlasting life. The Spirit is life. The Holy Spirit in the believer gathers up, so to say, all his affections, and centres them in divine Persons.
The revelation of God produces confidence in the heart of man. If you see the position of the Son as man with the Father it produces confidence; and confidence leads you to *ask;* and the Lord shows here that the giving would be in accord with that position, and not according to our need. Without the living water there cannot be worship; the Holy Spirit takes up all our affections and centres them on divine Persons. If the Son (who is in all the affection of the Father) is at the well of Samaria, what would that promote, but confidence in the heart of one who had apprehended His heart? Think of Him in such a position as needing a drink of water, and asking for it from this poor outcast! He says, "If thou knewest the *gift of God*, and *who* it is that saith to thee, Give to me drink; thou wouldest have asked of him".
What you get here is the nature of the gift and the result. A divine Person was there who was acquainted with the whole situation. Then He speaks in all the dignity of a divine Person. "We speak that we do know", @John 3:11. We shall not understand chapter 3 unless we see in it Christ, on the divine side, acting in the interests of the Father, and under motives which were in God's
{289}
nature. What is the effect on you when you take this teaching in? It impresses you with what God is. No one had seen Him, He was alone, and God *felt* that. He *wanted* to be known. Into the Son's hands the Father has committed everything, so that the expectations of our hearts may be boundless. Think of Elisha; the courage with which he asked Elijah for a double portion of his spirit. He was equal to the occasion; Elijah said he had asked for "a hard thing", @2 Kings 2:10. He asked for the *full* portion of the *first-born*. Faith lays hold on what is presented on the divine side. You cannot conceive of a greater gift than the Spirit. There can be no greater gift.
@John 20 shows how the sphere was extended; there was to be a generation like Christ. Christ had been alone under God's eye, but now God would bring in a generation like Him. The generation was to be, not simply His brethren in *resurrection*, but His brethren in *ascension*. It is the One who ascends who comes into their midst and breathes on them and says, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (@John 20:22): it is the Spirit of the ascended Man. I may give a sort of illustration from Gideon, @Judges 8:18,19. When Gideon makes inquiries of the kings of Midian as to what kind of men they had slain, they reply "As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king", @Judges 8:18. "They were my *brethren*", Gideon says, "even the sons of my mother". There is to be a generation on earth like Christ.
The chapter suggests the blessing of Joseph in @Genesis 49:22. "Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall": but here the well is the Spirit; living water, @John 4. The fruitfulness is there.
In verse 13, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again" refers to natural sources of supply. This woman had had five husbands, she was never satisfied. The Lord presents something
{290}
that would be entirely satisfying. It is a question of our affections being gathered up for God. God gets back what is His own.
In verse 14 we see how our affections, instead of going out to the world, are all gathered up by the Spirit, and go back to the source whence they come. The Spirit could only come from the Son. Who else could give it? Who else is Administrator? These chapters are written for christians. It is not only for your intelligence, but for your affections. We need to lay emphasis on it; the persistent working of the Spirit in the affections of the believer. "Springing up into everlasting life", refers to the believer being brought in his affections into the sphere of divine affections, the affections that exist between the Father and the Son.
But there is a further thought and that is that God is to be worshipped, verse 21 - 24. It is an undeniable fact that all the gospels were written to christians; they show the full bearing of christianity. This chapter sets free from all earthly religious centres. There is now no centre of worship on earth. The Lord acknowledges fully the place Jerusalem had, but He makes known that there is no longer a centre on earth.
Ques. What is the difference between praise and worship?
J.T. The latter is higher, it is the outcome of your affection *for* and admiration *of*, a Person. You are lost in a Person. It is not homage merely; it is worship, it is your soul being entirely lost in a Person.
Ques. Is it connected specially with the Lord's day morning meeting?
J.T. I always connect it with the assembly. The Son effectuates the worship of the Father. The Father's desires shall be fully met. He *seeks* worshippers.
{291}
The water springs up to everlasting life. That is what the *believer gets*, but the Father has *His* portion. One of the surest evidences that Christ has come in and taken His place as Head is that everything in result will refer to the Father.
Ques. "The princes digged the well", @Numbers 21:18. Is that analogous to this?
J.T. Yes. It takes place in the wilderness. It refers to the power of life. They "spake against God, and against Moses", @Numbers 21:5. The natural man is set against God and against Christ, hence there must be a new source of affection. The only answer to the brazen serpent is the springing well, and this issues in the land of Canaan. Life eternal is being brought out; the sphere where divine affections are.
*Princes* are men of power, men of spiritual power, but they digged the well "by the direction of the *lawgiver*" -- on the authority of Christ, and so the wells are opened up. "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it", @Numbers 21:17. The Holy Spirit gets a recognised place, that is the point. If you give the Spirit His place all is well with you.
They "pitched ... toward the sun-rising", @Numbers 21:11. After the springing well, Og, the biggest man of the Old Testament appears, but the people do not fear him; he is overthrown directly.
{292}
FEET-WASHING
@John 13:1 - 29
J.T. If you had read on to verse 30 we should have seen that Judas went out; that is, there was a circle in which Christ's ministry was carried on, which was a circle of light, out of which Judas went. He went out of the circle of light, and he went out into the darkness which marks the present state of things; the conditions seen at this moment. It was a circle of light, where divine love was active, out of which Judas went; and he went into darkness.
My thought was that we might consider that which is *within* in connection with the activity of divine love taking the form of service one to another. There is a very beautiful thought in @Psalm 134 in regard to those who "by night stand in the house of the Lord". The present period is outwardly the period of night, but there is the circle in which there is light, and it is our privilege to be in that circle in readiness to take care of one another.
Rem. We need to know the Lord's love to His own before we can show it to one another.
J.T. Yes, that is the idea. The Lord sets before their eyes what their attitude should be during His absence, so that we have a pattern of how we are to conduct ourselves during His absence; that is the point of what He did. He said, "Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for *so* I am" (verse 13); and then He says, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (@John 13:35); or more correctly "love amongst yourselves". What I think saints should be exercised about is to have a reserve; a stock of love at all times. It is not that love is always to be active, but that the thing should be *there*, that it may be
{293}
ready to draw from at all times. It is that which stands by us, no matter what may be the conditions. This chapter indicates the most terrible condition in the very circle where Christ's ministry was set forth; it indicates betrayal and denial, but there was one resource, and that was divine love, and that is a great stand-by, and will be so until the end; it is a resource which will never fail us.
Ques. What do you mean by a reserve?
J.T. I mean that there is *abundance*. I think the Lord contemplates the love being there.
Rem. It should be there in reserve, so that when the moment comes it might be present in its activity.
J.T. Yes; you are never taken by surprise if you have love.
Rem. That is @1 Corinthians 13.
J.T. Exactly. "Love never fails" (@1 Corinthians 13:8) and that is a very strong expression. There is nothing else in the world, but what *will* fail.
Ques. Where is the reserve to be; in the assembly?
J.T. Yes, among "yourselves". The Lord contemplates their being here while He was away. Love has its origin in God: "We love him, because he first loved us", @1 John 4:19. But then, there is no limit to His love, and, in a sense, there should be no limit to ours. It should not only be in Christ, but, as the Lord says, "among yourselves". The Lord's action here sets forth the form that love takes; the form it takes in Christ. He takes the servant's form. He shows His love by His actions. He said: "I love my master, ... I will not go out free", @Exodus 21:5. There could be no question about it. He was in the place of a servant. Luke shows Him as the servant of man; John more as the servant of the saints. I think that love is the point for us today; nobody with love will ever be
{294}
disappointed or discouraged; he has something that will stand by him.
Ques. Is that the same principle that you get in the end of @Romans 8; the love of divine Persons? Nothing can separate from it; it does not give way.
J.T. Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ, nor from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus. It is a great thing to be in *possession* of things; "*have* love amongst yourselves".
Rem. Love in the saints is the evidence of life.
J.T. Yes. By this, "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren", @1 John 3:14.
Rem. The divine life comes out in that way.
J.T. Yes. Divine love has expressed itself in a Man in human circumstances, in circumstances such as our own, and that in the most simple way. He showed love in every-day circumstances. The last supper which He took with them was, of course, an extraordinary occasion, but ordinarily supper is a time when family affection would be active; and the Lord rises from supper. Supper is a peculiar kind of meal; it is not like the morning meal, or the mid-day meal; it is a meal at a time when the responsibilities of the day are over, and you are free. At the morning meal you have the day before you; its obligations, trials, etc., and so with the mid-day meal, but at supper all are free. I use this as an illustration.
The Lord's supper is an occasion when we should all be free in spirit, our minds should not be engaged with anything else. Of course, we meet in the beginning of the day, but our spirits should be free. In the beginning the saints met in the evening.
Rem. The details of the way in which the Lord Jesus acted at this time are very interesting. He gets everything for Himself; the basin, the water, the towel. He was ministering to them.
{295}
J.T. Yes, it sets forth the way divine love expresses itself; it supplies all that is needed. If you want to take pattern from Christ; if you want to wash the brethren's feet, you do not expect them to supply the need. You bring the supply with you.
Ques. Is that the *reserve*?
J.T. I think so. And you must bring the towel too, and not only that, but you must be *girded* with it. It is to be put to use by you in the character of a servant. It is important first of all to get the water.
Ques. What is the water?
J.T. Your soul is in the good of the death of Christ, and you should not assume that those whose feet you wish to wash have what is needed; it is *your* obligation as a servant to have the water and the towel.
Rem. Before He washed their feet it is said that "he loved them unto the end", @John 13:1.
J.T. That was the secret of it; there is no abatement in His love.
Ques. What is the significance of His taking off His garments?
J.T. That is divesting oneself of personal dignity. That is really what marks a servant. *His* action was suitable to what He was doing. If you serve the saints your personal dignity has to drop. In another sense we all have personal dignity; that is, divinely-given dignity, because God surrounds Himself with people whom *He* has dignified; but this dignity has reference to *God's* world, not to *this* world. It is dignity for God, but that is not the point here. Here the Lord is a Servant before man, so the point for us in His laying aside the garments is that *you* lay aside that which might distinguish you personally. You are thinking of others, not of yourself.
It is very interesting to pursue the history of the men of faith, and to see how they were marked by
{296}
interest in others. Faith has always an object outside of oneself. A man who has not faith is self-centred, but the true man of faith has an object, outside of himself, and the first illustration of it is Abel. The first man who had faith was a shepherd. Abraham was a keeper of his brother, of Lot; although Lot did not discern it, yet Abraham *was* a keeper of his brother, and when Lot was taken captive Abraham frees and recovers him. Jacob too was a shepherd, so were Moses and David. They had objects outside of themselves. You remember how Moses rolled away the stone that the flocks might get drink. And another remarkable thing is that a shepherd was an abomination to the Egyptians. Man in the flesh abominates the idea of caring for others; he is self-centred.
Rem. In that way you get the indications of a man of faith in a practical way when he gets an object outside of himself and an interest in God's people.
J.T. Yes, I believe the Spirit of God has indicated what should mark His people, that they should always have concern for one another.
Ques. Is there the same thought in what is said of Moses and the reproach of Christ in @Hebrews 11, and the way it comes out in @Psalm 69? "the reproaches of them that reproach thee", @Psalm 69:9. It seems connected with His care for that which belonged to God in this world.
J.T. Yes, Moses had regard for his brethren. He slew an Egyptian who was contending with a Hebrew. He had a right thought from the start, the preservation of God's people, but he had to go to the desert to learn that it was not in the power of the flesh that it was to be accomplished; and then
{297}
when he returns to Egypt he has to accept circumcision. If he is to be the leader of God's people it must be in another power, not in the power of the flesh.
To return to the feet-washing; in regard to the water, it is a very great thing to be able to refresh the people of God. "By love serve one another", @Galatians 5:13. We are in that way placed in the position of servants one to another; we love the Lord's people.
Ques. Does the basin answer to the laver?
J.T. Yes, that is the idea. In the case of the laver the water was standing there for the priests to wash thereat, but here the Lord *brings* the water. The great point is that you have it, and so you are able to refresh the Lord's people.
Rem. Everything was to be made after the pattern which Moses saw in the mount. *Now*, what we have is the example of the Master, and this is, to serve by love.
J.T. Yes, water is power to lift the affections of the saints outside of things that would only divert and defile them, lifting them out of these things by a presentation of Christ so that the mind and heart are refreshed. I believe that is what the water signifies, the power by which the minds and hearts of saints are refreshed.
Rem. Water is refreshment?
J.T. I think so; the mind and heart are refreshed.
Ques. Can one saint wash another's feet unconsciously?
J.T. Yes; indeed, it is wonderful how when we really come into touch with a spiritual man he brings an influence that seems to revive one.
Rem. The great thing is to be in the enjoyment of the Lord and His word; then there is the overflow unconsciously. You will minister that which lifts the saints out of their surroundings, and you wash their feet in that way.
{298}
J.T. And the towel sets them at ease. The Lord has a wonderful way of cleansing and of drawing to Himself, setting the person at ease in His presence, so that he feels comforted and refreshed.
Rem. It is not an official thing.
J.T. No, an official is always above the people. The official wears his garments, he does not lay them aside.
Ques. Is it the outcome of what you said at the first in reference to @Psalm 134, as to standing in the house of the Lord?
J.T. If a man is standing he is interested in something, waiting to do something. Standing in the house of the Lord is very blessed.
Rem. David's mighty men refreshed David.
J.T. Yes, and it cost them something, and it *does* cost us something; it costs us death. The man who washes the saints¬ feet rightly is over Jordan. He has accepted death for himself and carries the atmosphere of it with him.
Rem. And that is the water.
J.T. Yes, you are in the acceptance of death, but it is that which puts you in touch with Christ risen.
Ques. "Part with me", is that the end?
J.T. That is the point. If you have part with Christ, you want others to have part with Christ; you want all the saints transported over Jordan.
Rem. That is the result of being over Jordan oneself.
J.T. Yes, you want others there. There are many people who only go over Jordan when there is conflict, and one rejoices that they do; but then one sorrows for them when they go back, because they go away from God's circle to go *home;* their home is not in God's circle, and when they go back to Moab they fear that they are at a certain disadvantage, and that their title to the land may be

disputed, so they build an altar as if to say, 'We want you to understand that we have the title to the land, though we are not going to live there'.
Ques. How do you apply that now?
J.T. People who live in their families or in their business. Their supreme interest is in their families or in their business. They do not give up the truth, and they are ready to fight for it; but after the war they go home and set up an altar to show they have a *title* to go back, but they do not *live* there. We should be set for helping the saints over Jordan to the sphere where Christ is known.
Rem. John knew this. He leaned upon Jesus¬ bosom; he had confidence in Him.
J.T. Yes. He was "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (@John 21:20) and that means that he was the disciple who *enjoyed* His love.
Rem. It tests us when we take the Supper. When we are relieved of our pressure, where do we go? The Supper is the test.
J.T. I think so. Ordinarily supper is the meal in which you are most free from all that has been engaging you. At the Lord's supper the saints are, or should be, free from pressure and all else.
Rem. And it is in view of the Lord's *coming;* there is not the idea of going back to our own sphere again.
J.T. Exactly. Abraham learned circumcision in @Genesis 17; he was ennobled, and taken off the ground of the flesh, and put on the ground of the Spirit in principle, and his name was changed. In the next chapter he is in the light of that, he is at his tent door, free for a visitation. It is a good thing to be exercised about being free from secular things, so that the Supper might be rightly entered into, and it is in view of the Lord's coming, not in view of going back to this world. You have Christ before you. When the Lord is thus known it has a wonderful
{300}
effect upon you. You are set in motion. If the two disciples going from Emmaus had met any one, they would not have been disposed to stop and talk; they were on their way to Jerusalem.
Rem. Paul conferred not with flesh and blood.
Rem. What comes out in this chapter vindicates the truth of the first verse.
J.T. I think so. It is a service that continues. There is a circle of light, and it is marked by this kind of service, by the activity of love; that is what is there. If any one comes into contact with this circle he cannot deny the light because love is in activity. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves". There is wonderful encouragement for us in this. Divine love is the resource. It is always a standby to us. There is no failure in that.
Ques. In what sense is it a "new commandment" (@John 13:34)?
J.T. It was a new kind of thing shown in Christ.
Rem. Man in the flesh could not claim that.
J.T. No; it is shown here in Christ and is to be continued in the saints.
Rem. That is where you get the blessed activity of the love of Christ through the saints.
J.T. Yes, I think so, and it goes on to the end.
Rem. In verse 12 He *takes* His garments.
J.T. The service is over. He says, "Know ye what I have done to you?" So it is an object lesson for us. I think that John gives us that which exists until the end; in spite of the denial and betrayal, there is an element that stands by the saints under all circumstances. The next chapter shows what He will do for us when He is on high; the Comforter would come, but this chapter shows what would stand by us in the presence of betrayal and denial, and that is *love*.
{301}
Ques. What is the meaning of the towel.
J.T. The towel is that by which one is set at ease. If you are bigger than the one whom you serve, he is not at his ease; he is more or less in bondage; but if you are a true servant you will put those you serve at their ease; there is no superiority; love never assumes to be superior. The Lord when here was the servant of all. Souls truly coming to Christ were put at ease in His presence. Love is the servant of all; you look *up* to the saints, you do not look *down* upon them.
Rem. This comes out in the apostle Paul in connection with the Corinthians; he did not assert his apostleship. He was not big or above them; he says, "the more abundantly I love you", @2 Corinthians 12:15.
J.T. I think his attitude towards the Corinthians was wonderful, it was a reflection of Christ; he conducted himself just as the Lord would. He loved them so much that he would not go to them with apostolic authority. Instead of that he *writes* to them and brings about repentance. It was all love.
Rem. Only the Lord could have treated Judas the way He did.
J.T. Yes; how pathetic is the scene! He says, "Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?", @Luke 22:48. The very expression of affection was used as the means of betrayal. And that is Judas -- *man*!
{302}
THE AUTHORITY OF CHRIST AND CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP
@1 Corinthians 10
J T. I think it is helpful to connect the first epistle to the Corinthians with the position of Moses when he went up the mount to receive the instructions in regard to the tabernacle. The first epistle has relation, I think, to that section of Scripture. The apostle could not come to the Corinthians on account of their condition, which answers, in a way, to Moses being unable to come into the camp with the tables of the covenant; he could not come into the camp on account of the conditions which existed there. The second epistle corresponds with the renewal of the law; things were now on an entirely new basis, hence you have the shining of Moses¬ face. I think the first epistle shows how the absence of Christ tests the saints. The first epistle corresponds to the first giving of the law; Moses, having gone up to the mount, could not bring into the camp the wonderful light he had received. He could not introduce it on account of the evil there, and, correspondingly, Paul could not come to Corinth because of the condition there.
In the second epistle you have things on an entirely different basis; that is, on the basis of the new covenant, and hence it corresponds with the second giving of the law; and connected with that you get the shining of Moses¬ face. God was there coming out on the ground of sovereignty, of sovereign mercy. The first epistle shows that the absence of Christ tested the hearts of the saints, as the absence of Moses had tested Israel. They said, "as for this Moses -- we wot not what is become of him" (@Exodus 32:1)
{303}
and hence their hearts took license for self-gratification. You cannot have the introduction of divine wisdom unless the heart is right. The absence of Moses tested Israel as to whether they were capable of receiving God's thoughts in regard to the tabernacle. What Moses was engaged with during the forty days was receiving God's thoughts in regard to *His* world, but the condition of things in the camp precluded the introduction of them.
When the hearts of the saints are not right the headship of Christ will not be realised. Headship involves the introduction of God's wisdom; the tabernacle represented that, but you cannot have headship apart from a right state of heart. Moses¬ influence was withdrawn, and the people being left to themselves, their idolatrous state was exposed. That is the position in which the assembly has been left here on earth.
In @Exodus 24 the law had been received; it was written in a book, and read in the hearing of the people, and they accepted all the obligations involved. And now the Lord has gone up on high, and has left commandments and principles for us, and it is from heaven that we get the full unfolding of divine wisdom. Headship was fully seen after Christ went to heaven, but the question is, whether the saints are *obedient*. He says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter", @John 14:15,16. The Comforter would reveal all things to the disciples, Israel were baptised to Moses in the cloud and in the sea, so *we* are baptised to Christ; it is a question of the authority of the Lord: He has left us here as subject to His authority. If you are not subject to the authority of Christ by keeping His commandments in His absence, you are not prepared for the disclosures which are involved in headship.
Ques. What is idolatry?
{304}
J.T. It is the diverting of our affections from Christ by any object whatever. It is simply a question of where the affections are. Israel professed not to know what had become of Moses, although he had left them only a few days before. In Christendom the absence of Christ is forgotten, and people do not know where He is except in terms. Then licence is taken and idolatrous principles are accepted. According to their own account, Moses had led Israel out of the land of Egypt. I think the truth was that they did not *want* to know, for they must really have known, because all was public. Moses ascended the mount before their eyes and the cloud was on the mount. There were evidences as to where Moses was, but they did not want to know; they wanted a leader of their own. Their true state was exposed.
Ques. How does @1 Corinthians 10 affect us?
J.T. I think the practical effect is that saints get exercised as to their associations. We are in the midst of a Babylonish world, and so we are exposed to idolatry. In Stephen's address in @Acts 7, this incident, the worship of the calf, is connected with Babylon. Idolatry was the ground of God's transporting them into Babylon. We are in the midst of a Babylonish world, a world that is characterised by idolatry, and the exercise of every true hearted christian is, whether we are in any sense recognising it. It is in that way that the breaking of bread is introduced in chapter 10. It is the bearing of the Supper upon you, not as convened, but as having to do with the world around you. It is *fellowship* that is in view. In @Exodus 32 it was not open idolatry. Aaron called it "a feast to Jehovah", @Exodus 32:5. It was idolatry connected with the name of Jehovah, and the people were called to the feast.
The name of the Lord is today connected with
{305}
a Babylonish world and it is idolatrous. People recognise the Lord outwardly, but their hearts are far away from Him, and they in no way feel His absence. Those who love Him, on the other hand, feel His absence, and as far as the world's overtures are concerned they hang their harps on the willows. You are not going to join in with the world around you if Christ is absent. What is called idolatry here is sitting down "to eat and drink and rose up to play"; people enjoying themselves in the absence of Christ. They are perfectly satisfied with their surroundings in the absence of Christ. That is what marks Christendom, whereas there ought to be a sense of bereavement.
What the apostle says is, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?" That is the point. It is the communion of the blood of the One whom you profess to love, and you are committed to that. How then can you recognise what is idolatrous, what disputes His rights? His blood poured out is a perfect testimony to His love; so He has a claim upon our affections. The blood is the life.
Rem. We should be ashamed to be associated with the world in Christ's absence in view of that.
J.T. I think so; the blood is the witness of His love for us. A man's life is the most precious thing possible; so with the Lord. He surrendered what was most precious, even His life. In that way the Holy Spirit appeals to the affections of the saints as to what they are going on with in this world. There may seem no harm in it, but any association or combination formed in this world other than the result of the gospel is Babylon, and it disputes the authority of Christ.
Ques. Is it a question of fellowship?
J.T. That is the point. The first part of the chapter brings before us the absence of Christ, and
{306}
in view of it the terrible seriousness of idolatry, He brings forward what happened to Israel as a warning. You cannot escape the governmental dealings of God if you disregard the authority of Christ. The disregard of the authority of Christ brings down the judgment of God. The Supper is introduced in connection with the fellowship, but the first part of the chapter is in connection with the governmental dealings of God on account of sinful disregard of the absence of Christ. There is no possibility of escaping the consequences if our affections move away from Christ. We all know what our hearts are. We naturally love independency, but independency is inconsistent with christian fellowship.
Rem. The world excludes God, but christian fellowship excludes the world.
J.T. Quite so. I think the blood is brought in as an appeal to show how utterly inconsistent it is for christians to touch idolatry; "dearly beloved, flee from idolatry".
The cup sets forth to us divine love. It represents to us the life of Christ given up; not merely that He died, but the Lord Jesus had a life as man here in this world in relation to Israel. He had affections in this respect. He was Messiah, the King. To Him all the promises referred, and *that* life He surrendered. We forget too much what it was to Christ to have all His links as a man and as Messiah broken.
Rem. By giving up His life He broke those links; death broke those links.
J.T. Yes, and the Lord Jesus in death surrendered all that He had as man. Everything was real to Christ, everything was divinely real. The state of Israel affected Him; the state of the temple at Jerusalem affected Him, because He was related as man to all these things. It is true, of course, that all would be secured by Him in another way; that
{307}
is through His death; but as in the flesh here, the Lord had affections in regard of His earthly people, and these were very real to Him. He drank of the fruit of the vine with His disciples; that was joy. He had joy, and a joy that He could not have in the *same way* again. When He would drink it again it should be in a *new way*.
Rem. He cherished all the bonds that God had formed.
J.T. Probably we do not think enough of that.
Rem. This aspect of His death is very precious. The bonds in Christ's eye were holy bonds. So He came into this life cherishing all those bonds that Jehovah had formed, and He gave up the life in which they were enjoyed.
J.T. Yes, we must take all that into account in order to see the full meaning of His blood. And rightly to estimate the gift of God you must see what Christ was here under the eye of the Father, "the only begotten Son", @John 1:18; @John 3:18. It is what Christ was to God in manhood. Many of us here can recall what trouble a pamphlet on the sufferings of Christ occasioned Mr. Darby. Many did not understand it but we *ought* to be able to enter into the Lord's personal sufferings. We ought to enter into what He suffered in having all those bonds broken.
Rem. He will have the joy of making those bonds good again.
J.T. That is very touching. He will yet bring all together. In @Isaiah 11 you have the stem of Jesse and the root of Jesse, and the tribes come under His influence. "The envy also of Ephraim shall depart ... Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim", @Isaiah 11:13. It is in that way unity is established under Christ. It is established by His influence.
Rem. But *we* are getting the good of it now.
J.T. Yes, but outward unity is now anticipative.
{308}
The Lord brought a unity to pass while here on earth. There were the twelve, but that was broken up, and that was a terrible sorrow to Him. His life, in a sense, was with that circle that had been formed around Him by His ministry. Judas¬ defection broke up that fellowship, and He went into death. "His life is taken from the earth", @Acts 8:33.
Rem. Messiah was cut off.
J.T. That was a solemn thing to Christ, to whom everything belonged. In resurrection He renews the bonds. We anticipate the re-union of Judah and Ephraim. Our unity has been brought to pass by the influence of Christ, and we cannot have it maintained without the influence of Christ.
Rem. Christ has shed His blood and brought the love of God to us. We must not form links in connection with this scene from which He is absent. That is the force of it here.
J.T. The first part of the chapter refers to His authority over us and what tests us while He is away, but then you come to fellowship, and you have the thought of unity there. The point of it is, that you cannot do as you please. In chapter 12 you cannot minister to the assembly as you please; you are corrected by the unity. In chapter 12 the truth of the body is brought in to counteract independency in *ministry*. You cannot be independent in the exercise of your *gift;* but chapter 10 is to correct independency of *walk;* you are amenable to discipline because of the fellowship: "we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread". We commit ourselves to the unity, and it is inconsistent with it to be independent.
Ques. Why is conscience brought in?
J.T. You are set for the good of others; while maintaining the liberty which intelligence gives as to God's creatures, you waive your right because of
{309}
the conscience of a less intelligent christian. You are not insisting on any right, because you are set for the good of all.
The bread is the communion of the body of Christ. The body of Christ refers to that in which God's will was carried out; the blood refers to the giving up of His life. In His body there was the carrying out of the divine will: "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God", @Hebrews 10:9. The Lord's body was the vessel in which the divine will was carried out, so it is, "by the which will we are sanctified", @Hebrews 10:10. Your body is to be here for the will of God; in that way you are to be sanctified. You cannot do your own will if you are in the communion of Christ's body.
Ques. There we are in the truth of headship?
J.T. It makes way for headship; the communion of Christ's body involves that we are sanctified, and to be sanctified means that we are here for God's will.
The Lord introduces an entirely new kind of food for humanity. His meat was to do the will of Him that sent Him; that is the manna -- "angels¬ food", @Psalm 78:25. God opened the windows of heaven and rained manna, the food of angels; it is really obedience, because the angels always do His will, and Christ introduced that principle on earth. His delight was to do the will of God; then He went into death to set aside *our* wills, so that our bodies should be the vessels of the divine will.
Ques. "Man shall not live by bread alone" (@Matthew 4:4)?
J.T. That refers to man's proper place of obedience; what sustains this is manna. Christ is manna, as having carried out God's will in every circumstance.
Rem. In that way He goes into death rather than that the will of God should fall to the ground.
J.T. I think it is an immense thing to see what manna is. It is an entirely new kind of sustenance; the natural mind cannot understand it. It is morally
{310}
the food in heaven, angels¬ food; and God gives that food to man in the wilderness. The Lord introduced it here. God's will should be done on earth as in heaven.
Rem. Man can only get divine support as he walks in obedience.
J.T. The Israelites learned that at the end of their course. Deuteronomy introduced it after the forty years in the wilderness. There we are told that "man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live", @Deuteronomy 8:3. The Lord began there. He had not a will to *correct;* He began with the book of Deuteronomy.
Rem. The temptation was that He should make bread.
J.T. And He would not do it, because He had no word for it.
Ques. In that way He is qualified to be the Head and the Leader?
J.T. I think so. He begins His career as a servant on that ground. His meat was to do the will of God.
Rem. The communion of His body would be that by which the will of man is excluded.
J.T. The manna is Christ here doing the will of God. We are here in the wilderness for God's will, and Christ is food for us in that light. The Lord had not to go through the wilderness to have His will subdued, as Israel had -- "to humble thee and to prove thee", @Deuteronomy 8:2. He began His career as a man with Deuteronomy, which was the end of the wilderness journey.
Rem. The only part of the wilderness Christ had was the wilderness according to God.
J.T. "All things are lawful for me, but all things edify not". That is a great principle to have established among the saints. You are not only amenable, but we have to answer one another. We cannot be
{311}
independent; we must consider others. Many young christians are damaged because they do not see this. You cannot do what you please; as actuated by love, you consider for others.
Rem. You must be true to the One who is *not* here, and look after the ones who *are* here.
J.T. Quite so. I was speaking lately of the kind of people that compose the heavenly city, people that have been formed by the ministry of Paul. This chapter follows upon chapter 9. What spirit actuated Paul? He surrendered all his rights, whatever they were, for the good of the saints. Paul's ministry produces the kind of people who compose the heavenly city. They are actuated by love, and hence the city has the divine character. It comes "down from God out of heaven" (@Revelation 21:2) hence it exerts influence on earth. We are set for the common good *now;* we shall be in the same happy employment *then*. This second epistle corresponds with Moses¬ action after he came down from the mount. It was a question of putting things right; hence he pitched the tabernacle outside -- "afar off from the camp", @Exodus 33:7. The communion of the body of Christ is a most important point, because it excludes the will of man, and this leads to the truth of the one body. The one body is for the carrying out of God's will. The one body is for the continuation of Christ's body. In His body here He carried out God's will; and in death He set aside *our* wills, and now there is the continuation of His body in the saints -- a vessel for carrying out God's will; so how can I do what I please?
Ques. Why is the cup spoken of here before the bread?
J.T. It was as a rebuke. It shows how far they had gone astray. The apostle says it is *Christ's* blood; that is what you are committed to, and you are going into idolatry? It was an appeal to their
{312}
affections. It is the communion of the blood of Christ; the One whom you profess to love, and yet you are going after other things!
There is another principle here of immense importance, and that is what you *cannot* do. "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils". "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?" We enter into a tremendous conflict in associating ourselves with idolatry. The Lord has a tremendous issue with Christendom; what the end will be remains to be seen. They have professed to call upon His name and they are going on with idolatry; and the Lord is jealous.
Ques. "Love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave", @Song of Songs 8:6. Is that the principle?
J.T. I think so. The Lord certainly will not tolerate it, and the result will be appalling, because He is the strongest.
Rem. Idolatry involves the displacement of Christ, so that the principle will come *near* to us in regard to what is spoken of as idolatry.
J.T. It refers to christians enjoying themselves in the things of this world. Idolatry is what characterises the world system, as built up by the god of this world. Total exclusion of Christ marks it. Do you not believe that Satan is behind all this enormous system called Christendom? It is his formation. The world, although nominally christian, is distinctly *anti-*christian.
In the absence of Moses, Aaron introduced the worship of the calf and called it a feast of Jehovah. Leadership in Christendom has given way. The responsible ones have given way to the influence of the people. A leader ought to lead. The true leader *leads*, he does not follow the people. It was not that Aaron did not know better; he gave way to the people. What are the clergy today? They are in the hands of the people. The true servant
{313}
stands for Christ. Moses represents the true servant, the man who stands for the rights of God. The man of God is the man for the moment. Aaron was for the people, Moses was for God. If we stand for God we shall help people rightly.
The introduction of the worship of the calf into the feast of Jehovah corresponds with Christendom today. The world was taken over by the church, but the name of Christ was still maintained, hence the associating of Christ's name with the abominations of the world. Romanism took over the pagan world, and Protestantism has a great deal of what is pagan. Babylon has daughters begotten of her.
Ques. What is your thought as to things sold in the shambles?
J.T. God's rights in creation. "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof", @Psalm 24:1. You do not admit that anything, even if offered to idols, belongs to the idol. It belongs to God. You refuse it, not because it is not clean, but because you are afraid of stumbling a brother. But maintaining God's rights in His creation is, so far, the refusal of idolatry. It is a creature of God; you do not admit the idol's claim at all.
{314}
THE VIRTUOUS WOMAN
@Proverbs 31:10 - 31; @Genesis 2:18 - 24
I desire to say a word in regard of headship, and to seek to show how Christ is reflected here in her to whom He stands in the relationship of Head. The idea of headship is not limited, as most of us know, to the church; it has a wider bearing. A man may be head of his business, head of his family, and head of his wife; each connection suggests a different idea, and it is evident the last is the most intimate. I venture to read from the book of Proverbs because I think it suggests that which underlies the relationship that has been formed between Christ and the assembly; that is, family affection. The book of Proverbs, as many of us have observed, is set in connection with the family; and it was a primary thought with God that He should surround Himself with an order of beings who should stand in relationship with Him as a family. That order of being is man. That is, Wisdom, personifying itself in the early part of the book, intimates that the order of being it had set its mind upon was man. So intensely engaged was Wisdom with that order of being that it rejoiced in the sphere in which man should be placed, "in the habitable part of his earth", @Proverbs 8:31. And then we find, when it comes to the order of being itself, that it is intimated that it would delight in the character of sons; "my delights were with the *sons* of men", @Proverbs 8:31.
Now I think that gives an idea of the point of view which is taken in the book of Proverbs, and it is remarkable that the writer of the book specially speaks of himself as in that peculiar relationship. He was in the relationship of a son, he tells us, to a father, "tender and only beloved in the sight of
{315}
my mother", @Proverbs 4:3. Solomon is seen in many connections in the Scriptures, and is a type of Christ in many relations but in this respect he is a type of Christ as having a unique place with God as Man. So that whilst we are related to Christ as His brethren and as His companions, we must ever bear in mind that He has always His distinctive place. In whatever relation the Lord is presented in Scripture you will find that there is always in regard to Him that which distinguishes Him from all others.
Now, if you consider the Lord in regard to sonship, it is perfectly clear that it was in the mind of God to have a company of sons. And in that company He would find continuous sympathy. Hence we are told that when the foundations of the earth were laid the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy, @Job 38. We thus have the clear intimation that God intended to have a company near Him, observant of all that He was doing, and being all that they should be in the relation of sons. You will find that the idea of sons is carried all through the Old Testament. I cannot dwell upon it, but it is alluded to, for instance, in the book of Job. In the early operations of God the *sons* were sympathetic with Him, and upon the earth they present themselves before Him, and they have God before them.
Well now, the Lord stands in relation to the sons, but you will find that the Spirit of God in the Old Testament carefully guards His personal distinctness. In Genesis we find an allusion to it in Isaac's relationship with Abraham. God says to Abraham, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest", @Genesis 22:2. That is a type of Christ in the unique place in which He stands in relationship with God as an "only one". It is in that character that He comes out from God and unfolds to us what is in
{316}
the heart of God; that is, that He will have a company like Himself. And so the book of Proverbs anticipates Christ, for it is only in Christ that you find in a spiritual way the relationships which are contemplated in the setting of the book.
Now in the closing chapters you have two prophecies. Chapter 30 is a distinct prophecy by itself and chapter 31 is another. After the light unfolded by Wisdom has taken effect, the spirit of the prophet looks on to a set of conditions that should prevail. If you look at chapter 30 you will find, as has often been noticed, six sets of four things each, and these conditions arise consequent upon the unfolding of Wisdom. I need not say that the unfolding of Wisdom was in the ministry of Christ. The ministry of Christ involved the preaching of Wisdom, the teaching of Wisdom, and, furthermore, a full unfolding of the history of Wisdom itself. The ministry of Christ brought into evidence the children of Wisdom. According to the point of view presented by the gospel of Luke, "Wisdom is justified of all her children", @Luke 7:35. What you find is that the children of Wisdom are set up here in the midst of those adverse conditions, and that without any alteration of the conditions they fully justify Wisdom.
In chapter 30 we find these different acts of four each. I only refer to it as pointing out the conditions in which the children of Wisdom are placed in this world. The prophet speaks of four evil things, four insatiable things, four inscrutable things, four odious things, four weak but wise things, and lastly, four stately things. I take it that the things that are weak, but wise, refer to christianity. So that chapter 30 announces prophetically the conditions in which we are placed here as illuminated by the ministry of Wisdom. The conditions in which we are found are left as they were, but Wisdom is justified in all her children. Although the early
{317}
christians were outwardly extremely weak, they were exceedingly wise, they looked to the future, and they were "comely" in their going.
Now chapter 31 is, I think, a prophetic view of the assembly seen in relationship with Christ; and it is of that I wish to speak. I read the passage in @Genesis 2 to show how the relationship is formed. Nothing can be greater for our souls to apprehend than the wonderful place that we have as viewed in the light of Christ's resurrection, for it is in that light that we are suited to be united to Him. To make my thought clear, I would seek to point out that what we are here as individuals in this world is *one* thought, and what we are in relation to God's purpose as united to Christ is another point entirely. In regard to the first, we may look upon christians here in this world as God's family. Nothing can be more precious to the soul of the christian down here than the consciousness that he is a member of God's family.
I take the family of Bethany; that is, Mary, Martha and Lazarus, as representing in type the family of God. What you will observe in that family, beloved friends, is that they were, as presented to us in Scripture, parentless. Nothing is said about their parents, and this aptly describes our own actual condition here. The Lord severs His connection with His natural relations in @John 2. He says to His mother, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?", @John 2:4. He was engaged in His divine ministry with that which was spiritual, not with that which is natural; He was there in regard to a spiritual order of things, forming links between souls and God in a spiritual way. "God is a Spirit" (@John 4:24) and if souls are to be set in relationship with God it must be in a spiritual way. Hence His mother had no title to make suggestions to Christ in regard of what He was doing spiritually. He would introduce the new wine, but He would
{318}
introduce it of Himself, and He *did*. But whilst He refuses the natural relatives, John, in the development of his gospel, brings to light another family, which the Lord takes up, and we are told that He loved them all. He "loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus", @John 11:5. The Spirit of God is careful to emphasise that He loved each and all.
Now, what I wish to point out is, that as God's family here in an adverse world the Lord knows our name; He knows every member of the family by name. If one of His family goes into death, as is possible, Christ will abolish death because it has touched that family. It was in the presence of death, as having broken in upon the family at Bethany, in the person of Lazarus, that He was moved in His spirit. He was deeply moved in His spirit; a member of that family had gone into death, and the heart of Jesus was moved because of the presence of death as holding a member of that family which He loved. So if death touches us, and it *does* touch us, what do we find? You find that the Lord knows your name even there. Be the circumstances ever so dark, be Satan's power ever so great, the Lord knows your name, *just there*, and He calls you by name. He says, "Lazarus, come forth!", @John 11:43. Now, that is the Lord's attitude to God's family. He takes you up as He finds you. He takes you up according to your identity as born into this world. You are known in this world as born into it, and the Lord takes you up *just there*, so that in all His dealings with you He makes you to know His divine interest in you. He calls you by name.
Now I want to show you also that each has another name. The names that prevail in this world under the government of God do not prevail in the spiritual world, which world must be ordered by Christ. He has come out of heaven, a new order
{319}
of Man; "the second man, out of heaven", @1 Corinthians 15:47. He is God's Son, who has come out of heaven in a new and spiritual order, and what comes to light is that He gives names to all His own. The conditions that prevail under the government of God here, whilst they become the way of the expression of divine love to us, cannot prevail in the world of God's counsels. That world must be ordered and dominated by Christ.
Hence you find in John's gospel that the Lord gives a name to Simon. It is not a question of what he is; it is a question of the Lord having authority to give him a name, and He does so; he is to be called Cephas (Peter), because it is Christ's will that he *should* be called Peter. If there is anything that we should maintain clearly in our souls, it is the sovereignty of divine Persons. You should never think of divine Persons acting automatically. They act sovereignly, and hence we see in John's gospel that if the Lord gives a name, He gives it sovereignly; He has title to give it.
Now, I want to show you how it is that the name the Lord gives in the spiritual world, whilst it is given sovereignly and unalterably, expresses what the thing is. We see this in the case of Adam; whatever name he gave a creature, that was its name. That is a point, the name; that has to be considered. As I have said, He took account of Mary, and Martha, and Lazarus, *as they were*, and He called them by name; but when you come to the spiritual side, what comes to light is that He gives them a name with divine intelligence. That leads me to the passage I read in @Genesis 2. The Spirit tells us, that among all the lower creatures there was not a helpmeet found for Adam. In all the host of God's creatures there was no helpmeet, no one suited for Adam. Yet there Adam was, head of the creation, acting with the intelligence suited to it;
{320}
as each creature was brought to him his intelligence shone in the name he imparted to it, but then the Spirit tells us that he was without a helpmeet.
Now, what I wish you to dwell upon is the antitype, not the type; but after the deep sleep of Adam is past, and the woman is *builded*, God brings her to him, and he is put to the test. Eve is brought to him; she is a most wonderful creature, and in no instance does Adam's intelligence shine so brightly as in the name he gives her and in his explanation of the name. He says to Jehovah; "*This* time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh". That is, referring to each creature as it had been brought to him, he says to Jehovah: "*This* time" all is changed; This "is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called *Woman*, because she was taken out of Man".
Thus viewed in the light of Christ's death and resurrection, we receive a new name. I am not now speaking of what we may receive individually, but of what the assembly is as the counterpart of Christ. He deliberately considers her. When Mary Magdalene came to the Lord in resurrection, she would have renewed the old associations; she would have renewed, as it were, the connection with Bethany. I do not say *she* was of Bethany, but she represented the family that had affection for Christ whilst He was here upon earth. The Lord says to her, "Touch me not", @John 20:17. The earthly associations must give place to the heavenly. "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to *my brethren*", @John 20:17. *There* is the name -- "my brethren". That is the name that the Lord gives us. It expresses what we are to Him in virtue of His resurrection -- the brethren of Christ. Now what *are* the brethren of Christ? What marks them? The *sons* of God are marked by dignity and liberty. What marks the *brethren* of Christ? What was Christ down here?
{321}
He was a new order of Man; a heavenly Man amongst men, and what marked Him was the tenderest solicitude and care for the welfare of His own. This shone out in chapter 13. It shone at the Supper. That was the spirit of Christ, and it was by that spirit fully set forth in His death, that the love of God was expressed. It is in the light of that that the brethren of Christ are formed. The thought of brethren is that of mutual affection. We stand in relation to Christ, and in relation to one another, beloved friends, in mutual affection, and the Lord views us as being wholly derived from Himself. We have our origin in Christ with no history prior to that. In this connection we stand related to Him, but not in earthly associations. Mount Olivet is in type the scene of heavenly associations. Hence when all was over, after the Supper, they sang a hymn and went to the mount of Olives. He had been accustomed to go there before; in @John 8 we are told that He went there; the disciples went to their own homes; "Jesus went to the mount of Olives", @John 8:1. It was His own retreat, and now He leads His disciples there. As His brethren in resurrection we have heavenly links and associations. Our origin is from Him, and He gives us a name that describes what we are. "*This* time", says Adam, "it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man".
Well, it is to that company that Christ is Head, and His headship is known in a spiritual way. I refer to that just for a moment, because upon it depends what is intimated here in @Proverbs 31, in the "woman of worth", the "virtuous woman". If the assembly is not set up in heavenly relationship with Christ she cannot fully set Him forth here. Her testimony is peculiar to herself, and it depends on her knowledge of Him as her Head, as having
{322}
given to her a name. I would ask you, Have you any idea of having received a name from Christ? It is well that He knows us by name *here*, where, under the government of God, we all have names, but it is an entirely different thought to be conscious of having a name from Christ in a spiritual way, to be conscious that the name He has given you is a name that involves your qualification to be united to Him. Adam says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man". That, I believe, sets forth the Lord Jesus, giving a name to His assembly, and the form the testimony has taken during the interval of His absence is of a feminine character. The testimony has taken form in the Woman; the Man is out of sight. He is in heaven, and if the Man is not in evidence here, what does that bring to light? It brings to light the character of the Woman. The absence of Christ has become the occasion of the testing of the character of the assembly.
In @Proverbs 7 the wicked woman's husband is away; she says, "the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: he hath taken a bag of money with him", @Proverbs 7:19,20. She has no regard as to how long he is going to stay away, and she is utterly unfaithful to him. She represents that which *had* a place in relation to Christ, but has proved to be utterly unfaithful to Him and a corruptress of the world.
But what is found in the "woman of worth" is that she thinks of her husband, and what is more precious still, he has full confidence in her. "The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her". Now, if you consider the assembly's position here in regard of Christ in this light, it opens up a wonderful field for instruction. As I have been saying, chapter 30 gives us a prophetic outline of the
{323}
conditions that prevail in the world, while chapter 31 gives us an outline prophetically of the history of the assembly viewed as in relationship with Christ. Therefore we have described in it the true features of the assembly while the Lord is away.
Now, the question arises as to where we are while Christ is absent, where we are in regard of our hearts, our labours, our testimony and our walk. What is it that controls us? Well, I can conceive of nothing that maintains christian testimony at its proper standard, but the light in our souls of our heavenly association with Christ. We are called to that. We have the first place with Christ. We are that family that has the first place in His affections, and, as thus privileged, we have the honour of maintaining for Him whilst He is away.
As to the type set forth here, the first thing noted is that this "woman of worth" is very rare, and then that her husband safely trusts in her. I think it ought to appeal to us in a direct way as to whether the Lord can commit anything to us. Now it seems to me the Lord *has* graciously committed something to us, and when I say 'us' I mean the assembly. I would never use the collective expression in regard of christians in any other light than that of the whole assembly. The Lord committed a great deal to the apostles. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the early chapters of the Acts. There was a company gazing up as Christ went into heaven; they loved Him, and when the cloud received Him out of their sight they were marked by respect for the authority of the Scriptures. For the moment the Scriptures were the sole authority recognised by the apostles. And besides this, they were united in affection and they were all together in one place; they were all of one accord, for they loved Him and loved one another; and it is to that company that the Lord
{324}
Jesus commits His interests. How much He committed to them! All the vast interests that belong to Christ were committed to that company. Think of the weight of responsibility laid upon them, but, beloved brethren, *they were true to it*. The Spirit of God shows us that at least for a moment there was a complete answer to the trust and confidence of Christ; they maintained in affection what He had committed to them.
It seems to me that the Lord has committed something to us. I have no doubt that in speaking to Sardis the Lord alluded to the great light of the Reformation. Great light had been vouchsafed, and they were to remember what they had received and heard. But when He comes to Philadelphia He can address the church and say, "thou hast kept the word of my patience", @Revelation 3:10. There was the answer to His confidence; it was not misplaced. The Lord had committed something to her and His confidence was not betrayed. His commendation is this: "thou ... hast kept my word and hast not denied my name", @Revelation 3:8. *There* is the "virtuous woman", the "woman of worth". After Ephesus there is no real answer to Christ in the assembly until you come to Philadelphia, and *there* there is complete evidence of an answer to the confidence of Christ as to that which He had committed to her.
Surely it is a matter of great concern what we are going to do with what the Lord has committed to us. What are we going to do with it? I am not assuming to lay a burden upon any one. It is a question of what we are going to do with what the Lord has committed to us. I doubt not that the traits of the "virtuous woman" will continue to the end, notwithstanding the ruin. She goes on, and what marks here is that she is true to what has been committed to her, and she makes the most of it. She is active to promote the interests of her
{325}
husband. She knows her head, so that everything she does is done in order. If it be a question of the order of her house, she looks well to it. There are those who make light of order in the assembly, but be assured of this, that the "virtuous woman" is seen in the order of the house, and she looks well to the ways of her household. Whatever feebleness there may be, there is nothing tolerated that would bring discredit on Him to whom the house belongs.
I cannot dwell upon the detail only to point out one other thing, and that is, in result, that He who has been, as it were, out of sight is *known*. The headship of Christ is a practical thing. Now the woman is in evidence, and the great result is that when the time comes for Him to sit "among the elders of the land" to take a public place, He is well known. He is known through His wife. "Her husband is known in the gates". In the future Christ will be identified by that which is of Himself which the assembly sets forth.
What that means for us is, that the spiritual order of things which is to prevail in the assembly *publicly* is already established there *now*. Every feature of the order of things that God has in His mind is to find its answer in the assembly, so that "the world to come, whereof we speak" (@Hebrews 2:5) is already *witnessed to*. It is known in testimony *now* through the "virtuous woman". Hence the great importance of *virtue*. What I understand by virtue is ability to refuse what is evil and to maintain what is good. If you have those two things you have what Christ has confidence in; and hence you have testimony. So that when the Lord arrives He has not to announce Himself again, He is known in the assembly; "Her husband is known in the gates".
Well, it is evident, as I have been saying, that it is of immense importance that we should apprehend our calling. The wonderful place that we have as
{326}
viewed in relation to Christ risen from the dead, and having a name received from His own lips (Remember *that*!), involves that we are in every way suited to be His companions in heavenly glory. But in the meantime we are placed down here where all is adverse and our *virtue* is put to the test, and wherever the test is answered to there is witness for Christ. So that in the future He requires not to announce Himself again; He is known already, and when He takes His place "among the elders of the land" (that is, publicly) he is "known in the gates".
The Lord grant that our hearts may be true to Him for the little while. You may depend upon it that the enemy is doing all he can to take away from us what God has committed to us, and our responsibility is to maintain tenaciously every interest of Christ until He returns.
{327}
CHURCH RECOVERY
@Revelation 22:16,17
My thought is to seek to show the necessity for the assembly. There is a necessity for it in regard of God's eternal counsels, which refer to the coming day, and also in regard of testimony down here. I believe it is of great importance for the saints to distinguish between the primary thoughts of God, and His thoughts and ways that have arisen as a consequence of the introduction of sin into the world.
Now, I regard the assembly as a primary thought of God; it is a necessary result of His eternal counsels; it forms part of the eternal scheme, but then it also falls into line in connection with His government here upon earth. The primary thought comes to light in @Genesis 2. There were then no conditions created by sin. The necessity for the assembly in God's mind and counsels arose from the fact that in the type the man was *alone*. His loneliness had not been caused by the presence of sin; it did not arise from sin having come in, but from the fact that his counterpart had not been created. But when we come to the second type of the assembly, which is Rebekah, she becomes a necessity on account of the *result* of sin and death; the necessity for Rebekah arose from the death of Sarah. She was for the comfort of Isaac after his mother's death. @Genesis 24:67.
Now, beloved friends, I have referred to these two types as indicating that the assembly takes its place in the course of God's government in this world, a government which arose from the conditions created in the world by the presence of sin. But all that having been solved, the intricate conditions
{328}
arising from the presence of sin in the world becoming ultimately adjusted under the governmental hand of God, He reverts to His primary thought in the assembly.
Now, I should like, the Lord helping me, to make clear to you, before proceeding, what is immediately before me, that is, to show the great difference there is between God's primary thoughts and His government. To suggest to you further what I mean, I would point out that we find God introducing the idea of a city and the idea of a kingdom. Now, God was not the first to introduce these things. The first city mentioned in Scripture is that builded by Cain, and the first kingdom we have in Scripture is that which was established by Nimrod. God did not introduce these thoughts; they were introduced by man, and their introduction greatly enhanced man's position here in opposition to God. Any one can see in Cain's city that, as builded, it greatly enhanced his position. He was a vagabond upon the earth, with the mark of a murderer upon his brow; he goes out from the presence of the Lord and establishes himself on the earth in independence of God, and *built a city*.
Now, that thought has never been given up by the world, but God took account of it. He took note of the advantage that the enemy had acquired by the establishment of a city upon earth. We find that after the flood the thought reappeared, for directly men got together their thought was to build a city and a tower. I allude to these thoughts to show you how the world system was established, and then consequent upon that Nimrod established his kingdom; he was "a mighty hunter" (@Genesis 10:9) before the Lord. His fame was widespread; he was a mighty one upon the earth; he was a hero, and he established a kingdom. Now, bear in mind these two thoughts, you have a city, a political centre,
{329}
a centre of influence upon earth; and then you have a kingdom, fixed rule established in connection with the city. Now I repeat that these two thoughts were not introduced by God; they were introduced by man. The question therefore arose as to how God was going to meet that? We must remember that God had always a witness here; He had always a people in this world who were in possession of light, and these would feel the character of the advantage that the presence of a city and a kingdom gave to the world. Therefore the question arose as to how God would meet that state of things, and I repeat that He met it, not by the introduction of a *primary* thought, but by the introduction of a *like* thought. His people were in the world-system, and He designed to call them out of it; He would deliver them out of it, and to that end *He* established a city and a kingdom of His own.
Now, there can be no greater thought for us in connection with the presence of sin and lawlessness in the world than the setting forth of God's city and God's kingdom. I need not enlarge upon them, they have often been enlarged upon, I only refer to them as showing the greatness of God's ways in meeting the state of things occasioned by sin, and that the establishment of these two things is for the deliverance of God's people from the world. We see that both the city and the kingdom have a present existence, and their object is the deliverance of God's people out of the world-system; God has provided a city for us, He has provided a centre for us, and He has established rule for us in the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ.
These two thoughts are clearly brought to light in the gospels. I would refer to the gospel of Matthew for a moment. Matthew's great point in regard to the kingdom is, that it was a *heavenly* kingdom -- heavenly rule. Now, there may be a question as to
{330}
what is the point in that? I believe the idea in Matthew is to show that God had transferred His centre from earth to heaven. Luke deals with the kingdom of God down here, Matthew with the kingdom of *heaven;* that is, that rule was henceforth vested in the heavens. I want to show you the working out of that historically.
Jerusalem had been the centre on earth in which the kingdom had been established, and it was there also that the idea of a city had taken form. God had placed both testimonies there; that is, a city and a kingdom. He had sent Christ to Jerusalem. The Lord visited that city, He visited it in full divine affection for Israel, He wept over it, He wept over the city, and He said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye *would not*!" @Matthew 23:37. There was definite refusal to accede to the divine overture; it was rejected; instead of being received there, the Lord was rejected. He entered it as King, for God had a testimony rendered to His precious Son as the Son of David, and He entered the city as King, but He was rejected as an imposter. Such was the city. Such was the power the enemy had acquired in the city in which God had placed these two great testimonies of His in the presence of man.
Did God give up the city? I think nothing can exceed the grace manifested in God's forbearance with it. The Lord says that "repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations". But where was it to begin? "Beginning", He says, "at Jerusalem", @Luke 24:47. At that city the gospel of the grace of God was to begin. I do not know anything that so exhibits the abounding grace of
{331}
God. At the centre, where all evil was concentrated, where the foulest crime was committed that had ever been perpetrated, He began *there*, He established there in principle another city. He sends down the Holy Spirit to His disciples, in the midst of Jerusalem, where He whom they, the Jews, had murdered, God sends down the Holy Spirit to His disciples in that city. It was in the midst of Jerusalem that the assembly was formed.
Matthew and Mark contemplate the continuance of God's relationship with Israel; the beginning of the Acts contemplates the continuance of God's relationship with Israel soon after the giving of the Spirit, hence you will find that the Supper is not definitely separated from the passover in these two gospels. God, as it were, lingered over Jerusalem. The most wonderful thing that had ever been introduced into this world was introduced in the midst of that city. And, beloved friends, we soon discover in the historical course of events, if indeed further evidence were required, what the city really was morally. The presence and energy of the Holy Spirit evidenced God's grace to man, but what did it elicit from Jerusalem? Well, we see at the death of Stephen, in the attitude of Jerusalem towards Stephen, what God's grace to Jerusalem elicited from it. The city was in the hands of the wicked power. The Spirit of Jesus, exhibited in His disciples, and manifested so perfectly in Stephen, only drew out the inveterate hatred of the leaders against Jesus and all who belonged to Him. Stephen was murdered; he was murdered in the presence of Saul, and Saul becomes the personification of the spirit of Jerusalem. He left that city as the representative of it; he was the official representative of Jerusalem; he went out of it, we are told, "breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord", @Acts 9:1. It was not simply *Saul's* hatred of Jesus,
{332}
and His disciples, but he was the representative of that city to which so much grace had been shown.
Then comes a definite break between Jerusalem and God, and the link has never been re-established. The earthly centre was abandoned by God and the heavenly centre established. The christian economy is established from heaven. God, in forbearance with Israel and in grace, brought into that city the most wonderful thing that had ever been introduced, but the rejection of it necessitated a complete break with Israel, and now all is established in heaven. Saul hears a voice from heaven, and that voice brings him down. Saul has now recognised that authority is in *heaven*, not upon *earth*. He had come out of Jerusalem armed with the authority of the high priest -- plenty of it -- he was *armed* with it. But he hears a voice from heaven, and that voice discloses to him what Matthew enlarges upon, that rule is now in the *heavens;* hence Saul says, "*Lord*, what wilt thou have me to do?", @Acts 9:6. He acknowledges the rule that God had established in heaven, and what follows upon that is, that God's city is introduced. There is no longer any protection for the things of God, to be looked for in Jerusalem. The things of God have to be cared for now from another centre. The high priests are no longer to be depended upon, they are in open opposition to God, and have refused the testimony; God has established rule in heaven, and there is power from thence to protect His interests upon earth. That power is for the support and protection of the things of God upon earth.
Now, beloved friends, that is what I understand to be the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens; it is established in Christ. Saul was the personification of Jewish wickedness against Christ, but God had a complete triumph. Power and authority from heaven *subdued* him. There we see
{333}
how God met the world system, the world city. God met it *in Christ*, in the voice of Christ, and in the power of Christ from heaven. Saul, the great representative of earthly wickedness against God and against Christ, is separated from the power of evil in Jerusalem; he is completely extricated from it, and henceforth he becomes the *herald of God's grace from heaven*. Paul brings in the announcement of the *Son*. His first preaching is to announce the Son of God. We are not told that he was sent to preach, or that he was commissioned to preach in Damascus at that moment, but the fact is stated that he *did* preach, and his preaching in Damascus was the outcome of the impression made upon his heart. He preached the Son of God. Now what hangs upon that is, that the Son of God must have His own city; Jerusalem is rejected, but He will establish a heavenly city. In Christ exalted we have the idea of rule, and all divine power to support it, so that it becomes effective upon earth, and then consequently we have also a new centre for the affections of His people whilst they are down here. All that takes place outside of Jewish territory, so that the people of God now have an all-powerful kingdom to support them; they have a city established, and they have a new centre to hold their affections, their thoughts, their ambitions and their minds.
I want to say a word further in regard to the establishment of things from heaven. Paul's ministry established christianity in the order that it had been in God's thoughts to establish it here upon earth. God's thought was, as we learn from the epistle to the Ephesians, to have both Jew and gentile in one body. The true thought of the "one body" does not come out fully until the gentile is brought in. The gentile is brought in in a collective way. The Holy Spirit came upon the Jewish remnant
{334}
collectively, as recorded in @Acts 2, and He came in like manner upon the gentiles in a collective way, as we see in chapter 10. You will find that the expressions as to the coming of the Holy Spirit are very similar, with this difference, that in @Acts 2 He came from heaven, but in chapter 10 it is simply that He "fell upon" those who were listening to Peter's preaching (@Acts 10:44). So that God had secured His thought, He had brought in a company; the gentile is bound up in one bundle of life in company with the Jew.
And, further, we find that the Supper is introduced in that connection; the Supper is in the economy of christianity. The Lord's supper is given from heaven. According to the testimony of the gospels it was committed to the Jewish disciples of Jesus. But in Paul's ministry it is received directly from Christ in heaven; that is to say, it is formally separated from the passover. Luke is the only evangelist who supports that, because Luke invariably supports Paul's testimony. The Supper is formally separated from the passover, and it is separated from all social connections here upon earth. It is received directly from heaven and committed to the assembly, as established here by the ministry of Paul.
Well, now, when we come to that I think that one may be free to say a word in regard to what the assembly is as a necessity in God's ways for the present moment, and for the future. It becomes evident that it was a necessity in view of Israel's decease. The death of Sarah of old, as I have been saying, necessitated the introduction of Rebekah, and now the decease of Israel, the severance of that link, has necessitated that the Lord Jesus should have another companion, and His beloved apostle Paul was the great instrument to bring in that companion.
Now that leads me to refer for a moment to the
{335}
connection in which we find the feminine idea introduced in the Scripture I have read; one cannot say much about it, but the feminine idea is introduced because man as created was alone. God said of Adam, "It is not good that the man should be alone" (@Genesis 2:18), and He assigned that as the reason for bringing a companion to him. God took account of man upon earth, and in His divine wisdom He devised that it was not good that he should be *alone*. Well, in the gospels wonderful testimony comes to light in Christ. How one could enlarge upon the ministry of the Lord as seen in the gospels! As seen in the gospels, the Lord is alone. He is there the *Man*. I read the gospels in that light. They present to us the Man; He comes out from God. He is God's image and God's glory. But He is alone and without a counterpart. He is alone, and God's thought was that it was not good that man should be alone.
Well, now, beloved friends, what is so touching is this, that the wonderful grace in the ministry of the Lord gathered around Him a company that was marked by affection for Him, and that affection is represented in the attitude of the women who are given prominence to in the gospel narrative. The record of each evangelist introduces a woman on the resurrection morning. The Lord had been alone upon the earth in His wonderful activity of grace, and now on the resurrection morning each evangelist in his turn enlarges upon the affection that had been drawn out by the Lord's ministry here. In the early morning before the dawn that affection exhibits itself. In whom? In a woman. The feminine side is in evidence at once upon the resurrection morning. I think it is most touching to see how, figuratively, the counterpart had come to light, the counterpart of Christ. I cannot think of the counterpart of Christ apart from affection. What marks the woman
{336}
is affection, affection begotten by the Man, and what we see there is affection begotten by the wonderful grace of Christ. I would commend to you the study of the gospels -- perfection is there. The gospels present perfection in a Man, perfection marked by divine love, and divine love in activity here upon earth. That is God's Man. What would God's Man be in the presence of lawlessness? He would be law-abiding. What would He be in the presence of hatred? He would be marked by love. Thus God's Man comes to light in Christ.
I need not say that God did not breathe into *His* nostrils the breath of life. He was a divine Person become Man. His Person could not be altered, and He goes back to heaven as He came out of heaven, a divine Person equal with the Father. But He was a Man upon earth, and He exhibited what man should be upon earth, and the setting forth of that gathered around Him a company that were marked by affection for Him. He begat affection, so that when He disappears in death affection is there, and on the morning of resurrection the woman is seen looking for Him. The apostles went to their own homes, but Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping. There may have been a lack of intelligence there, she ought to have known, but she had absorbing affection for Him.
We read in the prophets of seven women taking hold of one man, that one Man is Christ. There is only one Man in God's counsels, and *that* Man is Christ. He begat affection in the hearts of many; there were those who responded to Him, and this affection brings to light the *woman;* typically the assembly as the counterpart of Christ. Nothing can be of greater interest for the Man than the woman. There was no creature for Adam to be compared with Eve. There was no creature to equal Adam in intelligence, and Eve was equal to be his

counterpart. There was no creature like her, and Adam quickly discerns it, and he says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man", @Genesis 2:23. So you have in type the woman -- the assembly as the counterpart for Christ. The apostle Paul had that before him. He says to the Corinthians, "I have espoused you unto *one man*", @2 Corinthians 11:2.
Now, I would ask, Where are *we* in regard to that? I believe the Spirit of God would raise the question in our souls as to where our hearts are. Paul says, "I have espoused you unto *one*"; that is, I have not espoused you to two, I have not set two objects before you to distract you, I have set *one* before you. The One he had espoused them to was God's Son in heaven. *That* was the Object. The apostle was afraid lest the saints should be beguiled from simplicity as to the Christ. Christianity is essentially simple, so the apostle says, "I have espoused you unto one man". And in passing on I would say a word as to how the Lord in that sense takes account of the "woman" down here. In @Proverbs 31 she is prophetically alluded to as the "woman of worth", and we are told that her husband safely trusts in her. He commits his things to her.
In connection with this, I want to say just a word as to the form the assembly took in the administration of Paul. The form that the assembly economy took under Paul was that of local assemblies. As I have been saying, the testimony was connected with Jerusalem. In the wisdom of God, Jerusalem was recognised up to a point, but when the full light of the assembly comes out all Jewish influences are forbidden. The assembly of God is then formally separated from judaism which is classified with the world. The apostle mentions the Jew, the gentile, and the church of God. The church of God is thus formally separated from the
{338}
Jew and the gentile. Then you get in connection with that the formulation of the law by which the church is to be governed, and I take that law to be set forth in the first epistle to the Corinthians. I cannot enlarge upon it, I only suggest it to you. The form the church economy took was that it was to be seen in local companies. The assembly at Jerusalem had a certain metropolitan importance which no other assembly had. You never get the idea afterwards of a general church council. In the light of Paul's teaching a general council is not right. A church council after 1 Corinthians was written could not be of God. In that epistle we are taught that the principles by which *one* assembly was to be governed were to be the principles by which "all the assemblies" had to be governed. Privilege and responsibility henceforth took form in local companies. They were not independent companies. Independency is forbidden in the law of the church. Thus you have the working out of the christian economy in the local companies. Whether it be responsibility or privilege, all takes form in the local company. I need only appeal to the statements in the epistle to the Corinthians to prove that.
Well, beloved friends, that raises the question as to faithfulness. Does the Lord see that which He can trust? In the book of Revelation we find that the local companies are not marked by that which marked the "virtuous woman" at the outset. Ephesus, which had been the great result of Paul's ministry, established in the full light of the heavenly revelation, had left her first love; she had moved away from the position in which she had been placed in relation to Christ; in other words, *virtue* had gone. The woman of virtue is no longer seen, she had disappeared. Virtue had disappeared in the disappearance of first love. The Lord commits nothing more to her; He exhorts Her to do the first works, but
{339}
nothing more can be *committed* to her. Nothing can be more touching than the thought of what it must have been to the Lord to be conscious that that which had been so perfectly set forth, that affection that shone in Mary Magdalene and which marked the early church had disappeared, and with it *virtue* had disappeared. So that the church's path has been downward, until it culminates in the wicked woman Jezebel, who had been the personification of wickedness, the very opposite of the woman of virtue.
Now, at the close, virtue reappears. I believe the Lord is earnestly working to bring in virtue ultimately. We live in an awful age. How many voices there are around us calculated to draw away our hearts and divert them from Christ. We are put to the test by the different voices appealing to us, but the Lord's voice is distinctly heard. You will have observed that in the early part of the book the message is sent through John to the *angels* of the churches. The Lord impressed upon them how distinctly He felt the declension, and when we come to the last chapter we find in the early part of it that the Lord sent His angel to communicate these things to His bondmen; that is, to make known to His bondmen beforehand what was about to happen.
But the Lord must have His word directly to the churches before the book was closed, and the object of it is to arouse *virtue*. Do we hear His voice? it is the voice of Jesus. It is the voice that Paul heard, the same voice, the same Person. It is Jesus. It is not John who is speaking. It is the Lord directly announcing Himself to us: "I Jesus". The same Person who said to Saul of Tarsus; "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest", @Acts 9:5. *Now* He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches". He appeals directly to the assemblies by announcing Himself to them. It seems to me that we have the *Lord's voice now;*
{340}
the Lord is speaking, and if He is speaking to us, it is to beget what He so well knows how to beget, and that is *affection*.
I think the most remarkable thing about the Song of Songs is that it is the finest piece that Solomon had composed out of a thousand and five songs. Perhaps no poet had composed so many. But *this* one was the song of them all -- "the song of songs, which is Solomon's", @Song of Songs 1:1. The point in it is, that it is the Lord's triumph over the affections of His people, that is what the Lord counts to be His masterpiece, His triumph over the affections of His people; that is what He is seeking to do. He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star". That is what Christ is to the church at the close. It is the *Man* reappearing, as it were, after the sorrowful history of the assembly. He is reappearing to announce Himself to her. He says, "I am the root and the offspring of David" (wonderful testimony), "and the bright and morning star".
I think we do well to emphasise the deity of the Lord. He is the *Root* of David. Who can be that but God! but He speaks to us as Man in a voice of affection. He announces Himself in His true deity, He is the Root of David. It is Jesus, the Man of the gospels. Thank God, there is an answer to His announcement. It is the affection of His people that leads them to look for Him. "The Spirit and the bride say, *Come*"; there is not only affection, but there is full intelligence as to what He communicates. They know the meaning of His words. They know that He is the Root of David, that He is God Himself; and then He is the offspring of David; He is the Heir to everything that David set forth, and He must have His rights as such. Then He is
{341}
the bright and morning star; that star is JESUS. He is the bright morning Star in the midst of the darkening gloom of the world closing in, and where wickedness is intensified. Has He arisen in *your* heart? He arises in the heart of the believer to light you into the day. The morning Star appears before the day; it is the herald of the day. He arises in the heart of His own as light, so that they may tread with firm step into God's day. That is what we get at the close. "The Spirit and the bride say, *Come*"! Then there is activity for the blessing of others. "Let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come". Thus there is full church character. There is affection and desire in regard to Christ, and there is activity and interest in regard of the need that exists all around us.
Well, may the Lord lead our hearts to believe that there is a distinct voice speaking -- the voice of Jesus. *Bear that in mind*! The enemy no doubt thought that he had triumphed over Christ in death, but when Christ arose from the dead and went to heaven, the enemy could not touch *Him*, though he could touch His body upon earth. When Saul left Jerusalem, with his commission from the high priest to try and obliterate the name of Jesus from the earth, I believe the enemy thought he had completely won the day, but the Lord triumphed! Saul says, "*Lord*". He recognised the kingdom and the authority that were vested in Christ, and he became the great herald of God's Son. Now, the enemy failing in that attempt, he has succeeded in corrupting the church, he has brought in Jezebel, but the Lord is not defeated, so that at the close we find the bride is there. The Lord reappears and presents Himself, and so awakens affection toward Himself, hence "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". Thus the Lord is triumphant; He has His church, in spite of all the efforts of the enemy.
{342}
PROVISIONAL AND ETERNAL PRIVILEGES
@Luke 15:22 - 32; @Ephesians 1:1 - 6
In taking up these Scriptures my thought is to seek to engage you with what we are to God now in this provisional period, and what we shall be to God in the eternal state of things; and incidentally what we find now as our portion during this provisional period, and what we shall find eternally.
The Scriptures show us how God had ever purposed to have man with Him, to have man *near* to Him; and in placing Adam in the garden He intended not only that Adam should be in the joys and delights of paradise, but that *He* should visit him there. He intended to come to paradise; we read of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. It would seem that He discriminated in His visits. He came in at an opportune moment, the cool of the day would be a convenient time for Adam to be with Him. God discriminates so as to afford Adam every advantage. He came into the garden with a view to commune with Adam. Alas! as we all know, He did not find Adam; but we see in the visitation what was in the divine mind in ordering paradise. We know full well how that on coming to Adam God found him hidden. It is a sad thing to be hidden away from God, and it very often happens even with christians. As Adam might have enjoyed the presence of God in paradise, so christians have this great privilege, but it is on the ground of being apart from the world. God says, "I will dwell among them, and walk among them"; and "come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
{343}
daughters, saith the Lord Almighty", @2 Corinthians 6:17,18.
We find that God has in a provisional way the counterpart of paradise in christianity. He speaks of dwelling among His people, and walking among them. He has, as it were, a garden down here now, He has an enclosure, He has a spot apart from the world into which He can come, in which He can walk, and when His presence is known; we are made conscious that we are His "sons and daughters". That is a wonderful thing for us, but it is not the same as our eternal privilege; it is what we have provisionally on earth. "The Lord Almighty" makes us conscious that we are His "sons and daughters". We are made conscious of divine parental affections; so that we have *here* the place of being God's sons and daughters, and He who thus speaks is "Lord Almighty".
God visiting man in paradise shows us what is in the divine mind, that there should be a special place prepared for man of such a character that God should have access to it for man's benefit. Now we know, as I have said, how quickly all that terminated in the earthly paradise, but God never gives up a primary idea. He never surrenders *any* idea of His, so that if He does not accomplish it in connection with one set of circumstances He will accomplish it in connection with another.
Now after the flood we read of a national order of things being established. God was neither the author of a national order of things, nor yet was He the author of a city, but we find in the history of the world that both a national order, a kingdom, and a city appear.
Now how is God going to meet that? The order of things established in Adam had failed, and God permits man to show his hand, and what is man going to do? Well, man's idea was to found a city and a tower, the top of which was to reach up to
{344}
heaven; and in connection with that city you get a kingdom established by Nimrod. How does God meet *that*? *He* establishes a kingdom and a city of His own, He brings in what He intended to be, and what really was the antidote to the world system. In connection with Abraham's seed He brought in a nation, and He would have a place for Himself in connection with that nation. He established a kingdom, and in connection with that kingdom He established a city, and in connection with that whole order of things He would have a *house*, a place in which to dwell.
Now in the nation God had really better material, in one sense, than that which He had in Adam. It is perfectly true that Israel were not innocent when they came out of Egypt; they were very far from being innocent, but there was one thing about them pleasing to Jehovah -- they *loved* Jehovah. Jehovah in @Jeremiah 2, testifies to the affections that were begotten in the nation when they came after Him into the wilderness. It is one thing for God to comfort you, but it is quite another thing for you to go after Him, especially when it is in a scene where everything is against you. Now that is what Israel did; Jehovah reminds them in after years of the love of their espousals when they went after Him into the wilderness. That was a great result for God, and it was the brightest day in Israel's history. Everything was against them, there was nothing to attract them in the wilderness except Jehovah, and they went after Him into the wilderness. Now when they had showed their affection in that way, there was material for Jehovah to use, and hence He proposes to build. He says, "make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them", @Exodus 25:8. The fact is, *they* proposed to build God a habitation, and the material for the tabernacle came from them, so that in Israel we see an advance in that sense
{345}
upon Adam. Thus there was more for God in Israel when they left Egypt than there was in Adam in paradise.
There is no evidence that He ever secured reciprocity of affection from Adam, but He did from Israel, and they proposed to build Him a habitation, and He accepts it. He proposes it, and He proposes further to accept their habitation to dwell in. I need not refer to the other side -- their idolatrous failure. I am referring for a moment to what God found in the people in the beginning. God was not content that they should be in the wilderness. One of the most touching things with regard to God's relation with the people in the wilderness is, that *He* journeyed with them; in all the sorrows of their journeyings God was with them. He entered into them all, but the wilderness was not His end for them; the wilderness was but a means to His end. It was a wonderful place of privilege in one sense; God's tabernacle was there, and God was there; He dwelt among them and walked among them in the wilderness. Beloved friends, He would bring them in and place them in the mountain of His inheritance, in the place which His hand had established, @Exodus 15:17.
I want to show you for a moment how, in spite of all the wonderful pains and forethought with which God placed the people in Zion, He was, after all, deprived of what His heart was set upon. We must remember that God's thought for Israel was never reached until the temple was built. He journeyed with them, and entered into all their circumstances, but He had no house in which to dwell; He dwelt in tents until Solomon prepared the temple. Now, I must pass on to the end of their history, and that is seen in @Luke 13. The temple had been designedly built for God, the city was to be known as Jehovah's city; it was to be the city in which God would
{346}
dwell. We must remember that the coming of the Lord Jesus into the midst of Israel was the coming of Jehovah. The gospel of Matthew shows that it was Jehovah the Saviour who came. It was Jehovah in the midst of the people; He draws near to Jerusalem, and in sight of the city, from the summit of Olivet, all His affections that centred in that city arise in His holy soul. There was the city, the centre of all God's operations from the time that David had captured it until that time. It was the great divine centre on the earth; Jehovah's house was there; it was the centre of God's government on the earth, and here Jehovah appears, and as He looks down from the summit of Olivet upon the city He says, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" @Matthew 23:37. *That was Jehovah! "How often would I* ... but *ye would not*!" Man's will is active in that city. Jehovah was definitely refused as He visited the city in Christ, and now He says, "*your house*". It is no longer Jehovah's; "*your* house is left unto you desolate", and "Ye shall not see me henceforth". There is a definite break between Jerusalem and Jehovah. "Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".
But now I want to show you that God would not allow that all Jerusalem stood for should lapse; there would be a provisional order of things here upon earth, which includes in the principle of it, every feature of Jerusalem, and every feature of the nation, and every feature of the kingdom; all that would be established here in a provisional, nevertheless a spiritual way. I want to make clear to you what we have been introduced into as gentile
{347}
believers, which we are. We have been introduced into a wonderful order of things, which is to continue until the coming of the Lord.
Now in connection with this I refer to the Acts. We all know how the ministry of the twelve stood connected with Jerusalem, and how the operations of the Spirit at the beginning were connected with that city, for the city as yet had not been wholly abandoned. God in grace waited upon Israel, if perchance they would accept His overture, and all that went on until there was a definite rejection of the Spirit of Christ presented in the testimony of the twelve. Jerusalem was still lingered over, its ancient privileges recognised until the Spirit of Christ (I emphasise that), in the ministry of the twelve, and of Stephen, was definitely rejected in the murder of Stephen.
Now what marked the city? It only waited for Christ to enter into it, for it to show itself against Him; but after the death of Stephen the wickedness that put Christ to death became more active. Saul of Tarsus was present at the death of Stephen. He was a young man, and a young man is emblematic of energy, and Saul had energy to the full. He watched the death of the martyr, and held the clothes of the executors of it; he completely identified himself with the death of him whose face was the reflection of Christ. Now, there had never before been such circumstances on earth as that; it was not only the death of Stephen; it was a repetition, in a sense, of the crucifixion of Christ; it was as if Israel said, 'We are not a bit sorry for what we have done to Christ; we would do it again', and they did it again to him who was a perfect reflection of Christ. He looked up and saw the glory of God and Jesus; his voice and his manner and his words were all a reflection of what he saw; and they stoned Stephen, calling upon God; and Saul was
{348}
witnessing to his death, deliberately holding the clothes of those who stoned him.
And now Saul issues from the city; the energy, the evil, the wickedness of the city is personified in that man. The light, that wonderful light from the face, words, and demeanour of Stephen, all shone into his conscience, but he was rejecting the light, and the Lord says to him, "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks", @Acts 9:5. He was resisting inwardly that wonderful light, and all the wickedness that found its centre in Jerusalem became personified in Saul; and *he issues from the city*, breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord. There was the city of the Great King, the city of David's throne in which was God's temple; there the high priests were installed; that city was sending forth its emissary Saul, and he was in full accord with them; he was their apostle; he breathed out their spirit; he was in full accord with his credentials; he was breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord. *That is Jerusalem*!
But now what a change! God now transfers the authority from Jerusalem, from earth to heaven, so that when Saul leaves the land of Judea and draws near to Damascus, outside the territory of Israel, a voice *from heaven* is heard. It was a voice of authority, the voice of Christ from heaven, and it breaks Saul down. In that voice is embodied the kingdom of the heavens; the authority had been in Jerusalem, but now it was in heaven. The shekinah had left the city and was in heaven, and the voice from heaven conveyed no empty authority; *it was a voice of power*. It brought Saul down. The kingdom of God is in power.
I have referred to that to show that the order of things into which we as gentiles have been admitted began from that day. It is a heavenly kingdom,
{349}
and directly Paul opens his mouth to preach he preaches *the Son;* he does not preach the *King*. You might have thought he would, for it was the voice of the King that he heard, and he acknowledges Him as Lord; he recognises the voice of authority; but when he begins to preach he does not present Him as Lord, but as Son. I do not deny that he preached the Lord, because he *did;* but in Damascus he preached the *Son*. And if the Son is brought in, He introduces everything entirely new; and everything is of a heavenly character; hence you have a heavenly kingdom and a heavenly city.
In chapter 10 we see wonderful grace in the dealings on the part of God, which I would dwell on for a moment. It is seen first of all in preparing Cornelius, and then in preparing Peter. Chapter 9 is the heavenly kingdom, and the heavenly city in principle; and chapter 10 shows us that the mind of heaven is sympathetic with the gentiles. Peter went up to the house-top to pray, and while there he saw heaven opened and a great sheet knit at the four corners let down to the earth, and this was done three times.
Now what does that mean? It means that the order of things into which the gentile was about to be admitted was to be marked by this; that all the mind of heaven was sympathetic with the gentile. What was in that sheet, knit at the four corners, signified the creatorial rights of God. God had a right to creation, and that which was in the sheet represented creation, and God claims that. Peter was made to understand that what it meant was that what God had cleansed was not to be called common. God, in principle, had cleansed the gentile, and moreover, His mind was toward the gentile for blessing.
Peter is sent to preach to them, and while he is
{350}
preaching, and the gentiles are hearing, the Spirit of God falls upon them. The gentiles are thus brought into God's system, which, as we have seen, embraced a heavenly kingdom and a heavenly city. And all the mind of heaven was favourable; yea, the very heart of God was delighting, as we may say, in the returning prodigal. And the Spirit acted in energy as the passage implies, in taking possession of the gentiles; it was as if God embraced them. What a system is that which we gentiles have been brought into, and God really delighting over us! He says in @Luke 15:32, "It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad". @Luke 14 is the celebration of grace; it is what God has found in Christ as having accomplished righteousness. Chapter 15 is God's way of impressing on us what His heart finds in us. "This my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found". He found us who were lost, and we who were dead are now alive. The gentiles were dead to God, and He looked upon them in His loving kindness. Cornelius and his company represent the returning gentile; they were received as a company, as the Jews had been received. The Spirit fell on all them that heard Peter's word. Peter's part was to preach the word, and God gave the Spirit to the gentiles. "It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad". The "elder brother" would have nothing to do with the joy in the father's house on the return of the prodigal. I cannot dwell upon that side; I only wish to show what a delight God has in us in this provisional period. I want you to consider the elements of the system into which we have been introduced. It is a wonderful system; it is a system comprising a heavenly kingdom and a heavenly city; and the whole scene is pervaded with sympathy for the gentile.
I turn now to the few verses I read in Ephesians.
{351}
God shows us His own eternal state of things when we come to the epistle of Ephesians. We are there on the platform of God's counsels; it is not only provisional, it is what is eternal; and when we come to the eternal state of things, what we find is that everything is patterned after Christ. We are taken into favour in the Beloved. He has predestinated us unto sonship by Jesus Christ to Himself. We are not on the platform of the returning prodigal; we are on the platform of God's counsels. He has predestinated us unto sonship by Jesus Christ to Himself.
I want you to get that thought into your soul. The order of being that Wisdom has set its heart and mind upon is man; it is not an angelic order but a human order, and the relationship in which that being is put with God is that of sonship; hence we read, He has "predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself ... to the praise of the glory of his grace"; and we are taken into favour in the Beloved. It does not say here who the Beloved *is;* it is the strongest possible way of putting God's great affection for Christ. But wherever our relationship with Christ as sons is introduced, you will always find that the Spirit guards His Person. He must be supreme, pre-eminent; so that He is the "firstborn among many brethren", @Romans 8:29. Whilst the sons are related to Him as His brethren, He is the *Firstborn*. Whilst the company of sons are associated with Him as the Son, there is only one *Beloved*. I think Isaac is a type of Christ in that light. God says, "Take now thy son, thine *only son* Isaac", @Genesis 22:2. Abraham had other sons; he had Ishmael; but God says of Isaac, "Thine *only* son Isaac, whom thou lovest". How well God took account of the affections of Abraham; they were but a type of His own. God was really speaking of His own affections when He referred to Abraham's. "Take now thy son,
{352}
thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest". That was Christ as before God; He is His only One.
John, the beloved disciple, helps us there, and comes very near to Paul in his impression. He beheld his glory, "a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", @John 1:14. God has "graced" us in *that One*. He has given us a place within in connection with Christ, graced in all the dignity and beauty of Christ; that is God's thought for us. What a place that is -- taken into favour *in the Beloved*! What affection God has towards us to take us into favour in *that Person*. I can only suggest this to you in regard to the eternal state of things; we all have to admit how meagre our thoughts are in regard to God's eternal counsel; but, thank God, the light is there for us. God's thought is that we should be before Him, graced in all the beauty of Christ.
There is one other expression that one might bring forward to show the strength of the appellative Beloved; it is in @Acts 20:28, where we read that God has bought His flock "with the blood of *his own*". Paul says, "shepherd the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own".
We are in that way taken into God's affections in a unique way. May the Lord grant that our hearts may be under the influence of the love of God as it is known in Christ; as He says, "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them", @John 17:26.
{353}
READINGS IN THE BOOK OF RUTH
CHAPTER 1
The opening verses of this book indicate a dark day in Israel; "the judges ruled" but "there was a famine in the land". At the end of the book of Judges we are told that, "there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes", @Judges 21:25. *Elimelech* signifies that God is King; and yet, alas! he did what was right in his own eyes; he went to Moab. Elimelech's name signified the ground Israel had taken; they had professed that God only was their Ruler, and yet each was doing what was right in his own eyes. Elimelech maintained, as it were, the outward profession, and yet pursued his own way in going into Moab. In the present condition of Christendom there is a strong analogy to this. Many maintain an outward recognition of God and of Christ and yet pursue the bent of their own wills. This indeed marks the general profession of christianity; and there are numbers of true believers who, like Elimelech, are governed by circumstances instead of divine principles, and so get into false positions. Elimelech took his family to Moab, and Moab is the world of pride. "We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud", @Isaiah 16:6.
The circumstances in which Elimelech and his wife and sons were found afford an opportunity for the Spirit of God to show how the believer is recovered through affection. It has special application to our day. As said already, there is much outward profession, but souls are moving according to their own wills; and the Lord is waiting to effect recovery. The end reached, as we shall see more fully, is that there is a marital relation formed, and God secures
{354}
His portion in Obed. *Obed* signifies worshipper, or servant. From Obed sprang David, the king.
Elimelech being the husband of Naomi, he represents the side of responsibility, while Naomi is a figure of the nation viewed as that in which the light of God was. She was in the failure with her husband, but as far as her words go she had the mind of God; she had right understanding. Ruth became attached to her with more than natural attachment, and through her love for Naomi she comes into touch with Boaz and becomes his wife.
Naomi prefigures a true believer: she accepts the consequences of departure as from God. This is unmistakable evidence of recovery. She says, "call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me". The hand of the Lord had gone out against her, and she was humbled and in bitterness. But this result of God's dealings with us is the sure prelude to immediate and lasting blessing. Naomi signifies *pleasant*. The christian is pleasant in God's eyes, but as reaping the bitter fruits of unbelief he is not conscious of this. *Mara* is now appropriate. Elimelech and Naomi had a good excuse for going into Moab, for there was a famine in Canaan, but unbelief underlay their movement, for if God were King, as they professed, He would take care of them. Death overtakes Elimelech, Mahlon and Chilion in Moab, and the responsible side disappears. Naomi is Israel, or the christian, viewed as genuine and possessing the light of God; she continues to the end. *Prophetically*, Naomi is Israel, who, although she loses her husband and sons, is in possession of a son at the end, through the remnant, and through Him God's rights are established. The testimony was: "There is a son born to Naomi", chapter 4:17.
Ruth is a type of the remnant of Israel. She has no rights, pretends to no claim on Boaz. She says
{355}
"Why have I found grace in thine eyes ... seeing I am a stranger?", @Ruth 2:10. Beautiful effect of grace! On this ground shall the remnant of the future come into relationship with Christ, the true Boaz. But Ruth is also a type of the believer now; not as Naomi is, but as representing the affection formed by the Spirit. Elimelech represents the believer viewed in one light, Naomi in another, and Ruth still in another. Elimelech is responsibility; Naomi is the acceptance of this and the consequence of failure in it; Ruth is affection, which results in a marital relation with Christ. This latter is a special feature of three books in the Old Testament: Ruth, Esther, and the Song of Songs.
The strong affection of Ruth shines in her determined refusal to be separated from Naomi. This was more than natural; there was that in the widow of Elimelech which attracted her in a spiritual way. In Orpah there was nothing beyond the natural. She kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people and to her gods, "but Ruth clave unto her". Ruth's decision here has often an analogy now in souls being drawn to those who are moving out of this world as possessed of the light of another. The attracted ones are thus led to the Source of the light -- Christ Himself.
This but emphasises the importance of christians being governed by the light; "they ... declare plainly that they seek a country", @Hebrews 11:14. Naomi had set her face toward the land of Judah, where, as she heard, the Lord had visited His people and was giving them bread. She came to Bethlehem, where she was well remembered, for "all the city was moved about them" (verse 19).
Ruth's decision was most resolute. "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
{356}
where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried" (verses 16,17). Her choice was well taken, for she committed herself to one whose was the inheritance, and of whom the mighty Boaz was a near kinsman. They returned to Bethlehem at "the beginning of barley harvest" a most wonderful time typically, for it refers to the resurrection of Christ.
CHAPTER 2
As we have seen, Ruth and Naomi arrived at a most opportune time. It was "in the beginning of barley harvest".
This points to the time of Christ's resurrection, as the wheat harvest corresponds with the resurrection of the saints; that is, viewed as risen with Him. Christ is the "firstfruits" of them that slept (see @1 Corinthians 15:20), hence the early harvest, which was barley, is used to typify His resurrection. Compare @Leviticus 23. Ruth continued by the maidens of Boaz unto the end of the barley harvest and wheat harvest.
Chapter 1 teaches recovery; that is, discipline had its healthful result in Naomi, and now she is back at the point of departure, fully owning that the hand of God was upon her. An important point in connection with recovery is that the Lord is presented to us in a new light to that in which he has been known to us before. A comparison of the two epistles to the Corinthians would show this. The second epistle supposes that the first has effected recovery, hence Christ is presented as the Son of God in whom all the promises of God were "Yea" and "Amen", @2 Corinthians 1:20.
This was a new thought, and it was introduced to the end that the Corinthian saints might be established in their souls. In the first epistle the
{357}
apostle had told them that "God is faithful" (@1 Corinthians 1:9, @1 Corinthians 10:13), but now His faithfulness is proved by the fact that every promise is verified in Christ. In the book of Ruth a person who had not been referred to before is introduced in chapter 2. This was after Naomi's return from Moab. Christ is the true Boaz; He is the "mighty man of wealth" and declared to be such by resurrection from the dead.
There are many ways in which God works with souls so as to lead them out of the world. One of these is seen in Ruth's history. She got into touch with one of God's people and was in this way led to him who is a type of Christ. Coming to Christ now, we come to Him as risen from the dead; it is, as it were, the time of the barley harvest. If we begin with the barley harvest (Christ) we shall be led on to the wheat harvest; we shall be put into connection with the saints regarded as risen with Him. The wheat harvest is the fruit of Christ's death, for He was the "corn of wheat" that would have abode alone unless He died, but by dying, He has borne "much fruit", @John 12:24. Christ is the firstfruits from the dead, afterwards they that are His at His coming (see @1 Corinthians 15:23). When the truth is rightly apprehended the harvests are occasions of feasts (see @Leviticus 23) but this is not within the scope of this book.
We may now consider what is said about Boaz. He is introduced as related to Naomi -- "a kinsman of her husband's". This has to be specially noted. The object of the book is not to bring forward the greatness of Christ personally, but to show how He undertakes for the remnant of Israel in the latter days, and in them to establish the nation in its own land; and in a general way the book sets forth how Christ takes up the cause of any one who claims Him; being Man, He is related to men, and so all
{358}
can claim Him. Thus Boaz is said, at the outset, to be "of the family of Elimelech". Besides, he was "a mighty man of wealth". Hence Naomi and Ruth come to recognise in him one who had the right and power of redemption. Verse 4 affords further light as to the character of Boaz. "And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you. And they answered him, The Lord bless thee". That speaks as to what kind of a man Boaz was. He says, "The Lord be with you", and they reply in terms which indicate remarkable relations between him and his workmen; they say, "The Lord bless thee". You feel that God had a great place there. And this is a sure guide to the believer who wishes to locate the order of things over which Christ holds sway. Viewed from the side that christians are here to be of help to souls, it is of the very greatest importance that right conditions should prevail. Young people especially are helped and led on in this way. They are affected by the care and affection shown among the Lord's people. Ruth undoubtedly was drawn to Naomi by what was of God in the latter, and Naomi's God should become Ruth's God. As we see in Ruth, souls are drawn to Christ by what they see in His people. People thus come on to Christ's *field* so to speak. Here they come under His influence, and He demonstrates His grace and goodness to them. Thus their confidence is gained, and a definite relationship is formed between Him and them.
Ruth's "hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz", @Ruth 2:3. This was a great day in her history. Boaz at once takes notice of her; he inquires of the reapers, "Whose damsel is this?" Being told that she is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi, he addresses her as "daughter". How suggestive all this is of
{359}
the Lord's treatment of those who come to Him now! Boaz further directs her not to leave his field, and he tells the reapers to "let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her". What answers to that now is that coming into Christ's sphere of things exercised souls are made to realise something of the limitless spiritual wealth that is there, and how bountiful the Lord is in ministering it; but at first it is given in proportion to the actual needs of the soul. Ruth was overwhelmed by the grace and kindness of her benefactor, and this also corresponds with the believer's experience.
But light now breaks in. It is becoming evident to Ruth that Boaz is actuated by something more than compassion, and there is assurance in his address (@Ruth 2:11) that he was informed of her history; how she had forsaken father and mother and country for people whom she knew not, and how she had shown kindness to Naomi, and had come to trust under the wings of the God of Israel. In like manner now does the Lord encourage our souls when we take our true place before Him in the light of His grace, reminding us of what is but the effect of His own grace in us. And how becoming is her attitude: "Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?" (verse 10).
Ruth now returns to her mother-in-law into the city with what she had gleaned in the field of Boaz, and now she is enlightened as to who Boaz is. "Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen". In this way light breaks gradually into our souls and increases until the marital relation with Christ is formed. Chapter 3 will enable us to see how the believer is led on to this.
{360}
CHAPTER 3
As we have seen, chapter 2 sets forth the grace which marks the Lord's primary dealings with the believer. This is calculated to establish confidence in the heart, as is evidenced in Ruth here. She says, "Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thy handmaidens", @Ruth 2:13. There is becoming humility in her words, and confidence in Boaz is growing in her heart; besides, she *seeks favour* in his eyes. All this lays the ground for what is seen in chapter 3. Ruth "kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest", @Ruth 2:23.
It is a great thing to become thus attached to what is of Christ as the result of His gracious dealings with us. Young believers are apt to be timid and self-occupied, looking only at the dark side. Thus the Lord accredits us with much at the outset. Boaz gave Ruth credit for a great deal more than she would have taken credit for. The same thing appears in the Song of Songs, which book sets forth the Lord's triumph over us through our affections. The Song begins with the bride's exercises, given in her own words. She speaks of His love, and says of herself that she is black, though comely. Then the Bridegroom speaks to her of her beauty and grace. I think it is in this way that our hearts are established in confidence and set at ease in His presence. The Lord said of Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!", @John 1:47. But what the Lord thus accredits us with is the fruit of His own grace in us, and He speaks of it only where the heart is humble in His presence. It need not be said that He does not give the flesh credit for anything, for it *profits nothing*.
{361}
The experience of chapter 2 prepares Ruth for Naomi's proposal in chapter 3. She says, "My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?" The instruction upon which she was to act involved that Ruth was to approach Boaz on the ground of *kindred*. Ruth is now equal to this new undertaking, and so she complies readily with the directions of her mother-in-law. There are great things ahead of her, and Naomi understands this, so she instructs Ruth further to wash herself and anoint herself and to put on raiment. It was no longer to be simply in the company of his maidens on the barley field of Boaz, but of meeting him alone; of approaching him on the ground of kinship. Having to say to Christ in this light, the soul realises the need of preparedness. See Naomi's instructions to Ruth.
We may regard Naomi as representing the light here: she knew who Boaz was, and enlightened Ruth as to him. Ruth acts accordingly, and hence the great gain she acquired. It is painful to note how believers are often content to remain at a distance from Christ. The Lord delights in our coming forward to *claim* Him. But in approaching Him we must consider for His Person. The garments we might wear in the field will not do now, as we have seen. We are to approach Him, and for this there must be becoming attire. The sections of Scripture which have the marital relation with Christ in view, such as this book and the Song of Songs, help us on this line. The Person is before you, and you wish to be in the most intimate relationship with Him, and hence you think of what would please Him.
But there can be no doubt that we are conscious of need in our first approach to Him. The believer has light as to His Person and knows that He has ability to help. In this book redemption is in view,
{362}
and Ruth has this before her in her approach to Boaz.
The exercise indicated here is normal, but the experience of believers does not always correspond. There is great lack in this respect. Many know but little of a personal transaction with Christ. Moral strength is required for this, and this is acquired by the experience set forth in chapter 2. The food gathered on the field of Boaz builds up the constitution for what follows. What is to be noted in chapter 3 is that Ruth says nothing about being a stranger. This was in keeping with her first meeting with Boaz, but not here; a stranger could have no *claim* on him. She says, "thou art a near kinsman" (verse 9).
Another point to be taken account of is, that in going down to the threshing floor of Boaz at night Ruth did violence to natural feelings; faith always acts from its own motives, and is unconcerned about the propriety of its course as judged by the principles of this world. But Ruth was a virtuous woman, a woman of worth, in the eyes of Boaz, @Ruth 3:11. He had said of her that she had come under the wings of the Lord God of Israel for protection; now she says virtually to him, 'I want *your* protection': "spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman". It is a beautiful example of the knowledge of the Lord. Ruth here is a type of the christian as he advances in his soul in the knowledge of Christ, leading to our recognition of Him as having full title to us on the ground of redemption. At this stage Ruth understood that Boaz had *ability* to redeem, and that he was a kinsman -- he had *title;* thus she claims him. Later she had full testimony that he had the *heart* of a redeemer. This is the most blessed discovery of all!
As applied to Christ, the estimate Boaz places on Ruth is extremely assuring and encouraging to
{363}
the believer. He says, "Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich" (verse 10). Christ is not such as we might desire *naturally*, and hence He gives us credit for the grace which enables us to prefer Him. In truth, He is "the chiefest among ten thousand ... he is altogether lovely" (@Song of Songs 5:10,16); but this is not nature's estimate of Him. The remnant became attached to Christ, in whom the mass of the nation saw no beauty, that they should desire Him. The Lord, in taking account of our affections, does not overlook the opposition we may encounter from nature, or the flesh.
Boaz now assures Ruth (verse 11) that he would do all she required, adding, "for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman". And he acknowledges that he was a near kinsman, only there was a nearer than he. He further assures her that if this nearer kinsman did not do the part of one, then he would perform a kinsman's part to her. Kinship being thus claimed by Ruth and acknowledged by Boaz, we have the truth of redemption opened up.
CHAPTER 4
As we have seen, Ruth claimed Boaz as a near kinsman; this lays the ground for the development of the truth of redemption. Ruth did not make this claim in her earlier history; that is, when she first met Boaz, but she had made progress, and as instructed by her mother-in-law she went down to the threshing-floor and sought his help on the ground of kindred. Boaz owns the relationship (although there was one nearer than he), and then
{364}
the Spirit outlines for us in the most unmistakable way the leading thoughts in redemption.
The purchase of the field of Machpelah by Abraham helps us in considering the subject of redemption (see @Genesis 23). The land belonged to God, and was given in purpose to Abraham; yet the patriarch had to buy a burying-place for his wife. This showed that the land had passed into alien hands. Abraham would not accept the field as a gift from Ephron; he would pay for it. This was an act of faith, for it recognised the consequences of sin; that is, that although the land was God's, yet it was to be held on the ground of purchase. The cave and the field were made sure to Abraham for the full price. A leading thought in this transaction was that the money paid was *current;* "four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant", @Genesis 23:16. The only money current for redemption is the blood of Christ. We are redeemed "with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot", @1 Peter 1:18,19.
In the book of Ruth we learn that those to whom the land belonged have to be redeemed as well as the land itself. Ruth was purchased by Boaz. Ruth is a type of the remnant of Israel, and hence we learn that the nation as well as the land shall stand related to Christ on the ground of redemption.
The first great thought here is that the redeemer must be a kinsman to those needing redemption. As we have seen, Boaz recognised Ruth's claim of kinship, but there was a nearer than he, and the claim of this nearer relative must be owned. There can be no doubt that the allusion is to the law. The law was not a person, of course, but it was set in relationship with men, and what came to light was that it possessed no ability to meet man's case as sold under sin. "If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness
{365}
should have been by the law", @Galatians 3:21. The nearer kinsman here admits his inability, and then Boaz takes up his right to be redeemer. He had the means of redemption, for he was a mighty man of wealth. In this respect he is a striking type of Christ. Becoming man, Christ stood related to men, and hence had the right of redemption. But this was not all. He had the power to do so, for He is a divine Person -- the Son of God. The Lamb that had been slain is the Lion of the tribe of Judah (@Revelation 5), "the mighty man of wealth", @Ruth 2:1. To Him the myriads of the redeemed ascribe all praise.
Now we come to the great transaction itself, as foreshadowed here. It takes place in the most public place -- that is the gate of the city. Redemption was a *public* transaction. Redemption is in Christ, and is presented for faith in the gospel, but it was accomplished in the presence of the universe. Another great feature in this chapter is that all was done *legally*. The claim of the nearer kinsman was owned, and then the custom in Israel concerning redeeming and changing was fully observed, @Ruth 4:7. If we take "the custom ... in Israel" as pointing to God's requirement (which the Old Testament clearly teaches to be death), the plucking off of the shoe points to death. Death lay upon man and on the inheritance, and hence clearance can only be by death. The whole sacrificial system pointed to the fact that redemption could only be by the death of another, for without shedding of blood there is no remission.
From Abel onwards there was the persistent testimony on the part of God to faith, that His own Son should die for man's redemption. Now all is accomplished and Christ is risen from the dead and in glory; redemption is announced as in Him for all. The believer is justified freely by God's grace "through the redemption that is in
{366}
Christ Jesus", @Romans 3:24. And christians are said to have redemption in Him, the forgiveness of sins, according to the *riches* of God's grace, @Ephesians 1:7. As redeemed ones Christ only has title to us. If we recognise this we shall be kept free from the authority of evil. It is very important that saints should recognise that there is no one in the whole universe that has claim to them but the Lord Jesus Christ. We are His by right of redemption. This principle is seen in God laying claim to Israel in the firstborn ones, the firstborn being representatives. Subsequently, instead of the firstborn he took the tribe of Levi. He established His right to the people as having redeemed them. Then further on, in @Exodus 30, another thought appears, namely, that each believer cost the Lord the same price. The rich was not to give more and the poor was not to give less than half a shekel. The Lord has given Himself for us. You may appear insignificant in your own eyes, but the Lord gave Himself for you. And we are told further that the silver thus given was used to make sockets for the tabernacle. The whole divine structure rests upon that on which our souls rest, on the death of Christ. How secure we are!
As redeemed we are not our own. We have been bought with a price, so that "they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again", @2 Corinthians 5:15. This leads us to what was indicated in the name given to the son born to Boaz and Ruth -- Obed. He was a worshipper, or servant, one with whom God had His full place. Such an one is the glorious result of redemption. In him the name of the dead is raised up upon his inheritance. This shall be seen in Israel in the future, and it is worked out in the believer now. The book of Ruth introduces what the book of Judges called for -- a king. Obed was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
{367}
HOW THE LORD INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO THE BELIEVER
@Ruth 1:22; @Ruth 2:1 - 3
The thought on my mind is to see the manner in which the Lord introduces Himself to the soul of the believer, and the place woman holds in the Scriptures. I speak of her especially in the way in which she is taken account of in regard to God's testimony. In @Hebrews 11 two women are specially mentioned -- Sarah and Rahab, and we are told in that chapter that on the principle of faith "women received their dead again by resurrection", @Hebrews 11:35: Sarah setting forth that faith which brings in life. These women on the principle of faith received their dead back to life; they received the objects of their affections of which they had been deprived by death. The state of things in the Old Testament was that, whilst affection was there, the object was missing, but now we have received our Object from the dead, thus we have what answers to that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
By way of illustration we might take the Shunamite woman in @2 Kings 4. The prophet met her every need; she was the continuation of the widow whose every need was met. She was a great woman, a woman of wealth, but devoid of an object for her affection. Later she embraced a son: that shows in type how the Lord Jesus Christ is presented as the Object for the affections of His people, but He has to disappear in death. So the son of the Shunamite woman goes into death, but she receives him again from the dead, to retain him for ever. This is the present situation, we have the object for our affections, permanently in Christ.
{368}
In @Luke 7 we see affection begotten by the Lord when here on earth, in the woman of the city. She was a sinner, but she was attracted to Christ; she already had affection. In the beginning of @Luke 7 the centurion is presented to us, not as an example of affection, but as one who had faith. The testimony had moved out among the gentiles in principle and faith was there, faith that recognises Christ as One having authority. Although Christ was rejected by His earthly people, the centurion takes advantage by faith of what was vested in Him. The woman of the city was not exercised in regard to His authority, but in regard to His Person; she was attracted to Him and the Lord comments upon this. He takes account of her affection, and says, she loved much because she had been forgiven much. The centurion is continued in her. The centurion had come to Christ on the principle of faith and his needs had been met; his history is continued in the woman; she has affection for Christ and she comes to Him because of her affection for Him. Then she too lavishes upon Him all her glory; all that distinguished her is placed at the feet of Jesus, and the Lord singles her out as an example of the affection begotten in the hearts of His people by the presentation of Himself to them, and by the way in which He has brought relief to them. Then in chapter 8 you find a company of such people; they were drawn to Christ; the twelve were with Him, and many women who ministered to Him of their substance. The position in @Luke 8 shows what we are brought to as the result of the way the Lord introduces Himself to the soul of the believer.
Now in considering Ruth we see that it is an opportune moment in which she came to Bethlehem, for it was "the beginning of barley harvest". I want to be simple so that we might see how the
{369}
Lord introduces Himself, to our affections. Ruth came at the most opportune time; it was at the time of the first of the harvests. It refers in type to the time of the resurrection of Christ; the Lord Jesus Christ risen from the dead is the sheaf of barley, but the wheat harvest refers to the saints. The sheaf of barley typified the Lord Jesus Christ in the offering of firstfruits in @Leviticus 23:10. The wheat harvest came in later, when they were to bring two loaves out of their houses; referring to the saints in connection with the firstfruits, @Leviticus 23:15 - 17. Ruth did not come in there, but in connection in that which typified the resurrection of Christ.
They were advantageous circumstances under which this stranger Ruth came to Bethlehem. Naomi, as the vessel of light was intelligent and the point of attraction was with her; she had light and so became attractive, and Ruth found herself in Bethlehem as thus attracted. We come to Bethlehem just in that way. Light is in the world, the light of God is here, and souls are exercised and become attached to the vessel of light. I do not enlarge upon it, but only mention it to clear the ground. As thus attracted we find ourselves in the vicinity of the sphere influenced by the Lord Jesus Christ. The Spirit of God introduces Boaz as soon as Ruth appears in Bethlehem. We are given his characteristics and he is a mighty man of wealth. Ruth is now in a position to be introduced, and the Spirit of God brings forward Boaz. Where the Spirit of God brings forward Christ in a special relation in the books of Scripture typically or directly, you will find at that point a general indication as to the object of the Spirit of God in the given book. Directly Boaz is introduced as a mighty man of wealth, Ruth goes to his field. She says to Naomi, "let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn
{370}
after him in whose sight I shall find grace ... And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz".
I wish to speak about this field. Directly the person is introduced, you find what belongs to him is introduced -- his possessions. He is about to introduce himself to Ruth; to make himself known; and the Spirit of God immediately brings forward the field which she happened to light upon. It belonged to this mighty man of wealth. Christ has a field. You will find the idea of a field in various places in the Scriptures. In Genesis a field is mentioned and we are told that Abraham purchased the field. It was not a field of barley, or of wheat; he had no thought of tilling it or of cultivating it. He had lost the object of his affections and he purchased the field as a burying ground. The Lord Jesus Christ has acquired the field at the present moment and He has paid current money for it. Typically He acquired it in the presence of the elders of the land and not only has He acquired the cave, but the trees also. We are told as to Abraham, "And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city", @Genesis 23:17,18. Abraham used the cave.
The Lord Jesus has right of way in the field; He has paid for it; He has purchased it by His precious blood; He has secured the title deeds. The question is, what is He doing with it? He is using it, beloved, at the present moment as a burying place for the objects of His affections; for the saints. God buried Moses, and the Lord Jesus
{371}
Christ buries His dead. He owns the field, and He has His own here to bury His dead, as we read "devout men carried Stephen to his burial", @Acts 8:2. The Lord Jesus is taking care of his body. He also is taking care of his spirit; He has the spirit of Stephen as a precious treasure in His keeping. The potter's field was bought with the price paid for Jesus, the price of blood. It was to bury strangers in, and the disciples of Jesus are the strangers, they accept the place of reproach. We should not minimise that for the eyes of men are upon us; but the Lord Jesus Christ takes care of us.
The Lord has another field, a field in which the barley grows, and it is to that field you should be attracted. It is outside of man's world; it is something that has come out of death. After the passover was celebrated their attention was to be attracted to the field of barley, when they came into the land of Canaan. The present time is that of the firstfruits of the barley harvest; the resurrection field. The Lord does not introduce Himself to the christian in the field bought from the sons of Heth, now the potter's field, but He allures us on to the field of barley which has been reaped. Ruth's hap was no chance; it was by divine attraction.
Suppose a christian has been put by your side by the Lord Jesus. You may not realise it, but it is true that He is superintending all the operations of the Spirit here on earth. A christian has light in him and it is something that attracts you and interests you. In virtue of it, you accompany him and you find yourself in the barley field. The Lord has His way; He wants you; He will make Himself known to you, but He chooses the circumstances in which to place you, in order to capture you completely. He would have you to be where there is plenty. It is then we learn the kind of man that
{372}
Boaz is; He is not only a mighty man, but also a man of wealth; he is related to Elimelech and is a kinsman of Naomi and Ruth. He is a mighty man, a man of wealth, a kinsman, and he has the touch of grace. He went to his reapers and spoke to them in relation to Ruth. We also see the kind of man he is towards his reapers, for he comes to the field and says to them, "The Lord be with you", @Ruth 2:4. This is a field where the workmen are set for the good of souls. They are his workmen, his reapers. See his relations with them! "The Lord be with you", he says, there is no reproof; no question as to how much they have done of the day's work. He has perfect confidence in his reapers. "The Lord be with you", he says. It is well for the soul who is near by where that takes place. Their answer is "The Lord bless thee". You see what a place God had there; perfect relations are established between the man -- Boaz, and his reapers. They were no slaves, and they are recognized for their work. That man had a great place in their hearts, there was no complaint on either side. On the one part it is "The Lord be with you", and on the other side "The Lord bless thee". That is what is going on in the Lord's field. He is taking notice of you now.
Boaz says to the servant that was set over the reapers, "Whose damsel is this?", @Ruth 2:5. What a touch of his grace. There are great thoughts in the book; we have redemption presented and marital relationships established, producing a worshipper. Is it not a wonderful thing to hear Christ inquiring for you; "Whose damsel is this?" The servant's answer is, "It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab", @Ruth 2:6. They are now on the point of introduction. The Lord holds Himself back, as it were, and the servant continues his answer to Boaz, "And
{373}
she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house. Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my *daughter*?", @Ruth 2:7,8. What a beautiful touch there is in that word *daughter*. It is a term of relationship, and it established confidence in Ruth at once; he draws her on and says, "Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them", @Ruth 2:8,9.
The Lord gives you advice not to go on to another field. Many souls try different fields. Those who come into this wonderful sphere are developed, and the advice of Christ is that they should not go away, but hold on patiently. You will receive encouragement. If there is any advice I would give to young souls, it is, Hold on. Now see what relationships, what grace is here. The Lord may now be leading you on. He will give you credit for a great deal more than you would take credit for yourself. Boaz says, he has heard about Ruth and realises that she has come to take refuge under the wings of the Lord God of Israel. Thus you will have the Lord's encouragement so that you are prepared for more. Ruth replies, "Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens", @Ruth 2:13.
Now you get her side after Boaz has spoken to her. The Lord has spoken to your soul and encouraged you; and now you are to speak to Him, and address Him as Lord. You say, I am not like one of thy handmaidens, I am a stranger. You find a great disparity between yourself and the Lord's people; you may find that you are not
{374}
equal to them, but the Lord's grace is towards you, and as thus humble before Him, you are but a subject for His grace. "And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar", @Ruth 2:14. The Lord is now leading you on to something better, to a meal, a spiritual feast. "At mealtime come thou hither". The Lord is leading you on to this point where you are enabled to take part in a meal, for there is a feast of divine things. "And he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed", @Ruth 2:14. Coming, as it were into His field, and you are met with His grace and He would have you partake of a meal and be sufficed. You never come into touch with Christ and His people without gathering up something, so here Ruth brings back something to her mother-in-law. The testimony to the character of the field and of Boaz personally is conveyed to her, and now she is prepared for the revelation as to who he is.
Naomi knew Boaz and she makes known to Ruth who he is, and that he is their near kinsman. What I see in it is that you are gradually being prepared for the marital relationship to Christ. The next chapter shows that Ruth is so encouraged by the treatment received in the field that she is prepared now to go and seek Boaz. The third chapter is the outcome of the second, and typifies the Lord's leading the soul to the revelation as to His Person. Ruth is prepared to go and seek Boaz, and she follows until conscious that, if she is to go to him, it must be to him in the threshing floor, for he is there.
Now, that is where the test comes. I believe every christian is tested. The Lord discloses Himself to you in His grace. Naomi proposes to Ruth that she should seek Boaz and she follows until conscious that he is in the threshing floor and she goes down
{375}
to the threshing floor at night. If you have to go and seek out Christ, you must go through that. I do not intend to enlarge upon the theme of the book, only to point out how the Lord discovers Himself to your soul. You find His grace and He causes you to sit down, and you are able to take something away. Then you get the disclosure of that Person who has been dealing with you so graciously. Now you must seek Him for yourself. When we, in our affections, seek out Christ at the present moment it involves the violation of natural sensibilities. We must do violence to all that is of nature. We must lose our self respect; all that attaches to us in the way of dignity and reputation. Ruth is equal to it, she goes down softly and uncovers his feet, and she says, "spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid" (@Ruth 3:9); she is acting according to the light she had received. Her heart is attracted to Boaz, and she disregards natural feelings. The answer of Boaz is "Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning ... And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest", @Ruth 3:10,11. Beloved friends, if we touch the Lord's feet in this respect as Ruth did to Boaz, and declare our appreciation of His kinsmanship, He "will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day", @Ruth 3:18.
The next chapter shows how it was settled. There was another kinsman before him, but Boaz sat down in the gate of the city and publicly puts in this claim to Ruth. I wish your heart might be touched by what is involved in it. It means that the Lord Jesus went into death to establish His "right of redemption". Boaz had the "right of redemption" (@Ruth 3:12) we are told. The death of Jesus is the great means by which His rights were asserted in grace, so that He might have us for Himself.
{376}
Boaz did not rest until he had secured that woman who had been so attracted to him that she would seek him out at the expense of her dignity and her honour as a woman. We see thus in figure how the Lord takes up our case, discharges all our liabilities and secures us for Himself entirely. The Lord secures us, on the ground of redemption; the marital relationship cannot be entered into short of redemption. It is, as redeemed by the Lord, that we delight in Him. He has redeemed us; we belong to Him; we are His property. The Lord has a wonderful way of disclosing Himself to us in order that we might be in intimate relationship; that we might "be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God", @Romans 7:4. We see the result of all this in Obed; the "son born to Naomi", @Ruth 4:17. Obed is the fruit, he is a worshipper, and thus the divine thought is secured through all these exercises.
May the Lord bless His word.

THE LORD'S SUPPER
@Luke 22:7 - 23; @1 Corinthians 11:23 - 26
J.T. It has been suggested that we might consider the Lord's supper, and what accompanies and surrounds it.
The disciples here raise a question with the Lord as to where the passover should be celebrated, and He said to the two who were sent to make preparation, "Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready". There are spiritual thoughts connected with all these directions as to the place.
W.G.B. What is meant by the man with the pitcher of water?
J.T. Well, it suggests something spiritual. It is an earthen pitcher. I think it represents a vessel of the Spirit. It indicates a vessel in which the Spirit of God would be active. "We have this treasure in earthen vessels", @2 Corinthians 4:7. It is a wonderful thing that the Spirit of God is indwelling these. The Spirit of God is active in such. But here a man bearing a pitcher is *going* somewhere.
E.J.McB. The man is going to where there is a guest-chamber.
J.T. Yes, and they were to follow him into the house where he was going. There was a distinct lead. It is a great matter in regard to the Supper
{378}
to see where the man who has the pitcher of water is going.
W.G.B. The heart follows there.
J.T. Yes, indeed. There are many circles now, but does the man with the pitcher go in to each?
W.G.B. The Lord goes where His authority is owned.
J.T. It would appear that the authority of the Lord was recognised there. His rights were recognised. The Lord simply asks where the guest-chamber is.
E.J.McB. You take the man with the earthen vessel to be a type of the active ministry of the Spirit, and the authority of Christ is seen in the fact that there is a demand made for this guest-chamber.
W.G.B. And the demand is acknowledged, too. That is a great help to christians who are perplexed as to the Supper.
J.T. The Supper cannot be dissociated from the assembly.
E.J.McB. Will you say a little on the recognition of the activities of the Spirit?
J.T. Well, it is a wonderful thing that there is here upon earth the ministry of the Spirit. There is a great deal of ministry in christendom; a great deal of activity in service. There is such at the present moment in this city. But what christians should look for is the ministry of the Spirit. There should be a sensitiveness as to whether the activity is spiritual activity. The greatest lack is want of ability to recognise what is of God.
E.J.McB. The effect of spiritual ministry is that the affections of the saints are refreshed.
J.T. Christ is sure to be the subject of spiritual ministry. The Spirit brings forward the things of Christ. One of the greatest thoughts in Scripture is that "God is a Spirit", @John 4:24. The Lord said
{379}
that to the woman of Samaria, and it was in order to set aside all material worship and to set aside in her mind all idea of materialism, and of ceremonialism, in worship. God is a Spirit, and hence every one is put to the test as to spiritual ministry, as to whether we have spiritual sensibilities.
J.R.K. Is the authority of Christ the test as to the true ministry of the Spirit?
J.T. Yes, true ministry is sure to be connected with the authority of Christ. But the authority of Christ is set aside in christendom. If the authority of Christ is not recognised you cannot have the ministry of the Spirit. Where these two thoughts are allied together you get the assembly, and hence you can have the ministry of the Spirit. It is the *Lord's* supper, and that involves His authority. The state of the Corinthians was such that they did *not* have the Supper, though they *did* come together.
E.J.McB. There is the Lord's authority on the one hand, and the *state* of the saints on the other. At Corinth the state was such that though they had the outward form yet they had not the Supper.
J.T. The apostle does not hesitate to say that the Corinthians had not the Supper. The question is asked sometimes have the religious systems around us got the Supper? Well, have they shown themselves subject to the Lord's authority? We are asked sometimes what have the systems got? Clearly they have *not* got the Supper, though they take the sacrament.
E.J.McB. The great point is that we should have it for ourselves.
J.R.K. Would you say the "master of the house" represents the Lord?
{380}
J.T. Well, it represents rather the *element* that recognises His authority.
W.G.B. What is the spiritual thought in the title of "Teacher"?
J.T. I suppose that in judaism it carried some moral force with it. A teacher would have certain moral authority. What is taught carries weight with it. The Lord has a moral claim on us. We owe our christianity to Christ. Every christian will admit that.
W.G.B. "They shall be all taught of God", @John 6:45. Is that through Him?
J.T. Yes. Every christian ought to recognise that the Lord has some moral claim upon him. There could be no doubt that this "master of the house" knew something about the Lord, because the Lord refers to Himself as the Teacher in the message He sends, and at once he shows the upper room furnished.
E.J.McB. What is your idea as to the "large upper room furnished"?
J.T. It shows that the place we occupy is morally very large.
E.J.McB. There is room for all christians. All christians may have a place there.
J.T. One feels for young believers. Why are not young believers partaking of the Supper? It is for *all*?
E.J.McB. There is no reason why they should not.
Rem. They are afraid of failing in their responsibility in regard to it.
J.T. If you love the Lord you ought to break bread. If there is a response to His affections there should be an opportunity for their outlet. There are a great many absentees. The Lord appeals to the affections of those who are absent. He thinks of them all. He loves each one individually. The
{381}
Lord loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, and He loved them equally. The Supper really is a family affair. Family affairs are of great interest to the family, and the Supper is pre-eminently a family affair. The Lord knows every one in the family; as every man knows each member of his family by name. Mr. Darby gives a very touching note in regard to @Luke 24. Speaking of the Lord taking the bread, and blessing it, and breaking and giving it to the two, he says, 'He took the house-father's place'.
J.R.K. Is it because we are defective in regard to the family that we are not at the Supper?
J.T. Where sin is not judged you cannot be at the Supper. But why should we not judge sin? Why go on in sin? Why not forsake it? The Supper is there for you when you do judge it. The passover has reference to Christ as subject to the judgment of God, as made sin. "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast", @1 Corinthians 5:7,8. *God* provides the passover Lamb for you, but the unleavened bread is what *you* provide.
J.R.K. Unleavened bread was the only bread that was provided during the whole of the seven days.
E.J.McB. It is really food for our affections.
W.K. A good many here may not know what the signification of unleavened bread is. Will you kindly explain it?
J.T. Well, it is the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. One is hardly a christian at all if one is not sincere. It is not hard to understand what sincerity is, and what it is to be true. The great point is to see the spiritual thing. There is little use in talking about spiritual things unless the heart is right. Sincerity and truth are the outcome of the Spirit.
{382}
E.J.McB. Will you make a few remarks as to the Supper itself?
J.T. Apart from a spiritual state the Supper is not enjoyed.
Ques. Why is it called the Supper?
J.T. Well, because ordinarily supper is the last meal of the day. The last meal of the day is a meal at which you are free. The responsibilities of the day are over. The Lord's day is the suitable time because we are free then. In coming together we should be entirely free in mind from secular affairs. A man can sit down with his family at supper time free from the cares of the day. It would not be so at breakfast time, or dinner time, for then his responsibilities would be before him. The day would be before him. The idea of a day is responsibility. "Are there not twelve hours in the day?", @John 11:9. "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work", @John 9:4. The Supper is to bring the Lord Himself before us.
J.A.M. It is only as we are free in mind that we can take the Supper?
J.T. Yes, we must be free to take it rightly.
E.M. We are sometimes taken up with singing, 'We'll praise Thee, glorious Lord, Who died to set us free' (`235:1).
J.T. Well, that is very suitable. There is no direct injunction with regard to the Supper. We have the Lord's request, and then the precedent established by the early christians. They came together on the first day of the week to break bread. Christianity is much more a question of what is established by the Lord and His apostles, than a system of injunctions. Hence the great need to be spiritual. Everything the Lord did had a spiritual thought behind it for us. So when the passover
{383}
is ended He breaks the loaf, and He gives it to them. That is a spiritual idea. In the Supper there is that which you see, and that which you eat.
E.J.McB. What I feel myself is that we want to get to the point of the importance of what you were telling us about the Supper being the last meal of the day; the end of the day. If one could realise that we are entitled to be perfectly free.
J.T. Yes, there is no labour in front of us, so that we can be free to sit down and contemplate Christ.
J.McG. You spoke of what you *see*, and what you *eat;* what have you in your mind as to that?
J.T. Well, the Lord set something before their eyes. There was the loaf; what they could see. There are, I think, two thoughts in it. The Lord had no part in the eating of the Supper, but He *did something;* He *broke* the loaf.
Ques. Has the breaking of the bread the signification of His death?
J.T. Well, it refers to what *He* did. I think it refers to the fact that His body was to be given in death, and that He gave it voluntarily. It is what *He* did. It is not what *others* did to *Him*. Eating is communion and appropriation. The fellowship is in the eating. There is that which is presented to us objectively in the Supper. There is one thing I cherish very deeply, and that is that the action was a family action, and the Lord was really within the house. As regards the passover, it was also connected with the family. The Supper was instituted after the passover. The Lord was the *house-father*. The family were looking to Him. He took the house-father's place. In @Luke 24 when He took that place He took bread and broke it, then He vanished, but they knew Him. They knew Him in the breaking of bread. There was something in the way He did
{384}
it that made them recognise Him. It was the action that belonged to the head of the house.
W.G.B. That is very interesting.
J.R.K. The bread was not broken by those who invited Him in. *He* did it. He broke the bread, and that fact reminded them of what He had done before. As you say, He was taking the house-father's place. It is very beautiful indeed.
E.J.McB. What do you say in regard to the one who may break the bread at the present moment?
W.G.B. I should hesitate to admit that the person who does it has any special place.
E.J.McB. A person may break the broad, and saints may not be affected by it.
J.T. Well, I have seen one take the place of the head of a house in his absence. The eldest son might do that if his father were away; and he might do it in the way his father would do it. So that in the manner in which it was done the absent one would be called to mind. The absent one would be recalled by the act. It is thus, I think, with the person who now breaks the bread. As it is done, the Lord Himself would be recalled to the minds and hearts of those of us who are sitting there. The absent *one* would be recalled by the act.
E.J.McB. We want to get away from the outward ceremonial act.
J.T. Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons" (@1 Corinthians 10:15) which I think refers to spiritual formation. The breaking of the loaf suggests the Lord to you. I do not understand the word *do* apart from that fact. It recalls the occasion. It recalls the Person.
Rem. You think that "this do" reminds us of Him, and brings Him prominently before us in that way?
J.T. Yes.
{385}
S.L. It is the action of the Spirit of God that brings the Lord in a very special way before our hearts.
J.T. The Lord says He will come to us; but it is in a spiritual way. The difficulty is on the spiritual side, not the material side. Why should not the Lord move? Love will move. Did you ever know a stationary love? Love in the essence of it is active. The Lord is actually away. He was present when He instituted the Supper. The very thought in the Supper contemplates His absence. In the assembly the Lord comes to us in a spiritual way, so that He is personally with us.
E.J.McB. If He were not absent we would not break the bread.
W.B. The fact that we break bread shows that He is away.
J.K.R. It is that the Lord moves.
J.T. Yes, the Lord moves.
S.L. In a spiritual way it is made a reality to us.
J.T. Why should not the Lord come to you, or to me? The movement is not on your side only, but on His also. The point I am seeking to make clear is that He moves. Surely the Lord can move if He pleases. How well His people know that He moves to them individually. They have proved that many a time.
E.J.McB. If He moves to the individual, He can move to the company.
J.T. He says, "I will come to you", @John 14:18. Let us admit the truth. In verses 21 - 23 of @John 14, the Lord makes His coming conditional; conditional on keeping His commandments. "I will love him and will manifest myself to him", @John 14:21. Then He speaks about His word. If we keep His words the Father and He will come. Is not that activity?
E.M. There is movement on His side.
{386}
W.K. Instead of leaving them in the desolate condition in which they were, He will come to them.
J.T. I have likened it to a mother saying to her children in the next room, who are calling for her, I am coming. She cannot go to them just at that instant, but she assures their hearts and sets them in expectation. Our side is to come and partake of the Supper.
W.G.B. He brake it and gave to them. Would not that include the whole thing?
J.T. I think the Spirit distinguishes between the breaking of it, and the eating of it. The Lord did *not* eat it. What He *did* reminds us of Him. Then there is the announcement of His death; "as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come", @1 Corinthians 11:26. It is *announced* to the world, but the world has not any idea of the remembrance of Christ. That is for our *hearts*. I think it should be a very precious thought to us that the Lord will come; that the Lord is active towards us. I cannot understand why He should be in any way restricted. He came out of heaven to speak to Paul, and He stood by Paul at Jerusalem.
Rem. I think this is bound to make His coming very much more real to us.
J.T. The great thing is to be in a suited state for it. That lies at the bottom of it all. The most simple soul may be conscious of the Lord's presence.
E.M. The effect is very marked on the soul that is conscious of the Lord's presence.
E.J.McB. A simple soul will want to break bread.
J.T. The Lord is with His people at all times, and He supports us specially in our difficulties and
{387}
exercises. @Matthew 18:20, I think is a levitical meeting. It is a meeting of those who are exercised about the testimony. The Lord is there to support them. Being "in assembly" (@1 Corinthians 11:18) proper has no reference to what is levitical. It is a special season of privilege. That is the moment you would expect the Lord to come to the company. He comes now, indeed, as the heavenly Man. The Lord's affections are there, but in @Matthew 18:20, He is supporting us in our exercises in the levitical circle. In the assembly proper He is coming as to His "brethren". At the Supper you are free from the thought of responsibility. You are free for the moment.
E.J.McB. There is something adapted to the needs of the saints in a levitical meeting.
J.T. The Supper is the link between the wilderness and the land. When you come together "in assembly" you have Christ and the assembly. The Lord wants the assembly. The Lord wants us to be free. He loves the thought of the assembly, because it affords Him what He is seeking. You recall Him according to what He is. He was the Head there; He took the initiative in everything; the disciples understood that. They were accustomed to that. He always did it. The Lord was the *house-father*. Lordship has reference to official authority. The term *Lord's* supper is in contrast to the "table of demons", @1 Corinthians 10:21. It is in contrast to what is outside. @1 Corinthians 10 has reference to what is outside, but chapter 11 has reference to what is inside.
W.G.B. Exclusion without. Inclusion within.
J.T. We come together in a scene out of which Christ has been rejected. How essential it is that we should have in our hearts the thought of the Lord's authority over us. Christians in the early
{388}
days were all spiritual. I think @John 14:18, supposes this, hence His *coming* applied to all. But His commandments and His word became a test. The assembly is a spiritual formation, but we *come together* down here as in a flesh-and-blood condition. We come together to *eat* and *drink;* but we go on to what is spiritual.
W.G.B. To hear His voice and to see His face. There would be no distance if we knew that in our hearts.
{389}
READING
@John 14
Rem. I suppose this chapter is in view of the testimony?
J.T. Yes, testimony during the Lord's absence; and the Lord's words to His disciples in chapters 13 and 14 were calculated to impress upon them His great interest in them. Chapter 13 shows us how we are to act towards one another; that is, the Lord indicates the spirit in which we are to act one towards another, and as that spirit is acquired among the saints you have an element of sustenance. There are various elements of sustenance which these chapters indicate, and I think one element is that there is to be mutual affection. As the Spirit of Christ is apprehended and acted upon there is an element of sustenance, which is of great value during His absence.
E.J.McB. It seems to be all intended to have a great effect upon our hearts.
J.T. We all know that in natural things a family spirit has great weight with us. We know how families are inter-dependent. It is a very beautiful thing to see family affection and family interest, and we know how that where things are right naturally, the spirit of affection is an element of mutual sustenance. I think that is the point in chapter 13. Then, I think, the first half of chapter 14 is objective; that is, the gain of having Christ as a Man in heaven. He knows exactly what we are going through upon earth, and He is to be the Object of our faith in heaven. He says, "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me". In spite of all outward failing and breakdown, the Lord's provision for His own remains; Himself as an Object of faith -- the Son;
{390}
and the place He is preparing for us in the Father's house -- the saints¬ eternal home. Then the second half of the chapter would be the provisional arrangement, or order of things, which the Lord has instituted here whilst He is away. It is His provision in view of His absence. The Spirit's presence down here for ever. Then the unconditional promise, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" (verse 18). Then the *conditional* promise to those who keep His commandments and His words where declension has set in. Where these conditions exist the Father and the Son find out that soul. Christ manifests Himself to him and divine Persons make their abode there. These divine manifestations are realised in the power of the Spirit.
E.J.McB. You get that side of things with the thought of *Comforter*.
J.T. Yes, the presence of the Comforter here, and the things which depend upon it; divine manifestations, etc. In the Old Testament divine manifestations and activities were largely in connection with angelic agency; as, for instance, in the case of Abraham, but now all is changed. Angels are not used in that way. There are angels sent forth to "minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation" as @Hebrews 1 shows; but all direct communications now are dependent upon the Spirit. So that the gain of the Spirit is enlarged upon in the second half of chapter 14.
E.J.McB. Would the gain of the Spirit in the second half of the chapter lead you into what is the true objective side of things in the first half?
J.T. Yes, I think they run together; as our brother was saying at the outset, the point in view is the testimony. They were to be interested in His things whilst He was away, and there would be serious difficulties to encounter. But He encourages their hearts by saying, "Let not your heart be
{391}
troubled". He shows really that His going away would be in their favour, and that they would be infinitely superior to their surroundings. So that these are assembly chapters. They have reference to our position here ecclesiastically; and the Lord shows what resources we can count upon. If He were to continue here personally all these considerations would not be needed, but He is not to be here, for chapter 13 begins with the thought that He is to depart out of the world to the Father.
Ques. What do you mean by ecclesiastical position?
J.T. Well, I mean *church* or *assembly* position; that is, it is a question of persons left here *together* who love Christ, who have the Spirit, and who are to look after His interests while He is away.
Rem. You mean the company is taken account of?
J.T. Yes; what I see is that if there is a head of a family, every right-minded member of that family would do all that is possible to maintain what is the mind of the head. The Lord assumes that here, that each one would be interested, and He shows what would be available to such. If your heart is interested it is an immense thing to see the things that are available here on your behalf.
Rem. So that the presence of the Spirit is of the greatest moment.
J.T. One great essential feature in those who form the assembly is mutual affection. The Lord says, "that ye love one another, as I have loved you", @John 15:12. So that we have to consider the *kind* of love the Lord manifested to His own -- that is the kind of love we are to express to each other.
Ques. Did not that mark the company to which the Spirit was sent?
J.T. I think the company Christ left here manifested a most touching character. The only authority they had to go by when He left them was the
{392}
Scriptures; and the Spirit shows in @Acts 1 that they were engaged with the Scriptures, and in prayer. They were together, and united; so that @Acts 1 shows that the company to which the Spirit came was morally suited to receive Him.
Rem. You would say God had prepared a vessel for the reception of the Spirit?
J.T. Yes; I think so. And what the assembly began with is what is to continue afterwards. You cannot associate the Spirit with anything that does not recognise the authority of the Lord; because Christ here connects their love and the keeping of His commandments with the gift of the Spirit.
Ques. Why is He called the Spirit of truth here?
J.T. Well, I suppose it is in contrast to the spirit that is in the world. It is an immense thing to have the Spirit of truth, because if He is allowed His place everything is recognised in its true relation. Everything is adjusted by the Spirit of truth. What really came out in the assembly was that every divine institution had its place and recognised value; so that God's world took form in that way.
E.J.McB. Would not that be the maintenance of the primary thought of God?
J.T. Yes; things in the world are not true. The idea of truth, I think, is set forth in the principle that builders recognise. If buildings are not put up on that principle they collapse.
E.J.McB. Is not Christ, in that way, the full expression of truth?
J.T. Yes. In Christ's ministry everything was adjusted; everything got its true place according to God. You will find that in the discourses of the Lord everything was adjusted. So that now the Spirit has come into the assembly to have that maintained livingly here. Thus in his first epistle John tells us the *Spirit* is the truth.
E.J.McB. That would help one, because if you
{393}
look only at the ways of God you might not arrive at the truth; but what we have now is the *Spirit* of truth.
J.T. I think the idea of truth is, that everything is adjusted according to God's mind. Everything in the moral system is out of joint, but when Christ appeared, in so far as His ministry went, everything was set in order. And so the coming in of the Spirit is the establishing of the principle of God's world. Every divine institution has its relative place, and is recognised according to its true value. Take marriage, for instance: marriage is a divine institution. In Christ it has its proper place; Moses allowed divorce, but that was on account of their state. It is not really according to the truth to allow divorce. Hence Christ did not admit of it. He says, "From the beginning it was not so", @Matthew 19:8. So that the further the world gets away from God the greater disregard it has for divine institutions. But the presence of the Holy Spirit is that everything is maintained in its true relation.
E.J.McB. So that we have to go back to the assembly to get the testimony of what is of God.
J.T. Yes.
Ques. In what way would you connect the ministry of Paul with what you are speaking of now?
J'T. Well, the ministry of Paul really comes in later. It comes in in chapter 16. There it is said that, the Spirit would take of the Lord's things, and would show them to us; but in chapter 14 He would remind them of all that Christ taught. The conditions to which the Spirit came afford one of the most interesting considerations. I believe saints are too loose in regard to the Spirit. You cannot connect the Spirit with what is morally unsuitable to God.
{394}
Rem. "Whom the world cannot receive".
J.T. Quite so.. The Spirit is far more jealous as to what is due to God than we are liable to think. Take all the activity in the evangelical world, as it is called; but then you cannot connect the Spirit with what is not true.
Rem. He is called the Comforter.
J.T. The point is "*another* Comforter", that is, the Lord's place would be taken up by *Another*. If we had been acquainted with the Lord as the disciples were, we would have an appreciation of this. Many of us do not miss the Lord at all. We do not feel that there is a great blank in the world; but you miss your father and mother when they are removed, because there is a link of affection there. If we loved the Lord more we would miss Him.
Rem. We are tested in that way.
J.T. Yes, I think we are.
Rem. Was the coming of the Comforter provisional?
J.T. Yes; only He remains with *us* for ever. He takes the place of Christ whilst He is away, but while Christ is present the Spirit recedes. That is not derogatory to the Spirit, because the Spirit always makes Christ prominent. He always remains with us, but there are circumstances in which the Spirit of God is prominent, as, for instance, in the beginning of Acts. Peter's explanation was that "this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel", @Acts 2:16. He says that these men were not filled with new wine; they were filled with the Spirit. There are conditions in which the Spirit is prominent and there are conditions in which Christ is prominent. When the Lord takes His place in the assembly, He is supreme. Of course, the Spirit is always the power, whether it be of ministry or affection, or praise, or worship; He is always the subjective power. But when the Lord takes His place in our
{395}
midst it is evident that He must be supreme. But this chapter contemplates the Spirit here and Christ absent.
Rem. The host, in @Luke 10, was to take care of the man, as the Samaritan had done before.
J.T. Yes; quite so.
Ques. What is the difference between the presence of the Spirit, and the presence of the Lord?
J.T. Well, the Spirit never presents Himself as an object of worship. The Spirit was to abide with them, "he may abide with you for ever", @John 14:16. The Spirit never leaves us. But the Lord *does not say that of Himself*.
Rem. The Spirit will never leave the assembly.
J.T. No. He is here instead of Christ.
Rem. I mean when the assembly goes.
J.T. But the *Lord comes* for the assembly. The Spirit's office is to take care of it whilst Christ is absent. The Lord does not leave it to the Spirit to take the assembly home; He comes Himself.
Ques. What is the force of the Scripture where it is said the Spirit descended like a dove and abode upon Him?
J.T. It showed that God had now a permanent resting place in Christ; it showed also that Christ was a divine Person. I think the allusion is to Noah's dove; she could find no rest for the sole of her foot, @Genesis 8:9. The Spirit, you may say, found no resting place in the Old Testament; until Christ appeared He found no abiding place.
E.J.McB. Then, as you were saying, there was a Person who was morally suited to the Spirit.
J.T. Yes.
Ques. What is the difference between the Lord being "amongst you" in @1 Corinthians 14:25, and the Spirit being there?
J.T. That is God; "God is in you of a truth", @1 Corinthians 14:25. God is always the supreme Object of worship and
{396}
veneration. "One body, and one Spirit ... one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all", @Ephesians 4:4,6, and the wonderful fact was that He was in the christian company.
Rem. You spoke of the Spirit as being the agency by which everything is realised. Do you mind saying a word more upon that?
J.T. I remarked what I think is evident, that in the Old Testament God acted generally through the agency of angels; the Spirit was there, but divine manifestations were by angelic agency; but it is not so now. He comes now in a spiritual way. The presence of the Holy Spirit here involves that things are made to depend upon Him. One can readily see that in the Old Testament there were very great limitations, but there are no limitations now.
Ques. When the Lord comes in that way now, is it that He comes Himself?
J.T. Yes, He comes Himself. We must always maintain that the Spirit is not Christ. There is Christ personally, and the Spirit personally. How the Lord may come is another matter; that is left largely for the soul to discover. But He comes in a spiritual way; and the thought of His coming is introduced *after* the Spirit's coming is announced.
E.J.McB. You said that when Christ is prominent the Spirit recedes. I think that is very important.
J.T. Yes, of course when you get a man speaking in the power of the Spirit it is Christ in a sense; but the *Spirit* is prominent; that is @1 Corinthians 12; it is a question of the activities of the Spirit.
Rem. The Lord is careful to show, in @John 20 that it is He Himself, not a spirit, who came to them.
J.T. Yes; and the fact that the doors were shut shows that it is independent of what is material. The Lord comes in a spiritual way, but *He* comes.
Rem. How would you reconcile Colossians with
{397}
it? It has often been noticed that the Spirit is not mentioned here.
J.T. The point, I think, in Colossians is that there was declension; and what the apostle insists upon is *Christ*, "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him", @Colossians 2:6. He brings forward Christ almost universally in Colossians, and I think the point was to establish Him firmly in the affections of the saints. God had wonderfully favoured them, because really the gentile is in view there; so he says, "Christ in you, the hope of glory", @Colossians 1:27. It was a wonderful thing for a gentile company to know that Christ was there amongst them.
Ques. Would you distinguish that from what we were speaking of in @John 14?
J.T. In Colossians it is not a question of the assembly convened; it is a question of the *state* of the saints. As the Lord says, "ye in me, and I in you", @John 14:20. We are in His affections, and He is in ours. But this is different from His coming to us. See also @2 Corinthians 13:15.
Rem. Is not @John 14 a question of the state a good deal?
J.T. In @John 14 the company is in view. The Spirit came to them collectively, we know. They were gathered around the Lord when He was speaking to them here. I think the coming promised in verse 18 was enjoyed collectively. Coming to a faithful individual is spoken of afterwards.
Rem. You say there are times when Christ is prominent, and there are other times when the Spirit is prominent.
J.T. Yes; I think at a meeting like this it is the activity of the Spirit, if there is anything at all. His function is to instruct, and so forth. All is under Christ, we know, but the point emphasised here is "another Comforter"; that is, One who took the Lord's place. If you take a meeting for
{398}
prayer: there it is a question of the exercises of the saints engaged levitically; they are bearing burdens. But the idea of the assembly is that it is free and for Christ. But in prayer we are thinking of care, and of needs that exist. We come together for that purpose; hence it is not properly an assembly meeting, because the levitical idea is that people are bearing burdens. Then the Scriptures contemplate other meetings. Jude speaks of "love-feasts" (@Jude 12) for instance. The apostle says, "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together" (@Hebrews 10:25); but there is one *special* occasion that the Scriptures indicate. There is no injunction in regard to the Lord's day. It is not enjoined; therefore one would not enjoin it on the world. It is no credit to us that the world keeps the Lord's day: the Lord's day was never intended for it. It was a spiritual idea that faith laid hold of, and Acts shows that the saints in the early days recognised it in that way. They came together on that day. The Lord set them the example, as in every case. He came to the company on two successive Lord's days, and the saints, I think, were quick to discern what He had done; and thus they would come together. If the Lord was pleased to come into their midst on two successive Lord's days, I would say it was well worth while to come together on that day. Besides, He rose from the grave on that day.
Rem. It was the resurrection day.
J.T. Yes. It was a day of immense importance to Him. He honoured it in that way. Many thoughts enter into the first day of the week. The seventh day has reference to the creation, but the first day of the week refers to christianity; there is no end to it. It refers to what is spiritual, and so entirely new.
Rem. Would you not say that the Lord counted
{399}
on their affections, and they would recognise the way He came in?
J.T. The testimony of the Scriptures is that they were together *before* He came in. It may have been for a brief moment, but at any rate they were already there. As to the second visit it says, "his disciples were *again* within, and Thomas with them. Jesus *comes*, the doors being shut", @John 20:26.
Ques. Would you say that the Spirit gathers us together?
J.T. Yes, I would. But, as loving one another, *we come together*.
Ques. And when we are gathered together in that way by the Spirit, does the Lord come in?
J.T. I think the Lord would come to us as we are prepared for it.
E.J.McB. Do you not think that one of the main features with regard to the Lord's coming is that He comes to those who miss Him?
J.T. Yes, He comes to those who love Him, and so feel that He is away.
E.J.McB. You mean He comes to affection.
J.T. I think if you really want the Lord He will answer to affection. But we must never put the Lord in the position of acting automatically. There are many who seem to think that the Lord *must* act, but you can never regard the Lord in that position, because He is sovereign, and He always reserves His sovereign rights. Even if He is to come, you can hardly say that He comes even when the conditions are there. He will not disappoint affection; but I put in the provision because many think that because we are together the Lord is there. That will not do at all. You are making the Lord act automatically, and disregardful of the state of the meeting.
Ques. Is it to the company He comes?
J.T. This chapter shows that He comes to the
{400}
individual. Whatever extremities we may be reduced to, the Lord will not forsake us. If there is only one left, the Lord will come to him; and that ought to be a great stay to our hearts now.
Rem. One would see in this chapter the history of the assembly. First of all He comes to the company without a provision; then He comes to the individual who loves Him and keeps His commandments.
J.T. Because the Lord there assumes that early assembly affections were there. He assumes that they all loved Him, which they did, hence there is no condition stated in verse 18.
Rem. You said a moment ago that the Lord comes to the individual; that is not excluding the fact that He comes to the assembly.
J.T. The point here is that the Lord makes the provision for us no matter to what extremity we are reduced. To anyone keeping His word, He and the Father would come. So that your heart is sustained; no matter how extreme the day, the Lord promises you a visitation.
Rem. I am not clear about His coming to the company today.
J.T. Well, if He comes to one, He can come to two. I do not know that we can take any other ground than that now; that is, that the Lord will come to the individual.
Rem. There might be a hundred gathered, and five out of the hundred realise His presence.
J.T. Yes.
E.J.McB. In admitting that He comes to the individual, I think it covers the whole point: because if you admit one individual, you can multiply that to any number.
Ques. Is it a question of conditions when the Lord comes?
J.T. Yes. That was why I said the chapter
{401}
was prophetic; the Lord was casting His eye down upon the whole history of the church; and what He shows is that the individual who loves Him and keeps His words is not deprived of the greatest privileges that the assembly primarily enjoyed.
Ques. What is the difference between @Matthew 18 and this?
J.T. @Matthew 18 is levitical. Matthew contemplates administration down here in the assembly, and the Lord indicates that even if they were reduced to two or three, He would be with them to support them. But here He is thinking of you, what you need for your affections; not support exactly, but what *your heart* requires. If you love Him you want to see Him. I quite admit that the Levites did not go inside, even to the first holy place; and of course, prayer really is at the golden altar, not at the brazen altar; therefore you are a priest in prayer, I think. But @Matthew 18 contemplates our being gathered in relation to the Lord's interests, and the promise contained in it always holds good.
E.J.McB. Do you not get the fact that He comes to the individual beautifully sustained in John, at Patmos?
J.T. Yes; it was to give revelations, however. But here the affections are fully met. Now, if a person comes to live with you, it is not a question of supporting you, but of enjoying your affections. One might say that because things are so reduced we are deprived of the earliest privileges of the assembly. But the Lord shows that we are not. I think that is an immense thing.
E.J.McB. If one were in the enjoyment of this individually, would it not be a great stimulant to others; that many more might enjoy it?
J.T. Yes, I think so. We would seek to get others into it. The idea very much has been to go into the world and convert people. But you want
{402}
to get people into the assembly. Present-day evangelisation means that if a soul is converted he is told to go back to where he came from. That is what they are told. There is not a bit of heart in that. That does not bring the soul to Christ. It is not the Spirit of Christ, because the Spirit of Christ is that He went to the sheep, and laid it on His shoulders, and brought it home. That is the spirit of the evangelist. I think it is very beautiful to go through Luke, and see the spirit of the true evangelist. He put the sheep on His shoulders, and brought it home.
Ques. Would not that be the primary thought of the evangelist?
J.T. Yes, I think so.
Rem. The Father was not satisfied until He had the prodigal inside the house.
J.T. I do not think the present evangelical activity would be supported a single hour were it not that it builds up the systems of men. Christendom is going to pieces, and the leaders want their systems maintained; and they are very glad to have them maintained in that way. But if it be a question of taking souls to Him, the systems collapse; and so the true evangelists get no support from them.
Rem. Yes, because those souls are taken from the system.
J.T. If one went into one of the churches, and preached separation, and any left, it would to that extent weaken the system.
Ques. Will you say a word on verse 20? "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".
J.T. The Lord, I think, refers to the present moment, the Spirit's day; when we are conscious of these things; "that I am in my Father"; that is, that He is in His Father's affections; "and ye in me" I take to mean that we are in His affections.
{403}
All that is now known by the Spirit. The fact is that the disciples had a great deal more than they knew about when Christ was here. He says so in this chapter, verse 9; but the presence of the Spirit makes it all evident to us.
Ques. What about verse 19? "because I live, ye shall live also".
J.T. Is it not a very precious thought that the Lord makes our life to depend upon His life? If He lives, we live. As David said to Abiathar, "he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life", @1 Samuel 22:23.
Ques. Does the Lord give us credit for what we are not really up to?
J.T. Yes. He does indeed; it is the greatest comfort I know that the Lord views our actions from His point of view. He says of Mary, in @John 12:7, "against the day of my burying hath she kept this". I do not know that Mary understood it, but the Lord understood it; and she understood it afterwards.
Ques. What is the difference between verse 15, "If ye love me, keep my commandments", and verse 23, "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him".
J.T. I think the latter is to encourage the individual.
Rem. I was thinking of what the Lord says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". He did not say He was coming to abide.
J.T. I think verse 23, as I said, is to encourage the individual. The Father *and* the Son would come. It is an immense encouragement. It is not that He comes to such in circumstances that are strictly individual; He comes to us, to where we are ecclesiastically. The whole point is, where are we in our souls in regard to the testimony? Things have got very small, and very weak; but
{404}
the Lord is not hindered by that. So that John is exiled on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus; but the Lord came to him there.
E.J.McB. The Lord contemplates an individual who wants to be true to Him; but things are so low down that there may be only one individual?
J.T. Yes, I think that is exactly it. I take "our abode" to be the Lord's way of emphasising what the individual might reckon upon. It is even more than is spoken of in verse 18.
Ques. Is that saying that in coming to the company He *stays*?
J.T. No; the Lord does not say that They would make Their abode *eternally;* He simply says that the one who keeps His words would enjoy such a thing as that. The point is that he should enjoy such a thing as the Father and the Son abiding with him. We read elsewhere, "they abode with him that day", @John 1:39.
E.J.McB. It is referred to in verse 25; "These things I have said to you, abiding with you". Clearly it did not mean He was going to stay.
J.T. Yes, exactly. I think the point in it is to show that the individual is wonderfully taken care of; his privilege is even greater than what is stated in verse 18.
E.J.McB. As things break down on our side, there is an increase on the divine side.
J.T. Yes, and all for the encouragement of the individual. We have little idea of the way the Father and the Son take account of the present circumstances; and the remarkable thing is that they are similar to the circumstances the Lord found Himself in when here.
Ques. Would you confine this thought of the Lord's coming to the Lord's day morning meeting?
J.T. I think we are warranted to connect the assembly in its proper character with the first day
{405}
of the week. I believe that is correct, if you examine the allusions to the first day of the week in the Scriptures. The thought in the assembly is that we should be free. Now, in the prayer meeting you are engaged with what is levitical. In a meeting like this it is more a question of instruction and mutual edification. It would not do if the Lord were present to be speaking to one another as now; *He* would do everything. If a man of gift were present he would not use it if the Lord were there.
E.J.McB. I think we would all feel if the Lord came into the room now, and there were any questions to ask, we should question *Him*.
J.T. Yes; now it is the Spirit.
Rem. We really touch the assembly in the Supper.
J.T. Well, that is so little understood; and I am not saying that I am different from others in that, but the assembly in its spiritual character is so little known consciously that it is little understood.
E.J.McB. I think you will agree with the thought that there is nothing to surpass being where Christ is in supremacy.
J.T. It is ecstasy.
Ques. Is that possible?
J.T. I think the allusions to ecstasy in the Scriptures show that the early christians knew what it is. It was not unknown. The assembly is for Christ, and the great thing is to get free; and to be so free that you are for Christ. It is well to recognise that He is for *you;* but what about *His* heart? "It is not good that man should be alone" (@Genesis 2:18) and God's thought was that Christ should have the assembly. Sarah dies, and Rebecca is brought into Sarah's tent; and we are brought into Israel's place in order that we may be for the comfort of Christ.
{406}
READING
@John 20
E.J.McB. I think the general feeling is that we might pursue the same line that we have had before us; that we might have something on what one might call the functional side of the assembly.
J.T. @John 20 would more follow what we had last night.
Ques. In what way does @John 20 follow chapter 14?
J.T. It is the difference between the Lord's affection and care for His own, and the inauguration of the new order of things; and therefore chapter 20 stands on a much wider platform than chapters 13 and 14. This chapter stands by itself; and, what occurs in it being the inauguration of the assembly, it is necessarily once for all. There could be no other inauguration.
Ques. Is the new order of things confined to the assembly?
J.T. I think in its highest character it is; but the new order of things, while necessarily including what God will bring in in the future, proceeds from heaven. It is not only what is established in resurrection. The new order of things comes from heaven. So that in principle, in coming into the company here, the Lord came from heaven. I do not say He did so *literally*, because He had not actually ascended; but He came to them following upon His message that He was ascending to the Father.
E.J.McB. That is, it was in the light of His ascension that He came in.
J.T. Yes.
{407}
E.J.McB. He did not speak of His ascension merely as a fact that would take place at a certain time, but in regard of what it set forth.
J.T. The point is as to the moral place which the ascension holds. It is not only here that He is *risen*, but "I *ascend* unto my Father, and your Father". In chapter 14 He is *going* to the Father, which is another thought.
Ques. What is the difference?
J.T. Well, the word *ascend* shows that the Father is in heaven. In going to the Father the Person to whom He was going is more in view, but in chapter 20 the *place* where the Father is is the prominent thought, and that He ascends *there*. I think the truth of His own Person is involved in that; that is, He has title to ascend.
Rem. Inherently.
J.T. Yes, in the light of what He was, He could ascend. He had title to do so.
Rem. In chapter 17 He lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said, "Father, glorify thou me", @John 17:5.
J.T. I think that is rather what He is *as Man*. He had carried out God's will here, so He could say, "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do", @John 17:4. It was due to Him that the Father should glorify Him, and I think His prayer is based upon that. It was a demand for what was morally right; but, then, He is a divine Person, and He has *title* to ascend in virtue of who He *is*.
E.J.McB. Yes; the idea is not that He *asked* to be taken up, but that He *goes* up.
J.T. And He goes up to His Father, and *our* Father; it is a very precious thought. He says, "go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend
{408}
unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God and your God". It shows what a place the assembly has.
E.J.McB. Is there anything to be learned from what is seen in Mary, prior to this?
J.T. I think Mary represents the affections, the subjective side, in the disciples.
E.J.McB. Would you say it is the 'orphan' side of things?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Then, previous to this, was not *resurrection* power inherent in Him as a divine Person?
J.T. Yes. John, I think, always presents that side. He shows, for example, in chapter 19:30, that the Lord dismissed His own spirit; His death in that way was an act of divine power. So chapters 17 and 18 show that He is in supreme command. In chapter 18:6, He faces His enemies, and they all went away backward and fell to the ground; and He says "if therefore ye seek me, let these go away", @John 18:8. That is so touching. There was the Shepherd's spirit and the Shepherd's heart; He was thinking only of the sheep; and so He delivers Himself up. Then they put Him on the cross, and He looks after His mother there; and later, He dismisses His spirit. So that all through John's gospel it is a divine Person who is seen.
E.J.McB. "I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again", @John 10:18.
J.T. That is how John so helps us. He shows us, in view of the decline and ruin, that we have to do with a divine Person, so that there can be no defeat. I think that is the great value of John's writings. They apply so especially to our own day.
Ques. Is not the resurrection the crowning *sign* that John gives us? He says "many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples ... but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God".
{409}
J.T. Yes, it was the greatest visible sign as to the greatness of His Person. As a Man the Lord was here in humble guise, and the point in the signs was that the disciples might believe; that we might really be believers on the Son. There are a great many christians who do not really believe on the Son. John knew that, and he wrote to establish christians in the truth of the Son. He shows, in fact, that he had singled out these special signs "that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ", and not only that, but that He is the Son of God.
E.J.McB. If one really believed in the Son, nothing in the soul would wane or break down.
J.T. And there is no possibility of defeat. One remarkable thing about John's gospel is that it notes the Lord in isolation; and it also throws a slight on what was official. One of the most striking instances is in chapter 4, where the Lord is seen alone at the well. It is a most touching scene, and in the narrative there is a slight cast on the disciples. Why did they all go away and leave Him there? One would have thought, knowing the Lord, they would have lingered about with Him. But it says His disciples had gone into the city, and as the narrative proceeds, the woman appears, and she becomes the evangelist; and she had no official place at all. She was really an outcast; she comes into contact with Christ, and He tells her the most wonderful things. She goes back into the city, having left the waterpot, and says, "Come, see a man ... is not this the Christ?" She took back, in *principle*, living water into Samaria. The disciples were looking after the material side; they went to buy meat. She may have met them going in and coming out, but she bore a testimony. When they came to the Lord they did not know what had transpired; they wondered why He talked with the woman; the apostles did not know the *meat He*
{410}
had to eat. I think there is a distinct slight cast upon the apostles there.
Rem. His *meat* was not in the light of what is official.
J.T. Then you find in chapter 7:53, and 8:1, that they all went to their own homes, and Jesus went to the mount of Olives. Yet with all that there is a link formed between Christ and the remnant, and that link is represented here, I think in Mary.
E.J.McB. Yes, and there is the wonderful fact that He recognises them as His brethren.
J.T. You feel that He would not recognise any as His "brethren" unless they were morally qualified to be that.
Ques. Is the ascension here intended to indicate the way which the affections of the disciples should take?
J.T. Yes, I think so; and also that before you can have public testimony the saints must understand their heavenly position. If you do not take up your heavenly position, the testimony is necessarily reduced. Now, the testimony of the assembly was to take character from the light in which the company is placed here. They are to be sent out into the world as witnesses, but they are sent out in the full light of their heavenly association and position.
Ques. What is the force of @John 6:62, where the Lord says, "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?"
J.T. It shows that He came out of heaven. The point in @John 6 is the "bread which cometh *down* from heaven" (@John 6:50); but in chapter 20 we have the Lord going *up* to heaven, and this involves the "old corn of the land", @Joshua 5:11. Why do we need heavenly food? It is to build us up in a heavenly constitution.
Ques. Can the christian have any other?
{411}
J.T. Yes, I think so. If you feed on the Psalms only you would not have a heavenly constitution. What are christians generally feeding upon? What people feed upon gives character to their constitution; and if you have not a heavenly constitution, you are not fitted for heaven. Neither are you qualified to render a heavenly testimony here. We not only need the *light* of our position, but the *food* that is suitable to it.
Ques. Would you say that sonship is involved in what we have here?
J.T. Yes, the brethren of Christ are God's sons. The idea of sonship is the order of beings in whom God delights; the idea of brethren is mutual affection.
Rem. Testimony is not simply the message, but the character of those that bring the message.
J.T. I think the vessel was to be suited for the message.
Ques. Would you say that the message was to make known to them their position?
J.T. The message was to prepare them for the *visit*. The message is the light of our position in relation to Christ, so that we may know how we are suited for such a visit.
Ques. Will you give us help as to the heavenly character of the assembly? Is it in the light of the message, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend", that it is viewed?
J.T. Yes, that is the *ground*. But the ground signifies the attitude which you take up in your soul. Suppose a man is an Englishman; no matter where he is, the ground he takes is that he is an Englishman. Now, the ground that *you* take is that you are a heavenly man. You are entitled to take that ground. I think that the idea of *ground* is in that way symbolical. It is simply the attitude of soul you take up, and that gives character to
{412}
your testimony. If it is a question of adverse power, I take the ground of resurrection; but if it be a question of position, the ground I take is that I am heavenly, and that delivers me from the earth.
E.J.McB. And that really, as you were saying, prepares you for the visit.
J.T. Yes. The first convening of the assembly, according to this chapter, is in the light of the heavenly position; there can be no question about that. And see what is involved: why it is wonderful that we are accorded such a place as that, and that these poor disciples should have such a marvellous message sent to them. I think that it rendered them suited for the visit. It made them great enough for it. It did not as yet characterise them subjectively, but what we get here is the principle of the truth.
Rem. The next thing we find is that they are together.
J.T. Yes, and, as we said, they are together in the light of the message. John records all this here in order to set forth the heavenly position of the assembly; the *inward* aspect of it. The Acts gives us the outward aspect. Hence here, the Spirit is given inwardly; the Lord breathes into them, whereas in Acts it is what is external; "it *sat upon* each of them", @Acts 2:3.
Ques. Would you say that a heavenly testimony comes out from the company, and that in @John 20 the whole company is contemplated?
J.T. Yes; and that raises another important distinction to be made; that at the outset the company at Jerusalem was formally designated "the assembly" (@Acts 5:11); but after the introduction of Paul's ministry, what we find is that the christian economy takes the form of local assemblies. The only mention of a general assembly subsequently is in @Acts 15, and that was in the wisdom of God to
{413}
connect the gentile work with the Jewish work; but under Paul's ministry the christian economy took the form of local assemblies. Hence all assembly privilege and responsibility from that time is connected with the local company.
Rem. And not with any general assembly at Jerusalem.
J.T. No. So we read in @1 Corinthians 1:2, "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth ... with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours". There, I think, you have intimated that the christian economy was to take the form of local assemblies. At the same time catholicity was to be maintained. Hence Paul could say, "if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, *neither the churches of God*", @1 Corinthians 11:16. It was essential that the order of the house should be carried out in each local company. So now it is a question of each local company taking up the privileges that belong to the whole. Corinth is thus spoken of as God's assembly, and God's temple. Now all these thoughts have reference to the assembly as a whole.
Rem. The apostle says, "so ordain I in all churches", @1 Corinthians 7:17. That would show that the same thing was to prevail everywhere.
Ques. Would you say that in @John 20 you get the constitution of the assembly?
J.T. I think we have there, as I said, the inauguration of the assembly, not in its outward aspect, but in its heavenly relationship, privileges, and position. It is what is *inner;* what is altogether spiritual; whereas the epistle to the Corinthians gives us what is outward.
E.J.McB. Is not one great side of privilege -- that you see the Lord?
{414}
J.T. Yes, I think so. He makes Himself known to the company, but that is spiritual. Do you not think so?
E.J.McB. Yes, entirely; but it is *real*.
J.T. We must not think that because a thing is spiritual, it is not real: the most real things are spiritual.
Ques. I would like to ask why it is that the Lord introduces the heavenly character of the assembly here, because a difficulty exists in some minds owing to the fact that the Lord had not yet ascended.
J.T. Well, I think it is, as has often been said, a question of pattern; to show what the inner privileges of the assembly are; and it is that which qualifies us for the outer. If you only take the side presented in Acts, where we have the historical account of things, you would lose this side.
Ques. Why do you say pattern? Is it because the Lord inaugurated it Himself?
J.T. Yes; it is remarkable that in John's gospel he brings this out. The historical side in the Acts stands related to the official administration of the twelve. The Spirit came to them out of heaven, but it does not involve that they were heavenly. Now, John writes his gospel after all that is official has given way, and he shows that the Lord inaugurated something quite outside of what is official. So the apostles are not called apostles here, they are simply disciples. Our privileges thus, as christians, are even greater than the gift of an apostle.
Rem. Does not officialism come in where there is a lack of spirituality?
J.T. Well, yes, only I think we have to bear in mind that there *was* what was official. The apostles were given an official place; but the system they inaugurated gave way, and John's testimony came in to meet that; he shows that the Lord set up
{415}
something outside what was official, something that was wholly spiritual; and that remains.
E.J.McB. It was really set up before that which was official.
J.T. Yes, and the Lord speaks of the saints here in the light of their relationship with Him, and then He places responsibility upon them. He says to them, "as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".
E.J.McB. In relation to our brother's remark, no one could inaugurate anything like this, save the Lord.
J.T. And here, as a divine Person He breathes into them. It is not a question here of having received the Spirit from the Father, but He breathes into them Himself. Now Luke, in the Acts, gives you the other side. He shows us that the gift of the Spirit was connected with the promise of the Father; they were to wait for the fulfilment of the promise. Then Peter, standing up, tells them that "having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear", @Acts 2:33. And he shows that God had made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ; that is what is official. But here in @John 20 it is most intimate and touching. He breathes into them; it is not official.
Rem. That was His own risen life.
J.T. Yes, it was His own life.
Rem. They were to go forth here in His own Spirit.
J.T. Really it was the Spirit of the ascended Man that they had received. It is a wonderful thought.
Ques. How is it that the disciples were found together again, without any message, eight days after?
J.T. I think, as we were saying last night, they
{416}
took cognisance of the precedent established by the Lord; it is as if they appreciated the previous occasion.
Ques. What do you understand by the expression "eight days after"?
J.T. 'Eight' signifies a new departure, and is mentioned first in connection with Noah. Seven is the order of God in creation, and eight is a new departure from that. But as in all Scripture, it has no private interpretation, and cannot be limited to any one thought; so that in this passage I think, you have also intimated that the first day of the week was the assembly day. Hence the *same disciples* are alluded to. It says, "eight days after, his disciples were *again* within".
Rem. Thomas is singled out in the second meeting.
J.T. Yes. He represents, no doubt, the remnant of Israel.
Rem. When it is said that the disciples were together, does it mean *all* the disciples?
J.T. It would seem so, as if it were said, 'The brethren of Belfast'. I think they were all there. It would appear that Thomas was the only one absent on the first occasion.
Ques. Do you take it to be representative of the whole company?
J.T. Yes, I think so. It says, "And eight days after, his disciples were again within ... Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst". Mr. Darby has pointed out in the Synopsis that the Lord in that way signalised the first day of the week as the day He met with His own down here. It is important to see that christianity is established on precedent rather than on commandment.
Rem. It came in really before the Scriptures were written.
J.T. Yes. In the old economy it was a question of law. Moses was not the embodiment of the
{417}
testimony; he was not the law. He told the people what to do, but he was not what he told them. I think the point in christianity is that it is *Christ expressed;* the early christians were quick to discern things that the Lord did, and they attached value to them. It came out in a very remarkable way in Paul's ministry, for all that he taught was set forth in himself. He could ask the saints to be followers of him as he followed Christ. This establishes the great difference between the old economy and the new. In christianity you have everything witnessed to practically before it was established as a principle.
Rem. Reverting again to @John 20, do you not think that the Lord would greatly encourage us so that we might come together with expectancy?
J.T. I think our great desire on the first day of the week should be to be free in our affections. *That*, I feel, is a point of immense importance. There is an opportunity of coming together, and it is not service that we have before us, or any ministry. We have come with the thought of being simply for Christ.
Rem. That is very sweet indeed.
J.T. It does not say in John that the disciples were together for any special purpose. In the Acts, it does; here it is not mentioned, but undoubtedly they had the Lord before them.
Rem. Of course, in one sense we do come together on the Lord's day for a special purpose.
J.T. Yes, but it is only to prepare you for the Lord. You have Christ before you. You are going to be for Christ. In coming together for prayer we have the testimony to engage us. When we are together over the Word as now, it is for mutual help. But "in assembly" it is that we may have Christ before us, and Him only.
Ques. With regard to precedent, can we do things by precedent now?
{418}
J.T. We have to go by what the Lord did, and by what the apostles did. I would not take account of any other precedent.
Ques. What do you mean by coming together in assembly?
J.T. I mean when we come together to be for Christ.
Rem. I think what you say expresses it; that we should seek to be free in our affections when we come together.
Ques. Would you say that the Supper is to set us free?
J.T. Yes, it has that effect.
Ques. Would not the Supper be introductory to the assembly?
J.T. Yes, but the assembly is the *spiritual* side, whereas the Supper is the external side. It comes under the eyes of men, and is a testimony. The apostle says, "as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come", @1 Corinthians 11:26. But the assembly is spiritual, and does not come under the eye of man.
Rem. If you enjoy the presence of the Lord, the world does not see that; it is what is outward they see.
J.T. Hence the order in God's assembly is a matter of great importance, as we see from the epistle to the Corinthians.
Ques. Does feet washing come in at the Supper?
J.T. Well, I think it may, in the sense that it relieves your mind and heart of what would hamper your spirit. The Lord would set us free, so that we may have part with Him.
Rem. I suppose in the Supper there is something both for our eyes and for our hearts?
J.T. Yes. In @Luke 24 we read, "he was made known to them in the *breaking* of bread", @Luke 24:35. It does not say that it was in the *eating;* because He did
{419}
not eat. The *breaking* is evidently for our hearts, but our eating is the expression of our fellowship; we are committed to His death, and we announce it.
Ques. Would you not say that it was a very fit moment to be looking for Him?
J.T. Well, it is a great thing to get the idea in one's soul that it is when the assembly is free that the Lord comes; *then* it is for Christ. "It is not good that the man should be alone" (@Genesis 2:18); that is one thought. Another thought is that having lost Israel, the assembly is for His comfort. If we had been in the place of the disciples we should have understood the Supper. They understood it because they were acquainted with the Lord; they knew how *He* did things.
Ques. Would you connect this with what we have in chapter 14?
J.T. Well, things in chapter 14 were, in a sense, made to depend on the coming of the Spirit. What is more prominent here is the Person of the Lord; His own personal dignity, and the dignity of the assembly as associated with Him.
Ques. What do you mean by being free?
J.T. I mean to have sufficient spiritual power to lay aside distractions. You do not come to *do* anything. You come to break bread, but you have no thought before you of taking any part.
Rem. That is very important, because I think people often come with the idea of helping others.
Rem. I remember a brother once saying in coming to the room, that he was coming that morning, and he had no responsibility.
J.T. You have no care before you; the thought is that you are to be free for Christ.
Rem. If we came in that way, the Lord would not disappoint us.
J.T. No, He would not. I think the highest thought in the assembly is that you are silent. One
{420}
of the most sorrowful things in the meetings is that if there is a pause, some brother there, who cannot stand it, thinks he is bound to do something.
Ques. How does the "minister of the sanctuary" (@Hebrews 8:2) come in in connection with this thought?
J.T. The "minister of the sanctuary" is, I think, a more general thought. Of course, it is included, but the epistle to the Hebrews contemplates the whole divine heavenly system. It is not a question there of the assembly convened, though the apostle says, "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together" (@Hebrews 10:25); but what he is dealing with is the new system, in contrast to the old, and he shows that the One who now ministers is in heaven.
E.J.McB. And have not the things in the sanctuary more the idea in them of what is official than of affection?
J.T. Yes, Hebrews is official, and is, I think, as I said, to show that the new system is heavenly. Christ does not come out. So it says, "who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man", @Hebrews 8:1,2.
Ques. Is it a levitical thought?
J.T. No, it is priestly. The thought is the *kind* of minister -- "We have *such* an high priest", @Hebrews 8:1. I think you will find that in Scriptures which are specially intended for Jewish christians the heavenly side is always insisted upon, because they were in danger of being hold in the earthly system.
Rem. You find in Corinthians that God walks amongst His people, and He dwells there. Is that the idea of the sanctuary?
J.T. The thought in the sanctuary is holiness. It is the divine enclosure; but in the epistle to the Hebrews it is the heavenly system, and Christ the minister of it in heaven.
{421}
E.J.McB. When you come to look into that epistle, is not that thought connected much more with God, than it is with the Father and the family circle?
J.T. Yes, and that it is heavenly. The apostle says, "Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands ... but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us" (@Hebrews 9:24); and he *insists* that "such an high priest became us, who is ... made higher than the heavens", @Hebrews 7:26.
Ques. Would you emphasise *us* there?
J.T. Yes, it shows what a wonderful company it is. The company required "*such*" a Priest as that; and the Lord never ceases to be the heavenly Man.
Rem. And then we read, "as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly", @1 Corinthians 15:48.
J.T. I never, for a moment, would allow myself to take lower ground than that I am heavenly.
Rem. So that the testimony, as taking character from that, is heavenly.
{422}
ASSEMBLY ORDER
@1 Corinthians 14
Ques. Will you tell us the difference between the aspect of the assembly as presented here, and the way in which it is presented in John?
J.T. I think John presents it from the spiritual point of view; that is, what the assembly is as formed by the Spirit, and its inner privileges; whereas Corinthians presents it in its external character as that in which the divine order is seen here in this world; so that the apostle makes a point of what the outer world might see in the assembly. Therefore he says; "Let all things be done decently and in order".
Rem. It is manifestly on a lower plane than @John 20.
J.T. Yes, I think so. Corinthians is the assembly of God viewed in its local character as that in which divine order is displayed. In that way I think Corinthians corresponds with the book of Numbers.
Ques. Will you explain that a little?
J.T. Well, the book of Numbers sets forth the testimony in the wilderness. The wilderness may be divided into three sections. The first section is what the people under God had known as pure grace, as having been delivered by Him out of Egypt. Then followed the legal period; that is, the people under law; and lastly, the people are viewed typically as having the Spirit. This latter is prefigured in the book of Numbers from chapter 21 onward.
Ques. Would that answer to @Romans 5 to 8?
J.T. No. Romans does not give us the collective side, whereas Numbers does. The book of Numbers is in relation to the tabernacle, and the priesthood, and the Levites.
{423}
Ques. Does this chapter give us the assembly in function?
J.T. It contemplates the assembly as convened, and shows the order and operations that are there.
Ques. Will you give an outline of what leads up to this, from chapter 11?
J.T. Well, I think that, the details will all come in in their right place if we see that it is the assembly viewed as established here under the eye of the world, and not the assembly viewed in its heavenly relationship as in @John 20. So the apostle speaks of the Jews, and the gentile, and the assembly of God. It was a very great thought with God that He should have *His* assembly.
Ques. Do you mean that here it is what the world can take account of?
J.T. Yes; it could be taken account of as an institution set up here, apart from the world morally, but in the presence of the world.
Rem. In contrast to that which is purely the work of the Spirit of God, as under God's eye.
J.T. Yes, just so; that is more John's line; he presents the inside view, whereas in Corinthians it is the outer aspect; what is under the eye of the world.
Rem. The inner must be right first, before there can be anything outward.
J.T. You see, it is one thing to be here, in this world, under the grace of God; that is the wilderness position up to @Exodus 19. It was all a question of pure grace, and a very wonderful period. But then, if God is going to have an organisation in the presence of the world, there must be a rule; and the collective testimony stands related to the law. I am not referring to the law now merely as that which brings the knowledge of sin. The law is really a type; it was the declaration of God's rights, and the tabernacle was set up in connection with
{424}
the law, and the book of Numbers depends on the tabernacle; so that the collective testimony in the types stands related to the law. Now, I think that what answers to that in the New Testament is the first epistle to the Corinthians.
Rem. There we get God's order for His house, and God's order has to be observed.
J.T. Yes; so that this epistle is what you may call "the law of the house". The order that is spoken of here is not for heaven, and it necessarily terminates; but what we have in the gospel of John is eternal.
Ques. Does not verse 37 confirm what you say -- "If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord"?
J.T. Yes. We cannot suppose that God would have a system of things here without rule.
E.J.McB. Government is a great principle with God.
J.T. Yes; so that one prominent feature in Solomon's temple was the cherubim, not only in the holiest of all, but also upon the walls and upon the doors. The cherubim, I think, represent God's government; the *holiness* of God is seen in the seraphim.
E.J.McB. Will you say a word on the object of the assembly in this character?
J.T. Well, it is a provisional order of things filling up the interval between the ascension of Christ from the earth, and His appearing in glory. It is established in the way of testimony; that is, God's order is to be displayed under the eyes of men before it is displayed literally in the heavenly city. So that here, it may be noticed, the apostle is concerned about the impression made on those who are without. For instance, if anybody came
{425}
into the assembly and went out again, he would report what he saw inside -- he would have to confess "that God is indeed amongst you"; and he would gather that by observing the order that was found there.
E.J.McB. Because that there was inside that which was for the believer and also for the unbeliever.
J.T. Yes, the unbeliever is supposed to be able to take account of what is of God there; so that he is convicted; he is impressed that God is there. I think that is a great point.
Rem. A brother here told us, some time ago, about a person being exercised about the truth, who heard through another of a little meeting near the place where he lived, and he said, 'I cannot say much about it, but what struck me was that God was there'.
J.T. So that the great thought to lay hold of in that regard, is that it is *God's* assembly. That is, it is not man's; it is the sphere in which God is dominant. Hence the importance of the instructions that the apostle gives; and he intimates that the injunctions which were to govern the Corinthian assembly were to govern all the other assemblies; so that you have what one might call a catholic system; that is, the government is the same universally.
E.J.McB. So that *order* is of great importance, because God is a God of order.
J.T. "God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints" (verse 33).
Ques. What part of Corinthians answers to the second part of the book of Numbers?
J.T. The second part of Numbers is not a type of the epistle to the Corinthians, but I think that up to chapter 20 it is. What we see there is the tabernacle and the people set in relation to it; every male in the camp was taken account of "from
{426}
twenty years old and upward", @Numbers 1:3. I take that to represent believers as having the Spirit. Each was to pitch by the standard of his father's house.
Rem. I suppose that each was taken account of according to divine wisdom?
J.T. Well, I think the age of manhood has reference to one who has the Spirit. The age of thirty would allude probably to the *effect* of the Spirit. In the book of Numbers what is striking is the order in which everything is arranged.
Rem. And all in accordance with God who dwelt there in the tabernacle.
J.T. It was a very great sight to behold a company of that magnitude all controlled in relation to the tabernacle.
Ques. In that way would you view what we have here as the instructions following on chapter 11?
J.T. Well, I am speaking of the epistle as a whole. What I would like to make clear, if I can, is the setting of the epistle. The assembly is not viewed here in its heavenly privileges, but as the sphere of God's government and order in the presence of the world during the absence of Christ; Israel, where these testimonies were, being forsaken.
Rem. The assembly is here in testimony for God?
J.T. Yes, it is *God's* assembly in contrast to what man might have. Man had much in the city of Corinth, but God had introduced something for Himself into Corinth, and that was *His* assembly.
E.J.McB. I think what would confirm that in one's mind is that no unbeliever could enter into what the other side, @John 20, involves.
J.T. The doors are shut against him.
E.J.McB. Yes, I think it is perfectly clear that what is spiritual is entirely shut up to the believer.
Ques. Would you connect what you were saying as to the sphere in which believers are viewed here,
{427}
with the announcement of His death? "Ye do shew the Lord's death till he come", @1 Corinthians 11:26.
J.T. Yes. I think the announcement is a testimony here where Christ died. It does not say so, but in the context it is clear.
Rem. It is a testimony in this world.
J.T. Yes. Christ was put to death by men, and the fellowship is the fellowship of His death. That places the world at issue with God, and at issue with Christ; and we take sides against it. The world has expressed *its* estimate of Christ, and we express *ours*. The death of Christ is the expression of the world's hatred, but we take account of it in another way; it is the centre of our fellowship.
Rem. That would be in chapter 10, would it not?
J.T. Yes, but it is also alluded to in chapter 11. It says, "ye announce". I think the point in chapter 10 is to show that the individual member of the assembly is not independent; it is a fellowship.
E.J.McB. We might say to one that others are involved by what he does.
J.T. Yes, in that respect chapter 10 shows that no individual member of the assembly can do what he pleases in the world; and chapter 14 shows that he cannot do what he pleases in the *assembly*. So that in either case it is to set aside independency. Even if you have gift, your gift does not warrant you to be independent, for it is not given for *you*, but for the *assembly*.
Ques. Would chapter 10 be the individual side, and chapter 11 the collective side?
J.T. The point in the former is that you are to behave yourself outside when your brethren are not looking at you. The question is, Are you an honest man? You have committed yourself to a fellowship, and you are where, perhaps, your brethren cannot see you. In the assembly they *can* see what you are
{428}
doing, and what you are saying; so that the test is put to us as to whether we are going to be true men.
Rem. If we are not true outside we cannot be true inside.
Ques. Does not this fellowship exclude the world?
J.T. Yes, surely. I suppose an individual who links himself with the world really links the company with the world. That brings in another question, and that is, if you are not true you have to do with more than the saints, you have to do with Christ. So the apostle says -- "Do we provoke *the Lord* to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" @1 Corinthians 10:22. You may provoke brethren for a while, but if you provoke Christ, He will overcome you; you will come to grief. I believe that the *christian* world is at issue with Christ in that way. They have taken His Name, and they are not true to it, and hence He is jealous, and "jealousy is cruel as the grave", @Song of Songs 8:6. So that the Lord has power, and it will go ill with christendom in time. The Lord has long patience; He waits long; but whether it be against the individual or the system, the Lord is bound to overcome. In meetings where there is looseness of walk and independence, the brethren may have to bear with it long, and perhaps have not the power to deal with it, but in the end it is as sure as can be, that the person involved finds himself in a position which everybody discerns to be the judgment of the Lord.
E.J.McB. I suppose that is seen in the expression, "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep", @1 Corinthians 11:30.
J.T. That is in regard to conduct in the assembly, but the principle is true. It is most serious to link up Christ with the world; it is connecting Him with what is idolatrous.
{429}
E.J.McB. What you have been saying is very solemn, that you move about in a sphere where your brethren cannot see you, but where the Lord takes account of you.
Rem. The world we know is the religious world.
J.T. Well, the religious world is the Babylonish world. "Pure religion" (@James 1:27) is all right, but if it is divorced from Christ it is Babylonish.
E.J.McB. Is there any other world now?
J.T. I think it was the Babylonish world that the people of Israel suffered from after they left Egypt. "I will transport you beyond Babylon" (@Acts 7:43); came in after the golden calf, and we know that Balaam came from that direction, and the goodly Babylonish garment was in Jericho. These are elements of the Babylonish world. The people thought of going back to Egypt; but they did not go back to Egypt, they went to Babylon. I do not think that christendom intends to go back to the world in that sense; it is too proud for that. It would not go back into naked paganism, because the light of christianity has added immensely to the world, and it takes the assumption of being superior to anything that ever existed before.
Rem. To maintain the order you have been speaking of, you must have the "love" which is set forth in chapter 13. Gift in itself will not maintain it. Is not that why chapter 13 is put between chapters 12 and 14?
J.T. The machinery could not run properly without chapter 13; it is like oil.
Rem. Chapter 14 begins by saying, "Follow after love".
J.T. If we follow the teaching of the chapters, I think the eleventh sets Christ before the affections, and the twelfth is the activity of the Spirit in ministry showing how He operates in the gifts; and then the thirteenth is that which *all* may have. It will
{430}
not do to say that such and such an one has not much gift, or that he has gift; the question is, what have *you*? There is no reason why each one should not have something. It is a poor thing to depend upon those who have gift; the question with each should be, what have *I*?
Ques. Do you think gifts are to be acquired? It says, "Covet earnestly the best gifts", @1 Corinthians 12:31.
J.T. I think desire divinely produced, qualifies us for the gift, and God bestows the gift accordingly.
Ques. What would be the "best gifts" the apostle refers to?
J.T. That is the gift of prophecy, as the apostle shows. The point is, what can I make most use of for the edifying of the assembly; so that if you have not what is treated of in chapter 13; that is, love, gift is only a detriment.
Ques. And the whole point in chapter 14, I suppose, is edification?
J.T. Yes, that is the point; so that the apostle says he would rather speak five words to edification than a thousand in an unknown tongue. The assembly is an organism, and each member of it is essential to it; so the question for each is, What can *I* do?
Ques. I was thinking of the verse in @Ephesians 4, which says, "unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ", @Ephesians 4:7.
J.T. That shows that each has something, and what he has is according to the wisdom and giving of Christ.
Ques. How do you understand "according to the measure of the gift of Christ"?
J.T. It is according to Christ's measure; you have nothing to complain of. Then there are specific gifts which He gives to certain ones who are qualified, and that also for the edifying of the assembly.
Rem. You would say that He gives what each
{431}
vessel can hold; it is according to *His* giving. He would not give anyone that which he would not be able to hold.
J.T. No, He gives according to the capacity. Now, the question in chapter 14 is, as to the part you take in the assembly.
Ques. Is it the assembly in function?
J.T. Yes, and the point is that you are to act intelligently.
Rem. Such as on the first day of the week?
J.T. Yes, or at any other time, as when we are together for ministry. The wonderful thing is that God has brought into this world a company of persons spiritually intelligent, so that when they come together everything is done in order and intelligence. There is an intelligent faculty in the assembly which is self-governing, so that although there is no president, there is no irregularity and no disorder. The world knows nothing of that.
Rem. The assembly has the mind of Christ.
J.T. Yes, the thinking faculty of Christ.
Rem. That was fully seen at the outset.
J.T. Well, we ought to walk in the light of it now. If a brother takes the whole meeting, that is not intelligent, because we should recognise that the assembly of God is composed of individuals, and the clerical idea is foreign to it. There may be others there who have something to say; something which the Lord would like to hear, and which the saints would like to hear.
Rem. Then there is also the thought of the spirits of the prophets being subject to the prophets.
J.T. Yes, a person might say; 'I could not help getting up, I was pressed'. But the point arises, Is it the *time* for it? If what you have is from the Lord, it will not go from you.
{432}
Rem. It will be improved, most likely, next time.
J.T. Yes, I do not think that divine things are harmed for being kept.
Rem. I suppose the coming together contemplated in this chapter would be more for the object of profiting from the gifts; it would be distinguished in that way from the meeting on the Lord's day, I suppose.
J.T. I think it is. It supposes the whole assembly "come together into one place", and one has a tongue, another an interpretation, and so on. I take it they have these things before they come, whereas the assembly proper, as coming together, is simply for Christ.
Rem. It is a question of what *He* will do.
J.T. Yes, you are waiting on the Lord. But here it is supposed that you *have* something; and the question is, What are you going to do with what you have? How are you going to use it? So the great point that is emphasised is that we should act intelligently.
Rem. The apostle is not deprecating what they had, but regulating it.
J.T. Quite so. I have carried things for months, and I think we should all until there is an opportunity to give it out. If it is an opportune time, give it out; but the point is, you are not to give it out simply because you have it.
E.J.McB. I take your thought to be that whilst we should be always in a state to help one another, what we have should be used intelligently, so that it should be spoken at a time when it is to the best advantage.
J.T. Yes; we all go out and gather something "in hunting", @Proverbs 12:27. Encountering the world is no detriment to us if we are with God; it is really exercise that helps us spiritually. In the exercise you have gathered up something in regard to Christ, and in
{433}
time you will have the opportunity of giving out what you have gathered, and then it will help the whole company; so that your very exercise contributes to the welfare of the whole assembly.
Rem. You said that what you get will not suffer by being kept; but will you not suffer if you have it and do not use it?
J.T. Well, the Lord is very gracious; if you miss one opportunity He will give you another. The Lord is very patient; and your keeping it will tend to give you all the more exercise.
Rem. What is the thought of a "psalm" in verse 26?
J.T. A psalm is the outcome of experience.
Rem. It is not giving out a hymn.
E.J.McB. I suppose a psalm is something you have learned of God in your ways here?
J.T. Yes, the Psalms are expressions of experience. The book of Psalms is a wonderful book in that way; they rise sometimes to the height of Christ's experience.
Ques. Do you think this refers to the book of Psalms?
J.T. No, I do not think so, unless you found in the Psalms what expresses your experience, and that is doubtful. I think a psalm is the mode of expressing your experience, so that in that way it is *your* psalm.
E.J.McB. "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs", @Ephesians 5:19.
Ques. You do not get prayer and worship here. Why is that?
J.T. I think because here it is what is external. It is what comes before the eyes of the world that is set forth in this chapter. The apostle is not deprecating the Spirit; you cannot set Him aside, but "the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets". In other words, a man is greater than
{434}
his spirit. If a man does not see it to be quite the right time to do something, he does not do it.
Rem. Then you would say it involves spiritual intelligence.
J.T. Yes. Then in verse 34 he gives a word to the sisters. If you are exercised, and it is well that you are, it is commendable; but the assembly is not the place to bring into evidence your relationship with your husband. The relation between husband and wife belongs to the home; hence if you want to ask anything, it is to be done at home.
Rem. Will you say a word as to the expression "in the assemblies" in verse 34?
J.T. I suppose it is the assembly as known in this world. It is not according to God's order that a woman should be speaking there.
Rem. This chapter contemplates the saints "in assembly", and the order and rule that should be seen there, does it not?
J.T. Yes, I think it does; the chapter supposes what goes on in the assembly when it is convened. It is the place for the exercise of gift.
Ques. Are the gifts here permanent?
J.T. They are permanent in the sense that they continue while the assembly is here.
Ques. Should not the gifts act when we are together?
J.T. Yes, I think so; if you recognise the Spirit, He is sure to act. But then we have to be sure that it *is* the Spirit, and the test for that is that the ministry recognises Christ in every way. A gift is a most valuable asset to the assembly, and any company where there is gift has an asset which it ought to appreciate.
{435}
Rem. What we should seek is what is spiritual, because as you were saying the other day, "God is a spirit", @John 4:24.
J.T. Yes.
Rem. The gifts were given so that all might profit.
J.T. The early part of the chapter shows the working, so to speak, of the organism; and that the gifts are subordinate to the whole; but then they have their own distinctive place, and God has set them in the assembly; but in their operation they must not be independent; they are set in relation to the whole company.
Rem. There could be no such thing as clericalism if that was observed.
J.T. No; I think this chapter would be a remedy for clericalism. The point is that it is the *same* Spirit; so that there should not be any schism or division.
Rem. Would you say that the Lord's day morning is not the time for the exercise of gift?
J.T. Yes. I think the Lord's day meeting ought to be simply *for Christ*. The assembly is for Christ; the exercise of gift is more for *us*, though I would not deny that what we have in this chapter is a continuation of the first day of the week.
Rem. You mean, we might have a meeting like this in the middle of the week; but the assembly goes on.
J.T. Yes, I think that the week is a symbol of the whole period of christianity, and we begin afresh every Lord's day; so that all that follows in the week ought to have its beginning on the Lord's day. One would not like to say much about these things, but the more spiritual we are, I think, the more we should seek to get something fresh every week that would give character to the whole week.
{436}
THE CHURCH AS FOR CHRIST -- A SPIRITUAL FORMATION
@John 2:3 - 5; @Ephesians 5:29 - 33; @Acts 20:7; @Revelation 1:10; @1 Corinthians 16:1 - 2
What I would like to engage you with is the place which the church (the assembly) has in the Lord's heart. The place she holds in His affections is the key to all the wonderful love and ministry which He has lavished upon her; and the first thought evidently with the Lord would be to gain her affections. Solomon is a type of the Lord in the manner in which He secures the affections of the assembly. You will all remember the "song of songs, which is Solomon's", @Song of Songs 1:1. It is described as the "Song *of* Songs"; I take that to indicate that it was his masterpiece. His songs, we are told, were a thousand and five, and among them all this is *the* "*Song of Songs*", and the great point in it is that he celebrates his triumph over the affections of his people. I do not go into the detail of the song now, I only want to indicate what is in my mind in connection with it. Solomon is a remarkable type of the Lord in many respects, but in this respect especially that he was a man of great affection. He was brought up in affection. He was his father's son, tender and beloved, and the only one of his mother, @Proverbs 4:3. That was what Solomon was; hence, as nurtured in affection, he was a man of great affection; and in that way he is a type of the Lord in His affection for His people; so that in securing our affections, the Lord celebrates His triumph.
Now, I wish, by the Lord's help, to indicate to you the course pursued by Him in this triumph. First of all, He disowns the *natural*. The Lord as here upon earth had natural relations; He had a
{437}
mother, and brothers, and sisters. The other gospels give much more prominence to those relations than does John, because John's great aim is to establish the spiritual; he wishes to show that the things of God are necessarily of a spiritual nature; hence he records the Lord's discourse with the woman at the well of Sychar; and amongst other things he records how the Lord impressed upon her that "*God is a spirit*" (@John 4:24); and if God formulates a system of things after His own nature, they must be spiritual. The first was natural; but the second is spiritual; and the spiritual is that which is to remain; the natural disappears.
Now, in a way, nothing could be more important than to bow to that fact, because while most of us may be said to be clear of the world which is dominated by the wicked one, it is questionable whether we are clear of being under the power of natural relationships. Now, natural relationships are of God; they are God's institutions; but, beloved friends, if God has instituted the spiritual, which He has, the natural must take the second place. It is all well when the spiritual influences the natural; but it is the contrary, when the natural influences the spiritual. When the mother of the Lord attempted to influence Him in @John 2:3, He refuses it. She says, "They have no wine". She undertook to make Him acquainted with something of which she thought He was ignorant. Now, why did she speak thus to Christ? Upon what ground did she do that? It was on the ground of natural relationship.
It is all well and right to recognise these relationships, but when they assert themselves, so as to influence us in regard to the spiritual, then they must be refused. The Lord says "Woman". He did not say "Mother". He says "Woman". In regard to the spiritual she was of no more account
{438}
to Christ than any other; she was a woman. His saying, "what have I to do with thee?" was virtually saying, 'I am here in regard to the spiritual; I am here for the introduction and the maintenance of the spiritual; and you have nothing to do with that'. "Woman", He says, "what have I to do with thee?" You may say that seemed heartless, but it only brings to light the position the Lord occupies in John's gospel. He was there on account of the spiritual, and the natural must have no place whatsoever. Our natural relatives are, in the assembly, nothing more than others; and, as I shall endeavour to show, it is all right when the spiritual influences the natural; that is the divine way; but the spiritual *must* take precedence now, beloved friends, because the spiritual was the primary thought with God. The natural was an afterthought; the natural was only an index to the spiritual; and so, when the real thing comes in, the type must disappear.
Now, the Lord was there on account of the spiritual. His mother says to Him, "They have no wine"; but did *He* not know the poverty of humanity? Did He not know that the highest and best thing in nature is only transient? Did He not know that man is altogether devoid of good wine? He knew it better than she knew it; and *He* indicates to her that it was *His* province to introduce the new wine, and not hers; so He disowns His family relations after the flesh; they have no place in regard to the spiritual. But had not the Lord family affections? It is in man to have family affections, and the Lord, who was truly Man, had them; but He was there to introduce what was spiritual, and the natural could be allowed no place in that connection.
In the gospel of Matthew those whom the Lord acknowledges as His relatives are those who were
{439}
His disciples; those who did the will of His Father, @Matthew 12:50. Of whom were they the disciples? They were the disciples of Him who brought in the spiritual; they were disciples of the heavenly Man; and He says, "Behold my mother and my brethren", @Matthew 12:49. In the gospel of Luke the Lord owns as His mother and brethren "those who hear the word of God and do it", @Luke 8:21. What kind of people were they? They were spiritual. What kind of words did the Lord minister? He says, "the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life", @John 6:63. Now, who is it that hears the word, and keeps it? It is a spiritual person. Mary of Bethany represents the spiritual in the gospel of Luke. What marked her? She was sitting at the Lord's feet, and listening to His word. She was of the spiritual order.
Now, when we come to John's gospel, those who are recorded as His "brethren" are those who are viewed in the light of resurrection and ascension. They believed in His resurrection. The resurrection is a spiritual idea. We are told that He was "put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit", @1 Peter 3:18. The disciples believed in the resurrection; Mary Magdalene believed, as we see in @John 20. She believed in regard of Christ in resurrection; and she brought the message from Christ to the other disciples. They are all viewed as believers in the resurrection; and as such they are of a spiritual order, and the Lord recognised them as His "brethren"; the relationship is holy and spiritual. Now, that is where the assembly comes to light; and the Lord gives it its name. If you get a company of people who are marked by discipleship to Christ; a company who have heard the word of God, and have kept it; a company of people who have believed in Christ as risen; the Lord gives them a name. You will remember in @Genesis 2, that Adam gave
{440}
names to all the animals, and whatever name he gave each creature, that was its name. Nothing was recalled. He is a type of the Lord who gives names to all His.
Well, now, when Eve was presented to Adam, we have brought to light in type how the Lord recognises the assembly. Adam says "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman" (@Genesis 2:23); that is, Adam *recognised* her. He had been giving names to the lower creatures, and Jehovah brings the woman to him; she was taken out of him; and his intelligence shines when he says to Jehovah, "This time" -- referring to the other creatures to whom he had given names -- "it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh, this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man". This is something distinctive. That is, in type, Christ giving a name to the assembly, and in regard to the assembly nothing can exceed it, viewed as a matter of privilege. She is definitely named by the Lord. And what does her name signify? No previous history of shame; her origin is in Himself; and if, beloved friends, her origin is in Christ, her origin is of a spiritual and heavenly character.
Well, Adam has given her a name, and now he can speak to her. We all know how the use of a name may become the expression of affection; so that now Adam can, in his affection, speak to Eve by name. I need not remind you that the name "Eve" was subsequent; it was not her primary name. The name "Eve" signifies the mother of all living; but the name she received from Adam, before sin came in, was "Woman", because she was taken out of man. That is to say, she has a name of dignity; she has a name that qualifies her to be his companion, for it declares her origin to be himself. Now, he can call her by name.
{441}
It is a wonderful thing to be called by name by the Lord. John refers to it when he says, "he calleth his own sheep by name" chapter 10 verse 3; and in chapters 11 and 12 we have it illustrated in the family at Bethany. The Lord knew each member of that family by name; He loved each, and He loved all. And now that the Lord has the church, He has given her a name that describes her origin, so that she can be, as it were, on terms of equality with Him. When I use the word equality, I am not forgetting His own personal distinctiveness as the Son of God; I am speaking of Him as the Man of God's counsels, to whom the assembly is given, for it is to Him, in that light, that we are united. So, having received that name from His lips, we are suited for union with Him. You need not have any hesitancy *now*. In resurrection you are made perfectly free. The Lord makes known to you what your name is; and it is wonderful to apprehend the name the Lord has given to us. The name that He gives us describes our origin as of Himself; so that He would relieve us of every fear, and of every bit of reserve, that we may be free before Him. Hence, as He disclaims the natural, He embraces the spiritual.
Now, what a wonderful thing it is to be embraced by the Lord? This occasions a clean cut with all outside of Christ, and He gives us the sense that as His assembly we are come within the enclosure of His embrace. He embraces the spiritual. So the apostle, alluding to it, says, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife", @Ephesians 5:31. What cause? Because she is bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh. Now, that is exactly what Christ did. He disclaimed the natural, and He embraced the spiritual. That is to say, He embraces the church viewed in its spiritual light as derived from Himself.
{442}
So the apostle says, "This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church". It was wonderful to Paul to be able to speak thus, because He loved Christ, and he entered into the Lord's affections. It was said of Adam; "It is not good that the man should be alone", @Genesis 2:18. The apostle understood that. It applied to the Lord, and Paul's great aim was to bring the church in for Christ; to present her "as a chaste virgin to Christ" (@2 Corinthians 11:2); hence he says, "I speak concerning Christ and the church".
I have spoken of that to show what is in the Lord's mind; and now I wish to connect what I have said with the first day of the week. The first day of the week is a spiritual idea; it was not intended for the world; it represents the beginning of things spiritually; it represents the day upon which Christ had His pleasure in the assembly; there can be no doubt about that. The allusions to the first day of the week in the New Testament show unmistakably that the Lord honoured that day by being in company with His "brethren". The first point that I would allude to, and it has been much before us, is the Lord's supper. The early disciples, without any injunction, so far as we know, chose that day to celebrate the Supper; they had Christ before them. One is not going too far in saying that they all loved Christ; and they came together on the first day of the week to celebrate the Supper.
Now, the Supper involves in a sense what is material; but it involves the breaking of the link with the natural. The Lord said, before He instituted it, "I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God", @Mark 14:25. The link is completely broken with the natural; and now He introduces the Supper. The Supper signifies His death on the one hand, which has terminated all that appertained to the
{443}
natural, and it also symbolises His own familiar act, by which He is brought to our attention; and directly you have Him before you, you are led into the spiritual. Now, what I am saying I believe is fully borne out by the Scriptures, and by the experience of the spiritual; that if He is brought to the attention of your heart and mine, you are led at once into the spiritual. Hence, the next notice that we have of "the Lord's day" is that John is in the Spirit on that day; @Revelation 1:10. He says, "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day". I think that he recognises that all relationship with Christ was spiritual; and that if he were to enjoy the things of Christ, it must be in a spiritual way; hence, he says, "I was in the Spirit".
Now, when we are in the Spirit we are for Christ; we have reached the assembly, according to what it really is; a spiritual formation. It is formed of persons, I need not say; and each person in it has a name; and each person in it is known and loved by Christ; but it is also viewed as a unit, as *one;* and as such it has a name, which, as I said, indicates its origin. And as you are in the Spirit, as John was, you answer to what the assembly is to the heart of Christ. That is what I apprehend to be the proper state for the assembly, viewed as related to Christ in heavenly glory. Apart from being in the Spirit we do not touch it, but as we are in the Spirit we recognise what the Lord seeks, and we respond to it; we are His, and for His pleasure.
Now, we may see from @1 Corinthians 16, that there is another thought connected with the first day of the week; that is, the thought of *giving*. It is a very remarkable thing that the apostle directed the Corinthians to lay by at home on that day. There you come out of the natural; but you come out in spiritual power, to influence the natural. See what a man is who comes out in that way to
{444}
give. He comes out in the spirit of Christ to be what Christ was down here. It is said of Him, "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever", @Psalm 112:9. Now, that is the effect of the spiritual; that is, the divine order; but when the natural is allowed to influence the spiritual you have things reversed. It is only in the power of the spiritual that you can come out here in the relationships that God owns. When you do, you influence them, and you have God with you in them.
Well, that is just what I had on my mind to bring before you. What has especially exercised me is that the Lord may have something for His own heart. We all know how He became poor that we might become rich. The Lord clothed Himself in the humble guise of man, and "took upon him the form of a servant" (@Philippians 2:7) and then went into death; and He did it that we might be enriched. But remember that the Lord has affections that He seeks to gratify, and the assembly is for the gratification of His affections. It has a wonderful place in that way. We have alluded to the position which Rebecca occupied in @Genesis 24. We are told she was brought into Sarah's tent. Now, that is no small thought. Sarah's tent is not a permanent abode for Rebecca, but a provisional one; Sarah's tent represents the sphere occupied by Israel in the testimony.
Sarah was a very remarkable woman; she had no equal in her day. She had had in her lifetime a divine visitation; and she entertained the Lord in dignity. Mark her movements in @Genesis 18. When the three men came, how suitably she acted! She was a woman of faith; hence it was no small thing that Rebecca was to occupy her place; and I need not say that the tent was more than graced by Rebecca. The position occupied by Israel has
{445}
been more than filled by the assembly. But, nevertheless, it was a very great position. It is a wonderful thing that a company should be taken out of the gentiles, and connected with the Jewish disciples to occupy the great position that Israel had occupied for centuries in the testimony of God. But the early church occupied it in every way in accordance with God's mind.
But, then, Rebecca was more than that. She was to be a comfort to Isaac, and we are told that he loved her. Therefore, Isaac had that which his heart sought; and so the Lord, ere He resumes His connections with Israel, has His heart gratified in the assembly. There is a thought in the book of Genesis that helps us as to the peculiar place of the church; that is, Isaac had only one wife, whereas Jacob had two. Jacob refers to the ways of God upon earth, which will be discontinued. Isaac refers to the heavenly Man to whom the church is brought. This was the primary thought with God, and hence that which abides into eternity. Our unique privilege is, that we are to be the companions of Christ in that wonderful relation, eternally.
May the Lord give us to appreciate it.
{446}
THE FAMILY OF GOD
@John 13:31 - 35; @John 14:1 - 3
My thought is to seek to suggest something in regard to the family of God. If there is one thing that one's heart cherishes, and what one says of oneself must be said of all those who love God, it is the thought that one belongs to the divine family; and what I desire, by the Lord's help, is to show that the family of God of necessity must be patterned after Christ; firstly patterned after Christ as the *Son of man*, which has reference to our position down here; and, secondly, patterned after Christ as the *Son of God*, which has reference to our position up there, in heaven.
Now, in venturing to bring forward this great and precious subject one is dealing with what may be called the primary thought with God. It is important to distinguish between the primary thoughts of God, which of necessity are eternal, and those of a provisional character which have arisen to meet the conditions which arose through the introduction of sin or lawlessness into the world. I repeat, that it is of great moment that we should become accustomed to distinguish between these two thoughts. God's primary thoughts are those which He intends to be eternal. But the introduction of lawlessness into God's creation necessitated a provisional course of dealings on the part of God, by which He met and solved the problem that arose in His creation through the introduction of sin. In this He had, as it were, to turn aside for a moment and from His point of view it is but a moment, to meet and solve this great problem. When this great problem is solved, we shall find that God reverts to His primary thoughts. He never relinquished them for a moment. Indeed, I think that
{447}
an examination of the course of His ways will show that interwoven with His governmental dealings there was the family idea, which was a primary thought. The golden thread of the family idea, in connection with which affections are centred, runs through the entire course of God's dealings.
In the light of the gospel of Luke, one cannot fail to see that in Adam the thought was there. He was in a peculiar and unique relationship with God; he was God's offspring. There was the parental idea, which relates to the family; and from that point onwards you will find either the thought of father and son, or of brethren in the whole course of God's dealings; and that, I believe, is the link between God's primary thoughts and the course of His governmental dealings.
Now, going back for a moment beyond the first of Genesis, we find Wisdom in @Proverbs 8, giving us an account of the motives and desires that were active at the outset. Wisdom was there, as we read, "before his works of old". Wisdom was with God (@Proverbs 8:22); and directly the earth takes form and the habitable parts come into evidence, Wisdom is intensely interested. I need not say that there was interest throughout, but that chapter tells us of the special interest which Wisdom took in the sphere in which man was to be. Wisdom delighted before Jehovah, and delighted "in the habitable part" of His earth. Wisdom is engaged with a sphere in which man is to subsist. Then we read, "my delights were with the sons of men", @Proverbs 8:31. Now, there we get a family thought. Thus, we see that at that early date the divine thought was that God should have men; and Wisdom delighted in the *sons* of men.
Now, that is prominent in the gospel of Luke. That gospel shows us that God had set His heart
{448}
upon man. Hence the key to Luke in that respect is that there was to be "good pleasure in men", @Luke 2:14. That is, not only in Christ as Man, but in *men*, in a race of men after the pattern of Christ. Then Wisdom proceeds to say, "my delights were with the sons of men", @Proverbs 8:31. We have implied there that whilst God's good pleasure is to have man before Him, it is man in the family character. My reason for saying that is, that Wisdom speaks of "the *sons* of men".
Now, I do not know whether you have thought of it much, but I do know this, that every real parent has in his heart an ideal, and his thought is a son. You may think that is universal and common. It is, beloved friends, and the very fact that it is universal shows that it is a divine testimony which God has placed in the race to what is in His own heart. What is in the heart of God is, to have a humanity in the relationship to Himself of *sons*. As confirmatory of what I say as to the testimony that the parental idea suggests to us, we see that when God's earthly people were in Egypt, God's message to Pharaoh and the Egyptians was, "Israel is my son, my firstborn ... Let my son go, that he may serve me", @Exodus 4:21,22. Is there not wonderful light in that as to God's primary idea with regard to man? God has the affections of a father, and He has placed a testimony to that in the human family. There is no such testimony, as far as we can tell, among angels. Hence He says, "Israel is my son, my firstborn ... Let my son go that he may serve me". And what more does God say? "If thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, thy firstborn", @Exodus 4:23. He would slay *Pharaoh's* son. It was as if God had said to Pharaoh, 'You have the heart of a father, and you must recognise that I have the heart of a father. I have affections, and I must have my son'. There again we have God,
{449}
in the course of His governmental dealings on the earth, reverting to His primary thought.
Now, I was saying that the first statement of Wisdom which referred to the habitable earth was that God should have men, and have good pleasure in them as such, as *men;* and that this corresponds with the testimony of the gospel of Luke; whereas the idea of *sons*, the family idea, corresponds with the testimony of the gospel of John. John unites both these ideas in the opening chapter of his gospel. Giving us an account of the Person of Christ he tells us that "in him was life, and the life was the light of *men*", @John 1:4. It was not the light of *angels*, it was the light of *men*. In other words, the light as taking form in Man upon earth, has men in view. Men are to be illuminated, and the life of Christ was the light of men. That is the first thought. But John tells us also that the Lord came to His own and His own received Him not; but he adds, "as many as received him, to them gave he right to be (to take the place of) children of God", @John 1:12. *There* we get the *family*. And then he gives us an account of the origin of the children of God. He says they were born, not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but they were born of God. Hence the initial idea of the family is, that it is of divine origin.
John also speaks to us of *God*. He says, "God is a spirit", @John 4:24. Now, there is nothing that one feels more than the inability on the part of God's people to take account of what is spiritual. The apostle says that the spiritual was not first, but that which is natural, @1 Corinthians 15:46. Men are all engaged with the natural, but the natural is but an index to the spiritual, and the spiritual is the great end with God. Hence, to begin with, if we are to apprehend the *family* of God we must apprehend *God*. You cannot understand the nature
{450}
of the family unless you know God, and John tells us that "God is a spirit", @John 4:24.
But is that all? No, beloved friends. He who is a Spirit has manifested Himself, and here again John does not fail us, but says "the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him", @John 1:18. That is to say, He who is a Spirit has now been declared by One who has the place of an *Only One*, who has the place of Son with Him. Now think of that! That is the beginning of the divine thought for man. The disclosure of what God is morally comes out in One who has the place of an *Only One* with Him, as a Son. More than that, John says, "We beheld his glory" (@John 1:14); and what kind of glory was it? It was the glory "as of an only-begotten with a father", @John 1:14. We must take account of Christ according to what He is in His own Person; as such He has no companion, no equal. Isaac is the type of Christ in that light.
We find the idea of *sons* in the Old Testament, but beyond that we find there in type what is peculiar to Christ. He is the *Only One*. "Take now", God says to Abraham, "thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac", @Genesis 22:2. Now, Abraham had other sons, but in reading Scripture we have to read it in the light of the antitype; and that is what is in the mind of God -- Christ as the Only One. "Thy son", says God to Abraham, "thine only son, whom thou lovest". How well God understood the affections of Abraham. They were but a reflection of His own affections; namely, the affections that He has for Christ; those affections are peculiar. Christ has a unique place with God. He is the Only One.
Well, now, what we have to consider in regard to the family is, that whilst the declaration of God has come out in the Son of *God*, and in that way He is the leader and pattern of the heavenly family, yet
{451}
the testimony as to what we should be down here comes out in the Son of *man*. I desire, if I can, to make clear to you the distinction. You will remember what the apostle says in @Hebrews 2: "it became him ... in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings", @Hebrews 2:10. It does not say there *His* sons. The point is that He is to brings *sons*, that there are to be people in glory in that peculiar relationship. There is a peculiar glory connected with the relationship expressed in the word *son*. Hence, there are to be many sons in glory; that is to say, there are to be many such persons in glory; and that thought suggests to us the family that is to share the heavenly glory of the Lord Jesus. But before we share that, the testimony as to what man should be has to come out here upon earth. I repeat, that the testimony as to what man should be here upon earth has first to come out.
Now, Christ is both. He is the Son of God. That stands in regard to revelation, and in regard to what is eternal. The Son of man has reference to what man should be here upon earth; and what man should be here upon earth was perfectly expressed in the Lord, as Son of man. It was because of that that I ventured to read these verses in chapter 13. The Lord is at the Supper. One need not dwell upon this chapter, it is so well known to us; but I refer to it for one reason, and that is, it was the occasion of the brightest light. The brightest conceivable light shone there, and the wonderful ministry of Christ was here in the midst of His disciples. He was there as the perfect Servant, and in man's place. According to the well-known type, He had said, "I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free", @Exodus 21:5. I need not dwell upon that; it emphasises the character of the light that shone on the occasion recorded in
{452}
chapter 13 of John. Christ was there as Man. He was in man's place, and He was fulfilling it to God's glory.
Well, now, *Judas* was there! Christ was in the midst of the divine family, and Judas was the representative of the family of evil which began with Cain; he was there. No man ever had such privileges, save the other apostles, as Judas. He shared the companionship of Christ here upon earth, and he shared His ministry; and he was here on this marvellous occasion in which the brightest light shone resplendently; and we are told that he "went out", @John 13:30. Judas went out. Into what did he go? And out of *what* did he go? He went out, as it were, from the midst of the bosom of the divine family. You may say, where do you get the family? Well, we get the idea of it in chapter 11. The family at Bethany was of God. There was a family at Bethany that Christ loved. It is the suggestion of a divine thought. The Lord know the name of each one in that family, and He loved each one there. He loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus: He loved them individually and collectively. I refer to Bethany for the *idea*, that those whom the Father had drawn to Christ had this place, and at the supper He was there as Head. From that family Judas *went out*. He went out from the presence of the brightest light, into darkness, into the world; and he carried out into the world something that had never been in the world before. He carried out into it the spirit of a traitor to Christ, and of an apostate; and that spirit remains in the world to this day. It has not died with Judas; one can easily see that the spirit of Judas remains in the world: and it finds its home, not in the pagan world, but in that which is known as the christian world. The world with which we have to do is characterised by the spirit of Judas, and it only awaits the opportunity to manifest
{453}
itself under the "son of perdition" (@John 17:12), the one who will be the counterpart of Judas.
I will not enlarge upon that, although much might be said; but I wish to turn to the Lord's words in regard to it. He says, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall glorify him immediately", @John 13:31,32. This passage sets before us Christ as in man's place under God's eye; and the exit of Judas was the occasion that suggested that to His heart. The enemy had now got his instrument in Judas, and the last moments are coming. Gethsemane is at hand, wherein the Lord would testify in infinite perfection His unswerving obedience to the divine will. There is man seen in infinite perfection, in Christ, under God's eye. That is what I understand to be the *glory of the Son of man*.
I am not alluding to @Psalm 8, which is *conferred* glory; I am alluding to *acquired* glory; and my distinct impression is this, that the peculiar glory of Christ viewed as man is that He maintained man's place in infinite exactness in every detail under God's eye. He had maintained it throughout, but now the final test, the final crisis, was about to appear. He was to be face to face with Satan, who held the power of death in his hand; and Satan was about to bring that to bear upon the Lord so as to turn the Lord out of man's place. That was the whole aim of the enemy, to divert the Lord from man's true position of obedience to God. He had sought to do it at the outset in the wilderness, and now he returns with the power of death in his hand to turn the Lord out of the path of obedience; and at that moment the thought of His victory arose in the heart of Christ. He sees the opportunity, as it were, in which He would show in the presence of all, in the presence of the universe, His unswerving
{454}
obedience to the will of God. He says; "Not my will", @Luke 22:42. He could not but recoil from the cross, for it was the forsaking of God. It was the essence of His perfection to recoil from it; and on the other hand it was the essence of His perfection as man to take it up to drink the cup; and hence His glory shines under God's eye. There never had been such a shining of moral glory as there was in Gethsemane, and upon the cross when the Lord maintained, in infinite perfection, man's place under God's eye.
Well, He says, "If God be glorified in him". How is God glorified in Him? God was glorified in that His will was carried out by *man here upon earth*, and that in the presence of every possible opposition to it. Hence He says, "If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself". That surely is unique to Christ, for of no one could it be said but of Christ, that he is glorified in God. And then, moreover, God will not delay, He will "glorify him immediately". God, as it were, is morally bound to proceed to the glorification of the Man who so glorified Him in man's place.
Now, that is, I think, the pattern of the family of God here upon earth. The Man who in that way, glorified God in maintaining God's will here, that Man *must* go higher; that man must be glorified. So with ourselves; God gives us the opportunity of witnessing to what man's place is here; and then we are glorified. The Lord turns to the disciples and says "Children". That is a term of relationship, I only touch upon it for a moment. He says, 'I am going away. You are going to be where I have been; and I have glorified God in it. Now, what are *you* going to do?' He says, "Children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; and, as I said to the Jews, Where I go *ye* cannot come, I say to you also now. A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; as I have
{455}
loved you". And He adds, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves".
The point is emphasised, in these verses, that christian love would be mutual. All are to know that the disciples are His by love one to another. And what kind of love is christian love? It is *family* love. Evidently my love to my brother as a christian is not parental affection, that belongs to God, and it flowed out in Christ. But our love to one another is the love of brethren. We are 'to love as brethren'. Christian affection is family affection. Family affection begins with the parents; our love as brethren begins really with God, and flows out in Christ. And now the Lord is away. What are we going to do? Is there to be a family here taking pattern from the Son of man; He who carried out God's holy will, and in doing so was marked at every point by affection for His people? Now, that is exactly our position. It is that we are set here for God's will; and then we are set in relationship with one another as brethren; that is, we are set in relation with one another in this world as the family of God. So that man's place for God is witnessed to in the christian company, and the affections that are peculiar to the divine family are seen amongst God's people here upon earth. And what then?
Well, beloved friends, the moment is coming when that company which has glorified God upon earth will be translated to heaven. God will not translate to heaven anything that is not in moral suitability and accordance with Himself. What He transfers to heaven is what has glorified Him upon earth. Enoch, who was translated, is the great pattern man in this way. What was his testimony? He had this testimony "that he *pleased God*", @Hebrews 11:5. He walked with God. He did God's will
{456}
here, and he was translated to heaven. God translates to heaven those who glorify Him upon earth. Hence the Lord who glorified Him in perfection looks up in holy dignity to His Father in @John 17, and says, "Father ... I have glorified thee on the EARTH (where He had been dishonoured): I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was", @John 17:4,5. His prayer was a demand for what was morally right; it was right in God's account; and so we read in the epistle to the Romans, that He "was raised up from the dead by the *glory* of the Father", @Romans 6:4. Wonderful expression! The raising of Christ drew out, as it were, the nature of the Father in His affection for the Son. As in death, the glory of the Father took Him out of death; it was a question of the Father's affections. And it is as *we* glorify Him upon earth that we are morally suited for the heavenly abode. I think the thought of "the Son of man" is dropped there. The Son of man has to do with His path on earth, but the Son of God remains. I am not speaking dogmatically; I wish only to distinguish between the expressions.
Sonship is a divine idea, and a primary thought with God, and it is taken up in Christ, and in all that are Christ's; so that God is leading "many sons to glory", @Hebrews 2:10. Sonship, as I understand it, is that which God had set His heart upon from the outset; and so chapter 14 discloses to us that there is to be an abode for the family. "In my Father's house", says the Lord, "there are many abodes". The house of God is spoken of in Luke, and also in John. In Luke it refers to what is provisional; what stands related to the gospel here upon earth. In John it is eternal; it is the abode of the family of God as translated to heaven. So the Lord says, "I go to prepare a place for you". It is the *Son* who goes.
{457}
It is the Son who has to do with the house, and He goes to prepare it. For whom? He says, "I go to prepare a place *for you*". Every comfort was to be provided for them in the meantime, as the subsequent part of the chapter discloses; but it is only provisional. That which is eternal remains for us. "In my Father's house there are many abodes ... I go to prepare a place for you". And then, He says, "If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also". It seems to me that there the Lord is looking on to the completion of His plan to have the family that had shared His suffering upon earth, in the Father's abode in the heavenlies.
I trust, however imperfectly I have presented the subject, that there may be an exercise as to the *spiritual*, and that the family of God refers to what is *spiritual*. "God is a spirit" (@John 4:24), and hence His family must be a spiritual family. It is of such that we are part, as having received the Spirit of God's Son.
{458}
THE GARDEN OF GOD
@Genesis 3:8 - 10; @Song of Songs 4:12 - 16; @Song of Songs 5:1
It has often occurred to me that whatever God introduces in the way of testimony, He never relinquishes; although it may disappear for a time, it comes to view in the end. He has His own way of recovering it. Generally it is, that the thing is introduced in a material way, and as such it disappears; and then it is restored in a spiritual way. I say that, so that we may have before us that if we are recovered for God, we are recovered in a spiritual way. We are not recovered to be re-established on earth in a material way; we are recovered to have part in what is spiritual. A christian may be blessed in temporal things, or he may not be; that is entirely a matter of God's governmental dealings, but there is no doubt as regards his being blessed spiritually. If God has been pleased to work in our souls, it is that we might be blessed spiritually, and there is no uncertainty about that. The blessing which God has in store for us is, one may say, illimitable. He takes us up for the very greatest things. That is what is peculiar to this present dispensation. There will be a gospel after this present dispensation, but it will not be characterised as the gospel of the glory, @1 Timothy 1:11.
The "everlasting gospel" (@Revelation 14:6) and the "gospel of the kingdom" (@Matthew 4:23) are spoken of, but the gospel of the glory is the present gospel; it includes all the others, for no saint, whether in the past or future, will have anything in the way of spiritual blessing that God does not propose for us now. Of christians it is written, "Blessed us with *every* spiritual blessing", @Ephesians 1:3. That was a letter written to believers in Christ in
{459}
the city of Ephesus; and it was said of them that God had blessed them with every spiritual blessing. Where? On earth? No; material blessings belong to the earth; there are those who will be blessed with material blessings in a future day on earth. Christians are blessed, not with those, but with spiritual blessings *in the heavenlies*. Now, that is part of the gospel. So that, if God has begun to work in you, He has in view that you should have part in what is spiritual; and that you should have part in that, not on the earth, but in heaven. That is the full height of the glad tidings.
So that, as I was saying, recovery is in a spiritual way; and if God reverts to the idea of a garden, it is in a spiritual sense. Now you can all understand what a garden is. If there is anything that marks Scripture, it is the simplicity of its similes. Everybody, from a child up, may form some idea of a garden; it is a distinct part set aside by the farmer, or the landed proprietor, for his special use. Now God was pleased to introduce that idea. God has rights over all men. We must not limit the rights of God to believers; the Lord Jesus Christ has established His indisputable right to all, even though a man be an infidel. Do not forget that. He may not have put His mark on you yet; He would never claim you as His special property as an unbeliever; but He has a right to claim you. It is one thing to have a right, and it is another thing to assert it.
Now the believer has a mark put upon him. It is very important to determine whether you have that mark or seal. The gift of the Holy Spirit is referred to in three distinct ways by the apostle Paul in @2 Corinthians 1:21; he says, "he that ... has anointed us, is God"; that is to say, oil is poured on your head; you are distinguished; an anointed man is a distinguished man. The believer gets the Holy Spirit from Christ, and the possession of this Spirit
{460}
distinguishes him from all others who have not the Spirit; he is anointed. Anointing is not an internal thing; it is an *external* thing; it is on the head.
Now, the next thing is that God has sealed us. He has sealed believers. He marks them off as His own; it is for us to determine whether it is so. You remember how Paul raised the question with the Ephesian saints. There were twelve believers there. He says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?", @Acts 19:2. It was for them to answer. It is a very pertinent question. You are a believer; or you are a professed believer. Where is the seal? God's thought is that you should be sealed as one who is redeemed. It is a wonderful thought that God would put a distinct stamp upon you, and that stamp is the testimony that you are His. He has bought you; you are His. What is the price? The blood of Jesus. That is current money, speaking reverently; that is, the currency of the sanctuary. You are purchased by the blood of God's own Son; you belong, in that sense, to God, and you have the seal; but, as I said, it is for you to answer to that.
Then the next thing in regard to the Spirit is, that He is given as the earnest in our hearts. That is not the external mark; that is something for *our hearts*. Do you not need something in your heart? The Spirit in us is the earnest of coming good things; things which "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him", @1 Corinthians 2:9. Thus you have means spiritually. There are many people who have nothing to live on; and they turn to the world. What is the earnest for? That is something to live on. Is it not a handsome income? The Spirit is life, says the apostle writing to the Romans. 'Oh well', you say,
{461}
'I want to see a bit of life'. You want to taste a little of the world; you want to prove it for yourself. Ah! but you will not see *life*. You will see death there; "the dead are there", @Proverbs 9:18.
Well now, recovery is on this principle; and if God returns to the idea of a garden, He recovers it in a spiritual way. You may ask, 'What is the garden?' Your heart is the garden; that is the garden that God is looking for now. I will come to that presently. He had a garden in Eden; planted eastward in Eden. He made it in every way suited for the satisfaction of the man; it offered every possible means of satisfaction for man; it was a place of delights. But then it was not only to be for *man*. *God* was to have something to say in it. I have thought of the river that flowed into it. You remember that a river rose in Eden; the river did not have its rise in the garden; it rose in Eden, and it flowed into the garden. Now what that signifies is that God intended to influence the garden; a river is a source of influence; it flowed into the garden as *one* river, or stream, and it flowed out as *four*. Thus God indicated that the antitype, the gift of the Holy Spirit from heaven flowing into the hearts of believers, should be universal in its influence. Four is a symbol of what is universal.
As to the river in Eden, God intended to have a hold on the garden; He was to influence it; His river flowed into it, and flowed out of it; and, moreover, as the verse I read stated, God came into it Himself. Now I want you to dwell on that. The general idea is that God would have a special place for man, and He would influence the place for good. Think of the continuous stream flowing into it, influencing it with its refreshing power. Everything in the garden would benefit by that river; and then God Himself came into the garden. What I want to show you is this, that He found no response
{462}
to Himself in it. The trees ministered nothing to God, Adam was so constituted that they could minister to *him;* but they could minister nothing to God. God is a Spirit, and material things do not minister to Him; they are all to disappear. But there was something that God had placed in Adam that was *not* material; something that could respond to Him.
There is something in you, and in me, and in every one, that is not material; there is something that is in its nature spiritual. God had breathed into Adam; that was not material; He had breathed into Him His own breath. You remember how Solomon tells us later that the spirit returns to God who gave it. The question is not raised as to what God may do with it; but the wicked are limited to the lake of punishment. The spirit returns to God who gave it, and the body to dust. But God had breathed into Adam, and it was the answer to this that God sought in Adam, but He did not find it; Adam had become corrupted. Man has become corrupted in his spirit, his soul, and his body. The spirit, that which was nearest to God, became corrupted. It is a terrible thing to think of it; and when it became corrupted, and the link cut between God and man, the whole being is lost. Adam said, "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid". Adam and Eve heard the voice of God, but their spirits had become corrupted. Is it so with you? Have you any appreciation of Christ, or of the things of Christ? If you have not, your spirit is corrupted. It is so with every unconverted man: he is corrupted in that part of him which is nearest to God, and thus the whole man is lost to God. We think very little about what it was to God to come into the garden in which He had placed Adam, and to find no response. The voice heard indicated God's authority in the garden. He was stepping into His own
{463}
garden. God never gave up the idea of a garden. He has it now in those who love Him. I need not dwell here on Adam's sin. You are all acquainted with the history of the fall, as we speak of it. All I wish to dwell upon is, that God reserves His right to come into the garden with His voice looking for response, and He found none.
Now, when you come to Solomon's Song, you find the simile of the garden again. It refers to the last days, as no doubt many of you here know; and the song is a celebration of Christ's victory over His earthly people, His triumph over their affections in the future. In the course of the interchange of expression in the book, we arrive at the garden. Now I want you to consider this garden. I believe that most of you here are professed believers. You have heard the gospel, and most of you have professed to have accepted it. Now let me ask, What are you in the Lord's eye? He speaks of His spouse as His sister; a remarkable way to speak of her. A man's spouse is not usually his sister, but in this connection it must be so. You get the principle of it in Abraham, in Isaac, and in Jacob.
The speaker in the Song of Songs says, "A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed", @Song of Songs 4:12. There is no invitation in verse 12, but when you come to verse 16 there is an invitation to the Beloved, "Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits". God has reached His end; there is a garden now into which He can come on invitation. God loves that. He has a right to the garden, but He loves an invitation to it. Now where is your heart? Where are your affections, dear young believer? Are you a garden inclosed, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed? No one can go into a barred garden; nor is a spring shut up or a fountain scaled available to others. You have
{464}
the water, and the fruits; you have the principles of these things in you, but who gets the benefit of them?
I have been raising the question whether you *have* the Holy Spirit. If you have the Holy Spirit, as a believer, you have all these things in principle; but are you shut up? Now the Lord proceeds to say, "Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices", @Song of Songs 4:13,14. How He honours you! He speaks well of you. Your neighbour could scarcely speak to you like that, if the garden is barred up; He would say, perhaps, that you were selfish. The Lord honours you. He tells you how much you have that pleases Him. "Pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices". Everything that is delightful is there, but see to it, beloved friends, that after you have the Holy Spirit, that the Spirit is not grieved. As possessing the Spirit, you have all these things *in principle;* you have all that God delights in, all that Christ delights in. He encourages your heart by telling you that you have them. I am saying that for the encouragement of the Lord's people, and for all, for everyone here present.
Well now, if it is shut up, or barred, if the fountain is sealed, what will the Lord do? Be on the watch; there is the "north wind"; and the north wind is the piercing wind. It says, "Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden". Look out; the north wind is coming. Do you think, that the Lord Jesus, having put all that there,
{465}
is going to allow it to remain stagnant? Oh no. He knows what He has put there. If there is anything I cherish it is that the Lord knows all about me; if He has put anything in my heart, He knows where He has put it; and He knows how to value it. Peter recognised that; he said, "thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee", @John 21:17. The Lord indicates that here; but He will not reserve all that enjoyment to Himself; He wants others to share it. You may say, 'The Lord knows what is in my heart'. Does He? Well, if He does, He will see to it that others shall know what is there also. Do not call upon the Lord too quickly in that way.
If you say the Lord knows there is something in your heart, the Lord may bring the winds upon you that others may know it as well. He has put it there for that purpose. Everybody knew afterwards that Peter loved Jesus. But though Jesus knew it already He would have it made manifest to others; and before Peter passed out of the world, others knew he loved Jesus. The Lord passed him through the discipline; He caused the north wind to blow that others should know it. One of the most common expressions amongst christians is, 'The Lord knows all about me'. Well, if He has placed something within you for Himself, He would have others know it also. The word is, "Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out". The *spices;* not the flesh, the back-biting, the sarcasm -- no, the *spices*. The north wind does not bring out the flesh; the north wind brings out what God has put there, the spices; that is, love, sympathy, consideration for others, care for others; these are the spices that the Lord will bring out. How often one has seen in the discipline of christians that the north wind, the wind of affliction, blows, and the hardened spirit becomes soft, and there comes respect for God, and
{466}
the things of God, and respect for His people, appreciation of their sympathy, and response to it.
Now, when all that has taken place there is an *invitation*. You are prepared for the Lord to come into His garden. The invitation is to the Beloved. The One who has brought the north wind into activity is your friend. "Let my beloved come into his garden", she says, "and eat his pleasant fruits". Do you say how does that work out practically? Well, you have a place in your heart for the saints. If you do not want the *Lord's* people, you do not want the Lord. We were saying a few nights ago, that Simon the Pharisee invited the Lord, but he did not invite His disciples. If you want the Lord in your garden, you will want His disciples in your garden; they are bound up with Him; that is the principle. And the next thing you get in chapter 5:1, is that the Lord can invite His friends. He says, "Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved". The Lord can invite now.
Speaking in a general way, the garden really has reference to the saints. The Lord has a special spot here upon earth that He cherishes; and He desires to have a place in it. I would ask each of you before the Lord to look to it, as to whether your heart is open for the Lord, as to whether you have a place in it for Him, and for His people. If you have, you are answering to God's garden in the spiritual way. You are the Lord's property, and you give Him an opportunity, as it were, to invite others.
May the Lord help us in the apprehension of these things.

INHERITANCE AND AFFECTION
@Numbers 27:1 - 11; @Numbers 36:1 - 13
In taking up this book I desire, as the Lord may help me, to show how the Spirit of God views God's people in regard to the inheritance. You will recall that we get two numberings of the people here; all the males of the children of Israel were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go to war. In the first instance the numbering was in view of their being placed in relation to the tabernacle of the testimony; each man was to pitch by the standard of his father's house, but all were grouped around the tabernacle. You get that in chapter 2. Then in chapter 26 all the males are again numbered, but this time they are taken account of, not as supporting the testimony but as about to take possession of the inheritance. The type of the brazen serpent intervenes between the two numberings, and what follows on that is the springing well, setting forth typically that God's people are taken account of as having the Spirit consequent on the judgment of the flesh in the brazen serpent.
The first numbering is of great importance as having to do with the testimony, but they were taken account of the second time as in the light of the purpose of God; they are no longer taken account of as a people of responsibility, but of purpose. The Spirit being communicated, they are now suitable for the land of Canaan. All who had part in the first numbering had fallen in the wilderness save Caleb and Joshua, and they are viewed now in relation to God's purpose. The numbering infers that they had come to manhood; they are formed in intelligence, so the inheritance is taken up in intelligence, and they are in every way suitable to it. As believing on Christ, and having received the
{468}
Spirit, they are taken account of as suited for the land of God's purpose. God takes account of them. "From twenty years" takes account of you as matured, as having come to manhood. You are viewed no longer as children as under the old covenant, but as possessed by the Spirit and in full manhood. It is then that we come under God's view, and He gives us the inheritance; we learn that each one of us has a place there. You learn that the blessed God has especially designed a place for you in His inheritance; there is a spot for you in His land. God knows the extent of it, He knows the position of it, and there is ample room in it, and a place for each of us there. Just as the people were placed in relation to the testimony, so now they have their place in relation to the land. Divine wisdom controls everything in God's land; every place in it is divinely allotted, and no believer would have it otherwise. God is sovereign in wisdom and He is sovereign in love.
Now what is connected with the daughter of Zelophehad is appreciation of the land; there is the appreciation subjectively of what is presented objectively. The people at Kadesh-barnea had despised the pleasant land. God had prepared the very best for them, and there was a testimony to it in the grapes of Eshcol, but they despised the pleasant land and God was wrath with them. That is very much the position of things in regard to christendom; it is essentially infidel as to God's purpose, and it is infidel as to heaven and the heavenly character of christian blessings. God has prepared the very best for us in christianity, and the warning is given to us in Hebrews lest in any of us there should be "an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God", @Hebrews 3:12.
Now the daughters of Zelophehad *appreciated* the inheritance; they come forward and lay claim to
{469}
the inheritance of their father; they say to Moses, "Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father". That is what God delights in; what He appreciates is that His people should draw near to Him, that they should make request to Him in regard to what He has prepared for them. Canaan was prepared for the people of Israel; it was His purpose to give it to them, but He delighted in the petition of these women, and He answered it. God loves to have His people come and seek Him in regard to His things. All true prayer is on that line. And God appreciates it just because He loves to see the result of His own work in the hearts of His people. It is for this reason that so much is made of prayer in the Scriptures. God sets certain things before us, and the result of His operations in us is that we turn to Him in prayer, that we may get the good of what He has prepared. He has gone to infinite cost to make the inheritance ours, and He loves to see it appreciated.
So you will see that this scripture in Numbers presents the state in God's people which appreciates His purpose for them. Why were they not like their fathers at Kadesh-barnea? Because the Holy Spirit had come in typically; man in the flesh had been judged and set aside in the serpent lifted up, and consequent on that a new state had been introduced. Naturally, we could not appreciate the things of God, but God having condemned sin in the flesh, gives us a new state in the Spirit so that we can say, "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit", @Romans 8:4. That which maintains the law in the wilderness is the same power which appreciates the land of purpose.
These women set forth to us the subjective state which will lay hold of the inheritance, and that
{470}
state is the result of the work of the Spirit. God always commends the work of the Spirit; it is that which He appreciates in His people. It is true we are enjoined to pray, but prayer and worship are both spontaneous, and both are the result of the work of the Spirit. God always commends what is the spontaneous result of the work of His Spirit in our hearts. So here, He fully commends the desire of these women to get a possession among their brethren, and indeed He makes their request the foundation of a statute in Israel; it became a statute of judgment by the Lord's command, verse 8. God, as it were, establishes a law and a statute on the ground of the spontaneous result of the work of His Spirit in His people. The result of the exercises produced by the Spirit is in perfect accord with God. There is perfect agreement between the intercession of the Spirit and the mind of God; if the Spirit makes intercession in us with groanings which cannot be uttered, it is in perfect accord with the will of God. In that way the mind of the believer, as wrought upon by the Spirit, is brought into perfect accord with the mind of God, and the inheritance is confirmed to you as you appreciate it.
Turn now to chapter 36, and what I would say as to this is, you want to be on your guard as to whom you marry. In this chapter you find the male side introduced again; the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, come forward. The woman in Scripture is used largely to set forth the subjective side of things, but the male presents the thought of intelligence; so here, in the sons of Machir, we come again to the intelligence side. What we may learn from that is that our affections must be regulated by intelligence; our affections might lead us beyond divine limits, but if God gives us an inheritance in His land, what we find is that no inheritance must go beyond its own tribe. The inheritance is confirmed
{471}
and made sure to us, but it must be held within the divine limits which God prescribes. Then the question of marriage comes in, because there must be the appreciation not only of divine inheritance, but of divine Persons. As you progress in your soul's history you will enjoy the inheritance, and it may be confirmed to you, but the question of marriage will surely be raised; you need an Object for your affections. The inheritance is not enough for your heart. These women had come into the inheritance of their father, and a wonderful possession it was, but how were their affections to be regulated? Left to themselves they might have carried the inheritance out of its proper place, out of its tribe.
We may apply this to ourselves: if God has endowed us with the gospel, it must not be diverted from Christ. If God has blessed us in the gospel, there is only one true Object for the affections of His people, and that is Christ; Christ is the only Husband for the christian. We want to see to it that our affections are not diverted from Christ, that we do not in that way separate our inheritance from the tribe of our fathers. If christians had held firmly to this principle, the world would not have secured so much of that which belongs to Christ. The world has decked itself up with what is properly Christ's, with that which is proper to Christ and to His tribe. Christians took up other husbands, so to speak; they failed to keep themselves for Him. Very often in Scripture you will find that marriages took place between relatives; it is so in the case of Abraham, and with Isaac, and with others also. In Joseph we have another thought: it is the gentile bride that is set forth in Asenath, but in the main, marriage between relatives seems to set forth that in God's account marriage must be on equal grounds. So the church, as united to Christ, is suitable to Christ as of His lineage.
{472}
Well, these women were not to marry outside their father's house, and the point was that the inheritance should not be diverted from its proper tribe; and for us this sets forth that our inheritance as christians must not be diverted from the people -- the tribe of Christ. The professing church, as I have been saying, has carried away that which is His and has given it to the world. That with which the Lord endowed her and adorned her she has carried away and given to another; the very graces which were His she has put upon the world in that way. We have to be exceedingly jealous over our hearts lest they should be diverted from Christ and directed to another outside our father's tribe. As I said before, Christ is the only true Husband for His people; He is the only legitimate Husband; we are His. If you look at Ruth you will see that not only did Boaz love her, but he *purchased* her for himself; she was a redeemed one. It is so with us; Christ has redeemed us; He has purchased us for Himself; no other claimant has any title to us but the Lord Jesus Christ. He has bought us for Himself, and if we recognise His claim over us, all that with which He has endowed the church will remain to us, and remaining to us it is secured for Him. It remains to Him, though He has made it ours. When the heavenly city comes down from God she appears fully endowed, fully adorned with all that grace has put upon her. All that she has, every element of glory, is secured to Christ in the church.
In speaking of this scripture I wanted to make a direct appeal to ourselves. I would repeat: the Lord Jesus Christ is the only legitimate Husband for the christian, and as true to Him, all that He has endowed us with is secured to Him, it is held for Him. The Spirit of God will seek to gain us for Him through our affections, and the outlet for the affections is the marital relation. Naomi said to
{473}
Ruth, "Shall I not seek rest for thee?", @Ruth 3:1. *We* want to be at rest; our hearts need to be at rest. Then at the end of the book Naomi says of Boaz, "the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing", @Ruth 3:18. The heart is only at rest in the establishment of the marriage relation. As our hearts are brought into the consciousness of that relation to Christ we are at rest. We surrender to Him absolutely; that is the thought of it, recognising that He, and He only, has a right to our affections.
{474}
THE HOUSE OF GOD: HOW ENTERED BY THE BELIEVER.
@1 Chronicles 21:21 - 27; @Genesis 28:11 - 17; @Genesis 35:9 - 13
You can readily discern from the passages I have read that my thought is to seek to direct your minds to God's house, and what I should like to make clear is, that to reach it in our souls, we have to be guided by certain inward marks, and not by outward or visible ones only. Of course, it is true that God's house has certain outward features which can be taken account of even by the natural mind, but in order to reach it according to God, certain lines have to be followed which can only be discerned by those who have eyes to perceive divine things.
Now, what I hope to show is, that there are at least three leading initial features as to the house which have to be discerned before anyone can enjoy that place. The first has reference to the foundation, or, rather, the site of the foundation, and this is seen in the passage in Chronicles; that is to say, the spot upon which God's house was to be erected is identified with the place in which man is accepted with God on the ground of sacrifice; this involving the judgment of sin. This place was not left to man to choose; it was divinely indicated to David as the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. David discerned by moral perception that this should be the site on which the house should be built. He says, "This is the house of the Lord God". Here the sword of God was sheathed, as we see in verse 27. This is the first feature which I would dwell upon.
I wonder whether everybody here discerns that the sword of the Lord is sheathed? What the evangelist is privileged to announce is, that it is sheathed. It is not sheathed exactly for those who adhere to the
{475}
legal system; the Jew, as having rejected Christ, is still under wrath, so you will find at the end of @1 Chronicles 21, that David was afraid to go to Gibeon. Now, I am very desirous that every soul here should see the point of distinction between the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite and Gibeon. If you do not, you will not be free from the sense of wrath; and, on the other hand, you will not be in the apprehension of God's house.
Now, there are many people who in their consciences are not free from wrath; they are afraid of God. Is it not so? David, we are told, was afraid to go to Gibeon; he was afraid, and rightly so, for the sword of God was *there* unsheathed. Beloved friends, it is your privilege to be free from fear, but there is only one spot where you can be free, and that is where God has sheathed His sword. In having to do with God, remember that He is sovereign, and in sheathing His sword He did so on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. This points to the moral ground of the atoning sacrifice of Christ.
Now, you may ask me: 'Where shall I find the sword sheathed today?' The sword is sheathed in Christ risen. In a sense, the Lord Jesus Christ when here in the flesh was the sword of God. This may not seem to correspond with the character of His ministry, but it is nevertheless true. He was morally the Executor of God's judgment upon man. This may be traced in the gospels. I do not say, of course, that judgment was executed in a literal way, but it was executed morally; "now is the judgment of this world" (@John 12:31), He said. The Lord Jesus Christ answered to the cherubim of glory; but happily He was also the Mercy-seat. If God comes into the midst of a world of sin, and He did come in Christ, everything must be judged; but the wonderful thing for man to know is, that the Lord Jesus Christ Himself bowed to the sword of judgment. In Him risen from the
{476}
dead, man is accepted on the ground of sacrifice, and in Him the sword of God is sheathed.
Here in David we have a figure of Christ. It is true that he was personally guilty, but we learn from the corresponding passage in Samuel that God was dealing with the state of the people. David, here, comes forward and accepts the whole responsibility and, in this sense, he is a figure of Christ. At Gethsemane, the Lord takes this place. There He weighed all the responsibility, and He took the cup from His Father's hand, not from man's or Satan's hand. He was the true Head of the people, and although infinitely free from sin personally, He accepted all its consequences, and on the cross exhausted the judgment. The sword is thus covered, or sheathed, in Christ risen. It will be made bare in the future when Christ will come out of heaven to execute wrath, but for the moment it is sheathed, and instead of wrath, there is a Mercy-seat for man. It is this that is announced publicly in the gospel, and not judgment. David may be regarded in two lights in this passage; on the one hand, he is a type of Christ, as I have been saying, and on the other, he is a figure of the believer. As viewed in the latter light, what we see in him is, that he acted in the intelligence of faith. Perceiving where man is accepted on the ground of sacrifice, he refuses to go elsewhere. I want you to put yourself in the position of David. Do not go to Gibeon! Christendom, as seen outwardly today, is at Gibeon. I have not any hesitation in saying that, for it has placed itself under obligation to keep the law of God. The tabernacle at Gibeon represented the old order of things, which was established at mount Sinai, whereas the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite represents the new order of things established in Christ as Man risen from the dead. Faith clings to the latter, whereas ignorance, seen in the pretence to establish one's
{477}
own righteousness before God in the principle of law-keeping, goes to the former.
I speak of it so that you may be awakened as to the position that vast numbers of professing believers occupy, as seen in the words, 'Lord, incline our hearts to keep Thy law'. It is in principle Gibeon. David had faith, and hence would not go there. Are you not afraid to go to Gibeon? The sword of the Lord is there. Now, where are you, let me ask? Are you connected with some legal institution; some system which is built up in connection with the law? The sword of the Lord is there. You may reply: 'You were saying a moment ago that the sword was sheathed in Christ, and how then is it unsheathed elsewhere?' I reply that the sword is sheathed in Christ in regard to *man* as such. In John's gospel we read: "he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him", @John 3:36. This unquestionably refers to the Jews as rejecting Christ and clinging to the old system. You see the fulfilment of it in @1 Thessalonians 2:16: "wrath is come upon them to the uttermost". Whereas, on the other hand, christianity began, so to speak, at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite; but it has drifted back and is, as I said, now at Gibeon. I would not stay there for an instant. If you are there, dear friend, I would beseech you to leave it.
*The light of all these things in the soul of man is the true groundwork of the house*. David says, "This is the house of the Lord God". Remember that the site of God's house is in the souls of believers, and what I have indicated above is the only true groundwork for the superstructure of the house. The house is built in God's people. I have often heard people speak of the foundation of the house being laid, but it seemed very vague and abstract in their minds. I believe, as I have said, that the apprehension of
{478}
man's acceptance, on the principle of sacrifice, is a true groundwork for the foundation of the house. Paul speaks of laying the foundation in Corinth; he laid it in the souls of the saints, by presenting Christ to them in the gospel. He says, "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ", @1 Corinthians 3:11.
I go on to @Genesis 28 to show another feature of the house, and that is, you find in it God's interest in you. Jacob is a wanderer. There are, alas! at the present time a great many such; that is, they have no spiritual dwelling-place. Jacob had a stone for his pillow. It is not to be wondered at that persons in such circumstances are discontented. But Jacob is made to realise that he is an object of interest with God. The heavens are opened and the angels of God are ascending and descending, connecting Jacob, as it were, directly with God. In this way we are made conscious of divine interest in us. I do not say that the heavens open upon each of us, as upon Jacob, or that angels are the agents by which God puts Himself in communication with us; but nevertheless, as in His house, we find ourselves objects of interest with God. Angels came to Jacob, whereas christians, who are greater than angels, express God's interest in men today. Christians, being men, can sympathise with you. Elihu says to Job, "I am as thou", @Job 33:6. There are numbers of people around you tonight who can sympathise with you fully in whatever soul-exercise you may be passing through. The heart of God expressed itself in Christ as Man here upon earth, and there is a continuance of this in His people. God did not have men to express His interest in Jacob at Bethel, but now men, indwelt by the Spirit, form God's house on earth, and in them His love is practically expressed. They express His sympathy and love to men. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit, and this
{479}
works out practically in the house. Hence, this second great feature is, that you are made sensible of God's great interest in you in His house. Jacob says, "How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven". Well, I hope it is not "dreadful" to you; it is not to me. To those who love God, it is enjoyable as His dwelling-place; it is the gate of heaven.
I proceed now to @Genesis 35. What I see there is, that the house of God is a place marked by divine communications. What appears here is evidently in advance of the two features we have been dwelling upon. The believer prefigured in Jacob has now turned definitely to the house, fully recognising it as God's dwelling-place. Jacob had not been there for twenty years, still he knew the character of the place. Many have turned away practically from the house and have become wanderers. They have not forgotten it, but they prefer, alas! to live elsewhere. If there any such here tonight, God would say, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and *dwell there*", @Genesis 35:1. Jacob responds, but he felt he could not take his idols there; hence, he buries them under the oak, which was by Shechem. Many christians, alas! are hindered by idols; some objects occupy their minds other than God and His house; but in order to dwell in the house, we must bury them all. But what I wish to point out specially here is, that he found it to be the place where God revealed His Name to him. Here God answers a question that Jacob had asked Him when he returned from Padan-aram in chapter 32. Notice, that in chapter 28 He had told Jacob that He was the Lord God of Abraham and the God of Isaac; whereas, in chapter 35 He says, "I am God Almighty". "Almighty" means that He is able to do everything to the accomplishing of His counsels. He says further to Jacob, "Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall
{480}
come out of thy loins". The accomplishment of all this depended upon God's almighty power. Jacob and his seed after the flesh, as we know, should disappear in death, but an innumerable seed shall be reckoned to him on the principle of resurrection. "Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel?", @Numbers 23:10. The house, viewed as I am now dwelling upon it, is a place of divine communication; we see that everything is to be established by God Almighty. He who is Almighty to Jacob is Father to us; and it is in the house that you fully realise what the name Father is; and this is the point to which the Spirit of God would lead us.
I believe that there are these three distinct land-marks by which we may be guided in the full enjoyment of the house: first, man's acceptance on the ground of sacrifice; second, God's interest in you made known; third, God's Name revealed, and you in known relation to Him there in His house. May God grant that we may all know the house as thus indicated.
{481}
PROTECTION
@Isaiah 4
What I had in view in reading this chapter is to call attention first to the principle of independency. The seven women spoken of represent an exercise under the government of God, as indicated in the previous chapter. The prophet speaks of a certain governmental condition that had come about. It is, as you will observe, marked by independency of God; women ruled over the people, children spoke disrespectfully of their elders, and the women were marked by extreme worldliness, so that we have a remarkable foreshadowing of our own times, and, I may add, particularly on this continent.
Not that man is any different, save that environment brings to light certain proclivities. But it would be an entire mistake to assume that man is at all different in one continent from what he is in another. Man is man! In @John 2 there were those that believed on the Lord because of the signs, but He did not trust Himself to them. Nationality is not in view, but all men; for He knew what was in *man*. Certain environments may develop certain proclivities, but the Lord knew what was in man, and He trusted no man. He did not commit Himself to them.
But then certain environments promote particular features, and so we find in the history of man that he travelled; as it is said, toward the east. Now travel has an influence over man, and particularly promotes independency. A man who crosses the Atlantic assumes that he has accomplished something, and if he has crossed all the oceans he has accomplished more. And the more a man travels the more independent he is, for he feels he can look after himself. He can cut himself loose from old ties. Hence we
{482}
read that as men travelled eastward they arrived at Shinar: "they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt there", @Genesis 11:2.
You may be assured that this was the outcome of experience. They had travelled together and they had discovered that they could get along, that they could utilise the products of any territory, and so they made a common fund of their experience. They would establish a community, they would build a city and a tower, and the city would have the gain of the common experience of the whole race. It would be an unheard of thing and a new departure. It would make an epoch in the history of the human race, and be a beginning marked by centralisation. Centralisation involves a contrary power and independency of God.
And so this was the decision they arrived at: "Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth", @Genesis 11:4. That was the resolution, and it was immediately put into effect. They obtained the material for the city and tower and set to work to establish it.
There is on every hand the evidence of independence of God. Men strive to go beyond divine limitations and to acquire what they intended to accomplish at Babel. The cities are increasing. The country is being deserted for the city, and this is not by chance. It is largely a result of a certain course, and Satan is at the bottom of it. An increase of population means an increase of sin and independency of God.
But then God intervenes, and comes down to see what they were doing. Do you think God is looking on without interest in what is occurring here? We read, "Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built" (@Genesis 11:5), as if to show the intense interest He had in men. There was
{483}
nothing in it all for Him, as far as the record goes. In fact, the epistle to the Romans would show that they decided they did not like to retain God in their knowledge; what was known of God had no place. God was deliberately shut out. But He says, I will come down. He would, as it were, impress upon them His interest. And so today, notwithstanding the awful wickedness in these cities, God is interested in them. He knows all about this city and every one in it.
One has been impressed of late that the Lord Jesus called out from heaven the name of a certain street in Damascus. We have no record of His ever having visited Damascus but He knew everything in that city. Such is the patient interest of God that He is interested in man. His long-suffering is salvation. He would apply a negative remedy to the situation. They would wish not to be dispersed. God said that is just what is going to happen. Decentralisation has been the order of the day ever since. That is a mercy of God.
You find islands of very small size far out in the Pacific, and yet they are inhabited. How did people get there? @Genesis 11 tells us; God scattered men over the face of the *whole* earth. The Holy Spirit penned that chapter. He knew the earth was round; He knew all these continents. God is infinitely more particular about detail than we are wont to assume. Nothing happens without Him, and it is said of the Lord Jesus Christ that not one thing was made without Him. Not one thing. Such is God, beloved friends!
And so He says, I will scatter them abroad on the face of the whole earth. If man would centralise, God would decentralise, and scatter them abroad on the face of the earth, because He would reserve them for the gospel. It is easier to preach to a few than to the whole race centralised at Shinar. What
{484}
would such care for the gospel? They had elected to leave God out of their knowledge, and God gave them up. The modern trend is to centralise again, and that is what is coming. Let us not be deceived, the evil principles that are at work in centralisation are going to be successful, but not until God permits it. But He *is* going to permit it, and men are going to set up a head in the Antichrist. In the meantime God is maintaining what He did in @Genesis 11 and the Holy Spirit will not permit any successful effort at centralisation. In the Acts He begins by speaking in their own tongues, in the power of the Holy Spirit. It is said, "We hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God", @Acts 2:11.
Now in @Isaiah 4 we find that there has been an exercise, and if there is no exercise the gospel will accomplish nothing. So that instead of the women of pride in chapter 3, we have seven in this chapter. In Scripture seven refers to the result of a direct exercise. Enoch was the seventh from Adam, the product of an exercise. "And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, Our own bread will we eat, and with our own garments will we be clothed; only let us be called by thy name". Now that is the very opposite of independency. Modern women do not wish anything like this, but assume competency to get on under their own name. I am not speaking of women as such, but of women as representing the race in its subjective features. But these women have come back to the divine thought. When sin came into the world God said to Eve about Adam, "and he shall rule over thee" (@Genesis 3:16); that is to say, the race will be subject. That is the divine thought, the principle of subjection, but in modern times the place that woman is acquiring means that this principle has been cast to the winds.
So that there is a return to Christ in these seven. He is that one Man. The point was that these women
{485}
were conscious of being under reproach. There is nothing so hard to bear as reproach. Here I am under reproach, if I bear the name of Christ and go out into the world. But with God it is different, for if you come into the presence of God *without* Christ, you are under reproach, and every intelligence in heaven will look upon you with scorn. There is no place in heaven, there is no place in the house of God on earth, nor in the kingdom for you without Christ. These women say, "We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach".
We read in verse 2, "in that day there shall be a sprout of Jehovah for beauty and glory". "A sprout" suggests something that is young and fresh and attractive. As coming to Christ not only is reproach taken away, but you have come under the eye of God in relation to all that Christ is as beautiful and glorious. If you were to see what transpired in heaven when Jesus was born, you would have some knowledge of what this meant. The people on earth had gone into the towns and the cities so as to be enrolled, for Augustus had made a decree that the whole habitable earth was to be enrolled in the census. It was in that way very similar to what took place at Shinar. One and another came up to be enrolled in the census. Perhaps it never occurred to you that God keeps books in which not only the name but the doings of everybody are recorded.
Jesus was born while the census was being made, but there was no interest, beloved friends, in that Babe. The Spirit of God in Luke emphasises the neglect of the Babe. It was a very ordinary occurrence on earth, but it was wonderful to heaven. What was the Roman power to heaven? But the birth of Jesus brings out the angels. Shepherds keeping their flocks by night in the fields have a

visitation from heaven. An angel is beside them announcing, "Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord", @Luke 2:11. This was glad tidings to all people. Heaven was taking account of the race, for suddenly a multitude of the heavenly host were "praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men", @Luke 2:13,14. That was what was going on in heaven, and so heaven is interested *now* in men, assuredly it is.
And the Babe came under the eye of heaven as the sprout of the Lord for beauty and for glory, and the whole race of man is to come under Him. Not only is the reproach taken away by confessing the Lord's name, the reproach in heaven and among the people of God, which is the most select society, in accord with heaven. Your reproach is taken away only by confessing Jesus as Lord, and just as soon as you do that from the heart. But then you want to be set up in beauty and ornament amongst them. Christ comes in as the crown of the saints; and so the epistle to the Romans develops the truth until you arrive at "in Christ", @Romans 8:1. Then we take on in the presence of God all His beauty and His glory; we are set up in His presence according to Christ.
Now there is another thing. "And the fruit of the earth for excellency and for ornament for those that are escaped of Israel". Now you see you have *escaped* in taking on the Lord's name and confessing it; you have escaped an awful disaster by believing on Christ, and as among those who have escaped you come in for the blessing and ornamentation of Christ.
There is still another thought here, and that is, we are now amongst the *living* in Jerusalem; we have arrived at a definite position. All outside is death without one pulsation towards God in any
{487}
man or woman, but as a believer you are come amongst the living. How great a thing to be numbered amongst the *living*! "And it shall come to pass that he who remaineth in Zion, and he that is left in Jerusalem, shall be called holy". It is the book of life in Jerusalem. The book of life is a permanent thing. Think of what it is to be written amongst the living in Jerusalem! You are amongst the living in the assembly and are holy. God has made Christ unto us wisdom and righteousness, sanctification and redemption. Are you going to take up your heritage? I would not want to be enrolled among the dead. You want to be sure you have got your name in the book of life, written among the living and in Jerusalem. It is written that the Lord *added* such as should be saved, @Acts 2:47.
Now we come to the dwelling places and assemblies in Zion. Zion may be taken as representing a principle. And there are dwellings in it, and these dwellings come in for divine favour, as it says, "And Jehovah will create over every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and over its convocations, a cloud by day and a smoke, and the brightness of a flame of fire by night: for over all the glory shall be a covering" (verse 5). Now we have come to dwelling places and assemblies or convocations. There are both in Zion, and they are taken up in relation to the sovereign mercy of God. God blesses our households on the principle of sovereignty.
Every believer's house is a household of Zion. The introduction of the gospel in Europe was in relation to households. Lydia said, "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there", @Acts 16:15. How characteristically she was a householder of Zion, for if we have been shown the sovereign goodness of God, the next thing is to be faithful. I believe if there had been more faithfulness in our houses there would have been a greater
{488}
harvest. We need mercy in our houses, and God grants it; but then what about our faithfulness in them? I am responsible to bring my children to the Lord and hold them for the Lord. You may recall the incident of the colt that was tied at the cross-way. If you insist on the sovereign right given you by God in your house, God will stand by you. If you tie your colt at the cross-way the Lord will send and claim it, for the Lord has need of it, He has need of every one of our children.
Every household in mount Zion has a covering. It is the protection of God over our houses by day and by night. Here it is, as you will observe, "Jehovah will create over every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and over its convocations, a cloud by day and a smoke, and the brightness of a flame of fire by night". Young men and young women who disregard parental authority, there it is, and that fire will have to say to you sooner or later. You may despise it, but there it is.
Then, too, as to our assemblies, there is the glory over them. Divine protection is there. "And there shall be a tabernacle for shade by day from the heat, and for a shelter and for a covert from storm and from rain". His glory is in the assembly and in a measure His glory is in our dwelling places. We read the Scriptures in our houses, we pray, and it is as the smoke of Abraham's sacrifice. In Noah's case He smelled an odour of rest. You can count on His protection day and night; as we come together in the recognition of the Holy Spirit, we are delightful to God in our convocations. And as we speak together of the holy things of God it is pleasurable to Him. Surely He protects us. We have often seen the way the Lord comes in for the protection of His people and for the households of Zion.

GOD'S OPERATIONS
@Acts 10
My thought is to seek to show the manner of God's operations. You will have observed in the Scriptures that the *Spirit* operates in connection with a certain set of circumstances, and that the *Lord* operates in connection with another set of circumstances, and, finally, that *God* operates. And as you pass from one thought to another, the sphere of the operations extends. When God operates fully according to His own nature the sphere of the operations extends to the whole creation. He has rights as Creator, and when He is free to act according to His nature He asserts these rights. He has a right to operate according to His nature. One thing that gives the present period such a unique character is that it is the moment of God's operations according to His nature as fully revealed. He operates "all things in all", @1 Corinthians 12:6.
I need not remind you that God always operated from the outset. The book of Job is most interesting and helpful in this respect. It is remarkable, that in undertaking to enlighten Job, the great text-book of God was creation. He appealed to it, with the result that Job was convicted. God began by questioning Job, calling attention to the time when He began to operate. God asked, "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?", @Job 38:4. But His operations then did not disclose His nature; they disclosed His power.
With this the beginning of Genesis fully accords. In giving an account of things Moses opens thus: "In the beginning *God* created the heavens and the earth", @Genesis 1:1. The thought of the Spirit was to introduce God and His rights in creation. When Moses wrote, these rights had been disregarded, and men were
{490}
worshipping and serving the creature rather than the Creator. Hence the Spirit of God takes up Moses and inspires him to write a testimony of God's creatorial rights, saying, that in the beginning *He* created the heavens and the earth. And then we are further told that the earth being without form and void, and darkness upon the face of the deep, and then God operated to bring light and order into it.
An analogy to this is the soul of man as away from God. Man is God's handiwork, but sin has brought chaos and darkness into his soul. God has no place there, and if God has no place in your heart chaos reigns there. The laws of the country in which you live do not regulate your heart. They may attempt to keep within bounds its tendencies, but they do not regulate your heart; complete disorder and darkness reign there if God's rights are not owned. Now the Spirit of God in @Genesis 1, hovered over the face of the deep, and so now He waits on opportunities to work in men's souls. We do not always give Him opportunities, but one feels that if you come into the gospel meeting you give God an opportunity. If you are at all honest you come in for a purpose. God is always ready as the opportunity offers itself, and the first thing God does is to command light. God said, "Let there be light", @Genesis 1:3. It is a wonderful moment in the history of a soul when the command is given, "Let there be light".
I allude to all that briefly to show you the character of God's operations. God acts for Himself. He acts from His own motives, and He has His own great end in view in His operations. You may ask me what the end is. Well, the end in view in God's operations in the soul of man is that that person should be conformed to Christ. You could not conceive of a greater end. God begins with Christ; He begins by bringing in a Man that is in every way in accordance with His ideal. The heavens were
{491}
opened by God upon Jesus, and God pronounced His unqualified delight in Him. It was God virtually saying, *This is my ideal*. God has found His ideal in Christ, and all His operations now are to form souls after Christ. That is the idea in the gospel.
Now, I want to show you how God has operated so that the gospel might be extended from the narrow limits of judaism to the wide limits of creation. God has wrought to that end. I do not think you get any event in which this is more perfectly stated, than that which is related in this chapter. It commends itself to me as a most perfect statement to bring into evidence how God has operated so that the light of the gospel should be extended to us gentiles.
I wish to go into the matter in a little detail. A great many things had to be done, and one is struck with the minuteness of detail that is presented. Cornelius is taken account of outside judaism, and this is a distinct testimony to the sovereign activity of God outside Israel prior to the formal introduction of the gospel to the gentiles. Peter had to be taken account of in this, for he was the official holder of the keys of the kingdom, @Matthew 16:19. As yet he was not prepared to use them to admit the gentile, but we shall see that God operated to lead Peter to do this. I want to show you how God formed Peter to open the door to the gentiles in suitable dignity. If the door is to be opened it must be opened wide, and with grace and good-will; opened by one who was won over to complete sympathy with God's mind. The moment had come for it, and God was bent upon this great transaction.
We have to bear in mind that God's testimony up to this point was associated with Israel. God had not definitely broken with Jerusalem; the activities of the Spirit through the twelve apostles were there.
{492}
I have often thought that God did not leave Israel until they forced Him to leave them; it was a wonderful testimony to His patience. Nothing can exceed the patience of God in regard to Israel. He bore with Israel after they had put to death His precious Son, and after the testimony of the twelve was refused He sent Paul throughout the empire, and in every city that Paul visited he went to the "Jew first". Even when he went to Rome he sent for the Jews, not the brethren; and more than that, when the time came for God to bring in the gentile, and when He succeeded in securing the gentile for His pleasure, He invited the Jew to participate in His joy. He actually proposes to the Jew to participate in His holy joy in the returned prodigal. He appeals to the elder brother in @Luke 15. He says, "This thy brother" (@Luke 15:32), appealing to his affections, if there were any. The elder brother says, "This thy son was come" (@Luke 15:30), not, my brother. There was not the least sympathy with the Jew toward the gentile.
In @Acts 11 the spirit of the elder brother is fully manifest, even in those who were professed believers. They of the circumcision at Jerusalem contended with Peter, but the apostle justified himself by saying that it was *God* who acted. "What was I", he says, "that I could withstand God?", @Acts 11:17. As it was, Peter and the other apostles were tardy as to the admission of the gentiles, but God would have Peter act with Him. He would have the door opened, not simply to what was established in Jerusalem, but to what was established in heaven. What have I been admitted to as a gentile? Into what sphere does the door open? Why, it is into the whole heavenly system. The gentile was not simply admitted to what was established at Jerusalem; that was not a complete idea; it was connected with Jerusalem; what the gentile is admitted to is the heavenly system, but before the gentile was actually admitted
{493}
the four-cornered sheet had to come down from heaven.
I wish to dwell for a moment further upon the manner of God's dealings with Peter. He *would have* Peter. I think it ought to be a great point with every one who preaches the gospel as to whether it is a question of helping souls merely, or of being *with God*. Now God wishes to have every minister in sympathy with Him. He loves to work with us if we want to work with Him. Do you think God would have left Cornelius without light? Certainly not; but Peter was the appointed key-holder and Peter must go and admit Cornelius, and God operated in Peter so that he goes in full sympathy with Himself. One good mark about Peter is that he was praying. Even although he little understood the mind of heaven, at any rate he was in the position of a servant; he was praying. He went up to the house-top to pray. It is a very good place to go to. We read of the Lord being alone in prayer. The service of God requires power and that power is in God, and hence Peter to that extent was equal to his position; but that was not all. Peter was hungry. God had that advantage over Peter. God is the Creator and He reserves to Himself His rights in the creation. If He has so constituted us that we become hungry, He can use our hunger. It was well that Peter was hungry. If he had gone to sleep, he would not have seen such things. Peter fell into a trance while he was hungry, and God has His opportunity, and lets down the sheet. Cornelius was not there, nor his messengers. Peter was there; the sheet was for Peter; to educate Peter. It was to convey to Peter that the mind of heaven was not the mind of Jerusalem. He knew the mind of Jerusalem, but he was not acquainted with the *mind of heaven*. The gospel expresses the mind of heaven. There is no respect of persons there. One wonders whether the saints are
{494}
acquainted with the mind of heaven. It is common enough to hear what London thinks, what Berlin thinks, what Paris thinks, but what is the mind of heaven? Well, the wonderful thing that came to light is that the mind of heaven is in sympathy with the man upon the earth. It was as if God said to Peter, The gentiles are all mine. I have created the gentiles. He is the God of the gentiles as well as of the Jews. Well, Peter had not acknowledged that; that was new instruction to him; God would impress upon him what the mind of heaven was, so that if he opens the door to the gentiles, he opens it in suited dignity and grace. I love to think of entering the door opened by Peter; it is not only that he is the one chosen of Christ to open it, but he opens it in the full light of the mind of heaven.
What have we been admitted into? I take account of myself as taken up by God and introduced into a *heavenly* system. In @Acts 9 we learn that God's authority is no longer at Jerusalem; it is in the hands of Christ in heaven. Saul acknowledges Him *as Lord* there; and then he preaches Him in Damascus as God's Son. What I understand by the Son of God in that connection is that He will not take up anything that was established by another. He must be supreme. Hence the Son introduced a system altogether His own. He has His own kingdom, His own city, and His own house. Everything is formed and planned and carried out by the Son. In chapter 10 God shows that the mind of heaven is toward the gentiles. Peter opens the door to *all that*. I do not say that Peter understood the Son of God, but he opened the door for the gentile to enter into all that light. In being admitted into the divine, circle do we see the magnitude of it? It is a heavenly system. It is established and centred in Christ in heaven.
God has completely secured Peter, and Peter
{495}
goes on to Caesarea. Everything is so far perfectly arranged. Cornelius is also ready, God did that too, it was God's operation. We have little thought of the watchfulness, the vigilance of God, waiting for opportunities to operate for us. Now He had Peter, and Cornelius is ready, but not only that, Cornelius has a company ready. The gentiles are to be admitted as a company; it would not do for God to bring in only Cornelius; that would not represent the prodigal properly. One man could scarcely represent the gentile any more than one man could represent Israel. The Jews were brought in collectively, and so the Holy Spirit comes upon the gentiles collectively.
So far, as I said, the operations are perfect; God's apostle is now in Caesarea. He is going with a free heart, and he "opened his mouth". Cornelius is there and his relatives and friends. It gives us an excellent idea of a gospel meeting. A great thing in a gospel meeting is to get relatives and friends. One sees how Cornelius appreciated what God had to give. He know but little of it, but he knew something of God. He was accustomed to pray to God, and he knew that there was something worth hearing. He not only waited for Peter himself, but he had a company. A remarkable gospel meeting that! And who arranged it? It is a most remarkable instance of God arranging things for the furtherance of His ends. The company was there, and Peter goes and preaches to them. God had qualified him. Do you think Peter could have spoken to these gentiles with such freedom if he had not seen the sheet let down from heaven? Could he have spoken to them with such power if he had not been with God In His service? God intended that the message should come to the gentiles in a sympathetic vessel. Peter opens by explaining what God had shown him. It is remarkable how he understood the vision, he
{496}
understood what God meant by the sheet; he knew by it, that he was to call nobody common or unclean; he understood that God was now operating in a universal way, and that He was about to bring in the gentiles and give them part in His heavenly system; and Peter opens his mouth.
It is a wonderful thing to see a mouth opened by the Spirit. I never think of preaching without referring to the Lord, as seen in @Luke 4. There Luke depicts for us the first gospel scene in which Christ figured. The attendant in the synagogue hands Him the roll of the prophet Isaiah, and He stands up to read. All that was done in evangelical dignity. He reads only what is evangelical, and He says, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears" (@Luke 4:21), and He sat down. We are told that the eyes of all those who were in the synagogue were fastened upon Him. There is the Preacher, and His manner, His reading and His speaking are altogether lovely; they are altogether in accord with the message. There was no disparity between the message and the Preacher. We are told that they marvelled at the words of grace that proceeded from His mouth. Peter opened his mouth, and communicates to the gentiles what God had done. The point in this passage is that *God* had been operating. Peter says, "The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ". Peter gathers up the ministry of Christ and gives us a synopsis of it, and the point of his remarks is this, that God was doing things. God had sent Jesus, He had anointed Him, and Jesus went about doing good, for *God was with Him*.
Peter delivers his message, and God now does something. You must distinguish between God's sovereign operations in your soul before the gospel is presented and the gospel itself. The preacher does not effect any work in your soul. Peter could effect nothing in Cornelius¬ soul; all he could do
{497}
was to open his mouth, and in opening his mouth he communicated the gospel. Now God comes in. God is not content with enlightening the gentiles. He *embraces* them. I refer to the gift of the Spirit. It was taking the gentiles as it were, into God's holy embrace. He embraced the prodigal. Have you ever felt the divine embrace? Nothing more is to be said after that. Supposing God gives the Spirit to a black man? There is nothing more to be said. After He gives His Spirit to a man we must bow to God. God is no respecter of persons. We are His offspring, says Paul. He has made of one blood all the nations of the earth. Why should I make a distinction? God is making none. The sheet contained all kinds of animals. If God gives His Spirit to a man, God has honoured that man; you cannot conceive a greater honour than that God should actually give His Spirit to a man, and that man is suited for God now. He is no longer an alien; he has the Holy Spirit of God. Such persons are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens. That is what the gentile is, because God has given him the Spirit. Cornelius and his company did not say anything; the fact is, they had no opportunity, because Peter was speaking. There was no after meeting. No opportunity to make confession; but then there is no need of that if God is acting and looking on. God knows what is going on in your heart. He knew perfectly what was in these gentiles. He would not have given His Spirit if He had not. The gentiles were morally cleansed and He knew it, otherwise He would not have given them the Holy Spirit.
Now what one notices is that if the elder brother had been there, there would have been an objection. But, thank God, he did not go down with Peter. It is a very inapt thing to take people along in the service of the gospel who are not sympathetic. Peter went out from a very wonderful atmosphere,
{498}
the atmosphere of heaven, and he was accompanied by people who were sympathetic. They did not complain, although they were astonished at the gift of the Spirit coming on the gentiles. It is a great thing to be in sympathy with God. And so Peter says, as it were, 'I can say nothing, all I can do is to administer to the gentile the right of baptism'. He had preached, and God had done something. That is what I want you to get hold of. God has given His Son for us, and He gives His Spirit to us. There is no gift greater than the Spirit. There was nothing left for Peter, but to baptise them. He commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord. Baptism does not introduce us into the house, the Spirit introduces us into the house. Before they were officially acknowledged as in the kingdom, God had put them in the house. What I see in it is this, that God is so desirous of having them that there was no waiting. While Peter was speaking the Holy Spirit fell upon the gentiles.
If you have listened to the word of God and your heart is touched, *God knows it;* do you not think that God is looking into your heart? There is no creature that is not manifest in His sight; not a creature. He is looking into your heart. You need not tell Him anything. If you want salvation, you must confess Christ *as Lord*. You have to raise the standard of Christ in the region of the enemy, but God knows what is in your heart. I often think of the prodigal when he was returning; God saw him first, when he was a great way off; it refers to the state of the soul. "When he came to himself" (@Luke 15:17); that also refers to the state of the soul. God is the first to take notice of it, and then *He moves*. God moves toward us. He ran to meet the prodigal, and embraced him, and put him into His house. God moved out to these gentiles, and then He gave them the Spirit. He ran to meet them, and embraced
{499}
them, and put them into His house without a question; and Peter formally and publicly admits them as to their having title to all that Christ is. That is the position in which we stand. What I have indicated is the great position and blessing accorded to all who believe the gospel now. The ground is laid for Paul's ministry. Directly Christ has gained Paul the door must be opened for him, and hence the ground is laid in this chapter for the ministry of the apostle of the gentiles.
May the Lord grant that we may know what God's operations are, and to count upon them. He has not ceased to operate; and may each unsaved one believe God's testimony as to Christ, and so come into His favour, and enjoy the great privileges and blessings of the heavenly system, for His name's sake.
{500}
THE POWER OF GOD
@Hebrews 11:8 - 31
Two great thoughts stand related to Abraham; the sovereignty of God, and the power of God, and those who followed after acted in the light of the revelation that God made to Abraham, that He was the Almighty God, @Genesis 17:1.
The power of God is seen in two connections as regards the faith of the saints. First, in Joseph, who gave commandment concerning his bones. He was in the light of the power of God, and he had faith as to the resurrection of the saints. Then in Moses we see the power of God in its adaptability to the present time; the deliverance of the people of God out of the world system and their maintenance in the presence of it.
God had His glory in view at the outset; the "God of glory" appeared to our father Abraham, @Acts 7:2. In order to secure His glory God had to act on the principle of sovereignty, for the testimony committed to Noah had proved a failure in the sense that Noah did not walk in the light of it. The testimony of Scripture is that the posterity of Noah served idols, so that God was forced to exercise His sovereignty; and then, in order to carry out His designs, His power must be brought in. Hence in making Himself known to Abraham as the Almighty He connected with that the principle of circumcision, signifying that the flesh profiteth nothing and that if He was to carry out His designs it must be entirely apart from the flesh. The thought of the sovereignty of God gives God His true place in the soul, and puts the so-called rights of man out of court at once. It is a principle that man after the flesh always rebels against.
{501}
The prophet Isaiah develops the truth of sovereignty in a remarkable way. He shows in chapters 13 to 24 how God takes account of all that is objectionable. "The Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth", @Isaiah 24:21. Then, in chapter 25, he brings in the fact that God will do certain things in a certain place, in Mount Zion; signifying that He will act just where He will and how He pleases.
Abraham endeavoured to accomplish his designs through the flesh, but God having presented Himself as the Almighty God, not only was Isaac born of Sarah, but raised from the dead. It is a wonderful thing to be shut up to the power of God. Christians do not make progress till they recognise it. There might be a certain development as in Abraham's case, and a certain product as Ishmael, but it is not that which God would have. "Cast out the bondwoman and her son" (@Galatians 4:30), is the word; we have to come to that. Abraham had the very best desires and intentions when he said, "O that Ishmael might live before thee!", @Genesis 17:18. But Isaac was God's thought.
The power of God really places you in heaven. First of all God says, "I have borne you on eagles¬ wings" (@Exodus 19:4); that is, He was true to His word, He was Almighty. The other side is, "they that wait upon the Lord ... shall mount up with wings as eagles", @Isaiah 40:31. There is no limit if you recognise the power of the Spirit. It is a figure of the soul entering consciously into the sphere of divine purpose, and that is reached when you come to Rahab.
"By faith they passed through the Red sea"; that is the Israelites¬ faith; it was their doing. Then "by faith the walls of Jericho fell"; that is the overthrow of satanic power in the sphere of divine purpose. The next thing we read is, "By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
{502}
not, when she had received the spies with peace", and if you examine what she says in the book of Joshua you will find she recognised two things: firstly, what God did at the Red Sea, and secondly, what the people did to Og, king of Bashan, after they had, in figure, received the Spirit. It speaks of God's power in the resurrection of Christ, and God's power in the saints. The power of God is displayed in the resurrection of Christ. The counterpart of that is the establishment of the truth in the world as a testimony; that took place in the ministry of the twelve. The book of Joshua typically sets forth the result of the ministry of the apostles, which was marked by the power of God. It was no mere set of doctrines, but a system established and demonstrated to be in power.
What we are deficient in is the recognition of the Spirit. In christianity the Spirit is the answer to what God said to Abraham. If the flesh is disallowed there must be another power, and that other power must be the Holy Spirit. Hence, "*we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh", @Philippians 3:3.
The apostle's desire for the saints was that their faith "should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God", @1 Corinthians 2:5. The ministry of the apostles was so marked by outward human weakness, that if souls believed their testimony they would be resting in the power of God.
It is a very great question to ask oneself, What does one really believe? God has acted not in a limited way, but in the exercise of His almighty power. He has come out in the exceeding greatness of His power and raised Christ from the dead, and I believe that all that power is for me. As a consequence I would desire to prove its reality, and if
{503}
I do so, I would have no confidence in the flesh. The power is to lead us into correspondence with the light that we have. It is the apostle's desire that we should know that power. He prays for it; that we might know the hope of God's calling, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and "what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead", @Ephesians 1:19,20. It is a great object, and the legitimate result is that the soul is placed in correspondence with Christ where He is. That is the thought of God. I do not say, that any one of us is fully equal to the light he has, but if he is honest he desires to be so, and God will support him. If we are content to go on out of correspondence with the light our consciences cannot be good, and there cannot be any great happiness.
Joshua did not come to the front to take the lead until Moses was dead. You do not get the good of the leading of the Spirit until you are past the brazen serpent and are no longer under law. At that juncture Joshua took the lead and he led them straight into the purpose of God.
We observed at the beginning that Joseph's faith has reference to the power of God raising the saints. That is to say, he was in the light of what had been communicated to Abraham, that God was the Almighty God, and he was in the light of the fact that Isaac had been raised from the dead in figure. Now he spoke when he was dying of the departing of the children of Israel out of Egypt. He gave no commandment in regard of the people, but he did give commandment concerning his bones. That is the best evidence we can have as to the light of the resurrection of the saints, that when the saints should go forth his bones should go. He made mention of the departing of the children of Israel, but
{504}
he had nothing to do with giving command. That was connected with Moses¬ ministry. Hence Joseph only alluded to it. He had light that God would bring it about and he gave commandment concerning his bones. "If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, (that is what Joseph believed in principle in connection with Isaac) even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him", @1 Thessalonians 4:14. It is a very great thing to have faith of that kind. We all say, When the Lord comes. It has become public property in Christendom, but on what is your faith based? The apostle puts it: "If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him". Now look at Joseph. It says, he was put in a coffin. Egypt was a remarkable country for burials, and yet you do not get a record of the burial of Joseph; he did not have a grave. The actual word is that he was put into an "ark" in Egypt, all indicating that it was to be moveable. The faith of the soul is that what has taken place in Christ will also take place in the saints. And Joseph saw that he was not going to be left out; he was going to be with them when the time came. We do not prevent the dead ones, the saints all go together. The faith of Joseph ought to be the faith of every believer.
When you come to Moses you have the present time; the soul is delivered from evil and maintained in power in the presence of it. God begins, and He says to Moses, "What is that in thine hand?", @Exodus 4:2. He had a rod in his hand. That was of God, it was divine authority, but that rod became a serpent; that is to say, authority became allied with evil; but God's thought is that it should be allied with good. Moses fled from before the serpent. That is what has happened in the government of God with man in connection with the principle of authority. God says, "Take it by the tail", @Exodus 4:4. Moses did so, and
{505}
it became a rod in his hand again. Authority is restored in the hands of a Man, in the hands of Christ. Hence we have the kingdom of God. The Lord said, "If *I* by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you", @Matthew 12:28. Authority is allied with good, and it results in the deliverance of man, and his protection in the presence of evil. Moses represents the kingdom in the sense that it delivers from the world and maintains us free and in power in the presence of it.
There is no need for any kind of discouragement, because the power of God goes on. It is the same as it ever was. God loves to be as good as His word. He has great pleasure in that. In speaking to Moses that was His point; He was as good as His word spoken to Abraham. God will show at the end a testimony to His power to maintain His people for Christ in spite of the failure. The power comes in in support of the light. If you get a bit of light you are to move, and the next move that you make proves whether you are acting up to it or not.
These evidences of faith are to show that these men acted up to the light that was given to them. If you act upon the light you have, you may not realise the power when you are about to act, but the point is to act, and then you will find the power supporting you. You will also get more light.
There is another thing; these men included in their faith all that preceded in the way of light; it was a kind of accumulative faith. For instance, Joseph in his faith assumed the light that was communicated when he spoke concerning his bones. Rahab also acted upon the light that preceded. It would even go back to Abel's faith.
If you wait till you have the power to act you will not act at all. Act, and you will get the power.

If the light that is in your soul indicates or requires a movement, if you are to keep a good conscience, you must move. Cease to do evil, act on the faith you have, and then you will learn to do well. A person in system who has the light of separation, must move (cease to do evil), and act up to the light he has; then he will get support and learn to do well.
