THE LOVE OF THE CHRIST
@Galatians 2:20; @2 Corinthians 5:14 - 16
My purpose is to speak about the love of Christ. The subject is such as to draw out our feelings, for it is said, "The Father loves the Son", @John 3:35. At the Jordan the Father took occasion to speak about Him: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", @Matthew 3:17. On the mount He added, "Hear him", @Matthew 17:5.
First, I wish to speak of the Lord's love for Paul. Paul is distinguished in many ways, but particularly in this that he says of the Son of God, "Who has loved me and given himself for me", @Galatians 2:20. I do not recall that anyone else has said just those words. John says, in speaking of himself, that he was the disciple whom Jesus loved, but Paul says, "Who has loved me and given himself for me". But I desire to make a few remarks as to the context in which this remark occurs. The first and second chapters of this epistle to the Galatians are particularly in mind. Now, in saying this about himself, Paul works up to it, as if the thought grew in his mind as he reviewed events. In this epistle, the apostle is seen in relation to certain persons and circumstances which gave rise to certain thoughts about persons, some of whom were conspicuous. But in speaking of their conspicuousness he also brings in what *he* was; what marked him in those circumstances, and he gives some of the facts of his conversion. Now, in having to do with persons who are conspicuous we may be challenged as to the state of our minds. Naturally, we would be disposed to be conspicuous if there was any good reason for it. He had to do with the greatest persons on earth and the greatest in the mind of heaven. He recounts what happened at a certain time in Jerusalem and mentions
{2}
certain facts. Paul was there, and Barnabas, and Peter, and James, and John and others. Paul himself speaks of what his feelings were, but he is going to tell us, later, that Christ loved him. He is going to tell us that as he proceeds with this letter. He says, "The Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me".
Now, as having it in mind to say that, he touches on the reasons for saying it. This is not just anybody saying this. It is Paul! And in working up to this statement he has in mind that, when he says it, it will be obvious that he was loved by the Son of God. So that the mind is taken to the scene at Jerusalem where the greatest personnel in the universe were. There were others, too, who came in surreptitiously to spy out the apostle's liberty. But these would be ministers of the devil. But there were Peter and James and John who were conspicuous as being pillars. When Paul was younger, fourteen or more years before the events we have been speaking about, he went to Arabia. He had been converted, and he says, "I went to Arabia", @Galatians 1:17. Well, why did he go there? I am speaking now as to how persons who are loved of the Lord can give reasons for what they do. We may be ready to say that we are loved of the Lord, but I am just a little afraid of persons being too ready to say these things, especially if we are quoting Paul. I would challenge our hearts as to this. But why did he go to Arabia? Maybe he went there to deny the flesh. No doubt he did. But what bearing did that have on Christ's love for him? The opposite would be found in one that was not spiritual. Such a one may go to Jerusalem to see what was there. But Paul did not do that. He went to Arabia. The Lord watched him on that journey. It was a long way. The Lord watched his footsteps; doubtless he was a lone man. He had not gone to Damascus a lone man; he was a man of importance; he was a great representative of the priesthood
{3}
in Jerusalem in opposition to Christ. And he had company. But then he "went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus", @Galatians 1:17. Then after three years he went up to Jerusalem. We may have thought that he was going up to see the prominent brethren, to see the large meetings in Jerusalem. The leading men were there. But he did not go for that. He did not see any of them except Peter and James. He says that he "saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother of the Lord", @Galatians 1:19. He did not go there to become acquainted with the great brethren and with the big meetings. Yet, that is just what we may be inclined to do as we have opportunity, but I would challenge our hearts as to it. Paul did not go to Jerusalem to get to big tea meetings or social affairs. This may be current among the brethren. Afternoon and evening teas may become quite social with very little about Christ in them. But Paul went up to Jerusalem to see Peter. We may like to do that too, and to see all the other great personages there. But Paul went up to see Peter, and not only to see him, but to *make acquaintance* with him. The young brethren need to make the acquaintance of the elder brethren; not simply to be able to say, I have seen Peter -- and James -- and John, but to make acquaintance that will advance you *spiritually*. Well, that is what Paul did. He was at Jerusalem for fifteen days, which would mean, very likely, that he spent two Lord's days with Peter, or, possibly, three.
Well now, in the second chapter, he says that there were those who were conspicuous. How we do love to be something! But the apostle says, "If I ... have not love, I am nothing", @1 Corinthians 13:2. We need to take that home. If we have not love we are nothing! But there were those who were conspicuous, of whom Paul says, They communicated nothing to me. But nevertheless they were something. Peter and John had said earlier, "Look on us", @Acts 3:4. They had something. "What I have, this give I to thee". They had love. They told the
{4}
lame man at the Beautiful gate of the temple to look at them. But now Peter and James and John are said to be pillars, and Paul says that they "gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship", @Galatians 2:9. What a beautiful picture; Peter and Paul and James and John and Barnabas -- these great men in the testimony, shaking hands together! They loved each other in the testimony.
Well now, after these things, which I have mentioned briefly, Paul tells us that when Peter came to Antioch, he withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned. Now that is a very important feature of a person whom Christ loves, and that is what I am leading up to: a person whom Christ loves -- as to how he is worth loving. What a change had taken place! Here is Peter, the elder brother whom Paul had gone up to Jerusalem to see, and with whom he had spent fifteen delightful days. How much Peter could say to Paul, and how much Paul would value what his elder brother said to him! But now there is a change. We are *all* liable to change, even the most spiritual of us. Peter had become affected by party feeling. And not one of us is exempt from that. When some came from James, Peter withdrew and would not eat with the gentiles. But what is this man, whom Christ loved, going to do about Peter? Paul says, "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned", @Galatians 2:11. What he did shows why Christ loved him. If I say that Christ loved me, I want to show that there is some reason beyond the fact that I am a believer. Paul is telling us what he had done, and one of the important events was, that when Peter acted on party lines, and was not faithful to the truth, Paul withstood him to the face, and spoke to him about it before all.
Well, that is the point I am making, dear brethren; that if we make much of the fact that the Lord loves us, and there is little reason to be seen, we are liable to be challenged and *should* be challenged. Before
{5}
Paul says that the Son of God loved him, he tells us these things which show that he was worthy of being loved. I have often said that the Lord has the right to make selection. God has the right to set His love upon a person in a special way, but if He does, there is usually some good reason for it. See how He speaks about Moses. Persons traduced Moses; his own brother and sister, Aaron and Miriam, spoke evil of him, but God stood in the breach. He said, "Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?", @Numbers 12:8. If God sets His heart on a man He will show that it is deserved. So it is here; Paul is about to say that the Son of God loved him and had given Himself for him. And is it not justified in every respect? What a place Paul will have in heaven! "Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing", @2 Timothy 4:8. One of the best reasons for advancing that the Lord loves me is that I love His appearing. What a day it will be for all lovers of Christ! I should not like to be among the non-lovers of Christ when He appears.
Well now, Paul says, "Who has loved me and given himself for me". He carried that in his heart. In all the circumstances at Jerusalem he had carried in his heart that Christ loved him. But then, what portion did Christ have in what happened at Jerusalem? I believe that every movement of that servant was pleasurable to Him. I am sure of that. It was a long experience, and great conflict for the truth entered into it, but during every moment of it the Lord's eye rested on His servant. We have to remember that this was an inspired letter; the Spirit of God was in the matter and caused Paul to write these words. And the Spirit of God would have pleasure in him; so that, after all these events and all his faithfulness, which is recorded, He causes him to write: "But in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me".
{6}
That was Paul's life, and, I might say, Christ's life entered into it. That is exactly what is meant. That was his wilderness life; it was his life in flesh, not yet life in heaven. All these events that I have spoken about refer to wilderness circumstances, and in these circumstances Christ was his life. "When the Christ is manifested who is our life ..." @Colossians 3:4. Christ was his life; Christ was everything to him. It mattered little what others thought of him. "Whatsoever they were", he says, "it makes no difference to me", @Galatians 2:6. *He* was dead, in the sense of which I have been speaking. He was "crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me".
Well, I trust that each of us will be affected by what has been said and will challenge ourselves if there is any good cause why Christ should love us. Do we provide any such cause as Paul gives? any history like his? What part has my history with Christ's life? The history of the assembly enters into Christ's life; He lives for her, but then she is His joy, the pearl of great price. Paul wrote the epistle to the Galatians with his own hand, but the Spirit of God guided his hand to put down indelibly that the Son of God loved Paul and gave Himself for Paul. It was not that He loved Paul just as he was writing. Paul was relating history -- that when Christ died He had Paul in His heart; He died for Paul. I do not know of anybody else whose hand was guided by the Spirit of God to say that Christ loved him when He died. What an honour! And surely we may aim to be somewhat like him and give a reason why Christ loves us. We may say that we are lovers of Christ, but then, He is a Lover of us. That is just the point I make, and He wants to *say* that He is a Lover of us. But when He comes to some of us, how much can He say as to the reason for His love for us? Of course, there is the general thought that He loved the assembly, and gave Himself
{7}
for it, but I am speaking now of what is *par excellence*. John speaks of "the disciple whom Jesus loved". We have to find out who that was, but not so with Paul. Paul says, He *loved me*. All these years since He died He has had me in His heart; He gave Himself for me there, and He is the same now as He was then. I am sure Paul could say that as advancing in the knowledge of his Saviour.
Well now, I just go on to @2 Corinthians 5:13 where the apostle says, "For whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God; or are sober, it is for you. For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised". I am now going to speak about the influence of Christ's love and how it leads up to a right judgment because I find in myself, as I do in the brethren, that we are very poor in our judgment, both of persons and of things. This passage is to teach us something of judgment. He says, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died". That is judgment, and it hangs, really, on the fact of Christ's love for him. He had acquired experience of the love of Christ and it influenced him in the way of judgment: "having judged this that one died for all, then all have died". And again, "He died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised". I wish to enlarge on the importance of forming a judgment of persons and things. The Corinthians were very poor in their judgment. Some of the leaders there spoke very disparagingly of Paul. They said that his speech was contemptible. They spoke ill of each other. There were partisans among them. They had their friends, and non-friends. It was a humbling situation but it is written down, beloved, that we should not be marked by these things.
{8}
The apostle says, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died". Now, that is how we judge. If it were possible for Paul to stand up with the hundreds of millions of men and women on the earth before him, he would take account of them as dead. They may be scholars, orators, great statesmen, great soldiers, and what not. They are all dead. I speak now of those that are not christians. Of believers, he says, "That they who live ..." But what about those great men who have fought and judged nations, who are ruling countries? Is it right to say that they are living to Christ? "That they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised". Is it right? Can they be said to be living to Christ? It is not so. I am leaving out true christians for the moment. But take the millions of people who are not believers -- Paul has judged "that one died for all, then all have died". It would take time to give some idea of the meaning of this. I only mention the scripture itself for us to look into it and face the fact as to what is on the earth and how God looks at it. Men are dying every day, but morally it is all done. One died for all, then all have died. But then we are to see what modifications there are. It says, "that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised". The others are all dead; but anybody that lives, is not to live to himself, not to be selfish, but to live to Him who died for us and rose again. The Lord Jesus has died for us and has risen again for us. He is glorious! He is triumphant! He is in heaven! He is received there! He is everything there! Well, what about my life from now on? What is it to be? Living to Christ? That is the only thing. Morally, we should not live at all if we are not living to Him who died for us and rose again. It is a matter of only a few years and our lives here will all be over. We may as well look it in the
{9}
face; and the summation of it all is "that they who live" are to live to Christ. It is a great victory that the Lord has secured so many who live to Him. Others are dead. How thankful we should be, dear brethren, as we come together in these gatherings, that we belong to the living. Abigail said to David, "The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living", @1 Samuel 25:29. I ask each one here tonight, Are you in the bundle of the living? What are you living for? "That they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised".
May God grant us to be stirred up by these things.

THE ASSEMBLY AS DIVINELY USABLE
@Hebrews 2:12; @Revelation 22:16,17
Other scriptures are in mind but these two will suffice to introduce the subject that is to be presented. They refer to the assembly, as divinely usable -- usable in a peculiar way, as no other family of God can be used.
The first passage is quoted from @Psalm 22:22, which reads: "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee", @Psalm 22:22. The word 'congregation' is changed to the word 'assembly' in the passage in Hebrews. This fact shows how things, persons, systems, generations and families were utilised by God in earlier days to work out his thoughts, first in a tentative and imperfect way. But finally, as the time of perfection arrived, that is, the time of sonship, all is to be treated of and regarded in the light of what is perfect. We are living in the time of perfection. The time of imperfection was the time of law, but we are living in the time of perfection. We read, "When that which is perfect has come, that which is in part shall be done away", @1 Corinthians 13:10. We are in that time; it is a time in which we can speak of things as existing, not as things that should exist. Christianity exists; the assembly exists; the Holy Spirit has come; the Son has come; the Father has been made known; so that we are in the time of the existence of things that are of God. We are not waiting for them, they have come.
In speaking of the assembly, I would say of it immediately that it is the nearest of all families, or all systems, to the Deity, to God. Others are *relatively* near; there are to be many families in heaven and on earth which all will be named of the Father. He has pleasure in naming them, but above all He has pleasure in the assembly. He kept it in His mind without
{11}
saying anything of it to men, directly, for many centuries, "but when the fulness of time was come" @Galatians 4:4 the assembly began to be spoken of; in fact, it began to be revealed. Not that all came out at once, for it did not, but at the same time we read, "The Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved", @Acts 2:47. Now the word 'assembly' is not in the original. The *word* is not there, but the *thing* is there, and so "the Lord added ... daily those that were to be saved". It is obvious that He added to the great thing that was there; that is to say, what was being formed and was formed then by the Spirit of God. The assembly was there. People were being added, three thousand indeed being added on that day; and they were added to something; not added to judaism, but to the great something that had been in the divine mind, the assembly. And that is being added to all the time up to the present minute. The Lord is doing it; the Holy Spirit is doing it; and I may add, the assembly itself is doing it, for it has the means of adding.
Now the thing added to had already been spoken of prophetically in @Psalm 22. The Lord Himself, in that solemn hour on the cross, was in mind as the Speaker. The Spirit of Christ in the psalmist wrote: "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee", @Psalm 22:22. He used the word 'congregation', which is not as great a word as 'assembly'. God was leading up to the greatest thing, and that is the assembly. God was leading up to that, but the word 'congregation' is used in @Psalm 22. The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews changed the word to 'assembly'. Undoubtedly it was Paul. He was a living part of the assembly himself; in fact, he was the minister of it. No one knew more about it than he; he was minister of it, rightly so according to the place divinely given to him in the service of God. And he, under the hand of the Spirit, changed the word from 'congregation' to 'assembly' to bring it up to date, so to speak. We all need to be up
{12}
to date, not living in the past, but in today, as it says, "To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation", @Hebrews 3:15. God speaks, and is carrying on His work today; He is making much of the assembly today. Were we all to be translated to heaven today, we should find the assembly a great thing there. We should not look on it objectively, we should see that it is a great matter and that we belong to it; we are of it. It is not being used in heaven yet, but it is being used on earth. Our part should be to make it more usable and more useful. And if it is to be as useful as heaven would have it, then it sings; it is the place of singing. It has the exceptional place; the privileged and most distinguished place, because it is the thing in which the Lord Jesus Himself is acting in the highest way, namely, in a musical sense. He is acting musically in the assembly, and we all want to be in that, because we belong to the assembly. As David says, "With the instruments which I made ... to praise therewith", @1 Chronicles 23:5. He is a type of Christ there. We were all made for music for the Lord's use, and therefore we want to be sure we are of the assembly.
The writer to the Hebrews was of the assembly. He knew more about it than any other; in fact, he writes to the Ephesians, "By revelation the mystery has been made known to me, (according as I have written before briefly, by which, in reading it, ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ,)" @Ephesians 3:3,4. He had in his mind that he had more knowledge than others and he would love to impart it to the Ephesians; at any rate, he was concerned that they should know that he had it. This is a great matter. Paul is now with the Lord. There is a distinction between being with the Lord, and going to heaven. The departed saints are never said to be in heaven. They will be, but they now are with the Lord, as Paul said, "Having the desire for departure and being with Christ, for it is very much better", @Philippians 1:23.
{13}
Although he knew that he was not going just then, the time would come and he was ready to go. He had a desire to go, but he was thinking of the saints. He was being used by God to complete them, and he had it in his mind that they needed him, and so he elected to stay, and the Lord left him here. He said that he was "pressed by both, having the desire for departure and being with Christ, ... but remaining in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes", @Philippians 1:23,24. He elected to be with the saints. How long he remained, I cannot say; we are not told how old he was when he was martyred, but at any rate, he elected to stay for the sake of the Philippians, and in principle, by way of extension, it would be for the whole assembly. He would, in staying here below to serve the Lord, not only serve the Philippians but all the saints: "I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly", @Colossians 1:24. He had that in mind, nothing else than the assembly -- not simply one group at Philippi or at Corinth -- but to "fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly". And he would mean, in saying that, that the saints should not be behind; they should be what God intended them to be; they should be a vessel for His praise.
So this verse which I have read, says, "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", @Hebrews 2:12. As I said before, he uses the word 'assembly'. The word is properly 'assembly', and the assembly is for God's praise. It is the time of praise, and the vessel of praise is the assembly, and the songs keep going on all the time. Were we to go into heaven, we should find the song proceeding, like the continual burnt-offering. And so it is, the song of God proceeds constantly, and we want to be in that song; we want to be in the choir, as it were.
{14}
Now I want to refer to @Genesis 2. Chapter 1 is a record of the creation, and chapter 2 speaks of the generations of the heavens and the earth. The word 'generation' is used in that connection to show how important the creation is in the mind of God. Then we have Man. He is viewed as created in chapter 1, but in chapter 2 he is seen as formed. We are told he was formed, dust of the ground. He is not very peculiarly distinguished by the use of such material. He was made, you may say, in his entirety without breath. Chapter 2 is a wonderful chapter in the sense that God is saying, as it were, I have gone over things creatively but now I want to go over them a second time, so that they may be understood. And so first we have the reference to the seventh day, in which God rested, and then the histories or generations of the heavens and the earth. Then we are told about Man, how he was formed, because "there was no man to till the ground", @Genesis 2:5. And God formed him, in all his parts, but there was no breath, and hence no movement, nothing really to cause pleasure to God. Life affords pleasure to God in the grass, in the trees, in the vegetables, but in man it is life in its supreme place, and so he is said to be formed and then God breathes into him. In Ezekiel we have a like position in the valley of dry bones. The bones first came together and then flesh came up, sinews, and the skin. And God said to the prophet, "Prophesy unto the wind". And he prophesied to them and life came into them. "The breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army", @Ezekiel 37:9. That great army is said to be the "whole house of Israel" -- not part of it. Are the Jews included? Certainly. It is the whole house of Israel, but it is not so great as what I am speaking of. I am speaking of the assembly, which is a greater thought.
Well, I have spoken about Adam, who, in a sense is God's great thought because he is a type of Christ;
{15}
but he is also the representation of the entirety of the persons who are to form the assembly. He is made to live with the breath of life, the breath of God. God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life", @Genesis 2:7. Then it is said that Adam "found no helpmate, his like", @Genesis 2:20. There was not his like in the whole creation, no one just like him -- femininely. So it is that God said, "I will make him a helpmate, his like", @Genesis 2:18. Now I am speaking thus, dear brethren, to show how God, at this very early date, had the assembly in His mind. And it is in His mind yet, and will be in His mind eternally. It is the greatest thought of the Creator's mind in relation to His creation. Hence it is said in this remarkable chapter that He put Adam to sleep. He had breathed into his nostrils the breath of life but now He puts him to sleep. It is the first time we get that thought; he is put into a deep sleep, which would imply that he was not conscious. He was not conscious of what was being done, but God was doing something. A new word is brought in; the word 'built'; it was never applied to Adam, but it is applied to the woman. She is not, as it were, an independent creature by herself. Adam was asleep; he never saw the woman as a rib, nor did she ever see herself as a rib. I am not seeking simply to occupy or entertain you, but I am endeavouring to convey facts and truth. And so it was that God was doing something of supreme interest, not only to Himself, but to heaven, and something that ever will be of supreme interest to men and to women. So that it is said that "he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead", @Genesis 2:21. That is to say, there is no void, there is nothing wanting in Adam after the rib is taken out; the flesh is closed up instead. And there is no wound or mark to indicate any defect in him. He is a whole man; he is going to be a husband; and so it is said, "Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man. And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man", @Genesis 2:22,23.
{16}
So we see what had been done, and how the Creator was occupied with something other than creation -- He was building.
Now I want you just to carry that word 'build' in your minds into what I am about to say as to the verses I have read in Hebrews and in Revelation. The book of Revelation takes account of the assembly, in a peculiar way in the use of the word 'bride'. John, in speaking of the assembly, uses that word, and he uses it in the sense that she is "as a bride adorned for her husband", in @Revelation 21:2, and, "I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife", in verse 9. @Revelation 21:9. She is thus shown to John. He says, first of all, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth ... and I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", @Revelation 21:1,2. That is, she has done something. Eve had been prepared for Adam. God had performed a remarkable piece of work without Adam's knowledge. He had taken out a rib and had closed up the flesh, as if He were to say, You are not to know what came out of there; it is going to be mystery. Presently it is to be disclosed. Something had happened, but God would say, You are to wait for the time of the revelation of the mystery. We are in the time of mystery; it marks our dispensation; and those of us who are in the dispensation, characteristically, are initiated into the mystery; the mystery of the kingdom of God, and the mysteries of God. This rib taken out of Adam, and the flesh closed up where it had been, is one of them. Much is said about Eve, but that mystery remains untold. Now it is disclosed, and the book of Revelation contemplates it. John the evangelist says, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth ... . And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", @Revelation 21:1,2.
{17}
He saw that; he saw her adorned, and I want to say, dear brethren, that the present is the time of adornment, the time of doing things. God is doing things, but the adorning is our part. Not that God does not adorn, too. The Lord puts His beauty upon us; but at the same time, there is such a thing as the bride adorning herself for her husband. It is a time of seeing that, and understanding that we are going to have part in that.
Now I wish to show that the bride has the first place with God; I will say, with Deity, to make the thing plainer. The title "God" may be used in a final way, but when we speak of 'Deity' we use another word, we are speaking of what is to be reverenced, and to which we bow. We are to bow to God, but we are to worship when we use the word 'Deity'. It is a special thought which is particularly available to the minds of those of the assembly. The assembly is capable of taking in more of it than any other family. And so it is that the Lord says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely", @Revelation 22:17. Now, this is after the Lord Jesus had said, "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", @Revelation 22:16. The Lord is speaking in a personal way to us; He is speaking in the assemblies; He is not speaking abroad to the world; He is speaking in the assemblies, in a personal way to us. He says, "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", @Revelation 22:16. And then He says something about Himself. He is saying it in the assemblies, not anywhere or to anybody, but to the assemblies. And He speaks about Himself: "*I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star", @Revelation 22:17.
I have already spoken about music, as to where it goes on; it is in the assembly. And now I am speaking of what the Lord is saying about Himself in the assembly. He is speaking in a confidential way; we
{18}
are His confidants; we are those in whom the Lord has confidence. He is saying, I have something personal in My mind. I have brought you here today for a purpose -- to say something to you about Myself. The question is whether we are listening and taking it in. He is saying, "*I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star", @Revelation 22:16. That is one of the greatest statements, perhaps, that we can think of from the Lord. There are other great statements, of course, but this is one of the greatest; it is a matter of *what* He says and *where* He is saying it. And what He says is, "*I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star", @Revelation 22:16.
Well now, I come to the immediate thing I had in mind -- what the Spirit and the bride say. It is what is being said in response. It is a great way with God to say certain things and then look for response. There is very little response today, I am sure. At the same time, christianity is a current matter and some are speaking and responding to what God has said, and the response here is in two beings, speaking reverently. The first is the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself. When I speak thus, I am seeking to be reverential, to be very careful to say nothing that would discredit the Holy Persons of the Deity, but it is within our range to have to say to what God is saying, because the Holy Spirit is saying, "Come" to Jesus. The word 'come' perhaps was never employed in a more effective way than here. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come", @Revelation 22:179. It is spoken in a united way. The first speaker is God Himself and the second speaker, whose utterance is in perfect unison, is the bride of Christ.
So we can see what a place the assembly has. There is no other family, system, society, group of beings or persons who have the place and privilege that the assembly has, and we belong to the assembly. We are privileged to be united in this matter, in saying to the Lord Jesus, "Come", in conjunction with the
{19}
Holy Spirit. I bring this forward as a clear proof that the assembly has the nearest place to Deity. She has the nearest place in that one of the divine Persons sings in it to God; "In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee". We have already seen that the writer to the Hebrews changed the word 'congregation' to 'assembly'. But there is something else. For the word 'sing', he uses the word 'hymn', which we do not get in the Psalms. Psalms are distinguished from hymns in Ephesians. Hymns refer to vehicles of praise, peculiarly, and so the Lord Jesus in the assembly says, "Will I praise thee", but the word is really 'hymn'. It is not the dispensation of the psalms, it is the dispensation of hymns, and the Lord Jesus says to His Father, I will hymn Thee in the assembly. It is a clear indication of our nearness to the Deity: the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
I am endeavouring with all the means at my disposal to convey to you something that ought to stay with us; that we belong to the greatest group of persons, the greatest family, in the whole universe, and that family is being used by divine Persons for Their own peculiar purposes. One of those purposes is to praise God in the sense of hymning to the Father, and then that the Spirit says to the Lord Jesus, "Come", and the assembly joins in unison to say the same thing. You see thus how near the assembly is brought in conjunction with divine Persons in speaking and singing. We belong to it; that is the thing to get hold of. If the dear brethren are able to lay hold of this and carry it away, I will be thankful, feeling that I have done something. I can only leave it with you, that you belong to what is nearest to the Deity. Be in what He is doing in His own way, in His own place in the assembly.
May God bless His word.

"THE COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND OUR GATHERING TOGETHER TO HIM"
@2 Thessalonians 2:1 - 17.
J.T. The leading feature of this epistle, following on the first epistle, is what is said about the man of sin. It is important that so much stress is laid on the need of paying attention to facts in looking into the matter. The apostle says, "Now we beg you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as if it were by us, as that the day of the Lord is present". Clearly it is a matter of great importance, at first positively and then negatively. First, we are to have a clear understanding of this subject of the man of sin; but that understanding should be accompanied by what we have in the opening verse; "the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him". The mind is thus directed solemnly and urgently to the consideration of this matter, but by these preceding thoughts, as if we are to be filled with them first, and so be ready for the awfulness of the subject; that is, the imminence of the appearing of the man of sin. We are to be fully ready for it and equipped so as not to be overcome but in a spiritual way be ready for it. The Lord had said in His addresses to the assemblies, that He would keep the assembly from the great tribulation which is involved in this matter. "*I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth", @Revelation 3:10. So that we shall be out of it; we shall not go through the awfulness of what is indicated here, but it is all the more necessary that we should understand it and be warned; especially the thought of the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ and our
{21}
gathering together to Him. It is not simply our going to be with the Lord, but our gathering together to Him.
A.R. Were those in Thessalonica inclined to be shaken in their minds early?
J.T. That is what is clearly intimated. The apostle had already informed them of this subject, but they needed to be re-informed, showing that we may forget things that are constantly brought before us. We may forget them at a critical time.
W.W.M. In verse 7 he calls attention to the fact that the mystery of lawlessness already works. He put them on their guard.
J.T. Just so; clearly a current matter, as you might say. What already worked then is working now. It is an old matter really.
C.A.M. In what you stress as to the Lord's coming and our gathering together to Him -- assembly matters would be the only way to get a right view of things.
J.T. Yes; the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, and then our gathering together to Him. The idea of gathering should not be foreign to us because it enters into the Lord's supper and other assembly services. We ought to become accustomed to the idea of our gathering together to Him by the services that we have regularly.
W.F.K. They were young in the faith; they had not been converted long.
J.T. No; that is remarkable. It shows how young people need to be instructed, not simply making a theory of prophecy but knowing the facts of prophecy; that they are imminent and overwhelming in themselves, only that we have the encouragement that we shall be kept out of the great tribulation, as the Lord says. The Lord promises immunity from it; at the same time He would have us acquainted with what is involved.
{22}
R.W.S. Is it a principle of his ministry that Paul brings forward these stimulating thoughts first before going into the matter of the man of sin?
J.T. I would think that. It is to be noted that the first epistle contemplates the Lord's coming, not His appearing, exactly, but His coming for us; it should instruct us as to what is involved in what we call the rapture of the saints. The idea of His appearing and our gathering together to Him should have some application to assembly services. That is to say, we ought to be accustomed to His coming, His appearing and our gathering together to Him. And then as to the idea of rapture, the book of Acts contemplates that at least one brother, active in the ministry, had been raptured. I refer to Philip in chapter 8:39. I suppose the suggestion is that it should be intelligible to all. And then Peter speaks about ecstasy. These suggestions are to remind us of what belongs to christianity and to those who are of it, that we ought not to be strangers to these things, either to ecstasy, or the appearing of the Lord, or the rapture, or our gathering together to Him. All these things ought to be more or less familiar to us, in principle at least.
F.N.W. The same expression, "caught up", used by Paul in @2 Corinthians 12:2 is used of the saints in the rapture.
J.T. Just so.
A.N.W. Are you placing the idea of the rapture on the words, "our gathering together to him"?
J.T. I was thinking we should not be unfamiliar with the thought of being gathered together to Him, because it enters into assembly service, in principle. There are certain things that may be spoken of, in principle, and then they may be spoken of literally in their fulness, for we are gradually brought up to things in christianity so that we become familiar with them. The early saints including the apostles
{23}
themselves had to learn much after the Spirit came. And that ought to come home to us. We all have to learn much and the question is whether we are learning and becoming familiar with what is in the mind of God and what is involved in christianity.
R.W.S. The person who was troubling these Thessalonians would have discouraged them by saying the appearing was past, whereas Paul speaks of His coming and our gathering to Him. He makes it a present continuous hope.
J.T. Yes; there are certain persons in the world who pretend that the Lord has come. Some here may not understand that there are such people, but there are those who hold this sort of thing. It is of the devil, because it is not true. And so here, the warning was, "Let not anyone deceive you". Paul had already said, "... that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as if it were by us, as that the day of the Lord is present". This was being suggested and it was a lie. So there are suggestions being made in the world, but they are just lies.
W.F.K. They were exhorted to encourage each other with the words about the Lord's coming in the first epistle.
J.T. That was about His coming for us. Perhaps we make much of that at our burials, but the thought should be also ever present, because it is very touching in its preciousness.
F.H.L. The matter of spirit and letter can also enter into assembly matters. We should be familiar with that, in a right sense.
J.T. Yes. Correspondence among the brethren is quite familiar. Here, it was misused: "... that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as if it were by us". What is alluded to here is false. It is a happy thing that there is much correspondence among the
{24}
brethren that is true and edifying, and some of it is in print, but we are to be on our guard against what is false.
F.H.L. The enemy would take what is current among us to pervert it to his own use.
J. T. Quite so.
R.W.S. Should there be scope as we gather at the Supper for our gathering together to Him, and then the showing forth of the Lord's death until He *come*? Should there not be the public vindication of the Lord's rights, the reversal of the world's judgment about Him? Is that not the idea in: "Ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come"? @1 Corinthians 11:26.
J.T. I think that is very important, so that we are publicly on the Lord's side, as we often quote: "Thine are we, David, and with thee, thou son of Jesse", @1 Chronicles 12:18. We are not ashamed to ally and identify ourselves with Him, and in doing so to celebrate His death.
W.W.M. There is a footnote to the word 'mind' that seems to be very important: Or 'shaken from a steady and soberly judging mind'. We are to have a right judgment of things all the time. Is that it?
J.T. Very good. We have the spirit "of power, and of love, and of wise discretion" @2 Timothy 1:7; and so it was that the demoniac who was delivered was sitting and clothed and in his right mind. He would be ready for anything like this that might be current among the brethren. We should not think of treating our younger brethren or those who have come amongst us lately as though they do not understand. The idea of a right mind is that there is a readiness to understand; and then, we have the mind of Christ, so that we are made competent to understand.
C.N. Is it also to be understood that the Lord's coming and our gathering together to Him will not only have its effect upon the assembly but upon
{25}
conditions outside? Immediately, He begins to make war with this adversary and will take on the kingdom and set everything in order, in view of God being all in all. All that follows the Lord's public coming and our gathering together to Him, does it not?
J.T. Well, the procedure in the Lord's service is instructive; we begin with the Lord's supper and then go on to what relates to the Father and to God. The word, "For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come", @1 Corinthians 11:26 is important as bearing on what is outside. We meet in a room, or in a hall, or in a brother's house, and the room affords a protection to us, but at the same time it is, in a sense, public, and the procedure ought to be always in keeping with that. We are already accustomed to these matters. There is something that is distinctive about the assembly, especially as to the moral covering connected with it, which is indicated in the tabernacle; the different coverings, beginning with the badgers¬ skins and goats¬ hair, and then, inside, the veil -- a very fine texture involving what is spiritually refined. The nearer we come to the presence of the Lord we have the more precious things, and we ought to be in keeping with all that in our minds, and attitude, and clothing.
Ques. Is it instructive that the Lord Jesus, when He arose appeared to the disciples and His brethren, not to people at large in Jerusalem?
J.T. Just so; it was a secret matter; He was just risen from the dead, soon to go into heaven.
A.N.W. Does the announcing mean that in eating and drinking we commit ourselves afresh inside, and that, in effect, has an outward bearing in testimony to the Lord's death?
J.T. I think it has, but there is, in effect, a covering. The tabernacle involved that there is a certain protection, but then, that is a spiritual matter in ourselves;
{26}
we become more and more spiritual as we sit down together in assembly, because it is Zion in principle.
E.McK. Is what is inside in mind in the Lord's words, "I am coming to you"? @John 14:18,28. Does that fit in?
J.T. It does fit in. It is His coming that has become familiar to us at the Lord's supper. The coming in a public way is to be in mind, too, but the coming *to* us involves our being together. He is not in the room waiting for us, He comes to us as assembled.
J.H.E. The disciples had the doors shut for fear of the Jews.
J.T. That was physical, of course, but then there is a covering in a spiritual sense; that is, our demeanour and attitude; what we are spiritually is included in what we are saying. It cannot be discerned by the natural eye, and it only points to the assembly and what is involved in christianity. How near to heaven we are in assembly; how near to heaven, and to God, and to the Godhead, too!
Ques. If we are not experiencing that nearness are we subject to being deceived? In Ephesians and Galatians and Colossians Paul speaks of this matter as well as to the Thessalonians. That is, they were in danger of being led away as a prey, through philosophy, or by other means.
J.T. Yes. We are apt to imbibe wrong doctrine and take on wrong principles, and if we do we become opaque; the Spirit is hampered in us. The veil represents the finest material, but the badgers¬ skins become a covering for what is of God. We have to be accustomed to what is spiritual. As coming to the assembly, are we opaque or transparent? If we are not transparent we are hampering the Spirit and missing the reality of the Lord's presence, because He comes to us, and that is a wonderful thing. It is a thing to be looked for by us, and all these things enter into it.
{27}
F.N.W. In @Isaiah 4 the prophet speaks of the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning, and then goes on to say, "And Jehovah will create over every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and over its convocations, a cloud by day and a smoke, and the brightness of a flame of fire by night: for over all the glory shall be a covering", @Isaiah 4:5.
J.T. Very good. We can only touch that at a meeting like this, because there is so much involved, but it is very precious to have the thought of it. "Over all the glory shall be a covering", @Isaiah 4:5. It would suggest to our hearts what is involved in the assembly and its gatherings. The Lord, we are told in @Acts 1, was "assembled with them", @Acts 1:4. That is, He taught them how to assemble. Now we assemble and follow the word: "We being assembled to break bread", @Acts 20:7. We do that now, and He comes to us as assembled, but in @Acts 1 He assembled with them, I would gather, to show them what the thing really meant; there would be help in how He conducted Himself at that time.
C.N. So we have the idea of the "minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man", @Hebrews 8:2. That is really what we experience now.
J.T. That is what we are speaking of. We have in that chapter a summary of things. What he had written up to that chapter is summarised and made real to us in a spiritual way. "Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking is, We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man", @Hebrews 8:1,2. The great spiritual tabernacle is in mind.
C.A.M. Would 1 Corinthians stress the covering? The badger skins, for example, would deal with any inroad of evil.
{28}
J.T. That is very good; I am afraid we come in with much that renders us opaque, whereas we should be crystal-like. We should be like a sea of glass, everything in the open, not in a public sense, but in the spiritual sense.
C.A.M. In his second epistle the apostle seems to be free to talk about the house which is from heaven, as if he were emphasising, perhaps, the internal idea, and what it means to a priest to know the glory that is inside. And then the apostle refers to having been caught up. The glory side is in his mind in the second epistle.
J.T. Yes; and in chapter 3, he says, "But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory", @2 Corinthians 3:18. I do not know that we have arrived at the teaching of the second epistle very much. We have, perhaps, reached the first epistle, but the second is the one in which we come to the glory.
T.N.W. In His coming to us are we to think of Him as in His body of glory?
J.T. Just so; He does not come to us as He was during the forty days. That is another matter that should be touched on. He was here forty days after He arose before He went to heaven. I would say that whilst Christ does not come bodily, yet He comes to us as glorified. We are to be changed into the likeness of His body of glory; not what He was, although there cannot be much difference, and yet it is remarkable that there *is* a difference and that the Spirit of God stresses the idea of His body of glory, and that we are to have bodies like His body of glory. It is not the body in which He rose, simply, but His body of glory.
E.McK. Does @John 20 fit into that phase of the truth?
{29}
J.T. Yes; because He speaks, in John, of ascending. We have already spoken of what may be regarded as in principle and then what may be regarded as literality. @John 20 would be, in principle, what we are speaking of. He told Mary, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father", @John 20:17. In John He is seen coming into the midst as coming in from heaven, not simply as risen. It is the ascended Man that comes in. Some years ago there was much said about the Lord being always in the midst. It brought out the question of the Lord coming *to* us; not that He is always in the midst, but He comes to us, and how He comes to us is the next thing. Is it simply as risen, or is it as glorified? It is a very beautiful and important distinction, that it is as glorified that He comes to us, and as glorified we are to be like Him for eternity. What we are saying is of prime importance as to finality. The final thought of God is Christ glorified, and our part in it will be as glorified too; not simply as risen but glorified.
A.R. All we should need is a change in our bodies, as assembled at the Supper.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. In @2 Corinthians 3, it says, "But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory", @2 Corinthians 3:18. Is the apostle referring to the saints as gathered?
J.T. Yes; I think he is alluding to the assembly service, what is possible in assembly service now.
C.A.M. Have you not said that the Lord comes in in persons? It is not a question of the room, but of persons. I think that is one of the most illuminating things that could be said in this connection.
J.T. Yes. He comes in in persons. He says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", @John 14:18. So that He comes from heaven; not simply as risen but from heaven.
{30}
C.A.M. Is not our apprehension of the Lord most important? It is a collective idea. There is a glory, and is not that glory present because of the ability with the saints to take in the Lord's personal glory? Is that not essential?
J.T. It is. We would have to distinguish between what is current now in virtue of the presence of the Spirit of God in us in the assembly and what will be eternally. I would say that what is present now has to be regarded by itself. It is a provisional possibility, whereas when we come to eternity we come to fixedness. It is not dependent on conditions; not dependent on our own conditions or even the presence of the Holy Spirit among us. Eternal fixedness is eternal but assembly matters now and assembly privileges are variable. It raises the whole question of what is possible in the period of the assembly's sojourn on earth; how the service of God applies and how it can be carried on. It is one of the greatest things, but it is a provisional thing.
Rem. "I am coming to you" @John 14:18 refers in its entirety to the present dispensation?
J.T. It does.
Rem. In @John 14, before the Lord says, "I am coming to you", He refers to the coming of the Comforter. Would not the presence of the Spirit make possible the conditions of which you are speaking?
J.T. Just so; one of the disciples asks, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?" @John 14:22. The Lord says, "If anyone love me, he will keep my word", @John 14:23. All that would be characterised as provisional, involving assembly privileges.
D.Macd. I would like to understand more clearly how the Lord comes to us. It is not corporeally, but does He come in Spirit or in persons?
J.T. At the beginning the Lord actually appeared to them. "It is I myself", @Luke 24:39. And He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve, and to above five hundred
{31}
brethren at once, and to others. All these were corporeal appearings, but that did not continue. Paul mentions them in @1 Corinthians 15. They were miraculous. But when you come to what we are speaking of now as to assembly privilege, it is not miraculous; it is what is possible in a spiritual way while we are assembled. That the Lord can come to us, is a question of our spiritual ability to discern Him, and so we often say, "It is the Lord", @John 21:7 but we do not mean it is the Lord corporeally, but that He is there spiritually and we enjoy Him there. It is a real Person. You could not point Him out as another in the company. It is something that has to be kept in our minds as inscrutable. We can speak of it but it is inscrutable. No one can define it and yet the Lord is really there.
Ques. "In his shadow have I rapture and sit down", @Song of Songs 2:3. Is that suitable in the morning meeting?
J.T. I think it is, only whatever you get in the Old Testament has to be somewhat augmented to bring in New Testament conditions. It is important to bear in mind that there is a difference between what is provisional and what is eternal and final. There is what is provisional that the Lord affords to us to support us in the meantime, but it is not finality, because we return to our ordinary conditions.
E.E.H. Would this matter of the Lord coming in be discerned by something being expressed? Should something be said that would bring the Lord livingly before the saints at the Supper?
J.T. Something might be said, and it might not be. We are dealing with spiritual matters and we must admit we are not very much up to the thought of spirituality. The apostle speaks about persons who are spiritual and perhaps none of us can say very much on that, but it is a great thing to have the idea. God has given us minds capable of taking in ideas, and the idea in itself is profitable in a practical
{32}
way to us. The more spiritual we are the more the thing may happen. We will say, "It is the Lord", @John 21:7. At that particular time we really feel the Lord is there. That is quite possible, but it is spiritual, it is not material.
Rem. On Lord's day morning we often say that we welcome the Lord in our midst. We must be in a spiritual condition to be able to say that.
J.T. The Lord knows what we mean and how to appreciate it. In the full sense there may be very little, but the Lord knows how to appreciate it and would give us to know that He knows it and values it; but we are dealing with spiritual matters.
Ques. Is the Lord's presence confined to our morning meetings or does He have liberty to come into a meeting like this?
J.T. I think He does. I do not think the appearings referred to in @1 Corinthians 15 are limited to the Supper.
A.R. How do you view the passage, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises"? @Hebrews 2:12.
J.T. That bears on assembly service. I do not think the allusion there is to what is in eternity. The Lord is dealing with what would be a part of assembly service in the interim between the time of the Spirit's coming and the time of the Lord's coming -- what happens while the Spirit is here. So much can happen in virtue of the presence of the Spirit. The Lord can be here in virtue of that presence.
R.W.S. Do you differentiate between the glory attaching to the Lord's coming in at the Supper and the way He might come into a gathering of this character?
J.T. I would not like to say much because the Lord is so good and gracious. He might show Himself at a great crisis of the truth. He may come in to confirm what is right. He might make Himself so
{33}
visible, spiritually, as to confirm the matter once for all. I have known that.
F.H.L. Like the glory appearing at the door of the tent of meeting in @Exodus 33:9?
J.T. It is just that.
A.Pf. "But the Lord stood with me", @2 Timothy 4:17.
J.T. Yes; Paul says, "At my first defence no man stood with me, but all deserted me. May it not be imputed to them. But the Lord stood with me, and gave me power, that through me the proclamation might be fully made", @2 Timothy 4:16,17. That was a special matter in defence of the truth. That could happen at any time, in principle. And every right person would say 'The matter is settled for me; it is no question of doctrine, but the presence of the Lord'. The Lord's presence was there and there could be no question raised about it.
R.W.S. Could we assume that, under normal conditions, the Lord comes in at the breaking of the bread?
J.T. I would say that, but there might be a low, weak condition at any time and you may have to question if the Lord was there. The Lord's coming to us depends on conditions. We cannot just take it for granted.
T.E.H. Is it right to say that if evil is judged the Lord will be with us?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Does He make His presence known to the whole company or to individuals?
J.T. Normally, it is collective. "Above five hundred brethren at once" @1 Corinthians 15:6 would mean they were all conscious of it.
Well, we did not get to the subject that was in mind primarily, but I think we got to what the Lord had in mind for us.
R.W.S. It would be helpful if you would tell us what was in your mind in respect to the man of sin.
{34}
J.T. We would hardly have time. It says, "Let not anyone deceive you in any manner, because it will not be unless the apostasy have first come, and the man of sin have been revealed, the son of perdition; who opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God, or object of veneration; so that he himself sits down in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God". All this has to happen, according to what the apostle says. The terrible consequences are spoken of in the book of Revelation. It will mean the overthrow of the whole present system of the world.
A.N.W. While we are conscious that the apostasy is working we know that while there is restraint the end has not come.
J.T. That is right; it is very comforting that there is "he who restrains" and "that which restrains". There are two elements. One might be government and the other the Spirit in the assembly, but they restrain the coming of the man of sin. It is comforting that we can have meetings like this today. We could not have them if the man of sin were here.
Ques. Does the "last hour" @1 John 2:18 mentioned by John cover the period from his day down to now?
J.T. Just so; that shows how heaven reckons things. This which Paul says of the man of sin had already begun to work, and it is still working, only it is under restraint. God is keeping it in check that the saints may be able to carry on. The Spirit of God is sufficient to help us, and government, too, so that we can carry on. We should keep on praying to God, in our meetings for prayer and generally, that these conditions may continue and that the truth may continue to be opened up to us.
A.R. Will the presence of the antichrist overthrow governments?
J.T. I suppose what is in Satan's mind is to set aside what is of Christ -- the Anointed.
{35}
Ques. Was this spirit seen in Absalom when he stole the hearts of the men of Israel?
J.T. It was the spirit of antichrist. However, this is more anti-God. He sits down in the temple of God, "shewing himself that he is God".
J.H.P. "And now ye know that which restrains, that he should be revealed in his own time". Does that suggest knowledge and spiritual perception amongst the saints?
J.T. Yes; the saints are to know. The apostles had said certain things to them but I think he alludes to their spiritual intelligence. And we may say that we know now. There are two elements that are restraining. Some of us recall how, in the terrible years of the war, there was a restraining power that kept things back or we would have the man of sin present, because he is already here, in principle.
Ques. May we expect, during the time that the assembly is here, that lawlessness will not get the upper hand over government?
J.T. I think that would be right.

HOW CONTENTION IS MET BY MINISTRY
@Numbers 20:2 - 13.
J.T. I have been thinking of the book of Numbers as having a peculiar application at the present time. The original title of the book was, In the Wilderness, which is a good title; it states a fact that the people of God are in wilderness circumstances. In those circumstances we find that there is the spirit of complaint. It is seen in the book both in the mass of the people of God and also in their leaders. This chapter helps us as to this. It says, "And there was no water for the assembly, and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. And the people contended with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!" The thought of *contention* occurs in the passage and elsewhere in the book. In an earlier chapter it says that Moses complained to Jehovah about his burden, that it was too great for him.
Here, the people complained against Moses and against Aaron -- their leaders, whom Jehovah had provided for them. And the leaders themselves failed in the designation they used of the congregation, for they called them rebels. But Jehovah intervened on behalf of His servants "and the glory of Jehovah appeared to them". It was because Moses and Aaron had gone from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and had fallen upon their faces.
Our consideration may help us to see how God considers for his servants; and then, how He expects them to consider for Him.
F.H.L. What about the lack of water underlying the murmurings?
{37}
J.T. That would be a governmental condition that God was ready to take up. The lack was only to bring out the resource; for that is a point on which the Lord will help us -- what resources there are. God's resources came to light notwithstanding the failure of the leaders.
A.R. Would the circumstances bring to light their corporate state? It is a question of water for the *assembly*, is it not?
J.T. Yes; it says: "And there was no water for the assembly". This wilderness circumstance would bring out what God can do for us -- what He can be to us in the wilderness. It is not in the land, but in the *wilderness*.
J.S. Do we see what God could be to His servants in meeting this condition?
J.T. Quite so; we shall see that they failed in their use of the means that were available to meet the situation, and in their methods, too. But the resources that were there are prominent in the beginning. Also, God took account of the attitude of His servants in the way they met this attack; it says: "Moses and Aaron went from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces". God honoured them, because His glory appeared.
R.W.S. Were they provoked by what the people were saying, "Why have ye made us to go up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place?" Instead of answering the people they went to God about the matter.
J.T. Yes; the attitude of Moses and Aaron seems to cover the whole matter, and God accepted it. Whatever the assembly thought and said, the attitude of the servants was fully accepted; that is evident in that the glory appeared. "The glory of Jehovah appeared to them".
{38}
A.N.W. Is there something to be noted in that both Moses and Aaron were involved? It says, "And the people contended with Moses".
J.T. I suppose we have to humbly accept the fact that the more responsible we are, the more we are liable to be the objects of attack, if we are on God's side. Moses was the leading man as representative of God and His service; and it was against him that the attack was directed. Then the next thing is whether we are equal to meeting the attack graciously, as they did here.
C.N. Does being on their faces suggest their priestly state and attitude?
J.T. Yes; it would imply that, their *priestly* state; they are fully representative, in this sense, of God.
A.A.T. Paul, the leader, was attacked at Corinth, which represents our position in the wilderness.
J.T. Yes. Chapter 1 of the first letter to Corinth would indicate that God had provided for all that was needed, had *richly* provided. "Ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ", @1 Corinthians 1:7. But in the presence of that wonderful supply there were divisions among them. And what is now to be raised in our minds is whether we are united in the truth; are we accepting the truth and feeding on it? And then, "*We* have the mind of Christ", @1 Corinthians 2:16. That is the means by which we meet conditions. These are the faculties by which we may be served in the things of God, "that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God", @1 Corinthians 2:12. These questions should challenge our hearts now. Then it says, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" @1 Corinthians 3:16. We have the temple of God among us, the Spirit of God being here. And then, as to the leaders, it is said of them that they are *ministering servants*: "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful. But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man's day. Nor do I even examine myself. For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord. So that do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have his praise from God" @1 Corinthians 4:1 - 5.
{39}
It is well to bring these verses forward in connection with our brother's comment about the attack on the apostle Paul. The attack here in Numbers was on the leaders: "There was no water for the assembly, and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron". That is the position. The general idea is that the ministers were attacked, but it was because there was no water.
A.I. What special features of the truth do Moses and Aaron represent?
J.T. Together they represent Christ. Christ answers to both; He is "the Apostle and High Priest of our confession", @Hebrews 3:1. The "Apostle" represents the authority of God. The "High Priest" is representative of grace and consideration. It is said, in @Exodus 16, in relation to a circumstance similar to this, when the children of Israel wanted to return to Egypt, that Moses suggested to Aaron that he should speak to the people. And as he did so the glory appeared. The people, instead of turning their faces toward Egypt, turned toward the wilderness, meaning that they *accepted* the wilderness. That was in connection with the grace of the high priest. Priestly grace enables us to accept wilderness circumstances. These are important remarks for the brethren at the present time. How are we to be induced to accept wilderness circumstances? If it be through ministry,
{40}
it involves the grace of the priest. So that Moses represents the authority of God, and Aaron the grace of priesthood in Christ.
A.R. In verse 8, it says: "Take the staff, and gather the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes". Does that speak of the grace of Christ?
J.T. That is the second section where we come to the mode of meeting the crisis in the ministry. The ministers have been marked by humility; they have been formed in the truth and are seen as holding the position: "Moses and Aaron went from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to them". That shows what these two men were, that they were prepared to meet the attack. But then, can they be sustained on the high level at which they have begun? The high level, properly, was at Pentecost, but then the level was also reached in ministry. The question is whether it is touched now, whether we are on that level -- or, in principle, on it -- and whether we are sustained there.
C.F.E. When the people contended with Moses, they said, "Why have ye made us to go up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink". Is it because of the lack of water that there is no growth?
J.T. Well, now, are we to accept this as a fair statement? They are complaining of the wilderness. Is their report accurate? It is important when receiving ministry from God, to report accurately, because so much is retailed in the way of complaint that sometimes we cannot be sure of what is said. This report was not accurate. They said, "Why have ye made us to go up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place?" Well, what was Egypt if it was not evil? They say, "It is no place of seed". But it was
{41}
never intended to be a place of seed. According to an earlier chapter, there was wonderful growth, for some went up into the land. And *we* can do that at any time. We do not need to stay in the wilderness; there was a way out. The spies found a way out, and they found wonderful fruit in the land. So that there was unfair criticism, and unfair statements were made as to those who minister and what is amongst the saints in the way of privilege. I think we should acknowledge that there is a danger of complaint and unfair and untrue statements being circulated amongst the brethren.
A.N.W. They were soon to learn that water was there in the rock.
J.T. Quite so.
J.H.E. Quite a few have turned aside. They may say that there was no food or water, but it is not the fact, for there are those here who are in spiritual vigour.
J.T. Yes; there is a tendency for constant complaints which may serve to discourage. But often the details are not mentioned accurately.
F.N.W. Are we inclined to be occupied with our present circumstances, or past difficulties, whereas, those who represent God were engaged with entering the land? So that God says, in verse 12, "Therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land that I have given them". God was thinking of the land.
J.T. There is access to the land; but then these criticisms and complaints should be analysed, to see if they are so; and whether the present circumstances and the advantages of the saints are, at least, equal to earlier days. There is a tendency to refer to earlier days as if they were better than these, and to forget that we perhaps have advantages at the present time that some of us have not realised earlier.
{42}
F.H.L. The presence of God proves to be the test here, does it not? The Lord stood by His servants, and the glory appeared.
J.T. Quite so; the glory is really more, in a way, than the Lord's presence, because the Lord may be present in a concealed way, but when the glory *appears*, then there is something to attract us. It says that they "fell upon their faces; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to them"; that is, the glory was there. Why should there be complaint after that?
R.W.S. They were nearing the end of their journey, were they not? Do you think the enemy is especially intent upon diverting us as we are getting to the end of our journey, and the Lord is about to come?
J.T. That is true; and whilst you would avoid any eulogy of those who are ministering, yet we ought to be true and fair as to what God is providing for us in our day. We ought to take account of whether or not He is providing in keeping with the circumstances, and whether we are making the most use of the ministry He is providing. How much do we read? how much use do we make of what He is providing? how much value do we attach to what is placed in our hands? There can be no doubt but that we have proved, from time to time, in this district, the appearance of the glory -- manifestly so! The question is whether all that we have had vouchsafed to us is valued, or whether we are looking for something else and passing by what is in our very midst.
But then the next point is the ministers themselves; and how they acted. It says: "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Take the staff, and gather the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, and it shall give its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock, and shall give the assembly and their beasts drink".
{43}
This is the direction of Jehovah. It is all very plain and clear. And then it says, "And Moses took the staff from before Jehovah, as he had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels: shall we bring forth to you water out of this rock? And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his staff smote the rock twice". Well, you see, the ministers are at fault. The water comes, nevertheless, and that is a point that ought to be of great encouragement to us. Plenty of water came, nevertheless; that is to say, God is acting in spite of the defection of His servants.
A.N.W. Was the appearing of the glory to rally the people or was it to reassure the ministers?
J.T. I think it was an anticipative provision of God to maintain the ministers on the level on which they had begun. God anticipated that the ministers needed this glory to come in, because it says it appeared to *them;* as if they were in mind. Those that are in any way serving need encouragement so that the level taken up might be maintained.
Ques. God helped the leaders in @Acts 6 to be maintained on a high level, did He not?
J.T. I think He did. We get the first murmurings there. The Grecians complained because their widows were neglected, and the complaints seemed to be reasonable, but what came out was the wisdom of the leaders. Their ministry was in relation to the word of God. It was on the highest level. But what was needed now was a lesser service but nevertheless a *needed* work. And that is a point that comes into this inquiry, because there are many who may not have ability to serve on the highest level, but there is something they can do. The question is, Are they ready to do it? Peter said, "It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables", @Acts 6:2.
{44}
There are those here today who will serve tables, and it is an important service, and what we are saying should encourage them.
A.N.W. In the acceptance of the service there was room for Stephen to develop in the ministry.
J.T. Well, that is the next thing. Christianity is a wonderful institution, with varied and rich features which come out as opportunity is given. And these special occasions offer opportunities for ministry that is needed; and it should draw out our appreciation.
T.E.H. Philip also was one of the seven, and he became an evangelist, and had four daughters who prophesied.
J.T. Just so; so that those who take on the menial services today may be doing something on a higher level tomorrow, because the system is of such magnitude that it affords these things. God is always ready to advance us. Therefore, the word is, "purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith", @1 Timothy 3:13.
Rem. In @Acts 7 Stephen was able to give a whole summary of the history of the people of God.
J.T. Just think of what one brother may do! Stephen unfolded, in most remarkable order, certain features which marked the people of God up to the moment of his service. He purchased to himself a good degree and great boldness in the faith. And then Philip, also, purchased to himself a good degree of evangelical gift and power. It was not exactly what God endowed these two men with, but what they purchased to themselves. That is, they gave the Lord reason or cause to give them gift. And the four daughters of Philip were remarkable women. There seems to be an absence of such sisters at the present time.
F.H.L. What would the staff represent today?
J.T. I suppose Moses¬ staff would refer to his gift. But the word is, "Take the staff, and gather the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, and it shall give its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock, and shall give the assembly and their beasts drink. And Moses took the staff from before Jehovah, as he had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels: shall we bring forth to you water out of this rock? And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his staff smote the rock twice".
{45}
We have to consider whether it is Moses¬ staff, or *the* staff. I would think that perhaps *the* staff refers to Aaron's staff. That staff had acquired this place. It had budded, and blossomed, and ripened almonds. And the rock was to be spoken to. The staff was not to be used to smite, meaning that it was now a time of speaking.
F.H.L. God had maintained a high level up to this point. "Moses took the staff from before Jehovah".
J.T. I suppose *the* staff is the one to be considered now. It would be Aaron's staff, I think -- the priestly staff; so that what is to be done is to be in the power of the Spirit of God.
A.R. Would it be like Paul's ministry in the second letter to Corinth?
J.T. Yes; he had said to them, in @1 Corinthians 4:21, "What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love?" Paul would come to Corinth in love and in a spirit of meekness -- the priestly grace of Christ.
E.E.H. What is the thought of speaking to the rock?
J.T. Well, Moses was told to take the staff and to speak to the rock. "The rock was the Christ", @1 Corinthians 10:4 we are told in @1 Corinthians 10:4. In a word, that is the whole point.
{46}
R.D. Is there a distinction between the rod and the staff? The word in @Psalm 23 is, "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me", @Psalm 23:4.
J.T. Well, the word "staff" is used here. Moses had an extraordinary experience with his staff. It was his own staff -- an ordinary thing -- something that he had in his hand that he used to look after the sheep, I would think, for he was a shepherd. And that was the staff that God took up -- what he had in his hand. It was a staff, and that is the principle we are dealing with now, except that the staff referred to here was the staff of Aaron.
A.I. Is there a difference between the staff mentioned in verse 8, and the one in verse 11?
J.T. Verse 8 reads, "Take *the* staff". In verse 11, it says, "And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his staff ...". The staff of verse 8 was to take precedence now over all others. It is *the* staff. But verse 11 says, "And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his staff smote the rock twice"; that is to say, Moses should not have used *his* staff. *The* staff should have been used; and that is clearly Aaron's staff, the priestly staff. It was a question of life. It is not the hard spirit that is often seen in service. We are apt to be hard in our spirits at times, but the staff of Aaron never represents that. It is a living thing: it is a question of life.
A.N.W. He was not told to smite the rock, was he?
J.T. He was to speak to it. That was the point -- God's speaking had been demonstrated in Aaron before. God had said of Aaron, "I know that he can speak well", @Exodus 4:14. God selected him for that purpose. And now Aaron's rod is to be used. In @Exodus 16, as we have said, when Aaron spoke to the people, they looked toward the wilderness. Aaron's rod budded and blossomed and bore almonds. The almonds have a voice in themselves, and I believe
{47}
that we have reached (I am speaking of ourselves) a period when we may expect life to prevail amongst the brethren in the ministry. We should look for it, and we should aim at it, that what we are ministering is living.
P.C. In @Exodus 34, Moses¬ face shone when he came down from the mount. Is there something like that to affect the ministers in their service?
J.T. Quite; that shows what nearness to God implies in ministry, and how the ministers need to be near to God in their service.
R.W.S. There are times when the servants might speak to one another if there is a fault, but grace is to operate in the whole realm?
J.T. Quite so.
J.T.Jr. Would that come out in @Acts 15 where the apostles had the meeting at Jerusalem?
J.T. Yes; that, we might say, was the last general council of the assembly. It was a general matter. It was held, not at Antioch, but at Jerusalem, as if God would have the final word in Jerusalem as to what He has to say in christianity Paul said, as to it, I went up by revelation. Revelation is a great feature of christianity. And he also says, I took Titus with me. Titus was a gentile, but he was an excellent example of the work of God through the ministry. He was Paul's son in the faith. He was there to go in and out among the brethren in Jerusalem. There would be many there, but could they find a better example of God's work in a young man at Jerusalem, than Titus was? He had come in from the gentiles, an evidence of Paul's work. So that it is a question, therefore, of what any brother may be in the effect of his ministry.
T.E.H. Would James be the kind of brother that used Aaron's staff in a difficult situation? He said, "Brethren, listen to me", @Acts 15:13.
{48}
J.T. Very good; a man that can say that would have something very definite to say to such a remarkable congregation. But then, what he has to say links on with Peter. Peter has a place before him; therefore, the thought of personnel or persons comes into this matter, as to what their characteristics are and how they bear upon the ministry and the general work of God; because that is what they are set for, it is a question of the work of God.
A.I. Is the idea of the personnel seen in Titus?
J.T. That is right. Paul tells us that they did not demand that Titus should be circumcised, although he was a gentile. Circumcision could not add to the work of God that was there.
F.H.L. Why did Moses act as he did in calling the people rebels? Was he not in line with God's great thoughts?
J.T. I think he was affected unduly by their naughty ways. But we should be above that, and able to minister in grace in spite of it.
R.D.G. Would the reference in @Psalm 106 help? "They moved him to wrath at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account; for they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips" @Psalm 106:32,33.
J.T. Quite so; amongst the people of God there is often a tendency to provoke those who minister.
C.N. Is there a suggestion that stability and freshness are afforded the assembly on the principle of speaking? Moses was to *speak* to the rock instead of smiting it.
J.T. And then the beautiful, gracious thought, that in spite of the failure of Moses and Aaron and the complaints of the people, the rock yields its water; that is to say, the rock is Christ. Christ is the same as always: He is always ready to afford water.
{49}
J.S. It says "much water".
J.T. Well, just so; not only for themselves but for their cattle. There was plenty of it.
Ques. Was God affording water to the Corinthians in that Paul could say, "*I* was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling; and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in God's power", @1 Corinthians 2:3 - 5?
J.T. Well, that was it exactly. And it brought out what his spirit was. I think we should rest on the thought that in spite of the errors of those responsible in christendom, the Rock gives its water. In one sense, Moses and Aaron, here, depict the state of christendom. Then there is also the viewpoint that Moses suffered on account of the state of the people. We must not forget that God is still dealing with christendom. There is a remnant, but He is still dealing with christendom; He has not given it up. In spite of things that there are in christendom -- some of them terrible and dreadful things -- it is most affecting that the water still flows. It is not so much a question of the personal conduct of Moses and Aaron, in this sense, but, typically, the state of christendom with its hundred or more sects and its low state. But, in spite of that, God is causing the water to flow.
A.N.W. So that it becomes a kind of mediatorial service in their bearing the brunt of the error?
J.T. Very good; and then it says, "And the assembly drank, and their beasts. And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to hallow me before the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land that I have given them". Moses and Aaron have to suffer, but verse 13 says, "These are the waters of Meribah where the children of Israel contended with Jehovah".
{50}
Notice that it says, "The children of Israel contended with Jehovah".
A.N.W. What about that further word that Jehovah hallowed Himself?
J.T. I think it is very comforting, that in spite of all that has happened in christendom God is asserting Himself. He is causing a testimony to be maintained as to His holiness.
J.S. And maintaining the glory on a high level?
J.T. Quite so; why should we not, therefore, go on, on the highest level and with the greatest things before us? God is bent on hallowing Himself, as it were, by what He is ministering, and what God is giving in ministry is to be read by the brethren. Let us understand what God is doing, what He means; that He is to be testified to and hallowed in spite of all that is happening.
T.E.H. Is there not a suggestion of this in Revelation, in relation to the Lord's return? It says, "And let him that is athirst come", @Revelation 22:17.
J.T. That is right. And, therefore, the point in these meetings is to keep the truth on a high level, and freely before the brethren, and that it might have a living character.
A.A.T. While endeavouring to keep the truth on a high level, yet would you not pray for the prosperity of the gospel message in the churches or mission halls throughout christendom?
J.T. Quite so; but we are concerned immediately with what *we* have on the Lord's day. The privilege of the Lord's day has a hallowing power in spite of what goes on in christendom generally.
A.A.T. The water flowed out freely from the rock.
J.T. Quite so; but we seek to go on with what hallows God on the Lord's day, and as God gets His place we touch the abundance there is at that time.
{51}
T.N.W. If Paul is forced to call attention to himself, such as at Corinth, is the fault with the leaders or with the people?
J.T. I would think that much lay at the door of the leaders, but also, fault lay with the people. Moses and Aaron were provoked by the people, in this case, according to the psalm. They would not have failed had they been left to themselves. They were affected, adversely, by the unreasonable attitude of the people.
F.S.C. In Deuteronomy, Moses says, Jehovah was angry with me on *your* account.
J.T. He was angry with Moses because of the people.
{52}
BEING TAUGHT OF GOD
@John 6:45; @1 Thessalonians 4:9
I am seeking to be content with these two short scriptures, hoping, however, that what they present may be expanded for the presentation of the present truth, for there is such a thing -- the present truth. There was the truth, and there will be, but there is the *present* truth, and it is in mind that this shall be kept before us. Peter uses the expression "the present truth", @2 Peter 1:12 but I have read from John and from Paul and they both, as I may say, were up to date in the truth that Peter referred to. Peter was an apostle, and had the ministry, as John and Paul had it, and no doubt had it all in mind when he spoke of the present truth. Both Paul and John would be quite well versed in what Peter had ministered. It was the truth equally with what Paul ministered, although Paul had the last word. It is he who says that he completed the word of God. No one else said that -- it is apparent that no one else *could* say it but Paul. But Peter had his line of truth, too, and it related particularly to the circumcision. He evidently received light and truth and principles from the Lord suitable for the circumcision and so he would, of course, devote himself mainly to that. It would be his part in the great dispensation. He had part in it and so did Paul and John and all the apostles -- each having a characteristic ministry. There were no two of them alike, nor are there two alike today in those who are ministering. The creation witnesses to the variety that is with God even in material things and it is more so in spiritual things. All is from God and He loves variety.
One can understand what pleasure heaven had in what had been inaugurated as the Lord Jesus went up into heaven and the Holy Spirit came down. Think of what there was in a general way and in
{53}
detail -- how each apostle, indeed, each *one* who contributed to the system would afford pleasure to heaven. We shall understand that pleasure, for we are to be there and they are to be there -- all the apostles are to be there. We shall know them and see them, and we shall have the opportunity of speaking with them, I am sure. The place the apostles have will be one of the features of the coming glory. We can understand that from the way they are spoken of as the twelve apostles of the Lamb. What pleasure the Lord would have in them! Features of life characterized them all -- they were marked by life. The reference to "twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb" @Revelation 21:14 is a remarkable expression. A somewhat similar reference is made to the apostles and others at the beginning -- "the crowd of names" @Acts 1:15 -- it shows what they were to heaven. The very names convey what is living. There was nothing dry, or crusty, or merely legal about them. Each had his characteristics; each had his ministry, and hence a wonderful variety was available. And the same will be true in heaven, dear brethren. The scene will be made more glorious on that account. It is said of the glory of the Lord that we are to be "transformed according to the same image" @2 Corinthians 3:18 -- the glory that is involved in the image of Christ. John speaks of what we shall see and what we shall be like at that time. "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", @1 John 3:2.
Well, as I have said, I wish to confine myself to what is conveyed in the two scriptures read. The first refers to the teaching of God: "They shall be all taught of God". The second refers to being "taught of God to love one another". I make a difference between these two things. As you can see there is the general teaching of God, and then the teaching of love. The latter is *specific* teaching. God teaches us to love one another. We are in a wide
{54}
field when we think of the general field of divine teaching, but then there is the specific field of divine teaching, and we need both. That God should undertake to teach at all is wonderful. Why should He give Himself to that? The apostles gave themselves to the word of God and prayer, relieving themselves of the burden of looking after tables, but then why should God turn aside, as it were, to teach? He is the Maker and the Supporter of the universe. Think of that, and yet He turns aside, to give Himself to teaching His people. Now this is one of the most important things we can consider. It should not be regarded objectively, exactly, for there is such a thing as my becoming one of God's pupils, one who learns from God. It comes to my mind just now in a most affecting way, that the Lord says, through the prophet, "He wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed", @Isaiah 50:4. And He also says, "The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the instructed that I should know how to succour by a word him that is weary", @Isaiah 50:4. I think that is wonderful! I would that everyone would take it to heart, that the Lord Jesus viewed Himself thus as a learner from God. Not that I would say that He would be one of a class with His people, but still, He was a learner and His ear was opened by God that He might know how to speak a word in season to weary persons. How many wearied persons there are today! I do not mean weary from manual work, but weariness of mind, troubled minds and difficult circumstances. The Lord is concerned about such. He is concerned to have a word for you tonight if you are a weary one. The Lord knows what it means. He took on such circumstances, dear brethren, so that we might understand that He knows what we go through. How precious that is! It may be that as we are going home tonight we shall get a word from the Lord, each one for himself, for it is a word to *him*
{55}
that is weary -- a person who is in weariness of mind or in sorrow. You may get a word from the Lord on the way home, or after you get home, or after you try to get some sleep, for you may not get sleep. Some of us do not get it just as we wish it, and the question is if we can think of divine things and make use of the time for the enjoyment or learning of divine things.
And so, as I have said, it is a question first of all of divine teaching; that is, God's teaching. If God were to inaugurate the teaching of science, how scientific men would flock to hear! Many devote themselves to science. They become known as scientists, but they may be missing it and missing what God is saying and teaching. Think of what He is teaching His beloved people in all these meetings! I might add to that a warning that we should all be present when such meetings are held. There are many such meetings, and those that occur every week, and we are apt to forego many of them, or make selections, maybe, and neglect the prayer meeting. But that is not pleasing to the Lord. On one occasion one of His disciples asked Him saying, "Lord, teach us to pray", @Luke 11:1. The teaching of the Lord, as to prayer, is for *all* of us and we cannot afford to miss the prayer meeting. It is a time of teaching, you see. Many do miss the prayer meeting, saying that they can pick out whatever meeting suits best, but the meeting for prayer is one in relation to which the Lord would teach us. The Lord said, "When ye pray, say, Father ...". @Luke 11:2. He undertook to teach His disciples how to pray. And that would mean that they were taught of God. It was not only that the Lord taught -- what He does, *God* does -- and so we cannot afford to miss any of the meetings. They are *all* special. Heaven is involved in each of them. Therefore, we are not to miss any if we can avoid it. The Lord knows well what we can and cannot do and there is no one more considerate than
{56}
He, but at the same time He is considerate of us in urging us to get to the prayer meetings. I say that because I know some of us make a selection and avoid the prayer meeting; they say they can get along without that, for there are other things they must do.
Well, I wanted to seek to connect things with God. As to the creation, of course, we must connect that with God: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", @Genesis 1:1. On the other hand, it is said of the Lord Jesus that there was nothing made without Him, everything that was made, *He* made, showing how the Deity is bound up together. I speak reverently; the Godhead is bound up together in these matters. And so we begin with God. And the evangelist speaks of the Lord as quoting from the prophets, "They shall be all taught of God". The word 'all' there clearly means every person; every one of God's people, for that is what is in mind. It is not the man of the world, but the people of God -- all are to be taught of Him. And so I cannot but refer back to the beginning to show how, in the matter of teaching, God began it. He made man on the sixth day. He tells us specifically, through Moses, what He did on each day, as if God would come down to our level to tabulate for us what He did on each of the six days. It is a very touching thing and it brings up the whole question of education: How are we getting on in our education as believers? God looks down from heaven in these matters and He is thinking of the different things that are to be done. He has His own way of doing things, of course, but it is God's way and we are to learn from Him how things are to be done. The Lord, speaking through the prophet, tells us that Jehovah opened His ear morning by morning. Well, that is a thing to notice -- it is how things are done. And so this matter of education is started at the very beginning of the creation. It is not
{57}
an afterthought but something that had to be taken up immediately because something had happened -- sin had come in. And so it is viewed as having started at the very outset. Hence we are told that Enoch was the seventh from Adam. The Spirit of God intends that we are to think of the number -- how many of us there might be -- but there is one man singled out and he is called the seventh, not from the *creation* but from Adam. From the beginning, in Adam, at a given time there was a seventh: there were many other sevenths, no doubt, but I question if they have the same distinction, or if the Spirit of God could single them out and impress us with them as He does with Enoch. I would think that this thought is confined to one person, and that person is Enoch. In one sense I should like to have been that person, but there is something else going on today that I can have -- that we can have -- and perhaps we are missing it. And part of that something else may have taken place in these meetings.
You will see that I am seeking to impress every one to be on the alert because it is a time of divine teaching. For us it is not the time of the universities, although there are many, but we are dealing with what God is doing in the sense of teaching, and the question is if we are missing anything that has come from the mouth of God. The Lord Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth", @Matthew 4:4. Think of words coming from God's mouth! Can I afford to miss something that the mouth of God has spoken? That is what is happening, and it should awaken the brethren to the importance of what is going on. You may say that you must go to business, that you must earn a living. But there is more than that, you know, much more, for God is doing something and you do not want to miss it. You would not want to miss the very last words that God will speak to His people before they are taken to glory. Scripture speaks of the last words of certain
{58}
persons, such as the last words of David. Who can say that of God? He has never stopped speaking -- He is not going to stop -- He is God. I am God, He says, and there is none else; so that if God is speaking we want to be up to date with what God has said. I would not say there is such a thing as inspiration now but there is something very near to it; there is that which the Holy Spirit indite in the way of ministry for us. It is not inspiration, and yet it is almost that at times. We cannot afford to miss what is said by such as Anna. The word is that she departed not from the temple. Think of it, dear brethren, night and day! That dear old sister, and I do not say that she was only that when she was old, but she *was* old, and she is an example for us -- she departed not from the temple, serving night and day. She was going on with the things of God, learning for herself, but speaking to others. She spoke to all who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.
But I was speaking of Adam and how there was one man called the seventh from Adam. He is mentioned in the book of Jude. It is a book of only one chapter, but it is a very important chapter and amongst the many things that are said is the fact that Enoch was the seventh from Adam. And I would say that means that it was the learning time -- the beginning of the learning time. God was beginning to teach men. Well, what would He teach them? Speaking reverently, I do not think it would be to give any further light about geology or the like of that. If it were needed He would do it, but He is not doing it, He is teaching about spiritual matters, and I believe the course of God's teaching began with Adam, and there was one man who is singled out by the Spirit of God as the seventh of that period. Whatever was going on he had part in it. And this leads on to many things that are to be learned, as taught of God. One of these is priesthood. I take the liberty of selecting my topics
{59}
from the great range of things which opens up, and I now mention the matter of priesthood and in doing so I am thinking of Exodus. Genesis speaks about priesthood too; indeed it speaks about one of the greatest priests; in fact, *the* greatest priest, because Melchisedec speaks of Christ. But it is priesthood in the wilderness that I am thinking about and Aaron represented that. Aaron was taught of God in priesthood. We cannot say that of Melchisedec, exactly, for he was a mysterious person, said to be assimilated to the Son of God. But Melchisedec did not teach Aaron to be a priest; Aaron was taught of God. Two of his four sons died under the government of God, and Aaron and his two sons continued in the priesthood. But I want to say (and this is important for both brothers and sisters) that we do not get anything about the priesthood of Aaron and his sons until we hear about the servant, spoken of in @Exodus 21. It is as if God were to tell us that He wants us to serve Him -- because that is the one great idea in priesthood, that we are to be in service. As was said of Aaron "that he may serve me", @Exodus 4:23. He is to be the servant, but his name is not mentioned as priest, nor are his sons¬ names mentioned either, until they learned how to love. That is my great burden tonight -- this matter of love. Aaron and his sons are not spoken of as priests until we read of the Hebrew servant in @Exodus 21, who says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children", @Exodus 21:5. It was not simply that he was a Hebrew slave, but he was a man who knew love. John says, "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us", @1 John 3:16. That is how we know it. In the early days of the pagan Greeks, they did not know love; they did not know the meaning of the word. We must come to Scripture, and to persons mentioned in Scripture as priests, to know love. And these persons are specifically Aaron and his sons. And I mention them, dear brethren, so that we may have in mind that if we are
{60}
to get anything from this address we must learn to know love, and to say certain things to persons about love. So that, as I said, we do not have the priesthood developed until we get these men, Aaron and his sons, who were taught how to love. Nor would there be anything in our souls tonight that would contribute to the priesthood unless we knew love. God has that in mind; He has in mind to impress us that if we are to be in His school and profit by it, we have to learn the first great lesson, which is love.
Now I think the dear brethren will conclude that I am not going beyond anyone's reach in what I am saying. The divine school began with Adam, I believe. That is what is meant, I think, in Enoch being said to be the seventh from Adam. And if we are to be in that divine school, we have to begin with the great lesson of love and go on with it, keep on with it, prove it every minute, because it is to be known, it is to be proved. "Hereby we have known love", John says. The Spirit of God, through him, tells us that love is known "because *he* has laid down his life for us", @1 John 3:16. And so, if we are to learn this great lesson of love there must be some exemplification of the thing, and it must be constant. The exemplification is in the fact that "he laid down his life for us". And it now involves that, in some sense, *we* are laying down *our* lives. So that it is a time for everyone to enquire before the Lord about these matters, What have I learned today about laying down my life? That is how the thing came out in Jesus, "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us", @1 John 3:16. So that the passage goes on to say, "And we ought for the brethren to lay down our lives". Thus the thing will soon become a daily matter, dear brethren, an acquired matter, a mastered matter, as it were, that I know love. And we should not give up our application to the thing until we master it, as they say in the schools. And so Aaron and his sons mastered it, in type, because when the Hebrew
{61}
servant comes into the scene saying, "I love my master, my wife, and my children", @Exodus 21:5 then we have the nomination of the priest. We are qualified to act as priests before God when we have learned love.
Well, I must conclude, because we are to be governed by measure in our speaking, but I feel that learning love is a great matter and it is included, though not mentioned, in the passage of @John 6: "They shall be all taught of God". That is a great general fact that the saints of God are, generally, in the divine school. But Paul, in his letter to Thessalonica, specifies that "ye ... are taught of God to love one another". He did not need to tell them about it because they were taught of God. God Himself had taught them. That is the thing -- God Himself is teaching the matter of love. It was as though He did not leave the matter even with Paul or with Peter. Not that they did not teach it, because I am sure they did, but it is as if God were to say, I will undertake this matter Myself because it is so important. And hence, in that remarkable chapter (@1 Corinthians 13) the writer says, "If I ... have not love, I am nothing", @1 Corinthians 13:2. What a sweeping thing that is. Do we have it? If we do not have it, the writer says, we are nothing! We may give all our goods, and even our bodies to be burned, but if we have not love, we are nothing. That is a sweeping matter.
Well, dear brethren, it is well to face these things. We are dealing with divine things. We learn in part, and we teach in part. We may say something that we have not thought much about, but perhaps we are saying the greatest things that we have ever said. That is how God does things and it teaches us to be on the alert, but especially we are to be learning love, for we are put to the test every day as to whether we know love. "By this shall all know", says the Lord, "that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35.
{62}
"*I* JESUS ... AMEN; COME, LORD JESUS"
@Revelation 22:16,17,20,21
I was confirmed in the exercise that I have had this evening by the hymn that we have just sung; that is, that part of it that contemplates the incoming of the divine thoughts as to Israel. These thoughts are without repentance: "The gifts and the calling of God are not subject to repentance", @Romans 11:29. God has His thoughts as to Israel and they go through. We shall see that as to Israel there are eternal features; God alone can bring them about. So His thoughts will not fail; they will come out in due time and Israel will be apprehended and understood. Why should there be so much said about Israel unless there be some eternal feature that will go through? Zion is a word that has a great place in Scripture, a peculiar poetic place, a thrilling place, too, when we think of what Zion is and the unfailingness of God's purposes as to it. So I have ventured to read these verses. The brethren will understand that I hope to be brief, but at least to convey something that will tend to enhance what has already been before us; for it has been a remarkable day, if I may venture to say so. It has been a day of impressions that will remain with us, I fully believe, and bear on the moment, for it is a peculiar time.
And so I have read of the Lord addressing Himself to someone -- whom, we just cannot say -- but He is addressing Himself in an emphatic way as the pronoun would show. He says, "*I* Jesus". A peculiar charm attaches to the thought of the Lord, as it were standing up and addressing Himself to His people. I do not venture to say to whom the address was directed, but we shall come to it presently, for the Lord is addressing someone, saying; "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies".
{63}
It is "in the assemblies", notice. That is, the Lord is standing out, we might say, before the universe at such a time as is now before us, and addressing us. It has been going on all day, too. And the word has come very forcibly this evening, being stimulated by the hymn that we have sung, involving Zion, a word that reverts back to historic Old Testament times but comes down into New Testament times. But in these verses the Lord Himself is speaking to us in an emphatic way and addressing Himself to us: "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies". It is not in the *assembly*, as you will notice; it is in the plural. The Lord is addressing the *assemblies*. No doubt He refers to the seven assemblies, and the word as to them is: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". That is going on all the time. It has been going on all day in this hall, I do not hesitate to say that. There has been an address to the assemblies; the word of God has come to us, as I believe fully, in an authoritative way directing us to something, and that something will be worked out I believe in our souls presently. But what I want to point out now is the peculiar position the Lord is taking up in this address, the peculiar position; it is one of the most peculiar that I know of, because it is Deity coming down to the level of the creature state. Now I trust that you understand what I am saying; I am sure you do. We have come to it that there must be something of this kind before we get through with the Bible, before we get through with the ministry. There must be some form of link between the Deity -- with God the Father, with Christ, with the Holy Spirit -- and the creature; there must be that, and I can hardly think of anything more important to be brought before the brethren at this time, for there is a goodly number of us here from various parts.
{64}
And so the Lord says, "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel". I cannot say who the angel is; that is not stated, but it is the Lord's angel, His own angel, one that He had employed in this book. And He goes on to say, "*I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". Now I dwell for a moment on what the Lord speaks of as the "root"; that He is the root of David. He is "the root and offspring", but the root, and that must involve Deity. I trust, dear brethren, you will understand what I am saying, but if you do not, it will have to be considered and weighed before God. We have come to a time in which we can speak to one another, having confidence. There is holy confidence among the brethren. I never knew a time in which there was more confidence among the brethren. I have been about a good bit recently, and there is great indication of confidence, confidence begotten of love, love working in our hearts. One of the greatest things that one can speak of is love working in the hearts of the brethren, involving confidence, and conversation. And then we might say ministry too, authority for ministry, liberty for ministry. We have had much of it today; but I thought I would bring in, in a confirmatory way at this time, what there is amongst the brethren in the way of confidence. And therefore I believe the Lord seizes the opportunity at the end of this wonderful book to speak to us in this way. He comes down to speak to us, and it is marvellous that He does. God has come down, as the hymn says, 'God come down, a heavenly Stranger'. (`112:2). Think of it, that God Himself has come down. I am reminded again of the service of God, and how much the service of God has taken form in hymns, holy compositions for the saints with which to serve and praise God. It is a time in which hymns have acquired a great place, and I may add that they are going to be extended. A meeting was held recently
{65}
in England to discuss the matter of hymns in view of revising the present hymn book. I believe that the service of God implies the feelings of the brethren, the very soul of the brethren being brought into it. And that enters into what I am saying now, as to the Lord Himself coming down, no less than the Lord Himself: "*I* Jesus". His name was to be called Jesus. "Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for *he* shall save his people from their sins", @Matthew 1:21. Wonderful fact!
But now I proceed to say further what is in my mind. The Lord says, "I am the root and offspring of David". We have spoken of the "root" which means Deity. "Offspring" is simpler; it shows that He was born of David. The word is indeed, "It is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda", @Hebrews 7:14. Judah was His tribe. Remarkable thing that that should be said; that the Lord should take that place; that it should be said of Him that He sprang out of Judah! And now, in the last chapter of the Bible, He says, "I am the root and offspring of David", The word "root" conveys Deity, and I hope the brethren understand that. Who could be the root of David, except God? We are all said to be God's offspring, in another sense, but it is not said that God is our root. Jesus says, "*I* am the root and offspring of David", one of the greatest men to appear on the page of Old Testament Scripture. He is mentioned several times in this book and spoken of specifically as a leading man. But the Lord says, "*I* am the root and offspring of David". You will pardon me for repeating, but the root refers to Deity. Only God could be this; but it is Jesus. He speaks of Himself as Jesus: "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies". That is where the conversations proceed; the assembly is the place of confidences, of confidential thoughts, where things can be said openly but in confidence. And the brethren
{66}
are coming into this great matter of confidence. And Jesus says here, speaking openly to those that were responsible and whom He loved, because it is a question of the assemblies, "*I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright ... morning star". The word 'and' should not be there as far as I understand. It is simply 'the bright morning star'. That is the great point, it is the morning star, the luminary; we are coming to luminous times, not dark times but luminous times. There are terrible times ahead. The great apostasy is yet to come, but the meantime is luminous; the Holy Spirit is here, and the Sun is in the heavens; the Lord Jesus Himself is above in the heavens; God is shining in His face; the glory is shining there. It is a wonderful time, it is a luminous time. And so He says, "*I* am the bright ... morning star". It does not say He is the sun; it is more the idea of a star. The Lord Jesus is subject, as it were, subject to God, subject to the Father, and He speaks of Himself as a star. We read in @Genesis 1:16 that God made the stars. God did that; but the Lord Jesus, spiritually, is the bright morning Star.
Now I am not going to proceed very much further, but I just want to make the point clear to you that is in my mind. And so the next thing is what the Spirit says, *and* what the bride says. So we come down to the idea of the creature. The most wonderful creature of the whole creation is the bride of Christ; she is the most wonderful creature of the whole creation, in the universe. She is a creature, but she is presented in this way. She is the most wonderfully glorious creature that there is. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". I am speaking now about the bride. I have been speaking about the root. It is God, it is Deity. And the "offspring of David" is Christ in manhood. But then the next thing is "The Spirit and the bride". I might say, properly, that the Lord has brought the Spirit forward.
{67}
"The Lord is the Spirit", it says in 2 Corinthians; "Now the Lord is the Spirit", @2 Corinthians 3:17. The Spirit takes that place and we love to think of how He has asserted Himself in recent times and become familiar to us. The communion of the Spirit is a wonderful thing. If we do not understand it, I would urge the brethren to think of it. Ponder over it; ponder the idea of "the communion of the Holy Spirit", @2 Corinthians 13:14. He is so near to us, so ready to converse with us, and to commune with us. That is the time in which we are living, dear brethren, a wonderful time! And "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". The bride is the assembly. I have already remarked that it is the greatest creature. The assembly is the greatest creature, but she *is* a creature. I speak very reverently, but I note that she is so closely linked up with God Himself, *although* a creature. It says, "The Spirit and the bride". The Spirit is mentioned first; that is God, but then it is, "the Spirit and the bride". She is a creature; the Spirit is divine; the assembly is the greatest creature in the whole universe. And we belong to it, beloved! I use the word 'beloved' because the brethren deserve it; you are all beloved, thank God. It is a time of love -- the time of light, but the time of love. But I am engaged with what the bride is, that she is the assembly, but the Spirit of God comes down, almost, you might say, to the level of this creature. I do not know how to put it; it is wonderful to be able to speak of it; but I think in what I am saying you will all understand that the Spirit, a divine Person, comes down to the level of the bride, so that they are speaking the same thing. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". They are saying the same thing. The bride is brought into unison with the Spirit. Wonderful that it should be said!: Brought into unity in that one word -- "Come!" And I hope the dear brethren will just be able to ponder all this, although perhaps imperfectly
{68}
spoken, but I think you will all see now how much there is involved in it, and that you will all take it to heart, and get to the Lord in prayer to find out if each one has his part in all this. I would assume that all here are the Lord's and that you have part in all these wonderful things, and that we all know that the Lord Jesus comes to us, even as we are here today in lowliness, to enter into our matters with us, and yet He is God and we are creatures. The assembly, great as it is, is a creature. But the Lord Jesus is speaking, and He is God -- God over all, as Paul says, "Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever", @Romans 9:5. What phraseology! That is the great point for the moment.
And so I proceed to finish. The next thing is, "And let him that hears say, Come". That is liberty, the liberty in which we are. "Let him that hears say, Come". You hear the bride speaking, you hear the Spirit speaking, but you are at liberty to speak too. And then it says, "And let him that is athirst come". See the liberty that we are brought into! "He that will, let him take the water of life freely". But I finish with that, dear brethren, because I trust others will speak, but I just want to say that it is a time of liberty; it is a wonderful time, and our time together today has been wonderful. Perhaps things are coming to us in a way that we have never had them before. These great things are coming within our range, for it is a time of liberty as suggested by the words of the Lord Himself: "And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely".
And then, finally, "He that testifies these things ...". That is the Lord Himself. There can be no question about what is being said and who says it. "He that testifies these things says, Yea, I come quickly" -- not simply that I come, but "I come quickly". And then someone says, "Amen". Who
{69}
says that? I should think that we all say it! "Amen; come, Lord Jesus"! Who can hesitate to have part in this wonderful, "Come, Lord Jesus"? He says, "I come quickly". There can be no doubt that it is to be very soon -- very, very soon; "for the coming of the Lord is drawn nigh", @James 5:8. But do we love it? I think the person who speaks here loves it. The "Amen" is from one who loves it; "Amen; come, Lord Jesus".
And then the final word, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints". That is the word to everyone here, dear brethren. We belong to the saints. It is a saint time, a wonderful time; it is a time that belongs to the saints, but we belong to them; we are among the saints; we are of the body of Christ. Not that we *are* the body, but we are *of* the body. These are all wonderful facts! He says, "I come quickly" and the answer is, "Come, Lord Jesus". And He *will* come; He will be sure to fulfil His word.
{70}
THE DIVINE APPEARING IN @NUMBERS 11
@Numbers 11
Moses complained, "Why hast thou done evil to thy servant ... that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?" Jehovah said, "Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel ... take them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with thee. And I will come down and talk with thee". What gracious consideration of the servant!
"Jehovah came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men". It was an appearing marked by God *coming down* and honouring His servant, speaking to him in the presence of the others. It would be seen that God was not unreasonable In putting such a heavy burden (as Moses said) on His servant -- that He had furnished him with sufficient power to carry it; for the Spirit put upon the seventy was taken from Moses. There was no *added* power.
There was, however, added *personality;* the seventy involved this; although the spirit of Moses, as it were, was upon all, each of the seventy had his own distinction.

THE GLORY OF CHRIST (1)
@John 1:14; @John 17:1 - 24
J.T. The gospel of John affords us more perhaps as to this great subject than any of the other gospels, We shall find that the subject of the glory of Christ is carefully sub-divided in this gospel. The verses read afford instruction as to the highest feature of the subject: Christ become Man, seen first as an only-begotten with a father, and then this point enlarged on in chapter 17 in His own words in speaking to His Father as to His glory which the Father should accord Him. He had finished the work that the Father gave Him to do, and He asks for the glory that He had shared along with the Father before the world was. Then He speaks of the glory which had been given Him which He gave to the disciples, and, in verse 24, of the glory which further had been given Him which they were to see. He links this last glory with the love that the Father had for Him before the world was. I thought we might touch the highest features of this subject first, and then work out to its effect in testimony here. Chapter 17 touches a state of deity which taxes us as to our spirituality and understanding.
J.W.D. Do you understand the love wherewith the Father loved Him before the foundation of the world to refer to His deity, or is it anticipative of manhood?
J.T. I think it is what existed then; He was not in manhood then. It is not presented as anticipative love, it is spoken of as existent. "I desire", He says, "that where I am they also may be with me ... for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". It is a love that was existent then, and of course He
{72}
was not Man then. It was a question of love between two Persons. It seems as if it is brought in in the passage read to detain us before the great fact of deity, so far as we may apprehend it. It is indeed apprehended in love.
A.R. It would appear to be a glory existent between Themselves; other glories are in the main relative, in view of our being brought into them.
J.T. Yes; we are brought into the glory of verse 22 because it says, "the glory which thou hast given me I have given them". But verse 24 is what the saints are to see; and the Lord adding that the Father loved Him before the foundation of the world is clearly to detain us in that great position in so far as we can be detained in the presence of Deity, for "He that abides in love abides in God, and God in him", @1 John 4:16. We are not far from Deity in that position of love.
S.P. Is it suggestive that this gospel, being the last written, should deal with this thought of glory? No other gospel develops it as John develops it. Does it not definitely fit in with our day?
J.T. Quite so. The glory of man would find its way into the assembly in the latter days. Royalty was coming into the assembly; the emperor himself presided in the councils; so it was needful that the saints should be established in the glory of Christ.
S.J.H. Are we to understand that the glory to be beheld in verse 24 is the same as the glory asked for in verse 5?
J.T. That I am not prepared to say. It is a glory given in verse 24, and in verse 5 it is a glory asked for that had been His before. It is not presented as a communicated or given glory; it is a glory to which He is reinstated: "and now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". It is not communicated afresh; it is not something attaching to Him as
{73}
given to Him as man, but one returned to Him. Only in the position of dependence, He asks the Father to glorify Him "with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was"; but whether we can behold that I am not prepared to say. There is certainly a strong link between it and the glory in verse 24, a given glory which we behold.
J.W.D. Is not the thought of glory something that shines out and is manifested?
J.T. Yes, it is.
J.W.D. Is this glory "before the world was" in verse 5 attached to inscrutability, or would it be the glory connected with "Let us make man" @Genesis 1:26 in reference to creation, God coming out? What I had in mind was that in some sense, just prior to God's coming out in revelation, you get the idea, "Let us make man". There is counsel, and yet still in deity. Is that not so?
J.T. The question is whether it is definable. "Before the world was" is indefinite and we can hardly add anything. We might say, Did the angels, or anyone see it? The Scriptures do not say. It is what "I had along with thee before the world was"; it was glory, whoever saw it. Why can divine Persons not speak of glory between Themselves?
A.R. Why did He say this before His disciples in relation to the Father?
J.T. I think He would have us linked with Deity in some sense. It is in love. What God is, is essentially beyond us; but then love is of God, and it evidently existed in the divine Persons before incarnation -- even before creation. So I think the link is in love; the understanding is in love.
E.P. How far would the expression in Ephesians go: "Chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love", @Ephesians 1:41. I was thinking of the expression. "in love".
{74}
J.T. That was clearly counsel. It was not yet existent because it referred to creatures; it was contemplated. But this glory existed then, the glory of verse 5; the other is just contemplated. What would you remark further?
E.P. I was just thinking of the expression, "in love"; I was wondering if there would be any connection with this.
J.T. "In love" is counsel. It is actual now, but it is in creatures. It is a question of the work of God, showing, as I was remarking, that the link with the Deity in eternity is love. But this glory of verse 5 does not include the saints, nor does it suggest that they see it. I do not say they do not, but it is a glory by itself not connected with purpose; it existed then whoever saw it. Divine Persons can evidently speak of glory between Themselves -- "the glory which I had along with thee before the world was".
A.B. Would it show to us that there have been no reservations in regard to love? As you have already called attention to, "He that abides in love abides in God, and God in him", @1 John 4:16.
J.T. Yes, quite so. I was just saying that seems to be the link as to us with what is in God. The "with" in verse 5, you will observe, is according to the note, "'along with' as to presence and place". It is a preposition of that kind.
J.W.D. Do you understand that to be connected with His manhood, that as in manhood He desires to take His place in Deity?
J.T. I think so, I think He has gone back on those terms. The link is in His manhood; but is it a glory that He can return to as Man within our range? That is the point, because it says that he "has also ascended up above all the heavens", @Ephesians 4:10 and we do not go beyond all the heavens. It is a question of Deity.
J.W.D. He was always in inscrutable Deity, but
{75}
in that He requested this as Man, would not that involve some relation to the saints?
J.T. It is a question as to whether we are entitled to say that. You see the preposition is "along with" as to presence and place. He has gone beyond all the heavens. Heaven is created; but what is beyond them is not created. We take it to be the uncreated realm which belongs to Deity, and we have to leave it there.
J.W.D. I was just wondering as to the request underlying it. In Ephesians it is in purpose; but here He puts it on the basis of a request.
J.T. But it is a remarkable request. He says, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it; and now glorify *me, thou* Father", ("thou" is remarkable), "along with" (as to presence and place) "thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". It is the same existent glory; it is the same glory He is going into now. To say we can follow that, although it is in manhood, is the question, because He has gone beyond the heavens.
W.L. Do you think the Lord brought this in to guard His deity before His disciples?
J.T. Yes. In verse 24, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" has the same force. That is, there is a guard but it is at the same time a precious thought. It is mentioned in verse 5, but then in verse 24 the idea of love is in it, which seems to be the link as to it in us.
C.A.M. Does it not help to recognize that with divine Persons as such, everything is an eternal now, all is present? The very use of the preposition is for our sake.
J.T. "Before Abraham was, I am" @John 8:58 -- that is the eternal now, as you say; the Person has no beginning or end; it is Deity. The preposition helps us. It is a
{76}
preposition of dignity or equality, one Person over against the Other on equal terms; that is the idea of it. It is what the Lord had along with the Father. Your child may share something with you, but that is not the thought; this is a preposition of equal dignity.
A.R. The Father and the Son are not on equality.
J.T. Not if you look at the relationship; but if you look at the Persons you have equal dignity. "Glorify thy Son" is spoken in the third person; but in verse 5, "Glorify *me, thou* Father", it is Persons of equal dignity. The Lord when He comes down to verse 5 is taking the ground of equality although in sonship. There is personal equality in the use of the pronoun.
J.W.D. What would you say this great thought is intended to produce in us?
J.T. It tends to make us worshipful, a very important matter. Chapter 17 is the proper place to bring it in because the Lord is evidently speaking to His Father in the hearing of His disciples. Although He is Son, and recognises it, yet the Person is understood to be there, and He has it before Him that He is to be glorified by the Father along with the Father, with the glory He had with Him before the world was.
E.P. Is the thought in this chapter that the Lord is here free from limitations? In the preceding chapters, 13 to 16, in speaking to the disciples would not certain limitations be imposed upon Him on account of their condition?
J.T. Quite so; He implies that in certain remarks. But there are no limitations when He is speaking to the Father. And in verse 5 He speaks to the Father on equal personal terms, and He is such a One as can be reinstated in a glory which He shared along with the Father before the world was. In chapter 1
{77}
we read, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God", @John 1:1. "With God" would be personal identification, and then "the Word was God" -- what question can there be about it? If we bear that in mind throughout the gospel we understand verse 5.
S.J.H. Is not the title "Word" something that can be conveyed or communicated?
J.T. That alluded to His position here in manhood; that is where the title came out. The communication was when He was here, an appellation which belongs to Him in manhood, but which is used to identify Him in Deity -- not that "the Word" covers Deity at all -- it is an appellation that belongs to Him as communicating the mind of God here on earth.
A.R. John would have the greatest reverence in his soul as he took account of the Lord Jesus in these verses. He says "we have contemplated his glory" and yet he speaks on another occasion of being on His breast and in His bosom.
J.T. That gives a clue to what is in mind. Spirituality and spiritual intelligence are taxed as looking into this matter. It requires a state of love to look into it.
J.W.D. There will always be something about that great Person that will remind us of His deity, and we shall be able to recognize it.
J.T. It is all there. He says expressly that no one knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals Him; and no one knows the Son but the Father. There is no revelation of the Son at all as to His Person; that should always be in our minds. We are in the presence of a Person who is inscrutable eternally.
J.T.Jr. @Philippians 2:6 opens with, "who, subsisting in the form of God", @Philippians 2:6 subsisting in it; and then the direct allusion to His manhood follows.
{78}
J.T. That is good, it helps the mind. He was "in the form of God", @Philippians 2:6. The word *form* is substantial, not simply external; He was substantially God. The account is that He "emptied himself, taking a bondman's form"; @Philippians 2:7 the word 'form' is the same, He is substantially a bondman too. It is not external, it is real, and this form of God was a real thing. He says as expressing that, "no one knows the Son but the Father"; @Matthew 11:27 not the *word* 'son', but the Person of the Son.
J.T.Jr. As in the form of God it is a glory which seems to contract itself when He becomes a bondman.
J.T. As we proceed in the readings we shall see the contraction or compression in such a Person from the form of God which is infinitely beyond any creature thought. Even in that second form, as bondman, no one knows Him. He is inscrutable, yet He can contract Himself or compress Himself into such smallness that we can take it in. That is what we shall come to in the subsequent consideration of the subject.
Ques. In chapter 1:14 it says, "We have contemplated". Is there the full idea of compression there?
J.T. Quite so: "an only-begotten with a father"; it is in compression but still there is glory attaching to it, that there is One there in manhood able to be with the Father as an only-begotten. He is able to take that place and shine in it.
H.B. Would Thomas's confession in @John 20 have any bearing, in saying, "My Lord and my God"? @John 20:28.
J.T. He was impressed with deity there: I suppose it is an allusion to the remnant by and by, how they will come in to apprehend Christ as their Lord and their God. @Psalm 45 says, "He is thy Lord, and worship thou him", @Psalm 45:11.
{79}
A.R. Would chapter 1:14 be what can be taken in? "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father)".
J.T. Quite so, it can be taken in. It is not the glory of deity, that is, it is not what He was before the world was, with the Father. It is what He is as Man down here as coming within their range. That is really the beginning of the gospel, the thirteen verses that precede this are prefatory. This is the beginning of the gospel from our side.
J.W.D. In what circumstances would this glory of an only-begotten be seen? Would it be our Lord's attitude Godward, as man, or what they generally saw in Him?
J.T. What they saw particularly at certain times; for instance this 17th chapter might enter into that, and other such occasions not recorded when He would be alone with the Father. We are told in @Luke 11 that He was in a certain place praying; they would see that. I am alluding to that only as to what they see. John does not say they contemplated His glory in deity as God; he says, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". That is where we begin; that is the position of christianity.
W.L. Would this chapter 17 be part of the contemplating?
J.T. Quite so. What better illustration could you have than this, His feelings expressed in His visage, because we are told He lifted up His eyes.
J.H. John's disciples said, "where abidest thou?" and the Lord said, "Come and see", @John 1:38,39. What is involved in that?
J.T. That fits in with what we are saying; we begin with what we see. "We have contemplated his glory", and so on. John does not say, 'I, Peter and James, and all the others',
{80}
but it is understood who the *we* are here. It is the beginning of christianity, and the apostles are authoritative persons selected by the Lord to see Him in this way.
J.W.D. Would you say that this glory is entirely unique to Him, or in some sense might we be brought into it?
J.T. Well, it is unique of course. The words are descriptive: the word 'father' here is not *the* Father; that is, it is not formally the Son with the Father. It is ''as of an only-begotten with a father"; it is descriptive and what any person from Adam down would understand. It is the idea of a family; ''as of an only-begotten with a father" is intelligible to every person.
C.A.M. As I understand it, God has brought things about in a finite way in order that love might be known, and these relationships are all that love may be known in the greatest possible way.
J.T. That is the force of this passage. It comes within the range and understanding of every person because every person belongs in some sense to a family. So in testimony it is intelligible to the human race -- glory with a father. 'Only-begotten' would be a son, a masculine thought. Have you something to remark further?
C.A.M. God gets infinite delight in what He has brought into finite conditions because of the essential greatness of what He has brought in.
J.T. That is important, because no creature could afford this joy to his father that is contemplated here. No creature could be this to God -- an only-begotten with a father; the Personality of Christ in manhood underlies the joy the Father has in Him, but still it is in mind that we can be brought into it in a relative way.
W.L. Is it intended to be attractive to us?
{81}
J.T. It is not the first-born here, although the first-born is spoken of too; it is an only one. It is to intensify the thought.
J.W.D. Is it to enter into our worship, as in the hymn, 'And to know the blessed secret of His preciousness to Thee'? (`277:6).
J.T. Quite so.
N.B. What would you say as to @Proverbs 8:30, "Then I was by him his nursling, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him"? @Proverbs 8:30.
J.T. Well, of course that is wisdom personified. I should not like to bring it into this. It is anticipative. It is wisdom personified, and Jehovah in that chapter is Christ Himself. Everything was made by Him and wisdom was of Him. It is not easy to get it into our minds perhaps, but anyone who would look at @Proverbs 8 would see that Jehovah is the Operator, and @John 1 says everything was made by Christ. Wisdom is contemplated as a person, so we have to bear in mind that if it is wisdom as in Christ, it would be Christ as Man anticipatively: but it was there when Christ was making the worlds. "Daily his delight", @Proverbs 8:30 and "my delights were with the sons of men", @Proverbs 8:31, would bring out what wisdom is.
A.H.P. Would it be right to say that @John 17 would give us to understand that lying behind every revealed or acquired glory was the glory that belonged to divine Persons? There may be much that we share and behold and enjoy as with Christ, but what was in the mind of divine Persons is peculiar to Themselves.
J.T. We must always remember that. I think it is important to keep in mind that John begins with Christ's glory. Our minds should be imbued with it in considering all that follows.
A.B. Would the import of this verse be seen in connection with the Word as "with God", but now become flesh, come into expression?
{82}
J.T. That is good. It does not say the Word became man; the word used is 'flesh', it is a condition intelligible to us, that is, within the creature's range; this is a condition which Christ took in incarnation.
J.S.T. How does that link on with chapter 17: "The men whom thou gavest me"? Is it a mature thought?
J.T. Chapter 17 is mature throughout. This is the beginning, that "we have contemplated his glory, the glory as of an only-begotten with a father". That contemplates Christ with God as man, not only a first-born, but an only-begotten.
J.W.D. Does this thought of man convey the thought of substantiality?
J.T. It does. That is, "the Word became flesh" is substantial. It is a practical expression, as John says in his epistle: "that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life", @1 John 1:1. That is what is contemplated in christianity; the disciples begin to see that.
J.W.D. Is not the idea of a man the basic thought? It is men that are sons, not children.
J.T. So that chapter 17 is "the men whom thou gavest me", showing they have come up to this now. In chapter 16 the Lord contemplates a man born into the world. The word 'child' is used first as to travail but the product is a man. You can see what the link is in the Lord's mind; and in chapter 17 those whom the Father gave Him were men through that ordeal. We come into manhood through pressure.
W.B. Why is the term "Holy Father" used?
J.T. We were referring to verse 6: "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world"; that is the first indication. You can understand that holiness would be essential; it is touched on later.
{83}
Ques. Would the sufferings include Gethsemane and the cross?
J.T. That is what He is speaking of in chapter 16; manhood is developed in chapter 16 out of pressure. The metaphor used is universally known, that of a child born, but then it is a *man* born into the world. That is the result the Lord has in mind. He does not continue the idea of a child; it is the product through pressure. He applies it to them: they were men through pressure.
E.P. Do you get this idea of substantiality in glory? I was thinking of Paul's expression, "eternal weight of glory", @2 Corinthians 4:17.
J.T. Quite so. Weight certainly involves substantiality.
Ques. You mentioned in your prayer the complicated affairs around us. Is that intended of God to make men of us?
J.T. I think so. I think the whole position today is that we may come into the truth that is ministered to us. I never knew of a period of greater pressure than at present, both in the assembly and in the nations; I am sure it is to effect manhood in the saints. Pressure is the way to it. That is what the Lord speaks of in chapter 16 in the metaphor He uses; He speaks of a man born into the world, and then He says, verse 20, "But the world shall rejoice; and ye will be grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy", @John 16:20. And then after the metaphor, He goes on to say in verse 22, "Ye now therefore have grief; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you", @John 16:22. That is what He has in mind, that they would come into actual manhood through the pressure, and He would crown it by appearing to them. There will be the joy of His presence after they have been through it. The Lord called Peter and all of them one after the other, and the pressure was consequent; but this peculiar
{84}
pressure in Gethsemane is what He has in mind here, that they would come out of that, and that they would see Him, be equal to it, and rejoice.
A.H.P. From chapter 13 the Lord's service amongst the disciples is an ascending one; His serving them as washing their feet finds its climax in chapter 16 in the thought of manhood. Would that enter into chapter 17, in the Lord speaking to the Father?
J.T. It does clearly. Verse 6 comes after the preliminary great thoughts of eternal life connected with Him as seen in effecting things for the Father. Then He comes down to what He has in mind, "the men whom thou gavest me out of the world". It does not say 'out of heaven', although that in a certain sense is true also, but "out of the world".
A.H.P. We are made to feel in reading @John 17 the need of spiritual manhood to understand it.
J.T. It is not simply that you are in the relation of son, but it is the quality of man through pressure; and I believe the present state of things is intended for that, that brethren through this pressure should come into practical manhood -- what God would make us in suffering excruciating things at times, but God is making us so that we are given to Christ under these circumstances.
C.A.M. When you think of the great idea of pressure, I suppose the thought of love is in mind. It would not be primarily that God has an adversary or that the question of good and evil has to be solved. Would you not say it was necessary in order that love should be understood in its emotional character?
J.T. Quite so. But the question is how much can we stand under pressure, because the first thought with us in pressure is to be relieved. But it has to be. You are not to be relieved, because it is a question of what is being made. The pressure of what is
{85}
being made in the earth, who can see? Geologists know a good deal, no doubt, but it suggests what is developed. Diamonds and other precious stones are undoubtedly the outcome of heat and pressure. Creation affords abundant illustrations of what God is doing spiritually, and if He is putting us into tight places it is to form us, getting us to throw off what is inflationary and take on what is reduceable -- what can be reduced and at the same time refined.
C.A.M. God can get what is infinite out of what is finite, but is it not remarkable that the metaphor used in this matter of pressure in @John 16 involves the expectancy which makes us hope and know that it is worth while?
J.T. "The joy"! It is the great thought from eternity, "My delights were with the sons of men", @Proverbs 8:31. They are not created; they are developed. There is the family thought; there is the creative and the progenitive. "Sons of men" is what wisdom delighted in.
Rem. "I and the lad will go yonder and worship", @Genesis 22:5. The lad would possibly suggest this side of it; he had to learn what the wood was and the binding.
J.T. That is very good. Abraham and the lad went to the mount appointed, and on the way they talked about one thing and another but the lad enquired about the wood. He was in the enquiring attitude; he was in the making attitude, for he saw there was a Iamb required for a burnt offering, and he was bound to that altar. Joseph too, when he was taken by his brothers -- what anxiety of soul! It refers to it afterwards as the anguish of his soul. It says too, that the iron entered into his soul. But see what kind of a man we get out of it! "God sent me before you to preserve life", @Genesis 45:5. So God is aiming at getting men, those who can do things, and through whom God can do things.
S.P. Does God take account of pressure that comes on us as a result of breakdown, to work out
{86}
His own ends? With David it does not say, 'Thou art the one', but Nathan says, "Thou art the man!" @2 Samuel 12:7. Then the child dies, and David lies on the earth and refuses to take food, and refuses to be comforted. Perhaps Jehovah will have mercy! Then the next thing is that Solomon comes in.
J.T. That is a very good and instructive line of thought. David was a man. God took him up as a man. His name signified that he was loved from the outset, and his qualities are given immediately. He was a man when he entered into this terrible conduct, and now, is he to be less? No, he is to be more a man than ever. So @Psalm 51 is not written immediately, it is when he is able to say, "I have sinned". He said that to Nathan, and that is the real man. @Psalm 51 is the product of a real man, and all generations these hundreds of years have been provided with expression for their manhood from that psalm.
Ques. Would the product be seen in relation to the joy that you are referring to in chapter 16? It does not read that she does not have trouble, but "she no longer remembers the trouble, on account of the joy that a man has been born into the world", @John 16:21.
J.T. Quite so.
E.P. Is that seen in Hannah's song? She celebrates the man child. She says, "The pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them", @1 Samuel 2:8. Do you think that was through pressure?
J.T. Hannah and Mary the mother of our Lord should be linked together in that way to bring out manhood in a sister. They are remarkable women because they bring out the qualities of manhood. They were both women of pressure so that Mary the mother of our Lord is able to say, "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour", @Luke 1:46,47. It shows she is able to
{87}
discriminate as to what is within her; she is a product of @Romans 7.
J.W.D. Is that idea connected with the acacia wood underlying the gold in the tabernacle system?
J.T. That is right; but at Marah I think the thing is that it was shown: "Jehovah shewed" Moses wood (@Exodus 15). It does not say it was acacia wood. Why did not Moses see it? It was there but he had to be shown this peculiar character of manhood coming out in Christ. He had to be shown, and I believe that would underlie the whole tabernacle system -- it is manhood, the boards are standing up. And they are big boards; you would wonder what kind of acacia trees could be had in the wilderness to provide boards a cubit and a half broad.
J.S.T. Is it instructive in @John 17 that the men received the word? I was thinking of the acacia wood. The Lord says, "I am glorified in them".
J.T. I am glad you bring that up because we want to see christianity here. We must find persons who have "received". So Paul says, "There are gods many, and lords many, yet to us there is one God, the Father", @1 Corinthians 8:5. "To us"; we must get the *us*: that is the people that have received. So John develops that in saying, "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God", @John 1:12,13. That is the idea.
J.T.Jr. Was that showing itself in Israel when David began to come to the fore even while Saul was still king? That element began to be seen in the people receiving David.
J.H. It was seen in a peculiar position of pressure; there was a murderous man by him all the time. David was in the house and Saul took a javelin to smite him against the wall. That is where manhood is developed; it was there but it was developed.
{88}
@Psalm 51 should be contemplated as to how we come out under pressure, and indeed all the psalms. David may have been the editor of all the books of the Psalms, but the first book is all David's, you might say.
J.T.Jr. He says, "In pressure thou hast enlarged me", @Psalm 4:1. Would you say that in the pressure God was having His way with him?
J.T. Very good, that is @Psalm 4.
H.B. Is there something analogous in the book of Malachi? You get the refiner's fire, the fuller's lye, and God sparing a man as a father spares a son.
J.T. Very good. "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau", @Malachi 1:3. Genesis showed a man and God says, I love him. That is in the last book of the Old Testament.
A.R. @1 Chronicles 12 gives a list of men who came to David in the pressure. Would @John 16 show those who were with the Lord in His pressure too?
J.T. Just so.
J.W.D. What was your thought about the glory that can be shared and the glory that can be contemplated?
J.T. Chapter 17 as a whole -- this range of glory -- gives the Lord's own words in speaking to His Father in presence of His disciples. He tells His Father what eternal life is. Why does He do that? "And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" (verse 3). He is telling it to His Father in their hearing. That is the moral side; that is really the basis of the chapter -- eternal life. In it we are really delivered from idolatry in the true man in Christ; and we are then ready for all these glories that follow. Eternal life is deliverance; it is an out of the world state of things. I am thus able to take in these glories that belong to another world. So He goes on to the very top of things in verse 5, and
{89}
then comes down to the men, and tells His Father what kind of men they are (verses 6 - 12). And then He goes on in verse 22 to say, "And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them"; He is telling this to the Father. If He were telling it to Peter, Peter might say, 'What did you give us, Lord?'. His Father would understand that in His attitude of mind towards His apostles He was clothing them with sonship, and they were the recipients of it. In verse 24 it is the glory that they are to see, and He links it with love, saying the Father loved Him before the world was.
E.P. In this thought of the Lord's speaking to His Father with these desires in His heart, is there any kindred thought in what Paul says, "He is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day"? Would Paul's desires for the saints be included in that?
J.T. Quite so. "He is able to keep" them; the Lord has kept the men, you mean? How much you can put into all this, into these words of the Lord to His Father! Now if we are on Ephesian ground we can enter into this in some little way. We are ready for it, to fill it out in our measure.
A.R. Say a word on verses 22 and 23, "That they may be perfected into one". What is your thought as to that?
J.T. "And that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me". It is clearly our position in testimony there but it is great elevation. It is the testimony issuing out of the persons who are glorified with the glory He gave them. It lifts the testimony up to a high level. The consequence is that the world knows "that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me". It seems to me that the Lord is bringing them to that in the understanding of sonship and the testimony that flows out of it.
{90}
A.R. Verse 21 says, "That they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us". Is the idea that the thing is working out reciprocally amongst us, and clothing each one of us with this glory?
J.T. One of the most difficult things I think is to look at the saints rightly. Brethren come together: how do I look at them? How do I clothe them in my mind? That is the point. The glory He gave Christ in testimony God gives us.
A.B. "The words" -- divine communications -- would bear upon that. It says, "They have received them".
J.T. Very important -- receiving His words, the words He had given them. What you receive gives character to you, so that christianity is verified in persons who have received it. And then verse 24 is the climax to all this, the glory that is seen in Christ, and the link with the past eternity before the foundation of the world. The 'foundation' being brought in in verse 24 shows that the Lord is coming down to concrete facts. It is the thing concretely as having a foundation; you can build where there is a foundation.
Rem. You spoke about "the Word was with God", @John 1:1. We are not able to look back into that condition, but verse 24 would link us on with it in love.
J.T. We are set up in that way in love in relation to Deity.
{91}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (2)
@John 2:11; @John 11:4,45 - 48; @John 12:10 - 19
J.T. For those who were not present this morning it may be said that we are considering the glory of Christ in John's gospel. We took up the highest feature this morning, the glory which He had along with the Father, as He says, before the world was. He asks the Father to glorify Him with that glory, according to chapter 17:5. We dwelt on chapter 1:14, introducing the disciples to this great subject. "We have contemplated his glory", @John 1:14 the writer says, "a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", alluding to Christ in flesh; as it says, "And the Word became flesh", a condition that is intelligible to man.
What is in mind now is to show how, as in this incarnate condition, He became an Object of faith, and that is why the verse in chapter 2 is suggested: "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him" (verse 11). There can be no doubt of the bearing of this verse on the last days, our days, inasmuch as it is a question of *disciples* believing. They had believed, or they would not be disciples even in name; but evidently they had not believed in the full sense hitherto. Now the manifestation of His glory calls forth true faith on Him. It is "on him", He was to become an Object of faith, a Person to be believed on.
Then chapters 11 and 12 are to develop this thought of *believing on Christ*. He is manifesting His glory in the signs, so that He regards Lazarus¬ illness as simply an occasion for the glory of God: "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it".
Ques. You make an important point of this believing on Him. What does that mean?
{92}
J.T. That He is an Object of faith as God had been. It says later, "Ye believe on God, believe also on me" @John 14:1. It is not only a matter of trust, as believing in a person, but putting your confidence in a person, that Person becoming an Object for faith; indeed the fact that He is this involves His deity.
Rem. Paul says, "I know whom I have believed", @2 Timothy 1:12.
J.T. Well, I think that is another phase of the matter. It means to believe a person or thing, such as 'believe his writings' or 'my words'; it is there more a question of believing or trusting His veracity, the assurance of what He says or does. It is a different preposition here, it is "on"; the movement of the mind is towards that Person. It is to believe on Him in a general way as an Object of faith for man, such as God is. It brings out, I think, christianity. These signs that He did were the manifestation of His glory, His glory in the sense that He exercised divine power and became, therefore, an Object of faith.
W.L. Does chapter 2 emphasise the manhood of Christ, that is, *Jesus*? "This beginning of signs did Jesus".
J.T. Quite so; of course 'Jesus' is very frequently used by John to designate the Person known here below.
A.R. Do you think you might say that from Abraham on God established confidence in persons, whereas the thing is now set out in Christ in manhood, so that the Jewish mind is transferred to the Person of Christ?
J.T. Yes. It is a great matter that such a One as He was that -- the Man Jesus, the Man known among them, not simply "the Word became flesh", @John 1:14 but known by this name, by the historical name given to Him.
{93}
A.H.P. Does the man in chapter 9 amplify that thought? The Lord having found him asked him, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" @John 9:35.
J.T. That amplifies it and brings in the thought of sonship.
A.B. Does it help to see that the preposition 'on' is the same as in chapter 1: "who is in the bosom of the Father"? @John 1:18. It is a continuation of that in relation to the disciples.
J.T. Yes; the idea is the movement of the mind towards an object; the preposition means that -- the movement of the mind in the matter of faith towards that Person. He acquires that status through the signs, so that the movement of the mind is toward the Person.
E.P. Is there some kindred thought in "those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", @2 Timothy 2:22? I was thinking of your reference to the last days and the disciples believing on Him.
J.T. Calling on Him is the same idea; it brings in His exercise of power. Here He has become the Object of faith; He has that status as God has.
H.B. Would you say why the locality is mentioned?
J.T. Well, there is another sign there, you know, later on. It was to carry forward the accumulative evidence of what He is. There is another side in chapter 4, that is to say a family side -- the man's house. It is the same town and brings out the importance of localities, because while God defends the truth in general, yet where certain things happen in a locality we have to inquire why it is so.
If we were publishing an account of what we are saying now in London, Ontario, you might say, Of what importance is that? Leave out the name, London, that is nothing. But it may be something,
{94}
because localities have histories and the history of the place gives us some idea of why the truth is stated in that place; there is some reason for it. At Cana of Galilee there was a marriage, which is a very common thing, but there was never one like that, and it becomes amplified into the millennium. It is the last wine which is His best: that which is last is best. Then we have a child raised up there, and in the status of a son, the child of a nobleman, all pointing to millennial glory.
A.R. What you say about localities is very important, for Paul at Corinth could not say what he could say at Ephesus.
J.T. Quite so, and what he says at Corinth had a meaning because of local conditions there.
S.J.H. You are connecting reproach with Galilee, but then Cana is mentioned as well.
J.T. Quite so, it was Cana of Galilee. It was evidently a characteristic town of Galilee. Galilee means reproach, but Cana was a certain place there. The marriage might have been thought little of and the nobleman might have been thought little of, but the Spirit of God brings them in. The Spirit of God is intensely practical.
J.W.D. Do you think that at the time when John wrote this gospel christianity was becoming a series of abstract thoughts? Do you not think this outshining of divine glory must be worked out in connection with local conditions?
J.T. I think so; the instance at Cana is remarkable. We are apt to be extreme about prohibition and about nobility; but it says, "He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine". @John 4:46. Notice the link between these instances. It goes on, "And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick. He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him and asked him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die. Jesus therefore said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe. The courtier says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die. Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way. But already, as he was going down, his servants met him and brought him word saying, Thy child lives. He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. The father therefore knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house. This second sign again did Jesus, being come out of Judaea into Galilee", @John 4:46 - 54.
{95}
So that this was another connection with Cana. A nobleman or courtier is apt to be criticised in our minds, because we are apt to be radical, but radicalism is leaven. Or, we might say, We are prohibitionists; but we are simply leavened with wrong thoughts.
J.S.T. In this second instance is there the suggestion that the belief is reaching a wider radius than the disciples? In the first case it was the disciples, but here it says the courtier believed His word.
J.T. This courtier is an important man, not because he is a nobleman but because such a man as he should get blessing, because he is a genuine case. We are told, "he believed, himself and his whole house" @John 4:53; it is his whole house now. The jailer is near this but hardly so pronounced because the jailer "rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God", @Acts 16:34. It is the jailer's joy and faith householdly, but here it is that everyone in that house is a believer -- the whole house believed.
J.R.H. The steps describing this person are very interesting; first the courtier, then the man and then the father.
{96}
J.T. Yes, and the Lord called the child a son. His father called him a child: "Come down ere my child die"; @John 4:49 it is a diminutive thought. But the Lord has a wider, bigger, greater thought; He says, "Thy son lives", so that Cana of Galilee is ennobled in this way. The courtier lived in Capernaum; he lived away down. He said to the Lord, "come down". The Lord was in Cana when the thing happened but the Lord did not go down, He said, "Thy son lives", and in that hour the thing happened; so that it is to bring out the glory of Christ; that is the point, and there is believing too. It is a question of where we are in these matters. We get into the current of things in John's gospel; faith is a current matter and we want to get into it. This courtier comes into it and I believe his is the only household in all of the gospels that is spoken of in this way.
J.W.D. Why is it that the question of prohibition is such a difficult matter among us?
J.T. It requires consideration; one does not like to bring it in much. It is a real leaven; it condemns the Lord, and we think we are virtuous because of it.
J.W.D. Would you say that sort of thing hinders the light of Christ's glory being understood?
J.T. It does; it reflects on His glory, because the occasion in Cana is the beginning of signs; and it was no small quantity -- a large quantity of water was turned into wine. It is mentioned in chapter 4:46, "He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine", @John 4:46.
S.P. Jesus says, "Thy son lives"; the father would take on a greater apprehension of him as a son than as a child.
J.T. He would, and he would never be a prohibitionist. The Spirit of God connects the two signs together, it is a twin sign.
Judaism is very pronounced among the brethren. As coming into the households it means the children
{97}
are not brought up rightly; they are not brought up in a balanced way. Temperance, or self-control, is the word. I am to look at things that God recognises and give thanks for them, and use them as they should be used.
A.R. What was Jewish in Galatia was a far worse epidemic than it was in Corinth.
J.T. Yes; judaism, legalism, that is what it was.
Rem. You remember the instance of king Saul, he would not let the people eat. I was wondering whether that would suggest the judaising error.
J.T. It is in @1 Samuel 14. Saul in that particular case is putting something on; he is doing his best to appear religious. It is the first altar he built and he sent for the ark. He is trying his best to be religious. Jonathan began to use what belonged to Canaan, the flowing of the honey in the land of Canaan, and Saul says, You must not touch that. But Scripture says, "Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and to choose the good", @Isaiah 7:15. Think of how far judaism will go!
C.A.M. Judaism carried to the full would rob the Lord of His glory.
J.T. Quite so, that is what they were doing in Galatia. So that He manifested His glory in this beginning of signs in Cana of Galilee and His disciples believed on Him; so that the point here is to be really disciples.
J.T.Jr. Wine would speak of joy. In Jotham's parable, @Judges 9:13, the vine says, "Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man?" @Judges 9:13. Is there not that thought introduced in the wine by the Lord, what is to exhilarate God and the saints?
J.T. Quite so, and to carry it on into the millennium. It carries the thought of joy, introduced on earth through Christ, to millennial joy; the marriage should be characterised by it.
{98}
S.J.H. What is the thought of "manifested"? Is it something more than revelation?
J.T. It is something that can be seen. It is a word John uses. "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world", @John 17:6 as we had this morning. That is, the Father is brought out before them so as to be seen, so much so that in chapter 14:9 the Lord says, "He that has seen me has seen the Father" @John 14:9; and again in chapter 21:14, "This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among the dead" @John 21:14. It is what can be seen; anyone who has eyes to see can see it.
J.R.H. Would you encourage us to look for manifestations of His glory in our meetings?
J.T. Indeed I would. One has seen it many a time, the way the Lord comes in, and at an extremity too. It is remarkable sometimes at meetings how we find ourselves in a tight place; that is how they were at the marriage: they had no wine, a critical state at a wedding! The Lord is told by His mother, "They have no wine". Perhaps she thought she had special influence with Him, but He says, "What have I to do with thee, woman?" @John 2:3,4. It is not to be on the line of nature, but still He takes notice of it. The vessels were there. What would happen in meetings unless there were some brothers the Lord could fall back on? They are not saying anything maybe, but they are there, and He says, "Fill the water-vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he says to them, Draw out now", @John 2:7,8. It is a remarkable scene! So that we have plenty of wine, the best that has ever been. That often happens: at the end of a meeting you get the best. Sometimes the Lord allows the liberty to drop and the brethren get humbled and exercised, and presently He moves. There is no doubt about it -- the glory is there.
C.A.M. This is a crisis, and also as to the child.
{99}
J.T. This gospel is full of crises, and every one brings out the glory of Jesus in order that we should believe. That is why I thought we might have chapters 11 and 12 because they bring this great point out strikingly. There is a crisis in the house of three that are lovers of Christ; one of them is sick. Great anxiety comes in you may be sure with the other two, but the Lord says, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it", @John 11:4. The Son of God is glorified but it is for the glory of God. That opens up one of the most interesting parts of the gospel; so many are brought into it -- the disciples, Thomas, Lazarus, Mary, Martha and the Jews. The outcome is the supper in chapter 12; it is not any longer Cana, it is now Bethany; then finally the Lord enters into Jerusalem. All this is the wonderful opening up of the glory of God in the glory of the Son of God. Faith is springing up all around. Lazarus was at table with Him. The point is to get into this current in John's gospel so that we may be real believers, not merely coming to meetings like this in a social way. Young people do it, but let us come in faith, so that faith may grow up and be in our souls and that we may observe what the Lord can do for us.
J.W.D. What particular features are connected with the idea of the glory of the Son of God?
J.T. The section begins with that really. Chapter 5 of course opens up the doctrine of the Son of God. The 6th, 7th and 8th are full of the doctrine of His Person, but it is worked out in remarkable settings in opposition to Christ, so that He is, as it were, forced to bring out the fact that "Before Abraham was, I am", @John 8:58. That is chapter 8:58. The man in chapter 9 is blind, not because he had sinned or his parents, "but that the works of God should be manifested in Him" @John 9:3. So that in these chapters, 9 to 12, it is
{100}
a question of divine sovereignty occasioning conditions in which to display itself; so that we have a blind man for that purpose and then a sick man. The sick man gives occasion for the glory of God, "that the Son of God may be glorified by it", @John 11:4. That is what we have to look at for the time left us, because it is the richest field there is in the gospel on this thought.
C.A.M. Do I understand your thought that chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 are the light or doctrine as to the Person? After that we have the idea of receiving; there is something living received by the persons. This man in @John 9 sees the greatness of the Person of Christ, the Son of God; he received it through his faculty of seeing. Does that start a course of reception?
J.T. Quite so. The great fundamental word "received" that comes at the end of the preface (@John 1:12) is to bring out what receivers of Christ come into, that is, the place of children. This man received his sight. Tell us more.
C.A.M. I thought that was what was in mind, the receptive faculty was brought into living operation in chapter 9.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord says to him in verse 35, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?" "Thou, dost thou" @John 9:35, that is, the man is distinguished. The chapter shows what he is; his very existence is to become the occasion of the manifestation of the work of God, and he is proving that. The "thou" brings him into prominence. The Lord says "thou" twice, it is emphasised, as He might say to anyone in such circumstances, You are a man of distinction. Not that He would inflate us at all, but you are a man coming into prominence now, you need to pay attention because you may miss the mark. He has done well, he has been cast out of the synagogue; he has been distinguished so far, very wonderfully so,
{101}
and all through his own loyalty and veracity in regard to the truth. Now that he is alone what will happen to him? He is detached -- a dangerous position, and the Lord knows that. We must all be attached.
E.P. Does this bring in the thought of distinction in the spiritual realm? "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?" @John 9:35.
J.T. Quite so, that is what I was thinking. In the New Translation it is an emphatic "thou", meaning that you have distinction. You get it by loyalty to the truth as you follow it. He was cast out; that is distinction, to be cast out of the religious world; but then, can you stay out? If you are detached from that you must be attached somewhere else or you are liable to drift away. Who can stand alone? "And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he", @John 9:37. That is, attachment is involved; no one could be more attached than to be brought into association with the Son of God! So he says, "And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? And Jesus said to him, Thou has both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage", @John 9:36 - 38.
J.R.H. It is beautiful how the Lord attaches Himself to one who is wholly detached.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord brings Himself near to us and says, I am the One who is speaking *with you;* and the man says, "I believe, Lord", and he worships Him. That is the way with God; the Lord would make worshippers out of us on those lines.
A.R. In delivering this man, it is not only from what is Jewish, but also from what is sectarian. We are not being delivered to set up another sect; the Lord is becoming the centre of a new universe.
{102}
J.T. Quite so. We are brought into a new world really, in believing on the Son of God; so that makes way for chapter 11.
There are three persons in Bethany, and the Lord loves them and would like to go and see them; but the glory of God is to shine there, the glory of the Son of God must come in: "that the Son of God may be glorified by it". That is chapter 12.
A.H.P. Much transpires in the two days that the Lord remains away: the person is allowed to die, and the disciples, the Jews and the sisters are brought to a very extreme point. They say, "Could not this man, who has opened the eyes of the blind man, have caused that this man also should not have died?" @John 11:37. What would be the import of allowing that?
J.T. It is all on the line of which we are speaking. Things must happen to bring out this great thought -- the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by these circumstances. So the Lord is not in a hurry to go, suggesting to us that in localities we have to let things work themselves out. You might send a good doctor to help Lazarus, but the Lord is not doing anything. Somebody may say, We cannot let things go on like this! But we might spoil the thing by coming in. Sometimes brothers from a distance come into a locality to work things out, but the Lord is staying away here. If God's glory is going to be seen it has to be worked out locally. Of course we should avail ourselves in such cases of brothers who have the word of wisdom or the gift of government.
A.H.P. We often find that if sounds of alarm are raised brothers begin to move around to seek to put a matter right.
J.T. It is a question of what brothers they are, whether they are fitted of God to help.
Rem. It is a common complaint!
J.T. Yes, it is; but here the Lord is told about the matter; the sisters sent to Him saying, "Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When therefore he heard, He is sick, he remained two days then in the place where he was" @John 11:3 - 6.
{103}
Those two days are to let the matter work out, because not only is Lazarus to die, but he is to be four days in the grave to bring out this great matter.
Ques. Would those two days amplify His glory?
J.T. They are intended to do that. The Lord could have gone there and kept him from dying -- that would have been glory; but that was not enough, because He had healed other sick people. He had healed the nobleman's son and kept him from dying, but this time it is not that, but *resurrection*! That is the full thought. So he is not only to die, but to be buried; he is in the tomb four days!
E.P. Is that the reason why Paul goes on to chapter 15 of the first epistle to the Corinthians? Resurrection is in mind.
J.T. They needed that great truth developed because they were ignorant of God. It was a question of the glory of God and that the Son of God might be glorified thereby; all these thoughts must become facts. The Lord waited until they became facts, and now He comes. It brings out where Martha and Mary were, and above all, it brings out the tears of Jesus. It is a wonderful scene! "Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done, believed on him; but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. The chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs. If we let him thus alone, all will believe on him" (verses 45 - 48). So that it is a question of believing on Him through all this, and in
{104}
chapter 12 Lazarus himself is the occasion of persons believing.
A.R. Has this in view the raising of all the saints in order that the Lord may become attractive to us as the Centre?
J.T. And it is the proof that He is the Son of God. What enters into the testimony of the gospel is this fact of Lazarus and others like him. Faith is in that connection. He is declared to be "Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead", @Romans 1:4. Lazarus was really dead. The word 'dead' is plural in @Romans 1; that word 'dead' is very solemn. Death is so common that we hardly stop to think of it, but what a real thing it us!
J.S.T. Lazarus is risen, raised from the dead; would that help us in regard to testimony?
J.T. It does; he was the dead Lazarus but he is raised. He carries forward the thought of death in regard to the town, but nevertheless he is a raised man, and therefore the whole of chapter 12 down to the verses read is to bring out this great matter of the glory of the Son of God, and that in Bethany. Bethany becomes a greater town than Cana! I think the brethren ought to look into the importance of localities, because of what state may be there or because of what God may have done there. There was no thought of the Lord going back to Cana to be entertained as he was entertained in Bethany. It brings out the comparative value of localities. Localities are always under the eye of the Lord.
S.McC. Why is it called "the village of Mary and Martha her sister"? @John 11:1.
J.T. Because it is their town; if you apply the idea of the local assembly, it is the idea that there are such sisters as those there. The town is taking character from them, and the Lord is going to add to that. Where He has His way He is given occasion
{105}
and opportunity for the glory of God to shine and the glory of the Son of God. Would you not like to be in a meeting like that?
J.W.D. So that in every locality this lesson must be learned.
J.T. We should leave the locality in the Lord's hands, so that He may work out what He has in His mind. Of course, if a man has a gift of government, or the word of wisdom, then his word should be taken account of in these matters; the Lord has provided him too; but let us let the Lord work the thing out. That is the great truth or principle that was developed in Glanton. Many here may know that Alnwick meeting was not very much; it broke down outwardly and brethren in Glanton settled it by letting the ones they thought were right come over and break bread with them. They took the matter out of the Lord's hands and the Lord did not allow that. The Lord put the meeting right at Alnwick, and He can put any meeting right if we leave the thing and let Him work it out, even if the brethren there are not very intelligent.
A.A.T. Is that why Paul did not go to Corinth?
J.T. He might have gone there and settled the matter but he let the thing work out, and it did work out. They were repentant!
S.P. Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. I suppose it links with the Galilean position. I suppose we are inclined to think little of those who are small.
J.T. I have often thought of that. Galilee was under reproach anyway. There used to be a time when this country, especially the United States, was under reproach in that way and rightly, in that sense; but still the Lord always defends what is His own. It is like Moses¬ second wife; apparently she was not very much, according to the way Miriam would value things, but Moses had married her and
{106}
the Lord came down to the tent door to rebuke Miriam. So that it shows that if we are extreme in describing what is of God, however poor it may be, the Lord defends it.
@John 12 is written to show how distinguished the meeting in Bethany was. "Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany". It was six days before He died, and at the end of that week we have what is called Good Friday. This is called Holy Week and last Sunday was called Palm Sunday. That is what the religious world is made up of. At Bethany there is not an atom of what is here in the religious world; it is all outside of what is just judaism. The spiritual thought of @John 11 and 12 has been judaised; it has lost its power, whereas our reading is to bring the thing back to us.
What a scene this is! Oh, that the meeting in London might be the occasion of a scene like this! "Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among the dead. There therefore they made him a supper" (@John 12:1,2). It is just what He values. There is one there who has been learning from Him and it becomes the opportunity for her to show how much she loves Christ. She has kept the pound up to this time, and in this way the glory is more delightful in this place as in her pound of ointment. The house is filled with the glory! It is the glory of Christ but carried through the hair of Mary; the house is full of it. She wiped His feet with her hair; she is in it, the saints are in it, as well as the Lord.
J.T.Jr. The feminine side is able to function now as the masculine side is put right.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. In chapter 11 it says, "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus". @John 11:5. I was wondering
{107}
whether chapter 12 is the reciprocal side, the returning of the love.
J.T. The point is they are worth loving, because in the beginning of chapter 11 we are told that Mary does this act. This instance enters into the whole position anticipatively; the Lord is going to reach this point in what He is doing. In the beginning of chapter 11 they are lovable, but particularly so in this scene depicted in chapter 12.
C.A.M. It is a striking thing that the word 'cosmetic' seems to be derived from 'cosmos' (the word for 'world'; it is connected with a woman's world); but here we have, as it were, a world for the glory of the Son of God.
J.T. Your reference to cosmetics, tell us more about that.
C.A.M. I am only referring to what you said about the hair of this woman, that it contributed in this scene of glory to the greatness of the Person of Christ.
J.T. Of course the cosmetics of the world today are repugnant.
C.A.M. So that in the use of them Satan is endeavouring to deprive Christ of this glory that Mary gives Him.
J.T. Quite so; she laid down her glory -- her hair is her glory -- she prostrated that at the feet of the Lord, and then the fragrance poured out.
J.W.D. The word 'therefore' in this passage is worthy of note.
J.T. Yes, it is a sequential passage. It is full of sequence. It is the fullest instance we have of the subject before us, and 'therefore' coming in indicates that one thing is promoting another. Everyone is shining at his best -- not at his best naturally but spiritually -- except Judas. You might say he is at his worst. The unspiritual man is exposed in such a scene as this!
{108}
J.T.Jr. Would you say that Lazarus would set out the masculine side that goes through death before it becomes effective; and then the feminine side comes up in a subjective way?
J.T. That is very good, the blending of the masculine and feminine side. Then we are told they were going to kill Lazarus because many believed on Jesus on account of him. And then we have what happened on the morrow (verse 12) with which Lazarus is connected in verses 17 and 18: "The crowd therefore that was with him bore witness because he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from among the dead. Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign", @John 12:17,18. That is what happens on the morrow. There is prolongation of the thought of the glory, the power to carry the thing forward. Now at the passover everything was to be burnt up, that is a finished matter; but that does not mean that power is not carried forward from feast to feast. There is great power in this feast at Bethany; it is six days before the passover, and there is one here who has got something that she has kept for a great occasion. This is a great occasion, six days before the time, and she has intelligence to know that it will be acceptable before the time. It is feelings and intelligence in Mary; she had kept it for the day of His burial, but it is acceptable before. You may have something for a later occasion but the Lord would give you to know that He can use it now, and she does it, and it is the great feature of the occasion. The fragrance of it fills the house!
Now on the morrow the thought of Lazarus is carried on, the masculine side. They want to kill him; he is suffering with Christ. "On the morrow a great crowd who came to the feast, having heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem, took branches of palms and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna, blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel. And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it; as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt" (verses 12 - 15).
{109}
That is, there is a great current of interest flowing. The devil is working in Judas and he is working in the chief priests, but the current is too strong, they are not gaining at all. The current is strong and the crowd have got palms, that is, a sense of victory in the position. There is prolongation of a great occasion, it is carried forward, extended, and the palms are brought in. "And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it". It is most important to get the fulness of the thought here of the glory of Christ, how the Son of God is glorified. He comes in at the right time Himself to bring it in, because we may be lacking in some point, although generally right. The Lord sees there is something needed and He finds the young ass; it is not provided by anyone, *He* finds it!
A.R. Is that why He says, "Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt"?
J.T. It is a quotation of Scripture: the cry, "Hosanna, blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel", is a psalm brought into the position. The Lord values that. If we are going on well in a locality the Scripture must fit into the matter. They are quoting @Psalm 118:26, "Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah" @Psalm 118:26. Then in @Zechariah 9:9 it says, "Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, thy King cometh to thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass". @Zechariah 9:9. If that scripture is to be filled out, complied with, we must have the ass. We cannot have that scripture complete if we have not the ass. We must have the ass, and a young one at that, and
{110}
the Lord finds one Himself so that He might fill out the position of glory.
A.A.T. Are you applying that to a brother?
J.T. Certainly, a young brother, ready for the Lord to lay His hand on him and use him.
S.McC. Paul had the young ass when he had Timothy with him.
J.T. Quite so. This one had to be found. So with Timothy, Paul had found him and he is with him. This is more the young brother in the place, one that is available to the Lord to fill out the position; because you cannot have this quotation from Zechariah without the ass, we cannot have the position in a concrete way without the brother it applies to. Where is he?
C,A.M. So that the words "on the morrow" bring it out.
J.T. It is one of John's tomorrows. It is what comes the next day, the continuance of the thing.
S.P. Would the crowd coming out to meet Him suggest that the Lord is now securing the movement that He has set Himself for among the saints? In verse 13 the crowd "took branches of palms and went out to meet him".
J.T. The palm is victory clearly, and they have got palms. The other evangelists do not mention the palms; John is the only one that does, as if it is the overcomer that does this thing. The carrying of such things forward requires overcomers, victorious persons.
The Lord finds the ass Himself, and that makes way for the quotation from Zechariah, so that it is a wonderful cumulative thought, Scripture brought in to show that it is authoritative. Scripture approves of this whole position.
Ques. Cana of Galilee, Bethany and Jerusalem; the thing is all worked out to a final conclusion. Is
{111}
the lesson learned and the glory of Christ seen in the way the thing is followed through?
J.T. Quite. Therefore He enters His capital here in glory. They heard Jesus was coming into Jerusalem; it is a final position, and so they meet Him in this way and the scriptures apply. Then it says, "The crowd therefore that was with him bore witness because he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from among the dead. Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign". They "met him" -- there are those with Him and those that meet Him: "the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign". So that it seems to me we have come to finality here in regard to the glory of Christ in testimony. He is carried into His capital according to the Scripture. Things must be done according to Scripture; whatever times we have, whatever feasts we have, we must bring Scripture in. It is a beautiful picture of the glory of Christ in the future: "Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in", @Psalm 24:7. That is the sort of thing.
R.A. It says they "went out to meet him". The blind man was cast out of the synagogue but these are moving out in victory.
J.T. Quite so, and we all want to get into that current, and then we shall be victorious as the Lord is victorious. They are carrying Him into His capital.
J.T.Jr. Would the fact that the ass is used indicate that sin has been dealt with? The ass is usable; the will is broken.
J.T. Yes, it is the acceptance of death. Lazarus enters into all this in resurrection.
A.R. This is the last chapter of public testimony in John's gospel; does it suggest that at the end of the testimony on earth the Lord is looking for this among His saints? For it says later on in the
{112}
chapter, "But though he had done so many signs before them, they believed not on him" @John 12:37. The spirit of apostasy was prevailing as regards what is public, but over against that the Lord is using the young ass.
J.T. Quite so. If there is anything missing the Lord will provide it, if we are subject. The ass is in subjection.
J.R.H. Will you say something about how the Lord found the ass? It says, "And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it". It does not bring in the disciples there.
J.T. Well, it fits in with the last days, the Lord has to do things Himself. If we make room for Him He will supply what we need, so that we might be "perfect and complete in all the will of God", @Colossians 4:12. The Lord would supply what completes us, I think. The Lord would work up to the idea of the assembly in some small way; He would bring in what makes it complete.
A.B. "He sat upon it". Would that show He had absolute confidence that it would carry Him through?
J.T. That is so. He found it. He knew it.
{113}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (3)
@John 7:39; @John 4:10 - 14; @John 12:16
J.T. It is the proposal that we might see that the Spirit is here as a consequence of Christ's glorification, as living water, and then as the power of remembrance. Later we may see in chapters 14, 15 and 16 how the Spirit guides us into all the truth, but at this time we may see how the Spirit's presence depends upon the glorification of Christ, and necessarily gives character to the testimony rendered.
J.W.D. What do you understand by the thought of glorification?
J.T. Well, christianity in its testimony must include what Christ is as received in glory in heaven. We read that "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory", @1 Timothy 3:16. The position He has up there must enter into the testimony involved in the Spirit here.
A.R. You mean the testimony on earth must correspond in some way with His glorification up there?
J.T. Yes, the glorification enters into it and enriches it. In @John 2:22 the resurrection of Christ is said to affect the remembrance of the saints; and in chapter 12:16 it is said that the glorification of Jesus affected their memories: "Now his disciples knew not these things at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him" @John 12:16. The resurrection in itself affects the testimony of Scripture, because as risen the Lord expounded it unto the two on the way to Emmaus: "He interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself", @Luke 24:27. @John 12:16 would go beyond that, and so His glory was necessary for
{114}
the understanding of such scriptures as are mentioned. I think the Lord may help us to see the difference between Christ's ministry as here in the flesh and then as risen and then as ascended and glorified, the Spirit being here in consequence of the latter.
C.A.M. Would the memory in chapter 2, consequent on His resurrection, connect with His body looked at as the temple here, whereas the other scripture in Timothy involves His ascension?
J.T. It does. I thought the truth of the temple of His body is important as connected with Him risen: "Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up", @John 2:19. That He could be raised by Himself is a great matter, and after He is risen the memories of the disciples are affected so that they believe: "When therefore he was raised from among the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken" @John 2:22. So that the testimony of the resurrection has a great place in our position in itself, but the glory is essential to the full thought of christianity because the Spirit is here consequent upon that. In the type in Exodus the Spirit is given on account of the suffering of Christ; the beginning of spirituality really in the types is in @Exodus 17. But @John 7 goes beyond that and makes the presence of the Spirit consequent on the glorification of Christ. Christianity is a heavenly testimony; it is not a millennial but a heavenly one.
A.R. Would it be right to say the ten days that the apostles remained in Jerusalem waiting for the Spirit was a great tax on them?
J.T. It was, and formative too. What they were was brought into evidence. We can see it was not the full thought but it was wonderful as far as it went. @Acts 1 is of great importance in that sense, what the
{115}
Lord left here is seen perfected by the testimony of His resurrection. Chapter 2 brings out not only the resurrection but the Spirit here consequent on His ascension; that is the full christian position.
J.T.Jr. In @Ephesians 1:19 - 23 we have the exceeding greatness of power in bringing Him out of death, and also that He is set in heaven above every principality and power. It is the full thought there.
J.T. Yes, the exceeding greatness of His power in raising Christ and setting Him down at His right hand. That corresponds with @John 7, the wonderful power of God in raising Christ up there and that He "gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body", @Ephesians 1:22. I believe many do not go much beyond resurrection and many do not even go that far; they are occupied with what Christ did here; wonderful indeed that manifestation of His glory, but christianity is much more than that.
J.W.D. Would the idea of resurrection bring in what is positive? Death is negative, undoing all that is adverse and hindering. Is that right?
J.T. I think that is right. It is foundational, so that Romans stresses resurrection, not the ascension. The gospel stresses the resurrection as meeting conditions in men here; but still Romans goes to the Spirit, but it does not stress the heavenly side, whereas Ephesians does. That is full christianity.
S.J.H. Would it be the special portion as with Elisha, 'If you see me go up'?
J.T. That is the idea, I am sure. The second book of Kings begins with one man falling down, he falls down through a lattice; and another man is going up, Elijah is going up. The time of his receiving up is come, and that is what Elisha lays hold of. The journey from Gilgal with Elijah strengthens him in his soul, the thought of an ascending man; and of course it synchronises with John's gospel because
{116}
John has the ascending Man in mind. Elisha is in companionship with Elijah, that is why John stresses companionship with Christ so much. You get enlarged thoughts, and the more enlarged your outlook is the more you pray. You want to grasp the thing in power. And so the journey of Elisha with Elijah and the different points visited enlarged his view. It was the ascending man he was companying with and they went over the Jordan. He saw Elijah wrapping his mantle and smiting the waters but that was not all; they went over together and walked and talked. That is a further movement after the Jordan was crossed, and then came the idea of what Elisha should ask. Well, he says, 'I want a double portion of your spirit', meaning that he had gathered up in companionship with Elijah a great outlook. And Elijah said, "Thou hast asked a hard thing", @2 Kings 2:10. I think God values that because He likes to be asked hard things: "But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think", @Ephesians 3:20. Still He gives you credit for asking a hard thing, meaning you have a grasp of things you have not had before. 'If you see me go up', Elijah says, and he went up by a whirlwind, "And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof!", @2 Kings 2:12; but he got his request. A double portion is what accrues to us as apprehending Christ, not only as risen from the dead, but as ascended.
S.P. Would it in any way connect with Stephen's address? He sees the glory of God and Jesus.
J.T. God would bring in this very thing we are speaking of at that juncture. I believe that is the basis of the epistle to the Hebrews: it has been called the book of the opened heavens. Stephen looked up there, his countenance was like the countenance of an angel; it was really judicial. What is to replace Israel is another Israel; it is the heavenly thing. That
{117}
is why his view is guided upward; he sees Jesus and the glory.
J.W.D. This hard thing you mention, does the solution of it lie in the emphasis on the Spirit in @John 7, the place we give Him as a divine Person?
J.T. That is what I thought and that is why I suggested the one verse; it gives character to the whole subject. "But this he said concerning the Spirit" -- it is a round-about thought, all the way around, it is the full thought -- "which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified" (verse 39), "not yet" means not yet here in activity; it is not, of course, a question of the Spirit's existence, but not yet in the actual sphere of activities. We are the sphere of His activities.
C.A.M. Where would you say the heavenly side comes into prominence in the gospel?
J.T. I think here, in chapter 7. It is not mentioned in chapter 4 where we have the living water, it is held for this passage until we reach the best that judaism has, the feast of tabernacles, the great day of the feast. The Lord awaited this circumstance to bring in this fact of the glorification of Christ as essential to the Holy Spirit here below. The feast of tabernacles was the last of the series in Israel, and this was the great day of it, the very best. That is the point at which Jesus cries; He does not cry in chapter 4. This is a more dispensational thought; in chapter 4 it is meeting need, but this is dispensational. The Lord awaits the opportunity for the cry. Why should He cry? He cries twice in this chapter, it is urgency! The ending up of one dispensation is not simply judicial, but it is also because of its insufficiency to meet divine requirements. Over against that the Spirit is "not yet", meaning that He is not yet in the sphere of operations, but now you have the supreme thought of God. The cry ought to be
{118}
observed; I think it indicates the urgency of the Lord as to this matter.
C.A.M. Does it express the emotions of divine Persons with regard to it?
J.T. Very good.
J.W.D. I was wondering about the thought of receiving.
J.T. I think chapter 7 is the balance of the 4th, and contemplates progress in believers; the word is, "But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive". The believing is past history in the disciples, but culminates in this; they had already believed. Believing in John is progressive; the faith here is beyond the woman's faith in chapter 4.
S.J.H. Would the Lord's cry indicate His feelings about the emptiness in the best that was earthly?
J.T. I think that is the way it stands. John gives great place to cries, divine feelings. Twice in this chapter the Lord cries and He cries at the resurrection of Lazarus. In chapter 12 His soul is troubled; He weeps in chapter 11; all this comes into this book and it is to bring out how real things are, how much feeling there is in heaven. It finds a reflex here in the flowing out from the inward parts of the believer, the place of his affections, the region of our organs that are automatic in their movements; they are genuinely affected, that is the idea; christianity is a system of feelings.
S.P. The Spirit as a divine Person enters into this too. This is the Lord's cry and then the Spirit cries.
J.T. Quite so. I think we are very slow to lay hold of divine feelings. God says, You weary me; He says that to Ahaz (@Isaiah 7:13). In @Genesis 6:6 it says, "And Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart", @Genesis 6:6. In @Genesis 1:2 the Spirit brooded over the face of the deep. God comes down to where we are, to give us to
{119}
understand He is not far away from us. Paul says, "As also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring", @Acts 17:28. Even man as he is created is like God. How much more so as learning of God in Christ and having the Spirit of Christ!
A.R. Do the "rivers" (verse 38) suggest that we have love for all the saints?
J.T. Yes; the allusion would include the river in Eden; "as the scripture has said" is not a quotation, it is what Scripture says in effect. Matthew makes a point of quotations, John too; but this particular instance is not that, it is a question of what Scripture says in effect. The Scriptures are full of the thought of a river or rivers and the sources of them too.
C.A.M. Do you see a reflex of that in the expressions Paul uses to Timothy in the expression of his affections?
J.T. Yes, you can see it throughout Paul's ministry; what an affectionate man he was! His salutations are remarkable. How he could remember the brethren by name in order to tell them of his love! One of the greatest difficulties one has is naming the brethren, to know them by name, and be able to think of each according to what you know of them. The apostle excels in that as, for instance, in Romans.
A.R. You spoke about the river in Eden; there Eden would be the source, but in chapter 7 the believer is the source.
J.T. That is the thought. I was thinking of Eden, it is a tropical suggestion. The tropics of course are remarkable as to the effect of the warmth on the human body and mind; so that after God set up Eden Adam is to look after it, and He would come into it in the *cool* of the day. It is a tropical allusion. It says He was heard walking: "And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day", @Genesis 3:8.
{120}
Does it refer to the happiness or blessedness of God that He found in a scene like that? Why should His voice be connected with walking? But alas! there was no Adam or Eve ready to meet Him; they hid themselves. Still, we have the suggestion of what Eden was: it was the source; the river went out of Eden, the word meaning the place of delights. The river went out of that situation into the garden and then it was parted and became four main streams or heads, meaning that there is intelligence typically in the movement of those rivers.
E.P. Is that idea of intelligence worked out in the Acts, Peter bringing in Cornelius, then Antioch and Philippi?
J.T. That is the idea. You cannot but be impressed by the spirit of control in the book of Acts; so many persons operating and yet the spirit of control is there.
E.P. Does the glory of Christ synchronise with this great movement of the Spirit here in @John 7?
J.T. That is the thought, the glorified Christ and the rivers flowing out: "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified" @John 7:38,39. That is, out of the inward parts should flow rivers of living water, out of one person. Who is that person? A believer in Christ. What a person he is! A characteristic believer; it is a progressive thought.
C.A.M. Our heads control really; this looks on to the headship of Christ.
J.T. That is the force of the word; they parted and became four heads or main streams.
E.P. Headship is not simply a title; there is flow from it.
{121}
J.T. It involves functioning in the way of control. As soon as your head gives out, the body is out of control. Things are to function from heaven in christianity, that is what you get in the book of the Acts.
J.T.Jr. Is "the head of the ... assembly" @Colossians 1:18 an administrative thought?
J.T. Quite so. It is organic also; many inscrutable things which originate in the head take place all the time in our bodies.
J.R.H. Would this matter of remembrance have an important part in our activity?
J.T. Yes indeed! How poor we should be unless there were the power to recall by association! One thing helps you to remember another thing. Chapter 12 shows that the glorification of Christ helps us in our memories; we shall see more about that in chapter 14 but it is touched on here. You remember that these things were written of Christ: "Now his disciples knew not these things at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him" (chapter 12:16).
You stand up to give an address, you have in mind the general outline, but then there is the power of association, of memory, the Holy Spirit helps you. What a wonderful field there is in Scripture! You need to scan the field. Well, the Holy Spirit helps you thus to glorify Christ, that is the supreme thought; the whole field is in the mind of the Spirit and He will bring things into your soul as you need them.
J.R.H. I was wondering if remembrance is to promote the feature of holiness with us? It is connected with what He says of the temple of His body, and then there is the feature of remembrance connected with spirituality.
{122}
J.T. Quite so; the glorification of Christ connected with your memory opens up a wide field; it is well worth looking into and using. The scripture opens up, the Holy Spirit operates on your memory and brings things back to you. The scriptures quoted in this passage from @Psalm 118 and the prophet Zechariah had been read in Israel for hundreds of years: "Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt" @John 12:15; and the one in verse 13. In the glorification of Christ these two scriptures are brought back to memory. For this section of glory in chapter 12 I need such light, such power as that to bring back to my memory what belongs to this sphere of glory.
E.P. It says of Israel, "When Moses is read, the veil lies upon their heart. But when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away", @2 Corinthians 3:15,16.
J.T. That will be a wonderful time for Israel! They are reading the Scriptures every sabbath, but what good are they to them? When Israel turns to the Lord the veil is taken away. When they do, Israel's intelligence will be opened up. They will not have the same intelligence as we have today, but they will have great intelligence.
J.W.D. I was thinking about your allusion to Romans, "the renewing of your mind" @Romans 12:2, and then "the eyes of your heart" @Ephesians 1:18 in Ephesians, whether that does not link on with the thought of remembrance? Some of us are getting older, our natural forces are abating.
J.T. We all know how much it affects us and it is one thing we should keep before us. One of the most important things for a brother to keep before him is that his mind should be clear. As he gets older it is apt to become very dull, which is a great disadvantage.
A.R. Spiritual persons are not taxing their minds in regard to the work, they are taxing a divine Person.
{123}
J.T. That is right. We shall see more about that in chapters 14 and 15.
Returning to the rivers and what "the scripture has said": this is a simple statement and I believe directs us to @Genesis 2 and 3, showing first the source of the river, where it flowed out, and then how headship entered into it; how as flowing it surrounded the territory. You get good things there, "the gold of that land is good". It brings up a whole realm of thought as to what is good; "bdellium and the onyx stone are there", @Genesis 2:12. It involves riches and the refinement that goes with riches.
C.A.M. When a person's memory is being helped of the Spirit he relies on spiritual suggestions.
J.T. One great effect of a river is influence. If you are influenced in your mind, well then there is the thought; then come words and then sentences. These are all sub-divisional to the whole matter, but influence is the great thing. Take the Euphrates, think of what influence there is in that great river!
J.S.T. You have a suggestion of it in Paul's ministry as to "holding fast the head" @Colossians 2:19; and then would his epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians be like surrounding "the whole land of Havilah", reaching out, so that "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water"? @John 7:38.
J.T. Quite so; it is "holding fast the head". It is a glorified Christ we begin with and the Holy Spirit down here. The idea of headship keeps us in balance, so that the new man is "renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him"; that is a remarkable statement, "into full knowledge", @Colossians 3:10.
A.B. Is that why in chapter 7 the cry is, "let him come to me and drink" before you have the rivers of water flowing out?
J.T. Quite so; that gives you headship. But then, this Man is glorified, and "This he said concerning the Spirit".
{124}
He is going around the thing, the whole matter of the Spirit is conveyed. You must have a glorified Christ to get the full power of it; the full outflowing of the river universally is from heaven.
C.A.M. The idea of influence helps; the word 'influence' and the fact that it is a river and has banks seems to take care of this matter of balance.
J.T. It is the idea of headship organically; you do not see anyone asserting himself; everything is balanced. The very fact of the river flowing indicates there is something behind it.
S.R.McC. Peter standing up in Acts with the others is not asserting himself @Acts 2:14. "Peter, standing up with the eleven", quotes the scripture in Joel.
J.T. Look at these eleven men standing behind Peter! Is Peter eclipsing these men? No, he is not; these men have a gift too, every one of them, and when Peter finishes speaking the convicted people speak to these eleven men. Why did they do that? They saw it was one idea, that these men were all of the same kind. That is the idea of christianity, we are to help each other and stand in relation to one another. It is not one man's understanding, it is an organism that is in mind.
J.S. T. The Lord in speaking to His disciples says, "Ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you" @Acts 1:8. Would that be seen in Peter standing up with the eleven? Was it the evidence of His power so that you would get to what was behind the apostles?
J.T. There is something behind those men. They were all to receive power from on high. The convicted soul sees that these men are all of a kind.
Ques. Are we deficient in appreciation of the glories of Christ? In Corinth it would appear that spiritual persons were not functioning. I was wondering whether the glories of Christ were not being maintained.
{125}
J.T. They were not. The first thing Paul rebuked in Corinth was the divisions. The divided state amongst them would preclude the idea of rivers flowing out. These eleven stand up with Peter; they are like him; the Lord had brought them together. He called whom He Himself would that they might be with Him, that He might send them forth. It is a united thought and I think the idea of a river must have been behind it, the thought of headship.
A.H.P. Is the same thought in @1 Corinthians 12? Great prominence is given there to the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so: "For also in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body, ... and have all been given to drink of one Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12:13.
A.H.P. Would chapter 14 show that it is flowing out in the ministry meeting?
J.T. Quite so.
J.W.D. I was going to suggest that these eleven apostles that stood behind Peter would be well content to be there, feeling they were organically of the same thing.
J.T. It is remarkable how you get them together throughout the chapters of the Acts. The converts persevered in the doctrine and fellowship of "the apostles" @Acts 2:42, not 'of the apostle Peter', but "the apostles". Then in Solomon's porch there they were, the apostles; you get them together, and there was the great power of the apostles¬ witness, and so forth. It is one idea in twelve men to bring out the administrative thought in love. That is why a meeting like this is so important; the brethren coming together, we learn together. It is the divine way that the glorification of Christ, the Spirit being connected with that fact here, unifies our thoughts. We have a wider outlook, and we are all brought into it; not to signalise any person but to bring out the dispensation and what is in it.
{126}
Ques. Paul says we have the mind of Christ; does that enter into it?
J.T. It does; it is the power or faculty of thinking. It is not gift exactly, it is what is normal to christianity, the mind of Christ, the power of thinking as He does.
S.J.H. Would you make much of the fact that it is living water? Is not that a test, in that there is the touch of headship about it?
J.T. That is another good point; that is why I thought we might connect it with chapter 4 which brings out the quality of the water; it is living. In chapter 4 it is a question of the state of the believer; chapter 7 is more dispensational, hence the cry. Chapter 4 is to bring out the state of the believer as it comes into evidence, so that the Lord sat just as He was on the well, and this woman comes to draw water, and the conversation brings out the state she was in. So chapter 4 is on a lower level, dealing with state, and how inwardly through the ministry of Christ we can make room for this matter of springing up in chapter 4 and flowing out in chapter 7.
Ques. Is chapter 4 more the Romans side?
J.T. That is right, and chapter 7 is Ephesians. Chapter 4 is what is given to you and chapter 7 is what you receive: "But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive" (verse 39).
A.A.T. Chapter 4 requires asking.
J.T. That is the thought. "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him" (chapter 4:10). A need arises in her soul, because the Lord's remarks lead her to say, Give it to me. It is a question of your need and you value the thing; it springs up into everlasting life. That is deliverance; I cannot be a vessel here unless I am delivered. Chapter
{127}
7 is the other side of the matter, the heavenly thing; it is what flows down through Him universally.
N.B. "For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives not the Spirit by measure", @John 3:34.
J.T. That is the general character of the giving dispensationally. Now the Holy Spirit is here in an absolute way, not partially. Of course He does not give the Holy Spirit to any one of us in that way; no creature could receive the Spirit in absoluteness. It comes out there in relation to Christ; the Lord Himself received the Spirit in completeness. It came in bodily form upon Him, and the same is true of the assembly.
A.R. This woman in @John 4 was very fickle, she had five husbands.
J.T. Quite so, but she is brought into headship in principle. She has only one Man before her now; that makes way for what we were speaking of in chapter 7.
Ques. Would you define for us what the springing up and flowing out are?
J.T. Springing up is an allusion to the organs that are automatic. Many things happen in our bodies that do not refer to the head; they act of themselves. Our bodies are so constituted that they act of themselves, the organs act of themselves. Springing up is not to heaven, it is into everlasting life; it is deliverance, another order of things, an out of the world order of things. The Spirit in the believer operates on him as he judges himself according to Romans, and he is delivered; it is an upward trend, it is up into everlasting life. That I would take to be deliverance: it "shall become in him a fountain ...". There are two words used for 'well': one is 'fountain' in verse 14, "But the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water"; that is, it takes charge of the believer and functions
{128}
in the automatic organs, so to speak, so that it operates of itself; it is not headship but it makes way for headship. Chapter 7 involves headship.
J.W.D. Why do you think this process of deliverance in @John 4 takes so long a time with us? Here it is connected with the power of a divine Person.
J.T. That is a good question for each to ask himself. The woman said to Him in verse 15, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw" @John 4:15. That is a selfish way of speaking, therefore the state of the person must be disclosed. That means a long history, you know; it is the length of the history and the variety of it and how much we have forgotten in such a history as this. All that has to be gone through; the process of self-judgment is a life process. As a matter of fact a man never ceases to be normally a repenting sinner; it is the length of the thing, how much has been forgotten and how much has to be brought to our attention by the Spirit of God. Think of a history like this: five husbands, and now one not a husband! The others were apparently legal in some sense, they were actually husbands.
A.R. Some might say, Why go back so far?
J.T. That is the point. It is hesitancy to go back so far that prevents this spring within, this matter of deliverance. She had to come into that: "If thou knewest the gift of God", One taking such a low place and yet divine. But then the other thing is this matter of five husbands; evidently they were legal in some sense; there must have been some sort of ceremony connected with them. This means how much had been forgotten, but not in heaven, and I have to come back to that.
C.A.M. She loves talking of the well of Jacob.
J.T. The well was deep; the well of corruption in her soul is deep and she has to bottom it.
{129}
J.T.Jr. I suppose in an outward way she claimed a religious position, in connection with the well that belonged to Jacob.
J.T. How much such people can say! She is setting herself up in a religious way: "Our father Jacob", she says. Well, think of what she has to go through to get right!
S.J.H. What is the lack? It seems to be a lack of conscience.
J.T. There is at first, she has no conscience at all. It is when the Lord says to her, "Thou hast had five husbands", that she says to Him, "Sir, I see that thou art a prophet" @John 4:18,19. That is the beginning of her spiritual history. What did she see before? She thought she knew something about the mountain and Jacob, she could talk quite well; you would never think she was what she was, but the Lord would see what she was at the bottom. He touches the well of corruption and He says these words to her, and she says, "Sir, I see that thou art a prophet". She is worth speaking to; the Lord does not hesitate to talk to her about worship. We often wonder why it is, but it is perfectly clear she saw He was a prophet. The prophetic word is the point.
Ques. Is the meeting for prophetic ministry designed to help us in our souls?
J.T. It is certainly intended to bring out all these historical things that have not been settled; they have all to come to light, that is what the prophetic word is for. We cannot bring everything into the assembly or it would be full of judicial matters all the time; the Lord makes provision for minor matters between saint and saint. Some matters have to be brought to the court of the tabernacle. This woman's case requires full investigation. How can she say, I have settled this matter? She could not say it. Yet the Lord does not go into the matter
{130}
publicly. She says, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done", @John 4:29.
J.S.T. Does availing ourselves of the Holy Spirit as in @Acts 2:17 -- the pouring out upon our sons and daughters and then the prophesying -- help us as individuals?
J.T. See what a time we should have! So much prophesying -- the past would be exposed and a great clearance effected, so that the Holy Spirit would have scope to spring up.
J.J. It is not a question of having her moral defects drawn attention to, but of her seeing the glory of Christ.
J.T. It is both, you know; because the point she makes when she went back to the men was, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done" @John 4:29. He said very little to her but His words searched her; that is the secret of her power in testimony. She admits she had been exposed to herself. Now one Man controls her instead of these others; she left her water-pot and went back into the city, she was a vessel, and carried in principle the living water to the men. "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?".
J.R.H. Would not this idea of abundance set aside the thought of labour and toil?
J.T. It makes way for the sabbath; there was to be no servile work on the sabbath. It is the liberty that we have inwardly springing up into everlasting life.
A.H.P. You referred last night to @Psalm 51: I wondered whether David in his soul history with God was brought into line with what the Lord did with this woman? He says, "Behold, thou wilt have truth in the inward parts" @Psalm 51:6.
J.T. Christ's inward parts, in infinite holiness, were laid out before Jehovah in the sacrifices. In @John 4 the inward parts in the believer are exposed
{131}
to be dealt with, and then instead of corruption you have living water springing up into everlasting life.
A.R. In @1 Corinthians 14 it says of an unbeliever, "He is convicted of all, he is judged of all; the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon his face, he will do homage to God" @1 Corinthians 14:24,25.
J.T. Not only does he judge himself but everybody sees it, all judge him. You want to join in with the person that is repentant. Everybody judges it, the whole matter is clear, and that man is fit for fellowship at once. They all see the man is repentant, they all come to his judgment of himself.
J.R.H. So in chapters 4 and 9 the recognition of the prophet comes in and makes room for worship in both chapters.
J.T. It is very remarkable that Peter should say so much about prophesying in @Acts 2:17,18. A sister bringing something to your conscience convicts you. Your sons and your daughters, your bondmen and bondwomen shall prophesy. It is a question of bringing in conviction, the mind of God towards us with regard to the state we are in. Everyone needs this.
What a holy, pure state of things there must have been in that house of Philip when Paul went there with his company, and Agabus came down and taking Paul's girdle, prophesied! There were four women there, four daughters of the evangelist, who prophesied. We are not told they did it then, but what a state would be in that house! The whole matter was clear as noon-day as to what would happen to Paul in Jerusalem; the condition in the house admitted of it. Paul did not say a word, he was not affected by it; it shows how the most spiritual of us needs that sort of thing.
E.P. Do both chapter 4 and 7 of John converge on chapter 12, in the thought of Jerusalem? I was wondering whether the woman calls attention to
{132}
Christ in chapter 4: "Come, see a man" @John 4:29; and then in chapter 7 attention is called to the realm of the Spirit. Jerusalem would be the whole sphere of it, would it not?
J.T. The whole great domain of glory! "Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in", @Psalm 24:7. In chapter 12 the brethren are ready for that by the glorification of Christ; that is the end of things; Jerusalem is the great centre of glory.
{133}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (4)
@John 16:13,14 @John 15:26,27; @John 14:26; @John 13:31,32
J.T. In our subject we have before us the Spirit here in the living water consequent on the glorification of Christ. Our instruction should show us the effect of the Spirit as glorifying Christ. He is here because Christ is glorified, but as here He glorifies Christ, according to our first scripture; so that we have before us a range of truth that includes Paul's doctrine. In the second scripture read the Lord said He would send the Comforter from the Father: "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, *he* shall bear witness concerning me"; and then He says, "and ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from the beginning" (chapter 15:26,27). That is, He distinguishes between the Spirit's own testimony and the testimony of the twelve; the former would include what was subsequent to the testimony of the twelve, as in Paul's ministry. Then in the third scripture read we have what would fit in in the last days, that is, when the things of Christ are either beclouded or forgotten. He says, "but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, *he* shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you" (chapter 14:26). That would be another ministry of the Spirit whereby He would glorify Christ -- to bring things forgotten, beclouded, or distorted back to their original form, back to the remembrance of the saints. Fourthly we have the glorification of Christ in a moral way as Judas went out: "When therefore he was gone out Jesus says, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall glorify him immediately" (chapter 13:31,32).
{134}
This is the most touching perhaps of all, because it alludes to the actual death of Christ brought about by the betrayal of Judas.
A.R. Do you have something special in your mind in commencing with chapter 16 and going back?
J.T. It opens up a wide field of truth, as I said. "But when *he* is come", the Lord says, "the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming. He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" (chapter 16:13,14). The chapter contemplates the Lord's rejection, and the rejection of the saints too, because He says, "They shall put you out of the synagogues; but the hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God" @John 16:2. And then He says, "But I did not say these things unto you from the beginning, because I was with you. But now I go to him that has sent me, and none of you demands of me, Where goest thou? But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you" @John 16:4 - 7. That is the position in this chapter and it is very marked; it is the position we occupy only on the militant side, the public militant side; and the Spirit being here glorifies Christ in unfolding all the truth, guiding us into all the truth as receiving of Christ, showing it to us and glorifying Christ in that way.
J.W.D. Is He regarded in this passage as indwelling the saints? He hears -- is it through the faculties of the saints, or something outside of the saints? It says here, "But whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak".
{135}
Would that be as indwelling, and hearing through our spiritual faculties?
J.T. It is not through our faculties, for He is here as a divine Person, but in such lowliness! He has ears and hears what He is going to say. It is a very touching matter that He is so lowly, that He hears what He is going to say. I should not like to say that He hears through our faculties, because He has faculties of His own through which He hears.
C.A.M. In @Romans 8 it would appear that the Holy Spirit hears from heaven as well as being aware of what goes on in our own feelings.
J.T. Yes; He brings in what He hears so as to use us to announce the things. The announcement, I should say, would be through Paul, through chosen persons. The word 'announce' is formal; it is said in the note to verse 13, 'The Greek has the sense of "reporting", "bringing back a report"'. Here it is a message brought from another, as @Acts 20:20,27. The Spirit receives and hears. He receives what He says, He hears and announces it. The announcement would be through the faculties of the person employed, such as Paul; but if He heard with Paul's ears, then Paul would be the direct source of supply himself. It is, I think, the Spirit in His own inscrutable way in the assembly here, individually and personally and freely, and in direct communication with heaven.
S.P. Would the faculties link with the word 'guide' -- "shall guide you"?
J.T. Yes; that is through one another as at a meeting like this. What we may say to each other may be used of the Holy Spirit to guide us into a particular phase of the truth; not teaching, but guiding, so that we do not go astray in our minds.
Ques. Is there any connection with what the Spirit says to the churches? "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies", @Revelation 2:17.
{136}
J.T. There we are to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. That would be also through ministry, that you hear what He says. But then, the point is how the Spirit hears according to this chapter. Does He hear through our hearing faculties? There is no reason why that should be, because He is a divine Person, and He has means of hearing. The Lord Himself when here heard from the Father; correspondingly the Father hears; and so I would say the Spirit is here, a divine Person, but taking a lowly place, the place of hearing; and as hearing He uses vessels in announcing things. It is more than saying, it is announcing.
W.L. Would you say that He is the present link between the ascended Lord and the assembly?
J.T. That is true, of course; it involves the organism. But still, there is the fact that a divine Person is here below. "But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you. And having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe on me; of righteousness, because I go away to my Father, and ye behold me no longer; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now. But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming" @John 16:7 - 13.
E.P. Is the position here somewhat like that before Jericho, the man with the drawn sword in his hand? The demonstration to the world just preceding
{137}
Jericho being taken? Is that the position of the Spirit in chapter 16?
J.T. Quite so; it is a militant position. The appearance of the man with the drawn sword glorifies the position. He comes in at a certain time and says, "As captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come", @Joshua 5:14. The Lord says here, "But I have spoken these things to you, that when their hour shall have come, ye may remember them, that I have said them unto you. But I did not say these things unto you from the beginning, because I was with you" @John 16:4. But now a particular time has come at which a certain thing is brought in; so that corresponds in that sense with the man with the drawn sword -- "am I now come", -- at this particular time, the time for that demonstration.
E.P. I was wondering whether the Lord had in His mind the importance the Spirit of truth would assume in our minds in relation to this great matter?
J.T. I think there is a marked correspondence, because this chapter is militant; it contemplates suffering. There is a time for it; they were not equal to it before, nor was it necessary because the Lord was with them. Now He is no longer going to be with them, "But now I go to him that has sent me" @John 16:5. The Holy Spirit would be here in a militant way and would bring in demonstration; it is not only that He says certain things about the world, sin and Satan, but they are demonstrated, the things are set out. At Pentecost the Holy Spirit began to bring out in a demonstrative way that the Lord Jesus was right and the Jews were wrong. It is the Jewish world that is in mind. That was the issue at the cross: if He trusted Jehovah, they said, let Elias come and take Him down. The issue was whether Christ was right or the Jews, and the coming in of the Holy Spirit would bring out publicly that the Lord Jesus was right. "And having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe on me; of righteousness, because I go away to my Father, and ye behold me no longer; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged" @John 16:8 - 11.
{138}
These things would come out in a palpable way in the ministry of the Spirit beginning at Pentecost, that Christ was right, the Man whom the Jews rejected is with the Father. That is righteousness; not only has God done it because of His relationship with Him as Son, but because of righteousness. That was the issue, Christ was right and the world wrong.
A.B. "Has been justified in the Spirit", @1 Timothy 3:16.
J.T. That is what is meant: "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit".
J.S.T. Do you get it carried forward with Paul in 1 Corinthians? "Not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power" @1 Corinthians 2:4.
J.T. That is it. "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming. He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" (verses 13,14); "shall announce it to you", not simply telling us. Mary "told the disciples" in chapter 20 @John 20:18; it is a similar thought, only there the word 'announce' is not used. It would hardly be suitable for a sister to take that position of announcing as a special messenger; although she was that. But the Holy Spirit has a unique place, He announces: "He will announce to you what is coming", and "He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you". So that the things are kept before us, the coming of the
{139}
Lord and all that is coming. It is a striking word as arresting attention as to these matters.
J.T.Jr. In the Acts numbers are converted; on the other hand there are the Sadducees and chief priests who are distressed by the preaching; but large numbers are being converted, and the Spirit is guiding.
J.T. I think that helps. The first day of the preaching brought in such results, and the leaders of the Jews took account of it in that way; they were being judged. Demonstration was being brought in in regard of sin, righteousness and judgment. The whole world was exposed because of what was happening.
C.A.M. That this evil power is still allowed to work would magnify the greatness of God.
J.T. It does; it brings out what the Spirit is as here, what He does. We have already dwelt on the glorification of Christ as affording the Spirit to us, but now the Spirit is here glorifying Christ. It is not Christ glorified as the Father glorifies Him, and puts Him down at His right hand; the Father does that, but the Spirit glorifies Him here in exposing and contesting an issue in favour of Christ.
J.W.D. "He shall receive of mine", that is, the heavenly things that are in His hand as the glorified Man. In chapter 13:3 it says, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God ...", @John 13:3.
J.T. It is what can definitely be called Christ's things. The Spirit brings them out to us. The servant of Abraham spoke about Abraham himself, but then he spoke about Isaac too, which would be to affect Rebecca peculiarly. The Spirit has great pleasure in endearing Christ to us and magnifying Him in our eyes, so that we can love Him better.
{140}
A.B. He calls them both 'master', Abraham and Isaac too.
J.T. Abraham merged in Isaac's mastership. The last word about 'master' is when Rebecca says, "Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master!" @Genesis 24:65. He does not say, My master's son.
J.W.D. Paul speaks of announcing amongst the nations "the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ", @Ephesians 3:8.
J.T. Quite so. It is a remarkable thing that you get verses in Scripture, particularly in John's writings and also in Paul's, that convey without formality the deity of Christ. Who else but a divine Person could be spoken of in that way? In John's writings, especially the first epistle, sometimes the pronouns may refer either to the Father or the Son. The Holy Spirit keeps the deity of Christ before us, taking of His things and showing them to us. The servant of Abraham spoke about his master Abraham, but then he speaks about Isaac by himself; the last word as to mastership is Isaac's, so that the assembly has the full thought of how Christ is regarded above. The nearer you get to heaven, the more you see what a place He has up there.
Ques. Does the Song of Songs fill this out? "My beloved is mine, and I am his" @Song of Songs 2:16. The Spirit would operate in the saints peculiarly after the Supper.
J.T. Quite so. The whole of the book is between the bride and the bridegroom. There is only one allusion to Jehovah, the word Jah; it is the only allusion in the book. That brings out what we are saying, that under certain circumstances the deity of Christ shines out, not simply in an abstract sense, but because of what He is. Certain things have come out in Him personally.
{141}
J.S.T. "And his desire is toward me", @Song of Songs 7:10. The Spirit would carry that to us.
J.T. He would. The Holy Spirit should have great pleasure in the service of God in that way. We begin with the fact that the Spirit is always with us, "For he abides with you, and shall be in you", the Spirit of truth. Now when we come together in assembly at the Lord's supper you can understand how the Spirit has the Lord exclusively in His mind. He is stressing the dominance of Christ, and proceeds until we come to the new covenant, and then to the marital side. The Spirit is peculiarly at home in all that; it is @Genesis 24 when you rise to that level, "That is my master!" @Genesis 24:65. The Spirit makes everything of Christ, makes Him lovable to us, admirable to us, and brings things forward to affect us so that marital feelings arise. The Canticles are particularly intended for that part of the service.
J.R.H. It is very affecting that He only speaks what He hears, and announces what He receives.
J.T. He brings in here what is going on in heaven; that is the point, what is going on in heaven; heaven is not sitting dormant, it is always aglow. Think of Christ as Man up there in that way, the history that is made there every day!
E.P. Do you get that suggestion in Luke's gospel, "a multitude of the heavenly host" @Luke 2:13, and the announcement to Mary and Elizabeth?
J.T. Luke especially brings that side in: "A multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace", @Luke 2:13,14. Later the scene is changed and the multitude says, "Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest", @Luke 19:38. That is what is going on up there.
A.A.T. The Spirit is bringing down at the present time what is going on in heaven. Is that through prophetic ministry?
{142}
J.T. Well, it is more than that. It is seasonal too, the months of the year denote variety of fruit; that is brought in here, every month has its own fruit, so that there are seasons of enjoyment as well as the prophetic ministry. Prophetic ministry contemplates the moral side of the position down here; but then there is that which delights Him, what is going on up there; there is always joy in heaven, peace and glory in the highest; from the time the Lord Jesus went in, there has been that wonderful occupation, and the Holy Spirit brings all that down here. There is wonderful mutuality there between divine Persons. The Lord would say, I will send the Spirit too as having been with the Father; that is, He has got first-hand knowledge of everything, of the Father's thoughts, He comes down "from with the Father"; it is a peculiar translation, but this is how it reads: "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, *he* shall bear witness concerning me" (chapter 15:26). He is from *with* the Father and knows all the Father's thoughts. He would know them as a divine Person, but as a servant He has been with the Father, and knows exactly what the Father's thoughts about the Son are. The Son has already gone up there before the Spirit is sent down. The Lord says, I send Him from with the Father, and when He is come "*he* shall bear witness concerning me; and ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from the beginning", @John 15:26,27. He is with the Father up there and He will bring down a true report of what is up there.
C.A.M. The book of Revelation was given since the Lord was here on earth. That is one thing He has brought to pass.
J.T. It is said of the Apocalypse, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place", @Revelation 1:1.
{143}
That was something additional that the Lord received from the Father there in regard to coming events; but these communications refer to how Christ is regarded up there, so as to form the affections of the assembly that the proper affections for such a Person should be promoted.
E.P. Would the carrying of the ark around Jericho imply that there is a corresponding movement on earth to what is in heaven?
J.T. Quite so. It is carried around Jericho, that is a militant thought; still it is the Kohathites carrying the ark. Actually in the antitype it means how we appreciate Christ. They are called priests there; when they get into Canaan they are promoted, they are called priests.
J.W.D. Would you limit the thought of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, to our being in the wilderness, or does it go beyond it?
J.T. The word implies, as you know, One who will take care of everything for us in the absence of Christ. That is what is contemplated in the word 'Comforter'. The Lord is no longer with us: it is another Comforter; but He is the same Person when He takes us into the land. He is with us still; He takes the form of the Spirit of adoption and the Spirit of Christ. The general thought of 'Comforter' is that He is here while Christ is there.
J.S.T. Do you get a suggestion of "from with" in Abraham speaking to Isaac, saying, "My son"; and then in the son speaking to his father and saying, "My father"? @Genesis 22:7,8. These feelings and affections are brought down to us in the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Quite so. How do we know what goes on up there except by the Spirit? We get impressions from the Spirit.
J.R.H. It is "all the truth".
J.T. Quite so. The article is before it. This is one of the most important phases of the truth we can
{144}
be occupied with, how the Holy Spirit brings down from heaven all the light and truth, and what feelings exist up there too; how Christ is regarded, because to get a true estimate of Christ you must go to the Father. He has taken pains to tell us what He thinks of Christ; when Christ was here He opened the heavens and told us what He thought about Him, and now He is up there and the Holy Spirit proceeds from with the Father, sent by the Lord. He comes down here to bring knowledge of what the Father thinks of Christ. We shall never get a full estimate of Christ except as we get it from the Father. What does He think of Him in all the wonderful environment of glory up there?
J.W.D. I suppose the highest feature in our worship would be to apprehend the Father's appreciation of Christ, and then to enter into the Son's appreciation of the Father and His thoughts of the Father. Is that not greater than our appreciation of Christ and of the Father?
J.T. Chapters 13, 14 and 15 unfold to us what Christ thinks of the Father. He is extending His remarks far beyond what you get in the synoptic gospels at the same period. He wants the disciples to have a true thought of the Father. According to these two verses in the end of chapter 15, He sends the Holy Spirit out "from with the Father", not simply to tell us about the Father, but He says, I am sending Him out that He might bear witness of Me.
C.A.M. In connection with our church music and the hymns, it would not be too much to say that what the Spirit brings among us is a present note in heaven.
J.T. I think so. The assembly is the reflex of heaven. What is going on up there is brought down here.
A.B. How does this bear upon, "All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son but the Father", @Matthew 11:27?
{145}
J.T. It is all the more reason why we should pay attention to the Spirit as He is taking up these things and showing them to us. The Spirit glorifies Him in our eyes. There is no formal revelation of the Son, it is negative in the scripture: "No one knows the Son but the Father", @Matthew 11:27. There is not a word said about the revelation of the Son; the Father knows, but wonderful things come in by the Spirit, for the Spirit knows because He is with the Father. What thoughts there are! They are inscrutable but still you get inklings of Christ, of His deity, by the Person of the Holy Spirit. Throughout John's epistles you can hardly tell at times to whom the references refer, whether to the Father or the Son. Antichrist denies both, because it is Deity in that wonderful way, in the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit knows everything as coming from the Father. What inklings we get from Him!
E.P. Not being made a subject of revelation, is it something very intimate?
J.T. Well, it is who the Persons are. If you could see as John speaks of it "(we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father)" @John 1:14, what inklings you would get in looking at Them in their relation to One Another! The Holy Spirit knows all that, because Christ was exalted before He came down. Abimelech says to Isaac, You told me your wife was your sister, but I see by your relations that she must be something more (@Genesis 26). The Spirit sees everything of Christ divinely, but He has taken the place of servant and hears, and what He hears He speaks. He comes out from the Father, and knows the relations, the feelings and affections that are there; He conveys inklings of all that the names Father and Son imply.
J.R.H. Chapter 1, verse 14 says "(we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father)", @John 1:14.
{146}
J.T. That is what they saw, but here it is "from with"; only the Holy Spirit could see that, because He was in heaven; the apostles were down here. "From with" means He has come from that place or state.
J.W. Would there be a link in the apostle Paul's prayer in @Ephesians 3? "For this reason I bow my knees to the Father ... that he may give you ... to be strengthened with power by his Spirit". @Ephesians 3:14 - 16.
J.T. Very good. Profound exercise is meant in that, but it is to the Father in regard of the testimony.
A.A.T. Paul speaks of the Father in @Colossians 1.
J.T. The epistles of Paul are all covered in what is said here, that "he receives of mine and shall announce it to you" @John 16:15. It involves the mystery, the whole range of Paul's doctrine, as over against what the twelve had.
A.R. I suppose in the main in our assembly service there is a great tendency to refer to the Lord as He was here, and very little as to what He is up there.
J.T. That is just the point, what He is up there.
J.T.Jr. In the book of Revelation, John "became in the Spirit on the Lord's day" @Revelation 1:10, and he sees One sitting on a throne.
J.T. What he sees is in relation to the book of Revelation, but the Spirit brings down through Paul's ministry the mystery, what exists between Christ and the assembly organically, and so enlarges on Christ; the Spirit has come down from the Father and He tells the saints who form the assembly what the Father thinks about Christ. You must have all the greatness of Christ for assembly relations; only the assembly is capable of taking that in -- what Christ is. We are told "a woman shall encompass a man", @Jeremiah 31:22. There can be no doubt there is the
{147}
idea of the assembly encompassing Christ, not in the inscrutableness of His deity, but according to all that is revealed and made known of Deity, and the Holy Spirit is here that we might encompass Him and have affections suitable for such a Person.
J.W. I suppose in the setting in which He says, "I sanctify myself" @John 17:19
J.T. He will convey to us in some sense what the Father thinks of Christ, the great Person He is, and that draws out the assembly's affections. The Holy Spirit keeps that constantly before us. The Father alone has a right estimate of Christ. The Holy Spirit is capable of conveying the Father's thoughts and He is down here doing it all the time "He shall glorify me".
C.A.M. In the expression of the woman encompassing a man, you are showing that what was true of Israel in an earthly way, we can regard as the same idea glorified in connection with the assembly?
J.T. I think so. Let the Holy Spirit make Him what He will, and He leaves nothing out of the glories of Christ The assembly is able to take that in. It is wonderful that it is to be understood, that we are to see what is going to be eternally, the thought of a bride coming down adorned for her husband, suitable to Him, able to reciprocate His affections and His intelligence as well. The Holy Spirit impresses us with the glory of Christ. The Lord says He announces what He sees, and what He hears He speaks "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" (chapter 16:14). That is not formation; formation is another form of the Spirit's service. 'Announce' means something presented, an objective thing to you, to your intelligence. It may happen in a meeting like this; I hope it is so. The Spirit of God is presenting to us something of the greatness of Christ according to heaven's estimate of it; not according to an estimate
{148}
that I might form from the gospels, but according to heaven's estimate of it. That is the true estimate of it. Of course the Father gave a true estimate of Christ down here, but it is the glorified Christ who is the climax of everything. We are to be like the glorified Christ, and the Holy Spirit is here to present these things to us that we might receive them into our minds and contemplate them, and as we do we shall be formed accordingly.
C.A.M. Paul's view of Christ was a heavenly one, giving us another status.
J.T. Paul's is a heavenly view of Christ; He is a Man up there. That is the secret of the understanding of the assembly. Abstractly He is God. There is what He was down here, then the forty days, and then what He is up there. That is what the Holy Spirit is occupied with, to present Him as He is up there so that the assembly might be equal to Him in that position, for she is going to be there with Him in heaven eternally.
W.L. Is there a suggestion of limitation here as to what the Spirit receives for the assembly?
J.T. Whatever He receives He lets us know about in the most pronounced terms. The apostle Paul was wonderfully qualified to speak of divine things; what power of communication he had! He was qualified to bring out the greatest things, and they are spoken of distinctly so that they can be understood.
J.T.Jr. In Hebrews we do not have the writer's name, but you see Paul in what is said.
J.T. Quite so. He does not write his name; it is a question of the speaker. The prophets spoke, but in the last days God has spoken to us in Son. The article is left out, it is God Himself speaking in Son; the epistle coming through Paul by the Spirit. Hence the wonderful ability for communicating things! His opposers said, "His presence in the body weak, and his speech naught", @2 Corinthians 10:10. You
{149}
can see the devil was seeking to becloud what Paul said.
J.W. I believe he uses the word in @Acts 20, "How I held back nothing of what is profitable, so as not to announce it to you" @Acts 20:20.
J.T. He uses it twice in that chapter. @Acts 20 is the acme of the teaching of the Acts, it is full of love. "For I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God" @Acts 20:27; whereas in Corinth he was withholding a lot, but not at Ephesus.
N.B. You have been speaking of Him as known as He is in heaven. We have certain thoughts of Christ before the breaking of bread; but after He is made known to us in the breaking of bread sometimes hymns are given out in relation to Christ above, addressing Him as above when He should be known and enjoyed by us in the midst.
J.T. Yes, I am glad you brought that up. It takes the two emblems to bring Him in. The idea of remembrance is attached to them both. It is not in the gospels, but in @1 Corinthians 11 the idea of remembrance is attached to the cup as it is to the bread. You want to bring Him in fully, that is, the mind remembers Him, is recalling Him fully; that is our part, for the remembrance of Him. But then there is His part, when He comes in; He comes in all glorious. He comes in from heaven, and then the speaking to Him is not as above, He is there; it is the Christ that has the assembly that comes in, and the Holy Spirit would occupy us with Him as the heavenly One. All our remarks should bear that in mind, that we are now in the marital position, Christ and the assembly. What a scene is implied in that! In order that the assembly's affections should be stirred we must keep before us what the Holy Spirit brings in; the heavenly Man comes in, not even the Man of the forty days, but it is the Man as above. "For *our* commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory", @Philippians 3:20.
{150}
That is Christ, and we are to be conformed to His image, the image of the heavenly. All that is essential to the church's formation, so that we may be in heaven with Him in suitability to the environment. I believe that ought to enter into what is said after the Lord's supper is over, and scope should be given for reciprocation of marital affections between Him and the assembly, but on a heavenly line.
A.R. Have marital affections any connection with past history of sin?
J.T. She is taken out of Christ, she has no sinful history as in heaven, she is really out of Christ. Adam is the great type, Eve taken out of Adam. Adam and Eve are the great type of Christ and of the assembly as she will be eternally.
A.R. Paul in his ministry to Ephesus goes back to Eve, "concerning Christ and the assembly", @Ephesians 5:32.
J.T. Quite so.
C.A.M. Otherwise we could never understand the thought of a woman encompassing a man.
J.T. So that if you have a great Man, you must have a great woman, a woman equal to that place in heavenly glory. We are dealing with matters that belong to the eternal counsels of God.
J.S.T. Jehovah Elohim walked in Eden: now He has secured the man and the woman.
J.T. They are not hiding. The Father's delight is found in Christ and the assembly. These scriptures would suggest that the Holy Spirit is here in relation to a glorified Christ, and He brings in heaven's thoughts about Him, what the Father thinks about Him up there, so that we might gradually be formed to the heavenly ourselves in intelligence as well as affections.
{151}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (5)
@John 13:31,32; @John 12:37 - 43
J.T. The verses in chapter 13 speak of the moral glory of Christ, which is the phase of our subject that we have scarcely touched on. First, His moral glory, and then God's glorifying Him in Himself on account of this and doing it immediately. Judas going out becomes the occasion of these remarks of the Lord; the allusion would be to Judas¬ betrayal of Him: "Jesus therefore says to him, What thou doest, do quickly", @John 13:27. Judas¬ betrayal of Him would occasion His being delivered into the hands of His enemies, and consequently His crucifixion, so that it is the glory of the Son of man that is in mind. He is glorified morally in His death. It was ignominious of course, suffering in the extreme, but it was all glorious in a moral sense, as seen in a Man.
J.W.D. Do you mean glory in the sense of being an expression of obedience and love?
J.T. That is what I was thinking, the length to which He would go in obedience to God.
C.A.M. Do you regard Judas¬ going out as giving prominence to the fact that he was going to bring about the sorrows of the Lord and what led to the cross; or was it because of the greatness of His Person that Judas had to go out?
J.T. No doubt the light forced Judas out, but I do not think that is the glory that the Lord had in mind. It was the result of what Judas was going to do. That is a leading fact in the chapter. The devil had put it into his heart already to betray Him: "He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me" @John 13:18. And then in verse 21 it says, "Having said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up". Then the
{152}
Lord says in verse 26, "He it is to whom I, after I have dipped the morsel, give it. And having dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas son of Simon, Iscariote. And, after the morsel, then entered Satan into him", @John 13:26. Already he had put the thing into his heart, but now he enters into him. "Jesus therefore says to him, What thou doest, do quickly" @John 13:27. So then it says, "When therefore he was gone out Jesus says, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him". That a man should betray Him to His enemies is solemn, but the Son of man is glorified.
J.T.Jr. Do you view Satan as having full control of Judas here?
J.T. Quite so. He entered into him.
J.T.Jr. Does the Lord take the initiative; "What thou doest, do quickly"? @John 13:27.
J.T. Satan could not take the initiative in it. The Lord is in control as is always the case.
A.R. Even in the garden of Gethsemane they fell backwards. The Lord has charge of the position.
J.T. Quite so. He delivers up His spirit in this gospel; He does it Himself. That is a great matter to keep in mind. He is in complete dominance in all circumstances although it may not always be in evidence. The Lord's day and the Lord's supper witness to that. However difficult things may be, it is the witness that He is in control.
E.P. How do you view this thought of Judas receiving the morsel? "Having therefore received the morsel, he went out immediately" @John 13:30.
J.T. The morsel would be the witness of Christ's unchanging attitude towards him. He was not ruffled by Judas¬ treachery, He was still Himself. It is what He would have done anyway: the morsel indicated that Judas had the place of fellowship; the Lord is not changing His attitude. It is an important thing, I think, that we should be ourselves in all circumstances. Satan's point is to *ruffle* and upset
{153}
us and take away our balance, and disqualify the whole position. But the dignity of the position stands. No one seemed to know what was happening and yet one of the most momentous things was happening.
A.R. Whatever Satan or his agencies do will always work out for glory, for God is Head.
J.T. From God's side balance is maintained, God is never upset. The book of Revelation indicates the greatest upheavals, but from the divine side the throne stands in the heavens, and the elders are there too. Everything stands from the divine side. Another important matter in relation to the testimony, and concurrent with it, is that sin is being developed and being disclosed. That is one point with God, to let sin show itself: "That sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful" @Romans 7:13, so that we might judge it unsparingly. That is in one sense going on in the world, sin is becoming exceeding sinful through certain conditions. It is a great point with God that sin should be manifested and come to the light; the iniquity of the Amorites should come to the full (@Genesis 15:16). It is an important thing with God that is should be so.
S.J.H. I think you called attention to the fact that it was not a demon that entered into Judas this time but Satan himself.
J.T. Quite so. He is the son of perdition, he is called that; the man of sin is called that too. They are the only two that are spoken of thus.
Rem. Do you mean sin is manifested to the one in whom it is?
J.T. That is so in regard to @Romans 7, that it should be manifested to each of us: "That sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful" @Romans 7:13; that is in each of us, God helping us to see its enormity, not covering it up. But then you think of its extent in the world in myriads of beings and in devils too, inclusive of Satan himself. What a thing
{154}
it is! And God is controlling it all, and yet letting it develop and show itself according to what it is; and that would be in the man of sin.
D.G. Chapter 6 says, "Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil" @John 6:70. Would you say the disciples knew it beforehand, but it is not developed?
J.T. It was not His fault if they did not know it. He did not call Judas by name, and say, He is the devil. It is "one of you"; the point would be they should be searching themselves. The word there is devil, not demon; the same name is used for the devil himself. The Lord did not designate Judas as a devil there, He said, "Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil". Well, who is it then? They all had this time to find out who this man was, but apparently they did not know, showing the want of care and interest in the Lord's remark.
D.G. They were forewarned that the sin was there.
J.T. Yes, "one of you"; the Lord repeats it here, "one of you shall deliver me up", @John 13:21.
A.P.T. They began to enquire of themselves at supper: "And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him, each of them, Is it *I*, Lord?", @Matthew 26:22.
J.T. It is a wholesome thing if anything in the nature of sin happens that each one should challenge himself as to it. Is it I? The Lord could have told them it was Judas from the outset, but He did not because He wanted them to get this experience of judging sin.
F.C. If it had not been Judas do you think it could have been any other of the twelve?
J.T. There is no "if" about it, because Scripture foretold this; "that the scripture might be fulfilled" @John 13:18. It could not have been anyone else; he was the designated one in the prophetic word.
S.P. This 'devil' feature was amongst His own.
{155}
J.T. That is a solemn fact, and he was a sent one too. The Lord goes on to say in verse 19, "I tell you it now before it happens, that when it happens, ye may believe that I am he" @John 13:19. Judas was a sent one, and his testimony was valid although he was a devil. People might say, Look at that man and look at his conduct! They would invalidate the whole position of Christ because he was chosen by Him; but the whole thing is a fallacy, it is not so at all. God may use anyone to do anything, and the thing is right although the man may be wrong.
A.R. Is sin developing in view of the Son of man being glorified?
J.T. I think Judas brings out what was there in man, but in spite of that the Son of man was glorified. It is not the Son of God. In @Jeremiah 18:4 the potter was making a certain thing but it was marred; but then he did not stop making on account of that, he makes something else that is not marred. That is the concurrent thing that is perfectly seen in Jesus. @Jeremiah 18:4.
J.R.H. The care of the bag would show how much the Lord trusted him.
J.T. Yet John never lets him off; he says, "Because he was a thief and had the bag" @John 12:6. John exposes Judas. They think the Lord is telling Judas to do something with the money; that shows how dense they were.
J.W. Peter has a proper estimate of it in @Acts 1:16: he speaks there of the Scripture being fulfilled, and of Judas as having had part in the service at that time.
J.T. Yes; Peter shows himself there as a product of the work of Christ. They were greater men after He went to heaven, but in the ten days they are showing there was progress in them from the outset.
Rem. Does that indicate that we should know
{156}
things, now that the Lord is glorified, and not be spiritually unable to judge of things?
J.T. We should take account of things that happen, for God indicates certain things before the great result appears. We are not to be taken by surprise when it happens, as He says here, "that when it happens, ye may believe", @John 13:19.
A.A.T. We should not expose a brother before he exposes himself. Judas was not exposed by the Lord, he exposed himself.
J.T. Well, quite so; the Lord lets the thing develop, He allows it. The point is that sin is allowed to show itself, "That sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful", @Romans 7:13. Every minute that Judas was with Christ made his sin the more sinful.
A.A.T. Does that not apply in our relations with one another, that we are to wait on one another?
J.T. Quite so; you allow the thing to show itself.
Rem. There is an incident like that in regard to David; he says, I know that man Doeg the Edomite. We can have a judgment about a brother but in due time that judgment will come to light by his actions.
J.T. David did not let Doeg pass unnoticed, he could not. This question of sin is a matter of great consequence, in the world and in christianity and in each individual. The climax will be reached in christendom when the Holy Spirit leaves. God allows the sin to work itself out.
J.H. Does the Holy Spirit help in that? Judas passed undetected by the disciples because at that time they had not the Spirit. John exposes Judas, but when he wrote these things he had the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so; his own exercises were seen in it. It is by the Spirit. However, it is remarkable how severe he is on Judas as compared with the others.
J.W.D. What do you understand by "Resist the devil, and he win flee from you", @James 4:7?
{157}
J.T. I think it is because we are partakers of one Spirit in Christ. There was that in Christ that overcame him: "The ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing", @John 14:30. Well, he has something in me, but he has not practically if I am in self-judgment. If I stand up against him he flees, because he is already defeated by what is operative in me in the power of the Spirit. He knows God has overcome him. He flees if you resist him.
A.P. It is like Daniel purposing in his heart that he would not eat the king's food (@Daniel 1:8).
J.T. Daniel and Joseph are the best models you can get of persons resisting the devil.
J.R.H. Do you mean if Judas had been in a self- judged condition there would have been no room in his heart for this treachery?
J.T. Judas was not animated by hatred of Christ, but by the love of money. That is a sorrowful thing, he was a thief and had the bag.
H.B. Does it not seem strange he went through the test in chapter 6? He did not go away with those who turned away back.
J.T. No, he did not. He was there; he went the full limit of apostleship outwardly, even to the last supper. According to Luke he was with the Lord at the supper; his hand was on the table. He was ready to do anything against Christ; that is what the hand alludes to.
Ques. Would you help us as to the difference between the words 'demon' and 'devil'? The Lord says, "Cast out demons" @Matthew 10:8; it is not, Cast out devils.
J.T. Well of course the Authorised Version is somewhat misleading in that. They are two different words. The word 'devil' refers to one who is an opposer, an adversary, so that there is no hope for him, and it is a stronger word. The Lord says to Peter, "Get away behind me, Satan" @Matthew 16:23. @Mark 8:33. Judas was a devil. The Lord rebukes Satan in Peter, but Judas
{158}
was a devil; he was a man, a human being, but he was a devil: "One of you is a devil" @John 6:70, the Lord says.
C.A.M. He would never be the subject of the intercessory prayers of Christ. He would be in a different class altogether from Peter.
J.T. He would be of course; the Scriptures had said he would be that: "not one of them has perished, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled", @John 17:12. I cannot imagine the Lord, after He arose, would appoint an apostle who was a devil. It must have been to bring out the whole condition, how sin worked out, that the sin might show itself in such circumstances as that.
C.A.M. One feature about the Lord is that He always gave the enemy every opportunity that he wanted.
J. T. Yes, He gives full scope, of course. He bound him for a while, just as he will be bound presently for a thousand years. He bound the strong man and destroyed his goods in order that the Lord might have a free hand, but He gives Satan full scope so that he should show himself.
S.R.McC. Why does the Lord say, "He that has delivered me up to thee has the greater sin", @John 19:11?
J.T. That would be Judas, of course; in a wider sense it would be the Jews. Pilate represented the governmental thought, and the Lord would not becloud that. He says to Pilate, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above", @John 19:11. He recognises government in Pilate, but He does not in Herod, and the Jews and Judas were responsible all the more because Pilate would have released Him, bringing out what government is. Sin is allowed to reach its enormity; God could have stamped it out at once but it has gone all these years, reaching a greater proportion now than
{159}
ever before because man's mind has been so stimulated by modern science. He becomes thus more the vehicle for the expression of sin.
W.L. Would you say it is allowed to come in in that way to establish a contrast with what God is bringing in?
J.T. God has some peculiar reason for letting sin show itself. How much He makes of it in detail in the prophets and in the New Testament, particularly in Revelation! Why is He occupied so much with it? He surely wants to bring out what He is overcoming in Christ. "For this cause, even as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; and thus death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned ... . For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which is by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many", @Romans 5:12,15. By one Man death is dealt with, and "much rather" grace has abounded. It is to bring out the "much rather". In @Matthew 11 and 12 to show the turning point in the Lord's service we have things at their worst, and the Lord brings out greater things. He says that a greater than Jonas or than Solomon is here (@Matthew 12:41,42). Then He binds the strong man, "He takes away his panoply in which he trusted, and he will divide the spoil he has taken from him", @Luke 11:22. It is to bring out what is at work in man on Satan's side, and on God's side.
E.P. The very worst comes out in Judas, and then immediately this title of the Son of man and the fact of His being glorified follows that; in the face of every disadvantage this peculiar glory shines.
J.T. I think so. The very sinfulness at its extreme is occasioning the glory of the Son of man.
E.P. In @Psalm 8:6 it says "Thou hast put everything under his feet" @Psalm 8:6, and @Psalm 7:15 speaks of a wicked man, that "he digged a pit, and hollowed it out, and is fallen into the hole that he made", @Psalm 7:15.
{160}
Things are put under His feet morally and then publicly.
J.T. He represents the divine current in humanity. For instance, God says to Moses, What have you in your hand? Well, it was a staff, and God says, Cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent. Released from God's hand man becomes that. He becomes the very expression of opposition to God. Then God says, Take it by the tail, and he took it and it became a staff in his hand; that is, it is man again brought back into the hand of God. Christ is supremely Man in that relation as I understand it; the Son of man is to be glorified in that way. It is a very fine thought and running down the line from Adam. "What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?", @Psalm 8:4. That is, it is having Christ in mind that He should be glorified in the very kind of a being that dishonoured God. The very betrayal becomes the occasion of the Son of man being glorified. It is a triumph of God. Who can stand against it? The greatest opposition becomes the occasion of glory to the Son of man.
J.W.D. "The Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up", @1 Corinthians 11:23. Should that be in our minds every Lord's day morning, as you were suggesting?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord says, "The hand of him that delivers me up is with me on the table", @Luke 22:21. He was triumphing even then; that is, He was unchanged. One of the finest things about the Son of man is His unchangeableness; He was Himself, He did not alter, but keeps on showing His love.
C.A.M. There is a change in the word in @Psalm 8:4 from "man" (Enosh) in the first part of the verse to "son of man" (Adam) in the second part. @Psalm 8:4. Would you say that expression involved another order of man?
J.T. I should say so. It is the prophetic term, especially in Ezekiel and Daniel, and is a designation
{161}
that points out Christ. It is a divine product in man as over against the son of perdition.
C.A.M. I suppose in that Ezekiel was so addressed constantly, there were features about him of the Son of man. Is that right?
J.T. Remarkably so. See how long he lay on one side! Who could do that but a man of obedience? The motion is divinely supported.
Ques. Does the sin offering enter into this glorification of the Son of man?
J.T. It is all involved in what the Lord was going to accomplish on the cross; and now He says that as He is glorified God is glorified in Him. That is a great thing. And then He says, "God also shall glorify him in himself" (verse 32). It is a very precious thought, that God will glorify Him in Himself. I apprehend that "Himself" is God, and He will glorify the Son of man in Himself; and He says He will do it immediately, He will not defer it. Therefore we arrive now in our subject at a kind of glory that is present; it is a present glory that Christ has. It is not a millennial glory; it is a present glory that God has given Him immediately. God has given Him the assembly immediately; He is wrapped up in that.
A.R. Is the title "Son of man" more in relation to earth?
J.T. It is; still it has a universal thought in it.
J.R.H. What do you mean by the Son of man being glorified in God?
J.T. Well, it is a personal thought; God has recourse to an unusual thing to glorify that Man in Himself. He might put a man over a kingdom, as He does in crises, and other things like that; but to glorify Him in Himself without specifying what the glory is is a matter that is peculiarly personal. I think the immediate glory is what the Lord has in the assembly. He has got that now; He has had it every day since then.
{162}
J.W. Would there be a link with @Hebrews 2 in what you are saying? "But we see Jesus, who was made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour" @Hebrews 2:9.
J.T. That is right. Stephen saw Him up there. It relates to the universe. He is in heaven and Stephen saw Him and the glory. There is no deferring of this matter; He is glorified, it says, "immediately". God is so taken up with this wonderful expression of obedience that He glorifies Him at once.
J.T.Jr. Was that in mind when the apostle says, "*I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly", @Ephesians 5:32? It was glorious -- what was predestinated, what was before the world.
J.T. It brings home to us what we are to Christ now.
E.P. Does this thought of the Son of man convey inherent qualities? Would lordship and headship, Lord and Christ, be a subdivision of that thought?
J.T. Quite so, it seems to be a development of 'Son of man'. Wisdom saw sons of men and delighted in them. The prophetic eye sees the Son of man having great distinction: one says, "What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and splendour", @Psalm 8:4,5. That is a good question, and of course the answer is in Hebrews, "We see Jesus, who was made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour" @Hebrews 2:9. That is the One.
C.A.M. "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?", @John 6:62. That seems to be a very marvellous statement.
J.T. Very.
C.A.M. How do you understand that?
J.T. It is remarkable that that title is used. It really denotes the unchangeableness of Christ's Person. Before He came down He was in Deity, but it is the
{163}
Person known on earth, designated in in that way. He says, "The Son of man who is in heaven", @John 3:13. What dignity the Son of man gets in that way!
H.B. Is the moral glory to shine out in localities when the scripture says, "Messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory", @2 Corinthians 8:23?
J.T. That is just it. The assembly is to reflect all this because she is the Lamb's wife. The Lamb is the Sufferer, so that you get Christ according to this moral glory reflected in the saints. Thus moral glory is reflected in us by suffering for the will of God.
E.P. Is this carried into the assembly in some way? I was thinking of the quality of manhood. Paul says, "I know a man in Christ ... such a one caught up to the third heaven", @2 Corinthians 12:2.
J.T. It would be; the Son of man is designated in that way in heaven. So that a man in Christ would be fitted as taking on these qualities.
E.P. Is the Lord's position as Son of man meant to bring out features of manhood according to God?
J.T. Well, it is a prophetic term that finds full amplification and fulfilment in Christ as Man in the gospels. It is used about eighty-five times in the New Testament, almost wholly in the gospels, to bring out what He was. Then Ezekiel is the other place where it is used. There are other scriptures where you get it occasionally.
C.A.M. If the question was raised in the Old Testament, Where is the Son of man? the answer would have to be, He is in heaven.
J.T. Certainly. He says to Nicodemus, "The Son of man who is in heaven", @John 3:13. How would he understand that? It is inscrutable.
C.A.M. Daniel had the light of it.
J.T. Showing what dignity is in the title. You can understand therefore the glory of it, the peculiar dignity of it: "Now is the Son of man glorified" (verse 31).
{164}
J.W. In chapter 12 the Lord says to Peter and Andrew, in answer to the Greeks who desired to see Him, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified" @John 12:23.
J.T. I am glad you brought that up. It brings in another thought, the universal dominion of the Son of man. Alexander's kingdom is in mind. These Greeks represented man peculiarly, that is the educated man, so that in @Romans 2 it is that man that judges others, condemns others. "And there were certain Greeks among those who came up that they might worship in the feast; these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked him saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus", @John 12:20,21. Andrew and Philip think that this is a very important matter, but the Lord does not make very much of it. The hour had come for His universal dominion. He is the Son of man; He is entitled to all that according to God belongs to man; all the glory of the race belongs to Him. But instead He says, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone" @John 12:24. There is the coming universal glory of Christ, but the Lord says, That must be deferred and I must die. The glory He gets in chapter 13 as having died is, as I understand, the assembly; not the kingdom as in the millennium, but the assembly. He gets it in the interval. It is what God the Father is pleased to give Him as having laid down His life, as giving up His life. The corn of wheat must die, because if not He must abide alone. The point is that a new order of man must come in: "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit"; @John 12:24 not the Greeks, but a new order of man entirely, and that new order of man is to be seen in the assembly now.
Rem. "There came therefore a voice out of heaven, I both have glorified and will glorify it again" @John 12:28. God was in accord with what the Lord said.
{165}
J.T. Quite so, The Lord was troubled in spirit: "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?" @John 12:27. He asks God to glorify His name, and God says He has done it.
A.R. The Lord says to Nathanael, "Thou shalt see greater things than these", @John 1:50. Is that deferred?
J.T. That is deferred. It is the glory of the Son of man in the sense of universal dominion: "Let them have dominion", @Genesis 1:26. That is deferred. He must die, must bring out another race; not the Greek or the Roman, but another race like Himself.
G.H. Why is Ezekiel referred to as son of man?
J.T. Because, I think, he primarily bore the traits of Christ in some sense. His ministry pointed to Christ as the Son of man; there is only One who is *the* Son of man.
A.P.T. Nathanael made great headway in his soul; he says, "Thou art the Son of God", @John 1:49. Where does that fit into spiritual history, the ability to say that and then to learn about the Son of man?
J.T. I think Nathanael read the Bible; I think he is honoured in that he refers to @Psalm 2. He says, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel" @John 1:49. Philip had said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth. And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see" @John 1:45,46. Undoubtedly he was a real case to bring out a true Israelite, one that can quote the Old Testament and accept it and see the Person the Old Testament had named. So that Philip says, "Come and see", and he came and saw. The Lord says, "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile" @John 1:47; and immediately Nathanael said, "Thou art the Son of God", showing that he had read @Psalm 2; he is able to name a prophetic person.
{166}
N.B. What glory does Peter have in his mind in @Acts 3 when he speaks to the men of Israel and says, "God ... has glorified his servant Jesus" @Acts 3:13?
J.T. That was the immediate thing that had happened. Peter is testifying to the fact that God has put Christ at His right hand: "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear", @Acts 2:33. He has glorified Him, Jesus who died, whom they had murdered. It is a demonstration of Christ's righteousness. So that the Holy Spirit is given because God has glorified Him. This matter of the moral glory of Christ is worthy of our deepest consideration, and then the immediate glory that is conferred upon Him because of that: God will glorify Him in Himself at once, He will not delay. Christ got the assembly at Pentecost, and He has had it ever since. We want to give Him the joy -- "for the joy that was set before him" @Hebrews 12:2 -- the present joy which He has now. "Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies as footstool of thy feet" @Psalm 110:1, says Jehovah to Him. In the meantime He drinks of the brook by the way; He has got it already.
W.L. Would you say we can detract from that in anyway?
J.T. I think you may hold back what belongs to Him. It is what is His joy now, His present portion, a personal matter between the Father and Himself. The Father glorifies Him in Himself, and He glorifies Him immediately.
A.H.P. That would greatly enhance the Supper to us?
J.T. I think it opens up what Christ has now. What a time He has every Lord's day!
J.R.H. This seems to correspond with the time in which the Supper was instituted in the other gospels.
J.T. Yes, it does. It is carefully kept apart, but
{167}
synchronises with it. And then in chapter 12 we have the thought of a man who saw His glory, that is another thing. We want to get a man who has seen His glory; that is Esaias. Esaias speaks twice; John quotes from chapters 6 and 53 of Isaiah. Chapter 6 is the glory of Christ in the temple and chapter 53 is the moral glory of Christ as the Sufferer here, the Redeemer, and it is said that Isaiah saw the glory. It is to bring out that one has to see the glory to speak of it rightly.
Ques. Isaiah is often referred to as a great prophet of salvation and joy. Should preachers have this view?
J.T. That is what I was thinking exactly, that we might have it before us. These things spoke Isaiah as he saw His glory and spoke of Him, so that it is the vision of the glory that gives you power to speak of it.
A.R. He saw His glory and then he says, "Here am I; send me". @Isaiah 6:8.
J.T. Quite so, a man who saw His glory.
H.B. Would you say that is the power of Peter's writings? He says the disciples were "eyewitnesses of his majesty", @2 Peter 1:16.
J.T. Quite so; he brings that forward in his last letter. Paul says, "Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?" @1 Corinthians 9:1. He saw Him and hence he spoke of Him.
E.P. His train filled the temple. Is that the idea of a retinue of persons?
J.T. I suppose so, and the seraphim are there to celebrate His glory; they say, "Holy, holy, holy, ... the whole earth is full of his glory!" @Isaiah 6:3; not only the temple but the whole earth; it radiates from the temple.
J.R.H. Isaiah speaks in a judicial way here.
J.T. The judicial side is that they are past believing; He blinds their eyes, just as we were saying; the point is reached where God lets men remain where they are. There is no hope for them at all. I think that this ought to bring before us and teach us the closing testimony of the gospel here. In the gospel testimony the aim
{168}
should be to have it clearly set out, not befogged by any sectarian view, because each sect has its own Christ. It is Christ's glory that is witnessed to, and if people do not believe it is, as Paul says, because they are lost. There is a class of this kind of persons, and then there are persons who are lost that are to be saved, such as Zacchaeus; he is lost but he is savable. There is a class of people that are lost, and they are not savable; that is the kind that is in mind here. It says, "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart" @John 12:40. This is quoted several times in the New Testament; it is judicial, people have refused to listen to the gospel.
Rem. In Corinthians it speaks of the radiancy of the glory of the glad tidings of the Christ.
J.T. That is a wonderful statement. If I do not see that, it is because I am lost; Satan has had an advantage over me and blinded my eyes.
J.A.T. Would this be the theme and power of the gospel?
J.T. That is what we have been having these three days, the power the gospel has in your soul if you apprehend the glory of Christ.
A.R. Will you explain the last two verses of the scripture read, @John 12:42,43? Why does He say that?
J.T. That is a very solemn thing, is it not, that any one should be of that class? The father and mother of the man in chapter 9 were like that; they were afraid they might be put out of the synagogue. They had glory in mind, they loved the glory of man rather than the glory of God. It is very solemn.
S.J.H. Were they really believers?
J.T. We are left to judge ourselves. It says in chapter 2:23,24, that certain people believed on Him, but the Lord did not trust Himself to them. But in chapter 3 you have a remarkable man, Nicodemus, who evidently was a believer, and who was born again, but
{169}
he remained in the council. You might say his case is doubtful, that he is questionable; but John brings him out at the end to show that he is not questionable, but is genuine, only of poor stature. God brings these people forward here to show them He does not think much of them. You are not of much account if you are of this class.
S.J.H. They would not be vessels to honour.
J.T. Let no one flatter himself if he is a man who thinks more of glory from men than from God. Still, there may be some right ones like Nicodemus. I think he comes in as a genuine case, but of small stature and I should not like to belong to that class.
A.A.T. Will you say a few words about the glory of the Son of God?
J.T. It is a question of affections, the Son making God known: "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". @John 1:18. The loveliness of it comes out in such a One in that relation. So that Paul says, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him. For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us", @2 Corinthians 1:19,20.
J.R.H. What is personal to Him underlies what is moral.
J.T. It is beautiful to see the Son of man over against Judas. We have the Son of man glorifying God.
{170}
WALKING (1)
@Hosea 11:1 - 4; @Exodus 13:17 - 20
J.T. One has been thinking of the disposition the Lord would make of us all so that we may be mutually helpful, both brothers and sisters, in order that we may get the benefit of what there is available, and hence I thought of suggesting the idea of 'walking' in the Scriptures. It is said in Hosea that Jehovah taught Ephraim to walk and it is thought to link that on with the types, first seeing the bearing of the prophets on such a thought, and then the types in Exodus and Numbers. As I said, the passage in Hosea was suggested because it speaks of Jehovah teaching Ephraim to walk. That is how it should read in verse 3: "And I it was that taught Ephraim to walk, -- He took them upon his arms". The verses read suggest that this is a divine thought, that we should know how to walk. There are also other thoughts that enter into the passage which denote the divine and tender feelings shown to Israel as He took them up out of Egypt.
Then in Exodus, the passage, "And the children of Israel went arrayed out of the land of Egypt", really means, according to the note, that they went out by fives. That would be a military formation. Later it is hoped that we shall look at Numbers where walking is taken up more definitely in relation to the tabernacle, but so far the scriptures read are to show what they were as coming out of Egypt, formed militarily, not simply to make war but in view of the tabernacle, and how they were to walk in relation to it in certain groups -- four groups. It is thought that the allusion to Hosea would affect us as it is intended to, having been written by one who was a very sympathetic man, most tender in his feelings toward Israel, yet firm, saying the very strongest things which were needed. But what is especially in mind now, as we remarked, is as to our walking together, and whether we are to be divinely
{171}
taught to walk as we are divinely taught in other things. It says in @John 6:45, "And they shall be all taught of God" @John 6:45, which alludes to ordinary instruction, but what is in mind now is walking.
L.E.S. It is very touching that following on in that chapter in Hosea it says, "My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man, -- the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not come in anger. They shall walk after Jehovah" @Hosea 11:8 - 10. Do you think there should be a correspondence in these days with that?
J.T. That is just what is in mind. The first such walking is spoken of as alone: "Enoch walked with God" @Genesis 5:24 -- not after Him but with Him. It is an individual matter. So did Noah walk with God; and God said to Abraham, "Walk before my face, and be perfect", @Genesis 17:1. So that it was early in the mind of God, and the question now is as to walking together. It is applicable to a local position, as it is to the general one, for Ephesians speaks of walking. God had ordained certain works that we should walk in them (@Ephesians 2:10), which would be more general and universal, for there is a great deal of individual or independent action, I might say, in localities taking on certain ways and procedures. We should have in mind that assembly customs are to be universal. "But if any one think to be contentious, *we* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God", @1 Corinthians 11:16. So that in these procedures whatever they may cover we ought to bear in mind that there is universality and catholicity in all that is done in the assembly. The allusion to going out arrayed, meaning they went out five in a rank, is certainly very suggestive, indicating that we are not making any great show of strength or numbers, but yet in rank and order -- military order.
{172}
R.R.T. You have said that this matter was early in the mind of God. Is it significant then that the first mention of it in the Scriptures is in regard to God Himself? They heard the voice of God walking in the garden, showing that it is a very early thought in the mind of God, set forth in Himself.
J.T. Very good. They heard the voice of the Lord God walking. Very suggestive! So John in Revelation heard behind him a voice; what he saw was seven assemblies, seven golden lamps. The suggestion of the assembly is what he saw first, and then Christ in it, the Son of man in the midst of them; so that it is a good thought to bring forward. Adam and Eve heard the voice walking, speaking; the voice meant that Jehovah was there. And then we have what was alluded to before, that Enoch took it on and walked with God.
F.T. Would you say that experience with God underlies walking? Ephraim was taught. I was thinking of Mary sitting at the Lord's feet and hearing His words. There seem to be underlying conditions there whereby she would be able to walk.
J.T. Well, no doubt what is really involved in her position is that she was moving in the principles already inaugurated. It comes after the mount of transfiguration in which the voice says, "*This* is my beloved Son: hear him", @Luke 9:35. She was moving on that line and was hearing Him. She had an ear, not on the mount but in her own house (or at least in her sister's house) and she was sitting at His feet hearing what He was saying. The point would be, therefore, to take in whatever the principal word is for the moment, and this particular thing is what she observed, for she sat at His feet and heard what He was saying.
C.J. The man in @Acts 3 would be in line with this thought. He learned to walk with the brethren, entering with them into the temple.
{173}
J.T. He did indeed -- "walking, and leaping", @Acts 3:8
A.D. Are there certain features which should mark us in relation to our walk? I was wondering whether @Ephesians 4 would fit in with your idea. Paul writing says, "*I*, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you therefore to walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye have been called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, bearing with one another in love; using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace" @Ephesians 4:1 - 3.
J.T. That is a very appropriate scripture, and very general, for it is an Ephesian scripture. It bears on what we were saying in the sense that we are to walk together. We have already touched on one walking, such as Enoch, and God Himself walking, but what is in mind as Numbers teaches is walking together; and that is what I believe Hosea would lead up to.
C.C.T. Do we see this walking together in Elijah and Elisha? It says, "They two went over", @2 Kings 2:8.
J.T. Just so; that helps.
F.A. Is the figure a physical one, making use of the physical fact of walking which depends on the power inside, as spiritual walking would depend on our experience with God?
J.T. Quite so.
E.G.McA. Does the first part of Hosea set forth the children of Israel taking on the licentious character of the nations around, and then this prophetic word comes in to bring them back to @Exodus 13? They were not walking in ranks excepting according to the nations.
J.T. Just so. The nations influenced them very much, which is, of course, the case now; we are influenced by surrounding circumstances.
Ques. Why does God especially refer to Ephraim here?
{174}
J.T. Because he had the leading place in Israel; therefore the anointed kingdom even after its division is very often referred to as Ephraim; but it is a solemn matter that Ephraim was the younger son of Joseph and God moved him up beyond Manasseh. It shows that while we are moved up sometimes, or move ourselves up in local positions, God may have to take us in hand to point out where we have broken down as He did with Ephraim. Despite this the birthright came down to him, and he had the first place. The birthright was Joseph's. It had belonged to Reuben but he lost it because of his conduct and God gave it to Joseph, and so it came down to Ephraim.
E.G.McA. Does God use the word 'Israel' in verse 1 to indicate His sovereign choice and then the name Ephraim as guiding him in his walk to come up to this idea?
J.T. I think so. The second part of the verse would show that actual *de facto* circumstances are in mind. It is what was set up in the land, and Ephraim had the first place. God goes back to the beginning with Ephraim, when he was a child. It says, "And I it was that taught Ephraim to walk", which would mean in his childhood. It really covers the whole position in childhood days showing how God is interested in us, which would apply to every local company and to the whole assembly too; as in childhood days.
F.R.A. It is a question of teaching. Some of us have been under the teaching of men but it was God that taught Ephraim to walk.
J.T. Just so. I am sure we begin aright by calling attention to the childhood days, whether it be those of an individual christian or of a local assembly or of all the assemblies. That is, what pleasure God has in us in our childhood days when we are teachable, or should be teachable! Ephraim was greatly
{175}
favoured because he was one who was pushed forward or elevated in the family, in Joseph's family. But in Ephraim's old days 1 Chronicles tells us that there was calamity in his house, which is a common thing now. The brethren have calamities in their houses and it is well to take note of that. Ephraim's children went down to the inhabitants of the land -- whatever land it may have been -- to steal cattle and were slain. He felt the loss of his children, though it was their own conduct largely, and therefore it says there was calamity in his house. But God gave him other children. It is a question of how you look after your children if you want to save yourself from calamity. He had other children and some of the greatest in the testimony, for instance, Joshua; he was one of the posterity of Ephraim when calamity was in his house, showing how God may exceed our expectations even in the sorrow. There is a daughter born too that is mentioned; she built certain cities, showing what the sons and daughters may do after a calamity, when it is really accepted. Ephraim was comforted, his brethren comforted him, showing how after the thing is accepted God may turn it into greater blessing than we may expect. It says, "And his daughter ... built Beth-horon the nether, and the upper, and Uzzen-sheerah", @1 Chronicles 7:24.
R.R.T. Is this looking at the matter first in an elementary way?
J.T. That is what I thought, because Hosea is a very affectionate prophet and worked with other prophets. According to the history you can see he was working with other prophets, but he was affected by marital relations -- Jehovah's own marital relations and how they had been interfered with. These relations have a great place with God and the sorrows that have come about through them too in this country especially. Hosea deals with all this. He is tender about things and yet he is severe, as has
{176}
been noted. But he speaks about our childhood days. There are some brethren here that are, perhaps, coming into the truth; their eyes have just been opened a little and God is looking at their walk. It is not a question of the truth but how the truth is affecting us, whether there is any walk that is suitable to it, and God is saying to us that He is ready to teach us how to walk; and we shall see that that teaching involves that we have to learn how to walk with others. "But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", @2 Timothy 2:22. God is going to put us into good company in our childhood days and teach us how to walk, and that implies walking with others.
L.E.S. The difficulty with Ephraim was that he never learned to walk with Judah; but at the end "Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not trouble Ephraim", @Isaiah 11:13. And at the end of Hosea it says, "Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? intelligent, and he shall know them? For the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them" (@Hosea 14:9).
J.T. Very good. One might cite further facts about Ephraim both in regard to Gideon and Jephthah. They were encountered by Ephraim in their services and the Ephraimites demanded why Gideon did not ask them before he did anything. That is to say, Ephraim represents an element in persons who are assertive and make demands, arising from rights and ability and the like, that we may have. Gideon very humbly said, What was I in comparison with you? and appeased them, but Jephthah quarrelled and they lost more than forty thousand men. They said, "We will burn thy house" @Judges 12:1; they were violent. We do not want that.
R.R.T. All this is elementary in a way, but would you say that there is a majesty and a greatness about
{177}
it? That is, we learn that it is not in God's mind that we should be impotent but that He would Himself take on the matter, and is prepared to teach us to walk. "And I it was that taught Ephraim to walk". We get a thought as to the greatness of the matter, God Himself being prepared to take us on and teach us.
J.T. Quite so. The tenderness that we have alluded to enters into the matter here. "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son", @Hosea 11:1. It leads us on to the Lord Jesus. And then the prophet, as is usually the way, turns to something else promptly, almost without notice. "As they called them, so they went from them" (verse 2). That would be an allusion to subsequent history. "They sacrificed unto the Baals, and burned incense to graven images", showing how this prophet runs on to other things abruptly, and God deals with us abruptly too at times. And then it goes back again to what we are saying, the tenderness and the child condition: "And I it was that taught Ephraim to walk". That comes in here as if the Spirit of God would put it in where there is severity, as it says further, "He took them upon his arms, -- but they knew not that I healed them". There was healing needed. "I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I gently caused them to eat" (verse 4). So that it is like a child taught to walk and taught to eat, and relieved and healed and set up in his infantile days in view of manhood.
H.B. Is there somewhat of an answer in the first epistle to the Thessalonians where Paul's tenderness is seen in working with Silvanus and Timotheus in this great matter?
J.T. That is good. And then, too, he sent Timotheus to the Corinthians that they might learn in Timotheus his ways as they were in Christ during
{178}
his absence. The Corinthians really had not learned properly how to walk and eat. They did not even know how to eat the Lord's supper, and he sends Timotheus that they might know how to walk, might learn Paul's ways as they were in Christ -- not the ways of the world around, but as they were in Christ; and then how to eat, because if we do not learn to eat the Lord's supper we shall never learn to eat at all.
E.G.McA. Does verse 3 indicate the affection of Hosea where it says, "He took them upon his arms"? Is that a statement of Hosea's, all his own? And "I it was that taught Ephraim to walk", and "but they knew not that I healed them" -- do these statements indicate the tenderness of God?
J.T. It is like some passages we get in the Psalms. You sometimes wonder who it is who is speaking; there are other voices. Christianity involves that there are other voices; the voice that was heard in the garden was Jehovah's, but it was Jehovah Elohim. That would work out into the Trinity. There are different voices: holy, heavenly, divine voices, and maybe the prophet's voice. We love to hear them. You just wonder at times, in the Psalms especially, who is speaking, but when you really do learn you are enlarged and feel how rich we are that there are three Persons dealing with us who love us. The Lord says, "The Father himself has affection for you", @John 16:27 as if the Lord is saying, It is another love. The Son loves and the Spirit loves, because the Spirit is said to love us, but the Father loves us, and the more we get into these things the richer we feel ourselves. That is intended, because the prophets are intended to enrich us. What voices there are! So that you get, for instance, the seraphim in @Isaiah 6: "In the year of the death of king Uzziah, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple" @Isaiah 6:1. There were seraphim
{179}
and then Isaiah speaks and the Spirit tells him to do something, so that we are enriched in all these things.
L.E.S. It is remarkable how in Deuteronomy Moses recalls the voice of Jehovah moving among them and with them. In chapter 5:24 it says, "Behold, Jehovah our God has shewn us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God talks with man, and he lives", @Deuteronomy 5:24.
J.T. In another reference (@Revelation 10) the Lord Jesus is seen coming down. He roars like a lion, with his right foot on the sea and his left on the land. Then there is an angel that speaks, and John tells us who the speakers are, but the Lord Jesus is directing. John is to eat the little book the angel has in his hand, and he says, When you eat it, the way it affects you will tell whether you are fit to prophesy again. It did affect him just as the angel said to him, and he says, "Thou must prophesy again", @Revelation 10:11.
L.E.S. Do you think that the matter of the little book has an important bearing on our walking together? You had something in your mind about the little book.
J.T. Well, I would not like to go into that now, but there is a little book, and the one who was writing about it says, speaking of the Lord Jesus, "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written", @John 21:25. So that this little book is important as having a bearing on something that we should know. Possibly we shall come into the teaching as we proceed, but now I am thinking of this childhood condition and how we all need to be taught how to walk and how to eat. What tenderness there is in God so that we should learn!
{180}
C.C.T. I was wondering about the tenderness of God that has been mentioned. Would the intelligence of what you have in mind here enable me to walk with my brethren?
J.T. Just so. "Be ... tender hearted", it says. The Bible is full of these things, especially Peter's writings, because he treats of the governmental dealings of God. He deals with saints at a distance. They are at that distance because they are under the government of God, but christianity comes to them at a distance. Christianity sets them up where they are, teaching them how to walk, so that we are to "follow in his steps", @1 Peter 2:21.
Ques. Do you not have the teaching of this where John in his first epistle speaks of the old commandment and the new? The new commandment would be what was shining out in them and the old commandment the words they had received.
J.T. The old commandment was what the Lord was here, the word they had heard. The new commandment was the same thing, "which thing is true in him and in you", @1 John 2:8. The new commandment implies what we are, how the walk of Jesus is seen in us now. Christianity really is in mind as compared or contrasted with our Lord and His walk here below. I believe what tests us is our local companionship, whether we can really walk with the brethren, get down in order to walk with the lowliest.
G.MacP. Sometimes we may get the idea of independency in our souls. In @Acts 9 evidently Saul of Tarsus was taught how to walk with the brethren in Damascus; he was taken by the hand and led to Damascus.
J.T. Very good. Galatians enlarges on that, as to how they took account of what happened to him, especially a brother who was before him in the service -- a great servant -- Peter. Paul says, "I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter", @Galatians 1:18.
{181}
as if he would learn from Peter. The time had come for that. Some one had led him into the city and he had learned from Ananias. The Lord had prepared Ananias so that he should teach Paul, telling him what he should say to Paul. These things show the system into which we are brought, and how God has prepared everything and foreseen everything so that we should be taught how to walk and eat and do all things.
Rem. As the apostle Paul says to the Thessalonians: "We used to exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify, that ye should walk worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory", @1 Thessalonians 2:11,12.
J.T. Just so. And then another thing: the Thessalonians themselves were models. He tells them they became imitators of the assemblies of God which were in Judaea, meaning that we have to look far afield to get all the divine principles and not to build up anything in a merely local sense, or have any local customs at all. Christendom is built up on national customs, and local customs, whereas true christianity is a universal idea; so that the Thessalonians were imitators of the churches in Judaea, which were a long way off and in a different country too. The idea of nationalism is to be deprecated among the brethren.
T.S. Do you think we should get the gain of Hosea's name? It means 'deliverance'. This walking involves that.
J.T. Just so. Think of the tenderness with which he speaks of Jehovah's marital relations with Israel in chapter 1. "The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. The beginning of the word of Jehovah through Hosea. And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms; for the land is entirely given up to whoredom, away from Jehovah", @Hosea 1:1,2.
{182}
He is speaking about the treatment that He has received from Israel in this sense, because He was really a Husband to her. Then He says in chapter 2:14, "Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart. And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, that thou shalt call me, My husband", @Hosea 2:14 - 16. That is, she would learn to call God her Husband; she would know God and learn to know Him as Head and to be subject; "and shalt call me no more, Baali; for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name. And I will make a covenant for them in that day with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will break bow and sword and battle out of the land; and I will make them to lie down safely. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; and I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies; and I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know Jehovah. And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith Jehovah, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jizreel", @Hosea 2:16 - 22. Pardon me for referring to all this, but it is only to bring out this matter of teaching. Jizreel means 'God soweth'. Sowing is a primary thought. He sows her to Him, as it says, "For if we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of his resurrection", @Romans 6:5
{183}
We are planted and sown in that sense. "And I will sow her unto me in the land; and I will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo-ammi, Thou art my people; and they shall say, My God", @Hosea 2:23. So that God teaches us in this as He takes Israel up afresh in the future; and as He takes us up now He would teach us according to primary principles, and especially that we should be linked up in a marital way with the Lord, as Paul says, "I have espoused you unto one man", @2 Corinthians 11:2.
L.E.S. I was wondering if we do not get an example of this in @John 4, in the woman's having had five husbands and living with one who was not her husband, and then coming into touch with Christ? Was He not her Husband, and had she not to come to a moral judgment about her history? The valley of Achor became a door of hope to her and she was morally adjusted and able to walk.
J.T. She left her waterpot. She "went away into the city, and says to the men ...", @John 4:28 showing that she was delivered, because the principle in this book is deliverance, as was remarked. She had had five husbands and the one she had then was not her husband. She needed deliverance from them and she got it because she got the Lord. "Come, see a man", she says. I think that helps too, because she says to the Lord, "Sir, I see that thou art a prophet", @John 4:19. It is when you begin to see and perceive things that you show you are growing; you are not writing to others all the time as to what to do. "The Lord will give thee understanding in all things", @2 Timothy 2:7. We learn from the Lord. So the Lord says to her, "Woman". It is the first time He calls her "Woman", as if she had attained womanhood in being delivered. That is the teaching of Hosea. She was brought into the wilderness and taught to sing there as in the days of her youth.
{184}
L.E.S. She is brought to recognise Him as her Husband and no longer only as Lord. "Come, see a man".
J.T. "I have espoused you unto one man", @2 Corinthians 11:2.
R.R.T. She had never taken one step properly in a walk with God until she left her waterpot after her conversation with the Lord and went into the city. These were the first steps she had ever taken rightly; she had learned how to walk.
J.T. She learned something too about the value of the body. It had been devoted wrongly, not used rightly. She left her waterpot, which implies her own vessel, meaning she would carry the water herself; but that could only be as she was delivered from impurity. How could she be espoused to one man, a chaste virgin to Christ, on those lines?
L.E.S. So Ephraim says in the last chapter of Hosea, "What have I to do any more with idols?", @Hosea 14:8.
J.T. One thought to connect it with this condition in the last chapter, but the woman of Samaria certainly helps us because it is a question of womanhood in this book. She is delivered from all uncleanness. She, so to speak, calls Him, 'My husband'.
T.S. Do you include the marital thought in the Lord's calling her, "Woman"?
J.T. I think so. The Lord is leading her up to the level that was in His mind about her. She has come to that level really because she says, "I see that thou art a prophet". And He says, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father ... . But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers ...", @John 4:21,23 because she had talked about worship and He answered her too. Then He speaks about the true worshippers.
T.S. In connection with Adam's saying, 'Woman', it immediately follows: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife", @Genesis 2:24.
{185}
Is that the full thought?
J.T. That is the idea exactly. Adam named her: "This shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man", @Genesis 2:23. That name is to go on down. That is the word the Lord uses to the woman of Samaria to deliver her from five or six husbands. Such a travesty of marriage, to say the least about it! But now she is to have one Husband! "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?", @John 4:29. So that she sets something before the men and they come to hear too.
C.C.T. In that statement she really commences in service.
J.T. Just so. She is set up in service.
G.MacP. Does it suggest a subjective state in us capable of taking on divine teaching and being maintained in it?
J.T. I would say that; we begin to proceed. When the truth is set out people talk about this and that and the other thing; they talk about their clergyman, saying what a fine man he is, forgetting that he does not know the Lord, perhaps. They forget that, and many other things that God abhors.
E.G.McA. She really began to do what the apostle says in @1 Corinthians 6:20, "Glorify now then God in your body" @1 Corinthians 6:20. That is part of the walk.
J.T. just so. When she left the waterpot she left herself in that sense. She was a new woman, a new person.
F.R.A. Do we get a touch in Nicodemus? He came to Jesus by night in @John 3, but in chapter 19 it says, "Who at first came to Jesus by night", @John 19:39. Now he was not coming by night; he came with Joseph of Arimathaea.
J.T. He came with one hundred pounds of spices too.
{186}
T.S. Is the reason for so much confusion in christendom the lack of what is marital being understood?
J.T. Christendom is a travesty as regards God. The marriage relation must be there, and to admit any other is wrong. She says, "Come, see a man" @John 4:29, and the apostle says, "I have espoused you unto one man" @2 Corinthians 11:2, and John the baptist says, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom", @John 3:29.
L.E.S. So that it says, "Neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord", @1 Corinthians 11:11. If you have 'Ish' you must have 'Ishshah'.
R.R.T. In speaking about the proper use of the body as illustrated in this woman, walking really would be a fundamental thought, just in line with that; for after all in a physical way walking is a co-ordinated action of the powers that are resident in the child; and so in a spiritual way could we think of it similarly? God would teach us to bring into proper co-ordinated use all the spiritual powers which we have and then we should go on to greater things in the use of the body.
J.T. Quite so. We know how parents love to look at little ones as they begin to toddle, and presently they begin to use their members better and learn how to keep balance. It must be pleasurable to God to see us use our members as we get light, and Romans teaches us how to use them.
G.MacP. To "walk in newness of life", @Romans 6:4.
J.T. Just so.
E.G.McA. You remarked in the beginning of the meeting that we should not localise these truths. Would not the scripture that says, "Shall two walk together except they be agreed?" @Amos 3:3 be looked at in a universal way?
J.T. That is a word that one had specially in mind in view of these meetings. How can we walk together unless we are agreed? A wise man says that.
{187}
J.McK. In view of what you have been saying, would it not be a concern with us that in our local assemblies we should be walking in the order in which the assemblies in other parts of the world are walking?
J.T. "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", @1 Corinthians 7:17. I think what has been said as to 1 and 2 Corinthians is helpful and far-reaching too. Paul would teach the Corinthian assembly to walk, and then he says, for that reason I sent Timotheus. He also taught them to eat. He says, as it were, You are eating, but it is not the Lord's supper. You are eating like partisans.
J.McK. Would the letter the apostle wrote to the Colossians, in which he said that after it had been read in Colosse it should be read in Laodicea and that the letter to Laodicea should be read at Colosse, have that principle in mind?
J.T. That is right. That would mean that both assemblies were taught the same thing and yet Paul did not make them do with one letter, he wrote two letters.
F.R.A. It says in Revelation, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies" -- all seven of them.
J.T. Quite so.
G.MacP. What God may be working out amongst us, He will work out universally in the world to come. What He wrought in Ephraim will be wrought out in Israel.
J.T. The last chapter shows how they come to it. "O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah; say unto him, Forgive all iniquity, and receive us graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips", @Hosea 14:1,2 meaning there would be sacrifice in it. "Assyria shall not save us", @Hosea 14:3. That is a great matter for guidance negatively; do not turn
{188}
to Assyria. The king of Assyria was a pretentious king. "We will not ride upon horses", we will not be pretentious, using horse-strength; "Neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Thou art our God; because in thee the fatherless findeth mercy", @Hosea 14:3. It shows what God is; His grace and favour and kindness to the fatherless. "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him", @Hosea 14:4. Notice the singular there. That would be Israel, I suppose, as a whole nation. "I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. His shoots shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon. They shall return and sit under his shadow; they shall revive as corn, and blossom as the vine: the renown thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? (I answer him, and I will observe him.) I am like a green fir-tree. -- From me is thy fruit found. Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? intelligent, and he shall know them? For the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall therein", @Hosea 14:1 - 9.
Rem. It is good to see that God ever has recovery in view.
J.T. How full these thoughts are, and how tender! What one had in mind was the tenderness with which God deals with young persons.
C.C.T. Would you say it brings in the thought of a restful position? It says, "They shall return and sit under his shadow".
J.T. Just so. Canticles would fit into Hosea, where the bride learns to sing in the wilderness. "In his shadow have I rapture and sit down; and his fruit is sweet to my taste", @Song of Songs 2:3.
E.G.McA. You get the eager tenderness of God in verse 8: "Ephraim shall say" @Hosea 14:8, and then it says,
{189}
"I answer him". That is, God is in it. Then Ephraim says, "I am like a green fir-tree", and God says, "From me is thy fruit found". Those are the other voices of which you were speaking.
J.T. It has to be read carefully there to see who the speakers are.
E.G.McA. What should impress every one of us is that no matter how obstinate or rebellious we may be, God's love does not turn, and even if the brethren have to take up our case, it is the love of God that is behind it to bring us back into the knowledge of Himself as children.
J.T. Just so.
L.E.S. Is the urgency of the matter seen in the prophet Jeremiah where the word as to the early walk of Israel is, "Cry in the ears of Jerusalem" @Jeremiah 2:2, and do we see the result of God's teaching when she went out after Him into the wilderness? Do you think God delights to record this?
J.T. I think Matthew guides us in that because of the idea of the place children and youth have; children in the temple were saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David" @Matthew 21:15, and the Pharisees reproved them, but the Lord says, "Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?", @Matthew 21:16. That is the idea, and Matthew has it particularly in mind. The Lord is seen in the second chapter of Matthew as a little Child. He is called a little Child nine times and there is the phrase, "the little child and his mother", @Matthew 2:13. Also we have, "Out of Egypt have I called my son", @Matthew 2:15. And when the disciples are together they say, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom ... ?", @Matthew 18:1. Think of that in the light of the truth of Matthew and how the babe condition is stressed! The Lord took a little child and set it in the midst of them and said to them: "Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens", @Matthew 18:3.
{190}
So that we are shut out if we are depending on our own greatness; the Lord says the little child is the idea. It is "this little child" @Matthew 18:4 -- the one He makes the selection of.
R.R.T. It is beautiful to see what you are speaking about in the latter part of the book because earlier God had to say that Ephraim was oppressed and corrupted in judgment because in self-will he walked after the commandment of men. In God's dealings with us, although there may be that self-will and walking after the commandment of men, it is all, as we meet it in exercise before God, to eventuate in what we have in the end of the book.
J.T. That is the way the truth stands, and one would love to know the book better; and the brethren, too, should look into it especially from a marital point of view and the feelings of God about His rights over us.
{191}
WALKING (2)
@Numbers 2:1 - 34
J.T. There was some inquiry made at the end of our last reading.
E.G.McA. I was wondering how you would bring in the prophetic statement, "I drew them with bands of a man", @Hosea 11:4. Has it a prophetic touch to it in regard to Christ or does it refer to the influence amongst the brethren in bringing in the love of God?
J.T. I should think antitypically the Man would be Christ.
E.G.McA. The apostle says, "Be my imitators, even as *I* also am of Christ", @1 Corinthians 11:1. I was wondering whether you could use it in a practical sense amongst the brethren today?
J.T. I would think the Spirit of Christ would enter into it. We remember that Christ is in heaven, and the antitype is really the assembly here, which implies that Christ is in heaven and His Spirit down here, the Spirit of Christ. We read of "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" @Philippians 1:19 which Paul had in a large measure; so the idea of the man would doubtless be reflected peculiarly in him. The reflection of Christ must be the supreme thought in the economy. The man immediately in mind would be Moses or perhaps more particularly Aaron. He was a man of affection, and we learn in @Exodus 16 that Moses directed Aaron to speak in connection with the manna. It is said in verse 9 of that chapter, "And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel, Come near into the presence of Jehovah; for he has heard your murmurings. And it came to pass, when Aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, that they turned toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud", @Exodus 16:9,10. The speaking of Aaron at this crisis was such that it affected the
{192}
people. I think that involves the character of Aaron and, of course, it requires both Aaron and Moses to set out the one Man -- Christ, "the Apostle and High Priest of our confession" @Hebrews 3:1; it is the attractiveness of Christ which comes out rather in Aaron's speaking to us, His voice rather than His authority. Therefore, authority is to be kept in the background as much as possible. Paul put it to the Corinthians whether he should come to them with a rod or in meekness and, as we said this morning, he sent Timothy who was his child, a man like himself, who, he says, "shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ", @1 Corinthians 4:17. The sequence shows that these ways were evidently attractive. And so here it was not authority at this time, it was Aaron's voice and the people turned toward the wilderness. They had thought of going back to Egypt, and their turn showed that now they were changed; there was something attractive in Aaron. The word in Hosea is 'bands', "with bands of a man", @Hosea 11:4 as if they were not hard to bear. So the Lord says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light", @Matthew 11:29,30. That is, there would be the holding back of power and authority in such circumstances and the unfolding before their eyes of Christ Himself. So He challenges them: "Will ye also go away? Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God", @John 6:67 - 69. I think that would be something like what is referred to here and it should touch us, those of us who are in any way prominent in leadership locally or generally, that as much as possible the man should be seen more than the apostle.
E.G.McA. I think that is a very helpful statement for those who seek to take up cases that are difficult.
{193}
As you say, what a man is comes before his authority.
R.R.T. Rehoboam would be an example of one who failed through moving on the opposite line. "My little finger is thicker than my father's loins", @1 Kings 12:10. He was moving on just the opposite line and, indeed, caused the people to depart from him.
J.T. Very often the humility and meekness which marks the servant is more effective than the authority he may wield.
E.G.McA. So that you can really be severe in love in dealing with the situation. You have to present the severity and seriousness of the case, but there is the impression of love that comes out first. Is that right?
J.T. Quite so. No doubt Hosea has it throughout, hence the result in the last chapter, as we had this morning.
Now what is in mind at this time is not childhood or babehood, but manhood, hence Israel is counted from twenty years old in @Numbers 1. "Take the sum of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, after their families, according to their fathers¬ houses, by the number of the names, every male, according to their polls; from twenty years and upward, all that go forth to military service in Israel: ye shall number them according to their hosts, thou and Aaron", @Numbers 1:2,3. So that we are now in the presence of another line of things which involves manhood, whereas we had this morning just babehood or childhood, the learning time, the impressionable time, not finality but that which leads up to what is final, which is manhood. The full thought of manhood is found in the Levites in the same chapter. We are now dealing with the children of Israel viewed in their tribes, and they are to understand that they are men, which would be a further stage of the believer's history involving more than new birth, because one may be born
{194}
anew and yet not have the Spirit or be in full manhood. The Spirit is in mind and it is a suggestion of Pentecost when the saints were seen as indwelt by the Spirit. The Spirit came down and the Lord Jesus was in heaven, the full divine thought thus being worked out, the Man in heaven set out down here.
E.G.McA. Is the expression in @1 Corinthians 16:13: "Quit yourselves like men" @1 Corinthians 16:13 more in your mind than the thought of men in @John 17?
J.T. Just so. @John 17 would be, as I suppose you have in mind, a question of the kind of being, humanity, of course, but humanity in a certain stage of development. "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world", @John 17:6. "Quit yourselves like men" @1 Corinthians 16:13 would be men in contrast to children. Paul says, "When I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child"; @1 Corinthians 13:11 he emerged from childhood.
C.C.T. How do you connect this thought of manhood with a man who is head of his father's house as in @Numbers 1:4? "And with you there shall be a man for every tribe, a man who is the head of his father's house", @Numbers 1:4.
J.T. And then their names are given. They would be what might be called head men and therefore such as should exercise moral influence over the house and over all, which is important. There are only a few such, about twelve, and of course Moses and Aaron represent them particularly, Moses in authority, and Aaron in affection, the priesthood. The idea of rule would be vested in these, tapering down to lesser men, because referring back to Exodus again we read, "And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening. And Moses¬ father-in-law saw all that he did with the people, and said, What is this thing which thou art doing with the people? why dost thou sit alone, and all the people are standing by thee from morning to evening? And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to enquire of God. When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another; and I make known to them the statutes of God, and his laws. And Moses¬ father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou art doing is not good. Thou wilt be quite exhausted, both thou and this people that is with thee; for the thing is too heavy for thee: thou canst not perform it alone. Hearken now to my voice: I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee. Be thou for the people with God, and bring the matters before God; and teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. But do thou provide among all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place them over them, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens, that they may judge the people at all times; and it shall be that they shall bring to thee every great matter, and that they shall judge every small matter, and they shall lighten the task on thee, and they shall bear it with thee. If thou do this thing, and God command thee so, thou wilt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens. And they judged the people at all times: the hard matters they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged. And Moses sent away his father- in-law, and he departed into his land", @Exodus 18:13 - 27.
{195}
Well, now, I think the brethren will see how the economy stands with respect to the idea of
{196}
manhood, twenty years old and upward. 'Upward' would include those men who were heads of the different groups; so that in Israel there would be a great number of persons who were distinguished and who in their places would exercise influence for good, leading on to manhood in the younger ones. I believe that is just what obtains at the present time, and what ought to obtain in every local gathering. A man is what he is, and his influence ought to be according to what he is. The younger ought to be ready to learn from the elder although they themselves might not have the Spirit and be men in that sense; experience in the elders must be recognised.
L.E.S. Is the military idea a matter of manhood? Would the idea of endurance as seen in the shittim wood be the idea in manhood?
J.T. That works out in the tabernacle, for the tabernacle unfolds the greatest pattern, I would think, and that is where the shittim wood is particularly seen, there is no other wood in the tabernacle. The power is another view of the thing and the building is another view to bring out the latent strength that would be manifested in all these men according to their experience. This is a very important piece of instruction although given by a foreigner, Moses¬ father-in-law; yet it shows how God acts and uses such men as that for a purpose.
R.R.T. It would fit in with a remark you made earlier that God makes His own disposition according to what is available, the valuation of the material under His hand.
J.T. Just so. And so at the beginning in Moses¬ own case and that of Jethro, Moses fled to Midian when he was forty years old. That is, he was come to years; he had become great, but not in the sense of spiritual manhood. He sat by the well in Midian, which is the Spirit typically, where a man would develop and maintain his manhood; and the
{197}
daughters of the priest of Midian came out to feed the flock and the shepherds drove them away. A greater power is needed and Moses is ready, but he did not slay them as he had slain the Egyptian, he watered the flock. When his daughters came back so soon Jethro said, Where is the man? They had not brought him with them. That is the idea: Where is the man? We must keep our eye on the Man.
H.B. Is there a lack of that at Corinth? Paul says, "There is not a wise person among you", @1 Corinthians 6:5.
J.T. That is good. Where there are difficulties amongst us we do not need to go before the courts to settle them. It is a question of the least in the assembly, but he must be an assembly man, a man that is in the assembly and has to do with it -- an intelligent person.
H.B. Is it not a sign of weakness in local problems when there has to be much correspondence with the outside as to local difficulties? Does not the Lord raise up those locally who can help in these matters?
J.T. Well, He does; only that there are other elements that sometimes interfere with that. Brothers who are older perhaps do not have as much experience as the younger ones, and such things have to be searched out. A man is what he is, what his influence is, and we must make room for him according to this.
C.C.T. We were speaking of Ananias this morning in regard to Saul. Would he fit in here as showing the full thought of manhood?
J.T. We never hear of him afterwards; he is only mentioned in relation to the service he rendered to Paul. He was not a man of great distinction in a general way, but he served Paul and that was a good point. And so Barnabas served Paul too, but in a greater way; he brought Paul to the apostles, putting
{198}
him before the right men, whom God had set up to guide him and help him.
G.MacP. What would be the idea in setting up a prince in the house of Judah: "The prince of the sons of Judah", @Numbers 2:3?
J.T. You are coming back to our chapter. It says, "And the prince of the sons of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab". Now let us see what that means. The word 'prince' has come to mean more or less what is right at all times, but I think here it would also mean a person of great personality. There are such men, as, for instance, Barnabas, a man of great personality; a man with peculiar influence, not only serving as an apostle but as an influential man.
Rem. He was a man having moral qualifications, would you say?
J.T. He would have. Otherwise he would not be a prince. The word 'princely' involves moral qualifications in view of personality. So we see in the book of Ezekiel that in the millennium there will be "the prince". It is a designation according to the king, and would mean not simply that he was a royal personage, although no doubt he would be that and would rule, but that he would be a man of great personality, a man of beauty and attractiveness.
C.C.T. Is your thought that personality comes into the service?
J.T. It does. If you have not personality you have not much influence for good. I may have the ability to preach, be a good platform man, but not be a good mixing man, or a mutual man amongst the brethren as a brother.
R.R.T. The matter of being a man among his brethren and his influence among them is emphasised in that it says of each one of these men, "and his host", intimating that he had influence with the brethren.
{199}
J.T. Quite so. It is a very testing matter. I think Numbers takes character from personality among the brethren, that is, a man who is morally a prince and yet just a brother, sitting with his brethren as one of them. The Lord says, "*I* am in the midst of you as the one that serves", @Luke 22:27, and He was the Lord! As He says, "Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for I am so. If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet", @John 13:13,14.
R.R.T. Paul, too, is a princely man. It is said of him, "Paul and his company", @Acts 13:13.
J.T. You will notice there, as we have often remarked, that there is a turn-over. Barnabas is mentioned first as setting out but it is "Paul and his company" immediately, showing that the leadership was in Paul.
Ques. Is leadership seen in Peter standing up with the eleven resulting in three thousand souls being brought in?
J.T. Just so. The ability was there.
E.G.McA. Is there a double qualification in this kind of man? In chapter 1:4 these men are heads of their fathers¬ houses and in chapter 2 they are to be heads of the hosts. Does that link on with the universal thought of the tabernacle?
J.T. I think so. There were four particular men of the whole number, and four groups of threes. Nahshon was not only prince of Judah; he was not only head of his own tribe, but he was in a way head of them all, showing how great the position was.
L.E.S. Would the principle of overseership and elderhood as set out in Timothy come into this?
J.T. I would say so; but what I have observed is that eldership is not much sought after by the brethren, preaching and teaching are preferred. That
{200}
is to say, the platform is rather desired, whereas the elder is needed to look after the saints and also the shepherd. There are two words: 'presbyter' (the Presbyterians take their cue from that) and 'overseer' or 'bishop', but they both have the same force. Paul and Barnabas chose such: "And having chosen them elders in each assembly", @Acts 14:23. This was when they went out to secure the material for the assembly; they saw to it that in every assembly there were elders, not 'an elder', but 'elders', showing that the saints need them for growth and building.
C.C.T. That is the reason Paul called out the elders from Ephesus and brought before them the thought of shepherding the saints.
J.T. Quite so.
H.A.G. The thought of eldership does not exclude preaching, does it?
J.T. Not at all. The elder is supposed to preach if he has gift. That is provided for in Timothy: "Let the elders who take the lead among the saints well be esteemed worthy of double honour, specially those labouring in word and teaching", @1 Timothy 5:17. But notice that is a secondary thought; eldership is first, and then it goes on to include gift. Then again we find them recognised in the epistle to the Philippians, where it says, "Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and ministers", @Philippians 1:1. These latter would be deacons, overseers and deacons being particularly noted in the letter, as if the apostle Paul would convey the idea that he is thinking of them particularly under those circumstances, thinking not so much of gift as of men who are officers.
E.G.McA. @1 Timothy 3 gives more detail as to the characteristics of the overseers. "The word is faithful: if anyone aspires to exercise oversight, he desires a good work. The overseer then must be irreproachable, husband of one wife, sober, discreet, decorous, hospitable, apt to teach; not given to excesses from wine, not a striker, but mild, not addicted to contention, not fond of money, conducting his own house well, having his children in subjection with all gravity; (but if one does not know how to conduct his own house, how shall he take care of the assembly of God?)", @1 Timothy 3:1 - 5.
{201}
That is rather wide, is it not?
J.T. It is, indeed. I consider that the charter for all eldership because it is very fully given. The idea of gift hardly enters into it, although it is there.
C.C.T. Would that be on the line of the standard that we find in @Numbers 2? There is a standard for each tribe.
J.T. If the elder in the town was what was in mind when he was selected I would say he would be the leading man in the town, because the elders are appointed for cities as well as for the assembly. They are always found in the plural; that is to save us from the clerical idea current today. The clerical man would say 'my flock' or 'my charge', and think of himself as the leading man in the place, but he is ordained, as we call it, by man and his position is supposed to include all the gifts, whereas eldership does not necessarily include gift at all; it does not need gift.
E.G.McA. Is your thought in your opening remarks that there should be found a man of this kind in every local meeting; if not, then something must be wrong with the meeting?
J.T. It certainly is needed; and as I was saying a moment ago brethren with ability to preach and teach may lay themselves open for these services and be ready to accept invitations to other places, no matter how far away, but the matter of eldership be left somewhat uncared for, and I believe the brethren are suffering from this.
{202}
E.G.McA. I think you said that to develop eldership we have to be in the local company most of the time.
J.T. Well, we have.
Ques. Is eldership then a local matter?
J.T. It is a purely local matter. There is no such idea as an elder of the whole church. The Pope claims supreme overseership and so does the Archbishop, but it is false. Eldership is always local whereas gift is universal. Where the gifts are enumerated it says, "And God has set certain in the assembly" @1 Corinthians 12:28, that is in the whole assembly. There are no elders mentioned at Corinth at all.
G.MacP. Does Timothy set forward the qualities of an elder. when Paul says of him, "For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling"? @Philippians 2:20.
J.T. "How ye get on". Quite so.
H.B. In @Psalm 78 it says God took David from the sheepfolds. Is that the principle? We have to have this background.
J.T. So when he comes into the camp he is challenged by his brother, Where are those few sheep? Did you leave them in the wilderness? No, he had left them with a keeper. That is the idea. Eliab would rebuke him because he supposed he had left the sheep without a keeper, but David says, There is a cause involved and I am here for that, but I have not neglected the other charge.
J.McK. I was wondering if what Paul brings in would help in that way. Speaking of Israel he says, "And then they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul, son of Kis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, during forty years. And having removed him he raised up to them David for king, of whom also bearing witness he said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will", @Acts 13:21,22. That would be divine discernment in the choice of manhood amongst the
{203}
brethren, for Israel chose Saul but God chose David.
J.T. Saul was a man head and shoulders above his brethren; David was not that, but ruddy and of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to. His father never thought him a man of great distinction but the Spirit of God said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he", @1 Samuel 16:12.
L.E.S. In a locality where these two thoughts are expressed in a person, eldership and gift, how would it work out? Should a brother be necessarily pretty much limited to his locality?
J.T. He might. One has often thought lately that the brethren are ready to go any distance to give an address or to take a meeting for the weekend or even to take such an occasion as this, but the home front is not taken care of. We must not forget the home front. It is a common expression; but if the home front is to be taken care of, eldership must be there. No doubt that is why there is more than one elder provided for each locality. What have you observed?
L.E.S. I think what you say is most important.
R.R.T. I was wondering whether what Pharaoh said to Joseph would bear on it? Joseph took five men of his brethren and set them before Pharaoh, and the effect upon Pharaoh was that "Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee. The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land settle thy father and thy brethren: let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if thou knowest men of activity among them, then set them as overseers of cattle over what I have", @Genesis 47:5,6. Would that link on with what is before us here, overseers in the sense of elderhood?
J.T. I think that is good. The idea of cattle was abominable to the Egyptians, but not to Pharaoh.
L.E.S. In a meeting where there are a fairly good number of brethren things should not fall upon the
{204}
shoulders of just one brother; the element of elderhood should be in the locality.
J.T. I think the instruction that we have in @Exodus 18 is a full answer to that. There are chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties and chiefs of tens, providing a full answer to all that is necessary, so that the saints are taken care of. The man who was over ten would know every one of them, and the man who was over one hundred would know every one of them.
C.C.T. Peter's exhortation to the elders is, "Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising oversight" @1 Peter 5:2, showing the idea is really local.
J.T. 'Oversight' is the word.
C.J. The idea of the elders being in the plural is very helpful and the illustration you have given us in regard to David. The sheep were in good hands even though David was gone.
J.T. I have often thought of that. Eliab in his pride would scorn his younger brother but the younger brother is morally equal to the test, more than equal to him morally.
A.D. In relation to the home front, would Titus come in there? "For the overseer must be free from all charge against him as God's steward ... clinging to the faithful word according to the doctrine taught, that he may be able both to encourage with sound teaching and refute gainsayers", @Titus 1:7,9. Would that be the qualification necessary for the elders in order to protect the home front?
J.T. There is an allusion to the stopping of mouths there. There is so much talk that springs up amongst the brethren in localities, sisters especially being prone to talk, that we need to note this verse, "Who must have their mouths stopped", @Titus 1:11. The stopping of mouths is not a violent thing but a question of moral
{205}
power in the elders. It might necessitate a word to the sisters which is final and has a warning in it. God is sure to come in where there is talk springing up or anything like that.
Ques. What is the thought in everyone encamping by his own standard?
J.T. That is a good point to bring up. The idea of walking is not first here but the idea of encamping, because we are not to be walking as much as encamping. It is similar to an occasion like this; we are in camp now, or in assembly as on Lord's day morning. The idea in encampment is to be free in view of doing something for God in the way of His service. That is what is in mind here: "And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, The children of Israel shall encamp every one by his standard, with the ensign of their father's house; round about the tent of meeting, afar off, opposite to it shall they encamp", @Numbers 2:1. That alludes to the tribes encamped in their tents and Jehovah in the centre of them. He dwelt there, He was in the centre of them, He dwelt in the holiest between the cherubim, ruling in love, too, night and day looking out on His beloved people as they were around Him, encamped like sheep around a shepherd. He would look out, as it were, on the tribes. Indeed Balaam commented on the beautiful appearance of the tribes and what they must have been to God! He saw that they were securely resting around Himself, and that He was protecting them. Beautiful picture! Inside they were on the breastplate of the high priest; there were the precious stones representing their names, meaning that they were precious in the sight of God. How precious in the sight of God is the encamping of the saints in His service on the Lord's day morning all over the world! The saints are precious in His sight and their names are on the breastplate of the High Priest, four rows of stones, four standards raised,
{206}
four sets of three, three names in every group for Jehovah to look out upon, and He is their Protector.
F.R.A. What is the force of the words, "afar off"?
J.T. They would suggest a reverential attitude in us, not sitting around as if we were in a waiting room waiting for a train, but reverential. We respect God for He is the living God. It says, "For also our God is a consuming fire", @Hebrews 12:29. He is a God that loves us and that we love, but He is a consuming fire nevertheless. Therefore let anyone beware of lightness, carelessness or neglect.
C.C.T. Is it your thought that when I come to the meeting I should be very careful as to how I sit and act and dress?
J.T. What it says about the Corinthians is that they were eating and drinking in parties or coteries amongst the brethren; so to speak, sitting with those they liked best and leaving the Lord out altogether.
G.MacP. Would it refer to an actual state as we come together?
J.T. It is bringing the world into the meeting, or perhaps giving evidence of a loose household, but leaving out the Spirit.
E.G.McA. The same principle of "afar off" is seen with the ark; the people followed at two thousand cubits distance.
J.T. It is the same thought, I am sure.
E.G.McA. I think your remarks are most helpful. We take up these divine truths too lightly at times.
J.T. I am sure we do, especially children and young people, laughing and talking with one another, overlooking that God is there. It is a question of Zion and the solemnities of Zion.
L.E.S. Would not "the ensign of their father's house" impress upon the children what the position of their father was?
J.T. Quite so.
{207}
R.R.T. Although afar off they are opposite the tent of meeting and set in relation to it. They are facing that way.
J.T. Quite so. When they went up at special times of the year you would see the relation peculiarly. On the way up there would be families but when they came to Jerusalem they would have to learn how to encamp around the city. The picture here, though, is the wilderness, not the land; it is a hostile scene and we need to be on our guard for the enemy is all around.
E.G.McA. Going back to the line of walking we had this morning, the tabernacle in the midst and the twelve tribes surrounding it would have a tremendous influence on their walk. Is that not the idea? Each Israelite is not identified with his own tribe only, the tribes were not each a separate fellowship; but the fellowship is for every christian. We understand the dignity and preciousness of it by what is in the midst of it.
J.T. So that when you come to the actual setting out of the camp in chapter 10 it says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall serve for the calling together of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps. And when they shall blow with them, the whole assembly shall gather to thee at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And if they blow with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather unto thee. And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie eastward shall set forward" @Numbers 10:1 - 5. Now this is what we are aiming at: "And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie southward shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm on their setting forward". @Numbers 10:6. The other camps are not exactly specified but these two set out what is in mind, the east and the south; and they are to march according
{208}
to this word in the order given. So the silver trumpets would mean that we are not only to march but we are to march on the blast of the trumpet, and that would mean that the Lord has rights over us. The silver refers to the rights of redemption; He has bought us, He has died for us. We are, therefore, under His orders and are to be sober, as we said, and reverential, and walk as directed to do according to the standard of our father's house, each tribe in its place and each man and woman in his or her place.
F.R.A. The trumpet sound is like a prophetic word.
J.T. Yes; something like that.
C.C.T. When we are together the trumpets will blow too, but not with the thought of alarm. Why is the trumpet spoken of in connection with alarm?
J.T. Well, first of all, "They shall serve for the calling together of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps", @Numbers 10:2. And then it says, "And when they shall blow with them, the whole assembly shall gather to thee at the entrance of the tent of meeting", @Numbers 10:3. That is the coming together in assembly. "And if they blow with one, then the princes", @Numbers 10:4 not the elders but the princes, "the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather unto thee. And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie eastward shall set forward", @Numbers 10:4,5. That is, those under Judah and those under Reuben move. They are not to move without the blast of the trumpet. As has been remarked just now, it is a question of ministry, the divine voice heard in the assembly.
C.C.T. I was referring to verse 7, "And when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not blow an alarm", @Numbers 10:7. How does that come in?
J.T. That is an additional thought. The whole assembly is provided for in the third verse and then the princes and then the marching.
{209}
T.S. Would there be something similar in the recurrence of the word 'Lord' in Corinthians? -- the Lord's supper, the Lord's table, the Lord's death?
J.T. It is a question of the assertion of the Lord's rights over us and the word 'Lord' is used. The very day is the Lord's; it is the dominical day, the day of the Lord's authority, and that should enter into all our external movements.
Ques. Would the ensign of the father's house indicate that this authority is being held in each locality and our walk governed by it?
J.T. That is rather a family thought and involves the thought of the father's house. That is a precious thing too.
L.E.S. In @1 Corinthians 14 the trumpet was giving a certain sound, not an uncertain sound. Then we have the whole assembly coming together in one place.
F.R.A. Would trumpets of silver suggest that we belong to the Lord?
J.T. Yes; telling us that He has rights over us, the rights of love: "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light", @Matthew 11:30 but at the same time there is no tolerance of carelessness.
Ques. Why is the camp of Judah set forward first?
J.T. It is a question of the sovereignty of God. It is not Reuben but Judah first, and then sovereignly we have Joseph in the lead. That is all a question of the sovereignty of God. "And for those encamping eastward toward the sun-rising there shall be the standard of the camp of Judah according to their hosts". Let us look at the three tribes. It is said, "And the prince of the sons of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab", and then Issachar is next and then Zebulun. These three tribes are the first set and the arrangement shows that nothing is promiscuous, it is all in order and there is a reason for it. There is a reason for everything with God.
{210}
And so, one might say, What is the reason for the sign of Judah being put first, because Reuben is the older brother? This is determined in the book of Genesis, where Jacob their father calls them together and says, "Gather yourselves together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days" @Genesis 49:1. When he comes to Judah he says, "The sceptre will not depart from Judah, nor the lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come", @Genesis 49:10. That is the reason: the king is there. The king arose from Judah. It is a question of David really that is in mind because he is the first one of God's choice. It is a question of ability but of sovereignty too, because David was in God's mind sovereignly before He found him. I found him, God says; a man after My own heart.
L.E.S. "And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved; and he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever. And he chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds", @Psalm 78:67 - 70.
J.T. That is a good scripture. There is no question about it that the idea of sovereignty was there, because he was in God's mind. He was pleased to allow the selection of Saul, but only to bring out that he was not fit for the position and to show what was in David in kingly qualifications for the position.
F.R.A. The fact that the tabernacle faces east links with Malachi: "And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings" @Malachi 4:2.
J.T. Just so. The position can be determined from the first chapter of Genesis. It is a question of the sunrise. So the Lord is presented in the prophets as the Sun arising as also on the mount of transfiguration in Matthew, which is what we are at now.
{211}
It is a question of David: in Matthew He is "Son of David, Son of Abraham", @Matthew 1:1. He is also Son of man for Matthew speaks of the kingdom of the Son of man, suggesting the Son of man coming in His glory, arising in the east; so that the magi say, "We have seen his star in the east", @Matthew 2:2.
R.R.T. Is there not a moral order about this matter we are speaking of? Judah sets forward, and after him another camp and another in proper order. In verse 5 it says, "And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar". Do we have to learn how to encamp next to one another if we are to have the moral and spiritual ability to move forward in proper order?
J.T. Just so. The idea of the neighbour comes in there, whether we love him.
R.R.T. I was thinking it would link on with what you were saying this morning, "Shall two walk together except they be agreed?" @Amos 3:3. We must learn to encamp together if we are to move forward in the testimony together.
J.T. Just so, and when it comes to eating as in @Exodus 12 there is need to share together. "And if the household be too small for a Iamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; each according to the measure of his eating shall ye count for the lamb" @Exodus 12:4. If the households are small they need to love one another; they need to be able to be next to one another and to eat the precious Iamb together, share it together. In the Lord's supper we share together.
R.R.T. Would this principle extend to cities in proximity to one another, that we might learn how to move together and learn to be together in assembly exercises; experiencing what it is to encamp together and how to move on together in relation to the testimony and the interests of Christ?
{212}
J.T. That consideration has come up in recent years. We hardly had it fifty years ago as it has now developed especially in the very large cities that have grown up in christendom. It imposes an exercise on the brethren as to how they are to walk together in these large centres. London had the first problem. At one time they had even more meetings there than now -- a larger circle, and they found it was not workable. For example, Croydon was twelve miles from London; it was hard to make the principle of the neighbour apply there, and therefore it became evident that they had to reduce the circle, which they did. Now they have a circle embracing about four millions whereas greater London is probably eight millions; it has proved to be a wise change. This exercise has extended all over the world; in the last ten or fifteen years it has been greatly accentuated and has now come to this country. How are we to move together in large centres? Let us consider San Francisco for instance. I call it San Francisco because it is the great centre which influences that large area. The question is whether the saints there should walk together as one local company or as three companies. That is for them to determine by the good judgment that God would give them.
C.C.T. Does the metropolitan thought come in there?
J.T. There is no time to go into it now. I would not like to inject that subject into this meeting. I am only bringing to our attention the importance of love governing us and influencing us as with these princes; they work things out together. They are great personalities, they are not little people; they are great people morally, and they can work together. Well now, there are three tribes in the first encampment and they are going to move. The nine others will have to wait until they move, because the first blast is for them, and the second camp is under the same
{213}
blast; so you have six tribes moving together. We have been dealing with the question of walk: how do they move? Do they behave properly or are they a discredit to the testimony in their walk?
E.G.McA. According to chapter 10 God had given them two years to become accustomed to this requirement. "And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai" @Numbers 11,12. Does God give us time to digest all these truths?
J.T. That is a good thought. It is worthy of note that the original thought in the book of Numbers is 'in the wilderness', as if that were a title. That phrase would be your title, the title to your position, we will say, in San Francisco. We have to consider what San Francisco is, the characteristics of the city or the place. So 'in the wilderness' meant that they were in those circumstances, and they were there for two years, so that they would learn how to be together with affection one for another. And that is what the book of Numbers means, that we are in the wilderness in a hostile scene and we need to love one another, for the enemy is all around us.
Ques. Why was the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps?
J.T. Their place was in relation to the tabernacle. It says, "And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spoke with Moses on mount Sinai. And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, who were consecrated to exercise the priesthood" @Numbers 3:1 - 3. And then it speaks of the death of Nadab and Abihu which we do not need to look at for the moment,
{214}
but it does say it happened in the wilderness of Sinai, an intensified idea of the wilderness. And then verses 5 - 12 say, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him; and they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole assembly, before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle. And they shall keep all the utensils of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. And thou shalt give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given to him out of the children of Israel. And Aaron and his sons shalt thou appoint that they may attend to their priest's office; and the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel ... and the Levites shall be mine; for every firstborn is mine", @Numbers 3:5 - 12. Now if the brethren will look down the chapter they will find the position of the Levites was in relation to the tabernacle. They were not afar off from it, they were in it, as it were, keeping the charge. I am referring to that to show that they do not come into the same category as the four threes, they are occupied in the service of God in relation to the tabernacle, as near to it. That is important, because those of us who are serving in any way in regard to it have a nearer place, a more responsible place than the ordinary saints.
H.B. Would that be the 'us' that Paul speaks of? "So that death works in us, but life in you", @2 Corinthians 4:12.
J.T. Paul says, The Lord appointed us for the last. He says too, "For we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus", @2 Corinthians 4:11. That applies to all those in the levitical position. We are bearers of burdens; the burden of the testimony
{215}
rests with us. If we had time to go into it in Numbers we should see that each of the families of the Levites had certain burdens to carry, and there was the prince of the princes of the Levites -- a greater personage than anybody else -- Eleazar, the son of Aaron.
L.E.S. I suppose the levitical idea is suggestive of the assembly according to @Hebrews 12:23: "the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven". @Hebrews 12:23.
J.T. That is the idea, it takes us to heaven. Indeed the levitical position throughout is the heavenly thought because they are assigned cities in the land. They had no cities in the wilderness, except three cities of refuge (@Numbers 35:14), but abode in the tabernacle or near to it.
E.G.McA. Would you say there is a distinction between an elder and a levite? An elder works in a locality whereas a levite is in a local meeting but he works in regard to all that is of God.
J.T. We shall see it worked out in @Deuteronomy 21 as to measurement. In any question that has to be solved the Levite is involved and the thought is identified with the priesthood in Deuteronomy, though there is a certain distinction between them.
R.R.T. Is that involved in what is said of the Levites, that they keep the charge of the sanctuary?
J.T. A similar thing is said of the priests earlier.
Ques. What would mark a levite today?
J.T. We have to follow the line of thought, because if we go to the beginning of the subject we see that they are the sons of Levi. The priests are the sons of Aaron, but the Levites are greater in number. Priesthood is a more precious thought than that of Levites. There were about eight thousand Levites actually serving, though there were twenty-two thousand Levites altogether. The ones actually serving were from thirty years up to fifty. They
{216}
were to keep the charge of the sanctuary, in the sense of carrying things, the precious things of the tabernacle. So their identity is determined easily, because they represent the men that God is using to bring out the truth, doctrine and principles and that sort of thing.
Ques. Would you say that we should see the influence of the princes in the things that you have mentioned, but should we also see the influence of the Levites?
J.T. Oh yes, they have an influence too. They are Jehovah's possession, and are given to Aaron. All that points to the relative value of the Levites, and it works out in connection with what the Lord said when the disciples told Him that the devils were subject to them, which was not ordinary levitical work. The Lord said, Glory not in that, but glory rather that your names are written in heaven. It does not mean that that was not their work. Our work is down here but in heaven is our glory, our family place. Every Levite is a firstborn, which is most remarkable! You could not find another family of which that could be said, that they are all firstborn ones. Every Levite is a firstborn because he represents the firstborn of the tribes. Therefore when we think of heaven, it says, "But ye have come ... to the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven", @Hebrews 12:22,23. We have a place in heaven.
G.MacP. Is there any difference in the camp of the levites today?
J.T. No, it works out the same way. It is a question of working it out historically, as is seen in the wilderness. When they came into the land they had cities, forty-eight of them, suggesting the heavenly thought, an administrative position. The cities of refuge belonged to the Levites, so that cities have a great place in all judicial matters.
{217}
L.E.S. In such personnel as the house of Chloe and Lydia and Phoebe levitical features are found. This is not a matter that is confined to the brothers; sisters come into the levitical idea.
J.T. That is good. I hope the sisters all hear, because the Lord has, I think, laid it on our hearts to speak to them at this time, because they must function. They must have exercises. They cannot speak openly, but they must be able to think, and they treasure up things for the time when they have opportunity to speak. Then they have the things to speak of.
C.C.T. So every levite has his own place and a service of his own.
J.T. Exactly; every man is valuable and, of course, that includes the sisters as much as the brothers.
{218}
WALKING (3)
@Numbers 10:11 - 36
J.T. The encampments are stressed in chapter 2 which we read yesterday. There is a list of the encampments in chapter 33 which becomes interesting in the light of what we have had, a long list of journeys: "These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth out of the land of Egypt according to their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron. And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah; and these are their journeys according to their goings out. They journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. And the Egyptians buried those whom Jehovah had smitten among them, all the firstborn; and upon their gods Jehovah executed judgements. And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth" @Numbers 33:1 - 5. We then have a list of encampments, and the way in which God takes account of our encampments is a matter of deep interest. They are our gatherings, our stopping places, and God takes note of all that enters into each encampment and into the journeys between the encampments. In Israel's history they are written down, which becomes, as we remarked, interesting in view of the subject of walking, which has been before us. For us they are not necessarily physical journeys but spiritual ones, for the physical are figurative of the spiritual, and yet they are actual journeys made and actual encampments, because the encampment requires that the saints be together and has in view the service of God continuing.
Now this chapter 10 is the journeyings rather than the encampments. Yesterday we spoke of the trumpets
{219}
which governed movements, but there were also the cloud and the pillar which denoted the divine Presence and these should be before us too because so many nowadays assume to have assembly status in their gatherings whereas there may be no divine Presence, and there cannot be unless the saints are walking in obedience. That is the point that is made in chapter 10. It is said in verses 11 to 13, "And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stood still in the wilderness of Paran. And they first took their journey, according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses". So that each encampment had the evidence of the divine presence in the cloud and in the pillar. And then too when they journeyed the silver trumpet announced the rights of the Lord over them, so that they journeyed at the commandment, at the blast of the trumpet. All is governed by obedience, and hence any assumption to assembly status must be based on obedience. Christendom is full of independence in that regard, the will of God and the commandments of God and the principles which govern the assembly being set aside, and people doing as they wish very largely, although they may be christians. But the divine Presence requires that we should be encamped first and then walk in obedience.
L.E.S. Do you think that the matter of the silver trumpets is of paramount importance? It is said, "At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses" @Numbers 9:23. And then we have the thought of the trumpets as if the prophetic word is needed in order to
{220}
put the commandment into spiritual force and application amongst us.
J.T. Quite so. That is made provision for in Corinthians which is very largely our guide book, a christian's guide book, corresponding with the book of Numbers in the type, and hence stress is laid on commandments and obedience. Paul says, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14:37. Everything must be governed by that; hence, if I am associated with human organisations, although they read the Bible and the like, I have to find out whether they are governed by the commandments.
C.C.T. You were speaking about obedience. Would the reference to rank, involving marching order, bring in the thought of our all walking alike as to the commandments?
J.T. That is what chapter 9 has in mind I think, and this chapter too. Chapter 9 takes in the idea of the passover, the keeping of the passover. That enters into each encampment, and for the christian of course the passover is replaced, or at least added to, by the Lord's supper. We spoke yesterday about eating. Israel was taught how to walk but they were taught how to eat too, and for us the eating includes the Lord's supper. The passover, of course, is eating too, but it is found in @1 Corinthians 5 while the Lord's supper is found in chapter 11. Without the Lord's supper we cannot assume to have any part in the encampments because assembly formation must be recognised as we come together. Paul stresses that some of them were coming together not according to due order. We have to learn to eat the Lord's supper as well as to walk.
F.R.A. What would answer to the cloud now?
J.T. It is just symbolic I would say of the divine Presence; of the presence of God.
{221}
L.E.S. Would you say a word at this point as to the bearing of verse 13 of chapter 9 in reference to the passover?
J.T. It is important to bring that up. In fact the chapters that intervene between 2 and 10 are preliminary chapters, speaking of things that have to be done, things that Israel had to do before they set out on their first journey; and included in these things was the celebration of the passover. There is a considerable elasticity attached to it because if they could not partake of it in the first month they were allowed to take it in the second month. That is, a certain elasticity was allowed so that all who could partake of it should, and hence the importance of believers partaking of the Lord's supper. If they claim to be true followers of the Lord Jesus and claim they belong to the assembly, they should partake of the Lord's supper; hence the instruction about the passover is very helpful but very solemn because all persons who could partake of it and failed to do so would be cut off. How serious that is -- people refraining from partaking of the Lord's supper!
R.R.T. Is there any sense in which the partaking of the passover, and now the partaking of the supper for us, would furnish spiritual strength for movement?
J.T. That is the point in it: "But let a man prove himself, and thus eat", @1 Corinthians 11:28. It does not say to eat first, but "and thus eat". If there is anything about which to examine himself he is to judge it, but eat. If we do not eat how are we to live? Because we are to live by food.
C.C.T. Is the eating part of the obedience?
J.T. Clearly. It is a request by the Lord, but still it carries the force of a commandment. If you refuse to acknowledge or respond to the request you are lawless; "Let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14:37.
{222}
Those things included what Paul said about the Lord's supper.
G.MacP. Is that what Matthew has in mind in the thought of eating, that we would build up a constitution suitable for the Lord's supper?
J.T. Yes, "as they were eating", @Matthew 26:21,26 you mean. The Lord's supper was instituted while they were eating. It develops really out of the passover.
E.G.McA. But am I right in thinking that unless I eat the Lord's supper in the light of Luke I really do not move on to the right light of it? You say that the passover is in @1 Corinthians 5 and the Lord's supper in chapter 11. In my experience, in eating the Lord's supper years ago it was really in the light of the passover, the forgiveness of sins, rather than what the body of Christ is.
J.T. Yes, I see what you mean. The chapters intervening in 1 Corinthians are to build us up from the time of the passover to the time of the partaking of the Supper, and what particularly enters into that matter is the question of fellowship. "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of the Christ?" @1 Corinthians 10:16. The word 'communion' means fellowship, and we must recognise the fellowship if we are to partake of the Lord's supper because we cannot be free-lances, sitting down at the Lord's supper and doing what we like afterwards. We are in fellowship and are bound up with the brethren and have to learn to walk with them and to be subject to them as they are to us.
F.T. You would include that whole first epistle among the Lord's commandments?
J.T. That is it. "The things that I write to you" @1 Corinthians 14:37 include that epistle.
F.T. So we must not set aside part of it and accept other parts. That is done in christendom; selection is made of certain things of Paul's and others are refused.
{223}
H.A.G. In regard to what has just been said, there are those that say that washing of the feet in a literal way is just as important as eating the Supper.
J.T. There is nothing said about feet-washing in 1 Corinthians. Is that not right? It is in @John 13, and it is an individual matter: "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me" @John 13:8, whereas the instruction about the Lord's supper is collective. "I speak as to intelligent persons: do *ye* judge what I say", @1 Corinthians 10:15.
Rem. The passover is connected with the wilderness while the Lord's supper leads us into the land.
J.T. The Lord's supper is partaken of in the wilderness; it is preliminary, but the Spirit leads us into the land really; it is by the Spirit we enter. But I do not know that we all got what our brother had in mind about feet-washing.
H.A.G. There are persons who say, You make a good deal of the Lord's supper; what about feet-washing? What about the Lord's washing the feet? Is that not on the same footing? "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me", @John 13:8.
J.T. I can understand that and I think it is helpful to allude to negatives sometimes for guidance, at least for convenience. But we will have to leave that for another time. There is a time for everything, the wise man says, and the time now is for considering the encampments of Israel which are typical of the saints in the present dispensation coming together. So we are enjoined in Hebrews not to forsake "the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom is with some" @Hebrews 10:25. That involves the encampments and all that enters into them and we are not to forsake those things. We cannot say that the instruction about feet-washing is in 1 Corinthians, although it may be there in spirit. I would say the first epistle is the water and the second epistle is the towel. Feet-washing was literally practised when the
{224}
Lord used it but it is not used in christianity as a literal thing, whereas the Lord's supper is. It is carried forward in christianity as a literal thing that is done.
H.A.G. Feet-washing would characterise us in our walk and in our relations one with another.
J.T. Quite so, because we contract defilement and we need to have it washed away; that is by the water of the word, not by literal water, whereas the Lord's supper, the bread and the cup, are literal elements. Neither washing the feet as a literal sacrament nor keeping the passover as a literal thing were carried over into christianity, they are spiritual matters. We have to distinguish between the types and the anti-types and see whether there are any types literally carried into christianity. I used the word 'type' for things that the Lord instituted or recognised even while He was here. Feet-washing was hardly His institution for it was practised of old. The Lord said to Simon the Pharisee, "Thou gavest me not water on my feet, but *she* has washed my feet with tears", @Luke 7:44. Washing His feet with tears or with a basin and towel is not carried over into christianity, but it is carried over spiritually, and I believe 1 and 2 Corinthians teach what it means. In the first epistle we are set free from defilement through the washing of the water by the word and in the second we see tender care for the saints typified in the towel, wiping away the effect of the washing so as to make us comfortable and at ease with one another.
L.E.S. The widows put on the list would have those spiritual features attaching to them, as having washed the feet of the saints.
J.T. Quite so, such would wash the saints¬ feet. Feet-washing is an old thing, as I said. The Lord alludes to it, it was done in Old Testament times.
{225}
F.R.A. Why is it that in John's gospel we do not get the Supper formally but we get the feet-washing in connection with the passover?
J.T. I think the allusion is to contact with the earth. We were speaking last night of sonship; sonship takes us to heaven, whereas the relation of children of God is down here. "Beloved, now are we children of God", @1 John 3:2. We walk through this earth as children of God and should see that our feet are clean. "He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet, but is wholly clean", @John 13:10. Even the most spiritual of us need the application of the word of God to keep us right. It is a question of what is spiritual.
E.G.McA. It is interesting that Abraham brought water for the heavenly visitors. You would hardly think they would need it, but it shows the importance of it.
J.T. Quite so, I was thinking of that. Besides the removal of defilement, feet-washing is comforting and induces restfulness.
R.R.T. In regard to what you were saying about the Lord's supper and the passover, it says in regard to the eating of the Supper that they partook of it as they lay at table. Would that correspond to the encampment? And then after the Supper it says they went out to the mount of Olives. Would that correspond to the journey?
J.T. Somewhat. I do not know that you would call it a journey, although it was so in a sense, but it was an ascension. We have the distance given from the mount of Olives to Jerusalem: it was a sabbath day's journey and I do not think that is what is meant in moving to a new encampment; the journeys were much longer than that. The journey primarily from mount Sinai to the land was eleven days, whereas the distance from the mount of Olives to Jerusalem was only a sabbath day's journey, which
{226}
was, I should think, the distance between the tabernacle and the camp, because there was a distance between the actual tabernacle position and the tents of Israel. I should think it was about that, because that was all they were allowed to travel on the sabbath day, whereas the journey from one encampment to another took a much longer time. Therefore the going from the position in which the Lord's supper was celebrated to the mount of Olives would be a spiritual matter, like travelling from Corinthians to Colossians. It is an upward trend as the mount of Olives is an upward trend from Jerusalem.
R.R.T. So it would be a spiritual movement forward but yet not corresponding to these journeys in the wilderness?
J.T. That is what I would say. There was the journey that the two disciples took from Jerusalem to Emmaus. That would be a distance enough to be regarded as between two encampments, but, alas, there was no proper encampment at Emmaus; the Lord only went there to get them to go back to Jerusalem.
R.R.T. It would be spiritual disaster for one to remain at an encampment when the people had moved forward.
J.T. It would, indeed. The position at Emmaus was sixty furlongs away which would be seven or eight miles. That was about, perhaps, the distance between Corinth and the port of Corinth, which was Cenchrea, where the sister Phoebe resided. That, I think, would be a good example. She had the experience of going from Cenchrea to Rome, and it was a very long journey to take. She evidently carried a letter on that journey, so that she maintained her contact with the heavenly all the way across the Adriatic to Rome.
E.G.McA. What would be the difference between an encampment and the camp in @Hebrews 13?
{227}
J.T. That is another good point. It is a question of going outside the camp there, "Let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach" @Hebrews 13:13. Primarily it means that God had left Jerusalem or judaism and it had become a godless camp, a place without God. For a while God remained with the Jews; the Lord had told the apostles according to Luke to tarry in Jerusalem showing that God was still there. The services of the temple went on; God mercifully and graciously recognised them, and the disciples went to them. But when Paul wrote that letter to the Hebrews, the Jewish christians were to leave judaism altogether and go outside the camp. That is what is meant. And so it is that if I now belong to a system professing to be christian and yet worldly in its ways and principles I have to say, God is not there, and therefore leave it. "Let us go forth to him without the camp" @Hebrews 13:13. And so in 2 Timothy it says, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity" @2 Timothy 2:19. That would be religious iniquity, the recognition of false principles, human principles, in the service.
R.R.T. Do we get an example of this spiritual movement in the way in which the testimony was shifted from Jerusalem so that there was that which God was recognising in Antioch? There had been a spiritual movement of the testimony and if some were not willing to recognise it, it would mean disaster spiritually. I mean, the testimony had moved on from Jerusalem to Antioch.
J.T. That is what we get here. The tabernacle must move. It is not simply that the people move but the tabernacle must move. So we see in chapter 10:21 that "the Kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary: and the others set up the tabernacle whilst they came". Certain of them went forward to set up the tabernacle where the encampment was assigned to be so that when the sanctuary came in
{228}
the hands of the Kohathites (they carried it on their shoulders) they could put it inside.
G.MacP. Does this journey indicate the way we take on the ministry?
J.T. I think so; we move with it. God is moving, as said, from Jerusalem through ministry, because it is a question of Paul's ministry. That is the test. He was undoubtedly the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews, and there he says, "Let us go forth to him without the camp" @Hebrews 13:13. The time had come for the Jewish believers to leave judaism.
H.B. Would the principle of an encampment be seen in @Acts 20 where it says, "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread"? @Acts 20:7.
J.T. That was an encampment; just so. There were certain brethren there who were the evidences of Paul's work; the great point was that it was Paul's labours.
E.G.McA. How do you apply the setting up of the tabernacle for the reception of the sanctuary today? Would it be the acceptance of divine principles in order to make room for the whole truth regarding Christ and the assembly?
J.T. Just so. That raises the question of the difference between doctrine, or principles, and persons. It is a question of whether I am governed by the persons, that I like them well enough to go and stay with them because of themselves, or whether I am also governed by the principles or the doctrine. Many make much of the persons and little of the doctrine, and some make little of the persons and much of the doctrine. It is quite clear that we must have persons for the encampment; there must be the idea of meeting. The tent here is called the tent of meeting, or the tent of witness; witness would refer to the truth. The brethren here in this town have to meet together because the testimony is not fully expressed unless they meet, and therefore we see the
{229}
idea of the encampment and the tribes coming together to the tabernacle as set up. The Levites carried the parts of the tabernacle and set it up before the Kohathites came with the sanctuary which was peculiarly the symbol of the divine Presence because the ark of the covenant was there and the cherubim. So that when the tabernacle was set up and the ark came the cloud covered it. The pillar was a formation, the cloud was not a formation, but we must have both these things; the cloud and the pillar are the public evidences that God is with us. Inwardly, the priests would know when they got inside whether the divine presence was there, because the fire would come down to show that God was there. There must be some evidence that God is amongst us or we can have no claim to the assembly position.
L.E.S. John would know something of the distinction between principles and persons and how they are blended according to his second epistle where he says, "The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom *I* love in truth, and not *I* only but also all who have known the truth, for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity" @2 John 1,2.
J.T. So that the second letter is to the elect lady and her children. They had love for the truth, that is the point; but besides that there is the idea of persons, the lady herself and her children; and then the question of anyone coming to her wherever she lived, persons who did not have the doctrine. She was not to receive them into her house nor bid them Godspeed.
L.E.S. "Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, *he* has both the Father and the Son. If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into the house, and greet him not; for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works" @2 John 9 - 11.
{230}
J.T. I thought we ought to bring that out because there are many who think that if you are individually right it does not matter who is in the congregation you meet with, even if there are people who are not christians or who have bad doctrine. There are those who claim that so long as you are right yourself you can partake of the Lord's supper anywhere, whereas that is contrary to this epistle. Certain ones are not to be received into the house or even be bidden Godspeed.
T.S. In connection with Paul being a tent-maker, would that fit with his line of teaching, to enable us to live tent-wise?
J.T. I suppose you might use it figuratively, the fact that he was a tent-maker the same as the man and wife with whom he stayed -- Aquila and Priscilla. They were all of the same trade. There is no doubt there is an allusion to building in it.
G.MacP. What does John have in his mind in connection with "the doctrine"?
J.T. It would be doctrine in connection with the Person of Christ. "Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either", @1 John 2:23.
L.E.S. Does not the whole position hinge upon right appreciation of the Person of the Lord Jesus? If I am not clear in my soul as to the truth of His Person I am wrong in my associations and my church links.
J.T. Therefore the whole question of gathering comes into our subject. When we encamp, who are the persons sitting down with us to partake of the Lord's supper? Who are sitting down with us? Are they christians? And even if they are christians, do they hold the right doctrine and is their walk right? We ought to challenge ourselves and not claim to be in the fellowship of God's Son if we are
{231}
sitting down and eating with persons who are not christians. It is a question of what the bread and cup mean: the bread is the communion of the body of Christ, and the cup the communion of the blood of Christ. So that we cannot be partakers of the Lord's supper and be contrary to it.
F.R.A. Is that suggested in the light from heaven that shone on Saul of Tarsus? It shone on him and those who were with him, showing what his associations were.
J.T. Quite so.
R.R.T. Would it be right to say that the apostle Paul in setting matters right with the Corinthians, was doing there the work of Gershom and Merari preparatory to bringing in the sanctuary?
J.T. Quite so. The place was being made ready.
E.G.McA. Would you say that verse 42 of @Acts 3, "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" @Acts 3:42, is the counterpart in christianity of what would be covered by this chapter 10 in Numbers?
J.T. Just so, and the doctrine comes before the breaking of bread, it is a question of the doctrine and then the fellowship. The doctrine must be there first and then the fellowship, which implies persons. We cannot assume that just because a person is a christian, and I know him to be a christian, he is fit for the Lord's supper, because in fact the man in @1 Corinthians 5 was a christian. The sequel showed that he was genuine because he was restored, but could he continue to break bread because he was a christian? No, he had to be put out: "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves", @1 Corinthians 5:13. So that we can see that the fact that a person is a christian is not everything; he must be clean.
C.C.T. I think you said a few months ago in regard to those who sought fellowship that we should
{232}
find out from them what they know about the circle of the fellowship of saints.
J.T. There is the matter of mixed marriages. Someone might go out and marry a person whose conduct was not right and yet was undeniably a christian. This would be denying the truth, because cleanliness and purity must precede all these links. So that it is the doctrine of the apostles and then their fellowship.
L.E.S. So that marriage in the Lord would be covered by the commandments of the Lord -- the matter of the journeys.
J.T. Quite so.
E.G.McA. If I were seeking the right place I would be governed by this order. I would have to enquire as to the doctrine held by those with whom I should like to associate and then see what there was in the fellowship. The doctrine would surround and protect the truth of the person of Christ. Would that also bring in the statement of yesterday morning, "Shall two walk together except they be agreed?", @Amos 3:3.
J.T. These are all most practical considerations especially as there are many amongst us who are exercised about entering into a marriage contract or into the fellowship, because the fellowship involves a contract too. Fellowship, breaking of bread and prayers; that is the order.
C.C.T. What is the contract involved in the fellowship?
J.T. Baptism in a certain sense leads to it. In @1 Peter 3:21 it says, "Which figure also now saves you, even baptism", @1 Peter 3:21. There is a certain saving principle in baptism and we have attached to it the idea of a contract as suggested in the note to that verse. That is, if you are baptised by someone you are introduced publicly into christianity and you are committed to something, you are professing to be a real christian. We are alluding now to adult baptism;
{233}
household baptism involves the same idea, because the parents must be in fellowship or in the contract, as it were, and that leads up to the breaking of bread. These are the two public sacraments, as we might call them, baptism and the Lord's supper, and they are literally done, one by water, and one by bread and wine.
F.T. It would seem that the Lord's supper is a precious privilege which is guarded by the fellowship.
J.T. It is guarded by the fellowship which means that there are persons involved, and the doctrine precedes both. For the idea of fellowship and the breaking of bread you must have persons.
G.MacP. The idea of a contract suggests the thought of being bound.
J.T. One is bound to the brethren. At Pentecost they were all together, and the Spirit came upon them and they were bound together in holy fellowship, the apostles¬ fellowship. But the doctrine was there too, the apostles¬ doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayers. Thus they were obligated to one another and persons would not say in those days, I can do as I like; I can marry whom I please. Paul says, You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of demons. Christendom can do it, but if I am a righteous person I cannot do it for righteousness forbids me.
F.R.A. Would you say that Moses took up the contract? When he came to years he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, but chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God. He entered into the truth of baptism.
J.T. He had been regarded as of Pharaoh's household, but he renounced the position and refused to be called that any more.
C.J. In these encampments, if the tabernacle and all that was in it were to be properly protected an
{234}
Israelite could not pitch his tent just where he pleased.
J.T. There was protection there, as you say, and he must pitch in his own assignment. There was divine protection in the cloud and the pillar all the time; the presence of God involves that.
F.T. Will you say a little more about the taking up of the cloud and the cloud standing still? Does it suggest that we must ever be ready to take on the spirit of the ministry?
J.T. Quite so; it is a question of seeing the thing. I believe the passage already alluded to in @Hebrews 13 is the best illustration you can get. The cloud had moved from Jerusalem out among the gentiles at Antioch and the Jewish christians were called upon to go out, not necessarily actually, but to go out in fellowship and heart and affections towards the believers among the gentiles.
F.T. I was thinking of applying that in our day. The Spirit of God is always moving forward and we are not getting the same ministry we had twenty or forty years ago; we must be up to date.
J.T. Quite so.
F.T. You said the cloud was not a formation but the pillar was?
J.T. It fitted into the night. I think the idea of formation must apply to the pillar. Anyone can see by thoughtfulness that -- whatever the substance was -- there was something there more formed than a cloud. A cloud is more loose; I think the pillar would be a more limited thought. It is remarkable that it moved behind Israel when the Egyptians were attacking, and was a protection. The Israelites could see it, indicating that this formation is on our behalf. And then this cloud is not just any cloud; the universe might be filled with clouds, but not with this pillar and the cloud that was over the tabernacle. They were discernible so as to be a guide.
{235}
F.R.A. Do we get the thought of this cloud in @1 Corinthians 14 where the man coming in would say that God is among us?
J.T. That is it. He would report that God is among you of a truth.
C.J. In these journeyings the tribe of Dan and his host brought up the rear. Might that be suggestive of meetings a little bit reluctant to take on present ministry in relation to the testimony?
J.T. I do not know. Dan's position was as much assigned by God as Judah's. It was a question of the will of God. I believe the points of the compass are intended to help us in that respect, and they are seen more particularly when the people are encamped. Judah was toward the sunrising; Reuben was toward the south, a warm and favourable setting. Ephraim was toward the west, which would be a solemn idea because there the sun sets. They faced the going down of the sun. It is said of Abraham that a horror of great darkness came over him at that time. Dan was toward the north, his assignment involved the bitter, disciplinary winds of the north. Ephraim had the tendency to discontent and unbelief. We know that matters in the camp of Reuben would be favourable, suggesting a favourable position for us. And then Judah would observe the rising of the sun, and all would be hopeful. The points of the compass are intended to affect the human mind in just that way, I believe, and to the christian it is all spiritual.
E.G.McA. Is it worth noticing that the tribe of Dan's encampment included Asher and Naphtali? They had a spiritual outlook.
J.T. Just so; Asher's foot was dipped in oil.
G.MacP. Would it suggest the truth in relation to the universality of the testimony worked out in four different camps?
{236}
J.T. The points of the compass, I think, would help us as to what we are assigned to in the will of God. If I am in a small meeting I am more likely to be attacked and to be discontented, so that it needs more exercise. We can work it out in that way.
Chapter 10 is not encamping, although they did encamp, but the point stressed is the journeyings, and they are enlarged upon in chapter 33. What we see here is the place that the tabernacle had, how it fitted in between the two sets of encampments, and how the Kohathites carried the sanctuary. It would all raise the question as to whether we are attending the meetings, because we are essential to the meetings.
G.MacP. I do not want to divert you but I was wondering whether the apostle Peter took a very definite journey in the apostle Paul's ministry; speaking of him as "our beloved brother Paul", @2 Peter 3:15.
J.T. Yes, that is good. Peter never mentions the Son of God in his ministry except in the second epistle, so that he came into the good of it clearly, although he had had the light earlier. There was a distinct revelation in Paul inwardly, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me", he says, @Galatians 1:15,16. It was an inward matter with Paul, whereas it was *to* Peter.
G.MacP. It is a great thing to realise the encampments of the Spirit of God in our journeyings.
J.T. We may look for these on the first day of the week because it is a question of the beginning of days.
Ques. In connection with the journey, is it a military idea?
J.T. Yes; and in that connection we get something here as regards Moses¬ father-in-law. That is, Moses felt he needed a man to help him in the wilderness. It says in verse 29, "And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses¬ father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it unto you: come with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel. And he said to him, I will not go; but to mine own land, and to my kindred will I go. And he said, Leave me not, I pray thee, because thou knowest where we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou wilt be to us for eyes. And it shall be, if thou come with us, that whatever good Jehovah doeth unto us, so will we do to thee".
{237}
Now I just refer to this paragraph because it brings in something that we are likely to make too much of, that is natural relationships in the things of God. Moses¬ father-in-law was useful, according to chapter 18 of Exodus; he served well in pointing out to Moses a state of things that would tend to wear him out, and Moses took his advice and God evidently blessed him. But now Moses is seeking his help again and this time he does not help, nor does he even indicate that he cares much for the saints. He says, "I will not go; but to mine own land, and to my kindred will I go". Now the only point I am making is that natural relationships are not to be trusted in the things of God. Moses is finding out here that although the relationship with his father-in-law was good, and profitable too, yet it did not last; it could not be trusted. We are not to trust our natural relationships, we cannot rely on them, and hence what follows is that in verse 33 it says, "And they set forward from the mountain of Jehovah and went three days¬ journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days¬ journey". Instead of Hobab we have the ark of the covenant. Our natural relatives are not trustworthy, but the Lord is trustworthy; the ark of the covenant is trustworthy. The thing for us is to come into the knowledge of divine Persons, just as we have been saying; the doctrine of the Deity, the Persons of the Godhead as John presents Them in his epistle.
{238}
Let us be sure about those things and not keep company with persons who do not hold the truth of the Deity of the Person of the Son of God.
R.R.T. Would you say that what entered into this matter was a turning to the wisdom of men rather than of God? Moses said to him, "Thou knowest where we are to encamp in the wilderness" (verse 31), which was God's matter alone.
J.T. Moses was evidently trusting him and expecting that he would serve him, but I think the passage shows that we cannot rely on such; but we can rely on the ark of the covenant which came out of its place. Earlier verses show that the ark of the covenant was in the very centre of the journey but here it came out and went to the front, showing that divine love will never fail us.
G.MacP. Does @John 13 indicate that? "Jesus ... having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end" @John 13:1.
J.T. That is a good passage. They were in the world, in the wilderness too.
H.B. In @Acts 15 Barnabas proposed to take his relative, John called Mark, but Paul comes forward and takes Silas, and they are committed to the grace of God.
J.T. God was with Paul and Silas.
G.MacP. What would you say about the ark moving out of its place?
J.T. I think the Lord would tell us about that now. What love is in God! "Love never fails", @1 Corinthians 13:8.
E.G.McA. Verse 34 says, "The cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they set forward out of the camp".
J.T. Beautiful! And then Moses¬ blessing comes in, something akin to chapter 6, where Aaron is brought into it. As the ark set forward Moses said, "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thy face. And when it rested, he said, Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel" (verses 35,36).
{239}
These are words for us all, especially where we are gathered in very small numbers; what a comfort that God is there!
E.G.McA. Does this indicate that Moses, despite his slight defects in regard of his father-in-law, is fully recovered in the power of leadership now?
J.T. I am sure that is true. Love settled the matter. Moses is a good example of that; he recovered himself quickly.
F.R.A. In verse 33 the ark seeks out a resting place for them, not an encampment; it was really a resting place for the ark.
J.T. It is the ark that does it, the Lord is before us, and I suppose we should look for this on the first day of the week, that the Lord will take the lead forward as He comes in. We may be counting on one another and say, Such and such a brother will be there, but they may fail us. The Lord is available, that is the idea, and love never fails.
L.E.S. What a difference between the eyes of Hobab and the eyes of Jehovah! "The eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him", @2 Chronicles 16:9. That is the idea of the ark.
J.T. This is a very victorious chapter. One often feels how one fails to lead as one considers this matter of Moses and Hobab. Hobab was a good man in a way, but he failed Moses. Now Moses is filled with the idea of Jehovah and the military thought: "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered" -- that refers to leaving the encamping places -- "and let them that hate thee flee before thy face. And when it rested, he said, Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel". We sometimes quail before the smallness of our numbers, but
{240}
we are going to have great numbers. Enoch speaks of the holy myriads, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads", @Jude 14.
T.S. Does this help us in the many difficulties that may face us in these days? They are not our enemies, but God's. I was thinking of unions and the like; God is taking care of us in these matters, they are His enemies.
J.T. I am sure the brethren have proved that. No doubt you have seen it. I never had much to do with trade-unionism, but I have known about it and I believe God has taught us much through that very thing. The combination of men belongs to Shinar: "And they said, Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth", @Genesis 11:4. They left God out and wished to do things themselves; that is trade-unionism. God has taught us much about that and I believe this passage is just to show us that God will never fail us even in a military sense. He is there to protect us.
C.C.T. Would you say that at the beginning of chapter 10 there is great activity and at the close of the chapter there is rest and peace?
J.T. Jehovah is returning. It is a question of the persons now, not the principles so much as persons. "Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel".
C.C.T. He receives something now from the persons.
J.T. Just so. Aaron's function in this respect was in chapter 6 where he was directed to bless Israel: "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: saying unto them, Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee; Jehovah make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them" @Numbers 10:22 - 27.
{241}
Thus the saints are preserved in blessing.
L.E.S. So that we may be small as to our public position, but spiritually we are very great and expansive. God refers in @Exodus 20 to the thousands of them that love Him and keep His commandments.
J.T. God has the persons in mind. So much does He think of them that in the priest's breastplate their names are given in precious stones. How precious they are to God!
H.B. Is this principle of resting seen somewhat in @John 20 on the side of privilege? Jesus came to where the disciples were.
J.T. That is the same idea. He says, "Peace be to you" @John 20:19,26 twice in @John 20.
R.R.T. If we are to get the gain of this I suppose we have to come into it company-wise. The thought of "the myriads of the thousands of Israel" sets aside individuality. There is the individual setting and the merging, but still it is Israel that moves forward. It is company-wise.
J.T. And it is a very great number, for God has great numbers in His mind. He ordered that there should be three thousand converted in the first stroke of the gospel preaching showing that we can have large numbers and how quickly it can come about too. But now we have small numbers for it is a day of small things, but the Person is with us.
G.MacP. Would the great numbers suggest the Ephesian idea, every family named of the Father?
J.T. Just so, every family.
E.G.McA. Would the thought in the end of our chapter link with @Colossians 3:15, "And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts, to which also ye have been called in one body, and be thankful"? @Colossians 3:15
{242}
J.T. I would say that.
G.MacP. If divine principles are recognised in each locality, He is there however small the numbers may be.
J.T. "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", @Matthew 18:20.
Rem. Balaam viewed them from the top of the rocks in chapter 23.
J.T. He puts his thoughts into poetry, which is a very interesting thought in Scripture. The devil would not do that. The devil supported Balaam but the Lord took him out of the devil's hands for the moment and filled him with His own thoughts and he put them into poetry.
R.R.T. Is not the fact that the ark is referred to as the ark of the covenant instead of the ark of the testimony in line with what you have been saying about God never failing?
J.T. He is a covenant God. "The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit, remain among you", @Haggai 2:5.
Ques. Is this seen in the end of 2 Corinthians? "Be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you" @2 Corinthians 13:11.
J.T. I do not know how many times "the God of peace" is mentioned in the epistles, especially in Romans: "But the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly" @2 Corinthians 16:20. So that we are encouraged that God will see that Satan, if he is allowed to attack, will be bruised under our feet. The reference in Romans is to the woman's seed: in @Genesis 3 it is said that the woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's head.
{243}
WALKING (4)
@John 1:29 - 42; @John 5:5 - 15; @John 6:16 - 21
J.T. We are now about to speak, not of types, but of antitypes, that is, what answers actually to the types in the Old Testament of which we have been reading in Numbers; for Numbers is the book which brings out this matter of walking and moving. It seems as if John is particularly fitted to treat of this subject of the Lord Jesus here on earth, and he brings in John the baptist first to set out his thought in him. John the apostle would be especially affected by the testimony of John the baptist, so he speaks of the latter's testimony, saying, "And this is the witness of John", @John 1:19. That is to show us how John the baptist witnessed, and that that witness was in regard of Jesus. He came in for that purpose -- to be a witness; and so in verse 26 he further speaks of the Lord as One already there, standing: "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose", @John 1:26. He had not yet seen the Lord evidently; in fact he says, "I knew him not". And so he tells us how he became acquainted with the Lord by the Spirit coming upon Him as a dove. The word to him was: "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". And then he says, "And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God". So that it is the walk of Jesus, the movements of Christ, that are before us now. On the next day (verse 35) it speaks of the Lord as walking and John seeing Him: "And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God". These two paragraphs are I think intended to affect us as to the walk of Jesus, being in the first instance a sacrificial walk. That is, if we are to carry it out in our own lives it is a question of being
{244}
sacrificial or unselfish, moving in relation to others and for the good of others.
L.E.S. Would all these days have a bearing on the encampments as we were looking at them this morning?
J.T. That is a good suggestion. Perhaps you will enlarge on it.
L.E.S. I was wondering if they did not in some way correspond with the movements of the Lord. We get constantly the idea of the morrow, the Lord taking up a new position which calls for the attention of those who were listening.
J.T. The Lord standing would not suggest any idleness or want of occupation but would coalesce with the encampments of Israel. They were never idle, as it were; there was always something for God going on. And this word for 'standing' in verse 26 indicates that one has taken his place and stands; that is, it is for a purpose, not casual. Allusion is made to @Genesis 18 and other such passages where Jehovah stood. The brethren will remember in @Genesis 18 the visit of Jehovah with two others to Abraham. It is said, "And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men standing near him" @Genesis 18:2, and the note says, 'stationed themselves', not simply standing. Indeed this very verse is alluded to in @John 1:26; it is the same Jehovah really, but the point it not that so much as the standing for a purpose. It was not any casual matter that Jehovah and two others came to Abraham and stood there; it was for a purpose. So the Lord was in the midst of Israel for a purpose, not yet acting but standing amongst them, waiting His time, for it is a question of time in these matters; everything has its time and the Lord is there ready for action.
L.E.S. The reference to @Revelation 3 in the note is interesting too, showing the different encampments
{245}
in that section, do you not think? And then it says, "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking", @Revelation 3:20.
J.T. It is the attitude of the Lord outside the door of the believer, an active attitude, a gracious attitude, for it goes on, "If anyone hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me", @Revelation 3:20. So it is very touching that the position here in John's gospel has reference really to the whole outlook that heaven had in mind in the incarnation, because John opens that up: "And the Word became flesh" @John 1:14, that is the incarnation. It was an act of His own; He was standing, having become Man, for the evangelist John does not give us the actual birth of the Lord but the incarnation. A great deal opens up before the Lord, we may be sure, but first John is seen as witnessing to Him. In the next paragraph, commencing at verse 29, the Lord is acting or moving, and He is seen as coming to John: "On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him". And then John names the movement that he noticed, namely that it was a sacrificial movement. It was a Lamb he saw, and coming to one who would represent, as it were, the one who acted in @Exodus 12 where the little lamb in the house was slain. The time of slaying would come. John the baptist of course would not do that, but at the same time the sacrificial action was seen, that the Lord was taking on sacrifice. It is important to keep that before us because we now have in mind to make application of the truth of walking and we are learning that the Lord's walk implied sacrifice. The thought of sacrifice enters into all these meetings. Some people do not attend them, they keep to their own lives and miss a great deal because these are what may be called universal gatherings. We cannot afford to miss them and generally it involves sacrifice to attend them, but it is worth while.
{246}
R.R.T. Is there an increase of intensity in what was observed in Jesus on the part of John? Initially he says, "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know" @John 1:26, He was not recognised. But then on the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and in the next incident it is, "looking at Jesus as he walked". There would be increase in intensity of observation in regard to Him.
J.T. There was one anyway who was interested in the Lord. It is a great matter, as we are now applying the truth, if we are really interested, intensely interested in the Lord. What a movement there was in heaven in the incarnation! What a movement there was when the Lord ascended! He was received up, we are told, received up in glory. So it is that Luke says, "When the days of his receiving up were fulfilled" @Luke 9:51. Heaven would be aglow with the thought of the time of the Lord's return. As He ascended to heaven what a reception He received!
E.G.McA. Would the thought of "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know" indicate the presentation of the truth, and the next two passages bring one into the good of knowing the Person?
J.T. John, I am sure, was not behind heaven in the way of interest, and certainly he was not behind heaven in the sense of humility. There is a thought of humility connected with heaven for Jehovah is spoken of as the One "who humbleth himself to look on the heavens and on the earth", @Psalm 113:6. The Lord expresses that attitude here below.
H.B. What would be the thought of the sandal in John the baptist's mind? Is it in keeping with our subject?
J.T. I think it is. John was a wilderness man where sandals would be very needful, not shoes but sandals. Travelling is the idea, I suppose, but especially in the wilderness. John was to be in the deserts
{247}
(not one desert but deserts) until the time of his showing to Israel, and of course the idea of the wilderness involves travelling.
Ques. What connection would the standing of the Lord in @John 20 have with this? Would this be the general position and @John 20 the inside position, "in the midst"?
J.T. Quite so. It says He "came and stood" @John 20:19, whereas in Luke it does not say He came but "he himself stood in their midst" @Luke 24:36, as if He would be there where they were. He "came and stood", shows more interest and dignity.
C.C.T. Would the standing call to our minds One in authority?
J.T. What is more in mind is the attitude of taking up a position with a view to a certain purpose, just as in @Genesis 18; Jehovah came and stood there, but He stood there with a purpose. As a matter of fact He was going to Sodom and took in Abraham's position by the way, showing that it was really a friendly call, because Abraham was His friend. God came to him as His friend, but He came and stood first as if to come within Abraham's vision, and Abraham knew what to do. Jehovah knew he knew what to do and he did not fall short.
G.MacP. It is a judicial matter here: "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".
J.T. Quite so. It is a sacrificial position involving what is judicial. The judgment of God entered into it, and John really suggests that because he is the baptiser. He baptised men; he administered death, that was his mission.
T.S. The fact that the sacrificial matter is brought forward in the religious setting is important; many priests and Levites were asking questions of John. All that would be instructive because in religious
{248}
conditions there is no thought of sacrifice; in a general way it is shut out.
J.T. They were ready to make much of John religiously, sending from Jerusalem to enquire about him. They were Jerusalemites. The paragraph opens: "And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou?" @John 1:19. It was as much as to say, You are a great man and we believe you are, and we are ready to acknowledge you and give you a degree; all that you deserve we will give you.
H.A.G. "He must increase, but I must decrease", @John 3:30. What a testimony!
J.T. John is not willing for any elevation at Jerusalem at all. They would fit him into their line of things, which was to give people titles: D.D. and LL.D. -- there is a good list of them; but John was not willing for that at all.
L.E.S. Isaiah in speaking to the heart of Jerusalem says: "All flesh is grass" @Isaiah 40:6. Does that link with this section?
J.T. That was John's mission really.
R.R.T. John indicates the right line. He says, You are occupied with me, but there is One greater than me standing in your very midst and you do not know Him.
J.T. But *he* knew Him, at least he had a right judgment and that is the point; and he was qualified to deal with these priests and Levites. They were not true priests and true Levites but religious people from Jerusalem, the centre of religion, ready to honour people on their own line, but John was not an applicant for that at all. He was not eligible for it, nor did he wish to be. So they say, "Thou, who art thou?". That would stress the thing, that he was a great person in their minds. They felt themselves to be the people who were able to designate
{249}
great persons. But "he acknowledged and denied not", meaning that he was not taking on their suggestion of being a great person at an. He "acknowledged, I am not the Christ", @John 1:20. It was a sacrifice for the flesh; here was an opportunity to be a great man in the world, a great religious personage in the world, but John says, I am not going in for that at all. So it says further: "And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not", @John 1:21. Elias was a great person, though if he had been alive then in Jerusalem he would not have been for he would have been the same as John in their minds. And then, "Art thou the prophet?". That would mean 'the Messiah'; the prophet is the promise in Deuteronomy. "And he answered, No. They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness" @John 1:21 - 23; you win find a record of me in the Old Testament if you search. He was a wilderness man, and what he called himself agreed with that. Then he added, "Make straight the path of the Lord". The word 'Lord' here has no article; the translator says, "'Lord' has no article here, which is irregular in Greek, but I do not doubt it is in place of the name 'Jehovah', as in other Gospels". It is the same Person that was before Abraham's tent door, so to speak, standing, waiting for some purpose. So John says, "Make straight the path of the Lord, as said Esaias the prophet. And they were sent from among the Pharisees. And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet? John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose", @John 1:23 - 27. That is his witness. The idea of witness
{250}
is prominent with John the evangelist, and so that should be before us in what we are talking about.
F.R.A. In chapter 3 John disappears in the greatness of Christ, when he says, "He must increase, but I must decrease", @John 3:30.
E.G.McA. Why does John leave out the baptising with the Holy Spirit and fire which is found in Luke?
J.T. "I baptise with water", @John 1:26 he says. He is minimising what he is doing; water is just a figure.
E.G.McA. Is he emphasising the Person rather than His work?
J.T. I would say that: "I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose", @John 1:26 - 27.
R.R.T. What is involved in those words you just read: "He who comes after me"?
J.T. That means John was coming in historically before the Lord; but then he says, "He *was* before me".
R.R.T. In verse 30 he reiterates and enlarges on it.
J.T. It would mean that he discerned a divine Person. Here was Jehovah of the Old Testament; that is the truth.
A.B. It would be something like what was said in regard of Joseph: "They cried before him, Bow the knee!", @Genesis 41:43.
J.T. Quite so. Zaphnath-paaneah means 'Sustainer of the life of the world'. Well, that was Jesus.
Ques. Was it time to call attention to Christ in view of those following? In the second incident two disciples followed Jesus. Is it time for that now?
J.T. That is what we have come to. The Lord returns to that thought in @John 8:12. He says, "I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life", @John 8:12. The followers come into life. The light of life
{251}
is a great thought with John; thus it is said of the Lord in @John 1:4, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men", @John 1:4. The follower gets that light, the light of life.
C.J. What was there that John observed in the Lord's walk that caused him to refer to Him as the Lamb?
J.T. That raises the question of naming, and how we are to name things and persons. We should learn to do that. God gave ability to Adam to name the creatures, not the things but the creatures, whereas Solomon named creatures and things. Now John here has the ability to put a name on the Lord Jesus as he sees Him coming to him. "On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world". That is, this is the Person that he is naming, and he is naming Him "the Lamb".
G.MacP. Is that in relation to the lamb in the household in @Exodus 12?
J.T. Quite so; only this is not a diminutive thought, it is a great thought. It is not simply the sufferer, but the great thought of sacrifice.
F.R.A. Is this the answer to Isaac's question, "Where is the sheep", @Genesis 22:7?
J.T. Quite so; The Lamb is here, and in the type presently the Lamb came into view, caught in a thicket; but it was a ram.
C.C.T. Did John perceive that it was a Man come down? We are able to name things because we are in touch with heaven.
J.T. God gives us things. How are we to be assembly men unless we are conversant with heaven and heavenly things? -- not only heaven and Persons in heaven but things in heaven. So things are to be named and understood.
J.McK. What is involved in the position of which John the evangelist speaks? "These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising", @John 1:28.
{252}
He indicates that the Lord came to John in that position. Was John still there?
J.T. That was the position. It is characteristic of John's position that he was the baptiser. Scripture calls him John the baptist; it was his commission. But this is not the Bethany referred to later in the gospel; it is beyond the Jordan, showing that it was a distance from Jerusalem.
J.McK. Would it suggest a place of exercise rather than rest?
J.T. Just so.
R.R.T. Does John's word to the Lord here cover quite a range when he calls attention to Him as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world"? He goes on to say, "A man comes after me", involving His incarnation and, "Who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me", involving His deity.
J.T. He is a man full of great thoughts. He is a wilderness man, dwelling in the deserts, where all that appeals to the flesh is broken down. The wilderness tends to break down the flesh, although it did not with Israel for the flesh remained in them and they lusted, but with John it was broken down.
F.T. Would you say John looked at things from God's side, the Lamb of God moving to take away the sin of the world in its entirety, so that there might be a world pleasurable to God?
J.T. Just so. John brings God in. He brings God into the world, whereas Paul brings the saints into heaven. John keeps us down here with God, but Paul normally brings us up to where God is.
T.S. Do we have to be real men to be able to speak as John does?
J.T. God saw to it that he was kept in the deserts, where the flesh would be broken down in him so that he should be a vessel for God. He was girt with a
{253}
leathern girdle and camel's hair was his garment. He was fitted for the desert where there is nothing to minister to the flesh. That is the idea God is bringing before us.
F.R.A. Is it at this point the Lord enters the sheepfold?
J.T. Quite so.
F.R.A. He identifies Himself with the remnant.
J.T. Just so, that is the next thing. It is a question of the followers. John is not presented as a follower at all; he is a testimony by himself and the Lord recognises him. In the other gospels the Lord waits until John is cast into prison before He moves out in service; when He is presented as Man John is first; the Lord acted that way. But John the evangelist presents Him as exercising His own service before John the baptist is cast into prison, which is just in keeping with his line, for John cannot get to the Person quickly enough. He must get to the Person as soon as possible, like the writer of the Chronicles who, you will observe, reaches David in chapter 3. He is in a hurry, as it were, to get to David.
C.C.T. Would you say that the voice of John is the opening of the door for the followers to come in?
J.T. That is the way it is put here. The paragraph from verse 29 is John's meeting with Jesus and naming Him; he knows Him by His walk, so to speak, His manner, His gait. The idea is seen in Adam naming the creatures, but Adam was not called upon to name Jehovah; *He* was not a creature nor in a creature's place on the earth, He was altogether apart. But the Lord Jesus came down and was a Man among men. The question then is, Did John know Him? He did. Others did not know Him, but john did. He says, "And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God".
{254}
He had indications by which he was to know the Person.
H.B. Is it in a way like Abraham? He speaks to a certain One of the three and calls Him Jehovah.
J.T. That is right. All the men of faith after Adam knew how to name things, especially Noah. He is the first one who discerned unclean creatures.
G.MacP. Is that what Paul had in mind when he said in @1 Timothy 3:16, "God has been manifested in flesh"? @1 Timothy 3:16.
J.T. Yes, and "justified in the Spirit", meaning that the Spirit justified all He did, made it plain to us. It is a question of the Holy Spirit showing what the manifestation meant, and so here.
F.T. John is really introduced to the person here in a sense. Is that necessary for us in a way on account of the greatness of the Person? He says, "And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God". He was no doubt familiar with the Lord as being His relative.
J.T. We cannot be sure. It says here, "And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". He may have known the Lord Jesus but God did not leave it that way, He furnished John with knowledge. So I think we have to go by what God did, furnishing John with the knowledge he needed. He became acquainted with the Lord because God made him acquainted.
L.E.S. In spiritual matters we should know by way of spiritual observation, not natural, should we not?
J.T. That is what is suggested here. John is not governed by Jerusalem. We are not governed by geographical things or historical things but by spiritual
{255}
things; we are to learn to know things by spiritual means, as Paul says in @1 Corinthians 2:13, "communicating spiritual things by spiritual means", @1 Corinthians 2:13.
L.E.S. This matter of naming things in the locality ought to be a concern to us; there should be some correspondence to the idea of the spirit of sacrifice worked out locally.
J.T. The brethren should all have the spirit of sacrifice, and that includes entertaining. The writer of the Hebrews points out that we are to be marked by entertaining.
L.E.S. Is it something like the Lord in Luke saying to Simon, "Seest thou this woman?", @Luke 7:44. There was something to be observed in that woman, and would not the Lord in that way draw attention to what is in each locality? If the Lord is seeking to add to a locality He would point out what is there substantially, something spiritual.
J.T. To make the thing very concrete, suppose there is someone in the locality who is to be gifted, something will happen to call the attention of the brethren to him. God will do that. It may be providentially, but it will happen, and then it is for the saints to tax their spiritual power to see that it is so. Is the brother really furnished to be a minister, a representative of God? The brethren will be on the look-out for him, and I am sure they will find the thing that God has put there.
R.R.T. You mean we should be on the look-out for such a one in the way the Spirit is pleased to identify Himself with him? We have the greatness of the Lord in mind here, but applying it to a brother we would look for the evidence of the Spirit identifying Himself with him.
J.T. Just so. All who are in a locality who have these marks will be discerned. The brethren ought to be on the look-out for them.
{256}
Ques. Does a man's gift make room for him?
J.T. I think so.
E.G.McA. Is there the element of sacrifice in entertaining?
J.T. I think it goes with it when a man opens his house. The Lord opened Lydia's heart and she opened her house to the brethren.
G.MacP. Is it the same thought as in @Hebrews 13:1: "Let brotherly love abide. Be not forgetful of hospitality; for by it some have unawares entertained angels"? @Hebrews 13:1.
J.T. Just so. That is the verse I was thinking of.
C.C.T. Would you say a little more as to the opening of our houses?
J.T. It costs money to buy food and to house the saints, but what are we if we are not equal to that? We cannot expect to build up an assembly without that. It is seen frequently in the Scriptures as a mark of those who were really with God. Abraham was God's friend, and he was visited by the angels.
J.McK. Is the thought of manhood stressed here? John says, "A man comes after me". It had been said of John, "There was a man sent from God, his name John", @John 1:6 but then in regard of the Lord it says, "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him", marking out the manhood of the Lord Jesus as distinctive in that way.
J.T. He is distinct as the Son of God, not yet alluded to as the Son of man here.
J.McK. John speaks of Him as a Man.
J.T. Identifying Him with what is always carried forward in John, His deity. "A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me": that is Deity. I only refer to that because John would build us up in the idea of the deity of Christ to make us worshippers.
L.E.S. Referring again to the sacrificial thought, it would enter into all our commitments, for example
{257}
the matter of meetings and being ready to avail ourselves of any opportunity to be together.
J.T. Yes; it may be a wet night: put on a heavier coat, but anyway sacrifice to get to the meeting! One is not trying to accuse the brethren, far otherwise, but it is shameful that we are so afraid of a little drop of rain or flake of snow in getting to the meeting, because it is a question of Zion. The Old Testament saints were joyful as they entered Zion; it was a great matter with them. It is a question of overcoming, whatever the difficulties.
Ques. In @Luke 11 the man in bed with his children bears on this thought of entertaining, and the end of the passage runs on to the giving of the Holy Spirit to them that ask for Him. Is the giving of the Spirit just historical, or has it a moral thought that we might be able to have something for one who has come on a journey, as Abraham had for the visitors?
J.T. You mean we must have the Spirit or there will be nothing for the visitor? Just so.
To return to @John 1, the second day mentioned brings out the walk of Jesus. The previous incident spoke of His coming to John, but He is not coming to John now; John is standing. The idea of standing is now passed on to John. The time of tarrying is over for Jesus and now He is walking and John admires the Lord walking. "And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God". And then we are told that "the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus". That is, John's speaking must have greatly accentuated the idea of the walk of Jesus. The persons who heard him say, "Behold the Lamb of God", followed after Him; they were affected. John is a model for us at this point, for we are to be affected by what is being presented to us, what ministry brings to us by the Spirit as to the attractiveness and glory of Jesus.
{258}
H.B. Would this be a rebuke to dumbness in the morning meeting?
J.T. You do not mean sisters, of course, because they are not supposed to speak, but the question is whether they are moved in their inward affections by what is presented to them. The brothers can give expression to their feelings in words, and if they do not you might say they are dumb priests.
C.C.T. John sees as Man here the One who was in the form of God, but looking on Him as Jesus there is a following taking place.
J.T. Just so. One of the followers is John the evangelist himself. "The two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus. But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye?". This is a challenge. What is in your mind? What is affecting you? I believe this is all to bring out how we are being affected by the ministry of the Spirit of God.
F.R.A. So those coming in from the outside would be attracted to the brethren first, as to John the baptist and those with him, but as the brethren are convened and the Lord comes into view then they would be attracted to the Lord personally.
J.T. I think what you are saying would have confirmation in @Revelation 1 where the same John says, "I heard behind me a great voice". Then he says further, "I turned back to see the voice" @Revelation 1:12, not to hear it but to see it, meaning that he thought it was a Person, which of course it was. But what he saw first was the seven golden lamps, that is, he saw the saints first, but then the Lord Jesus was seen there in the midst of them, If I want to see Jesus I must be where the saints are because that is where He comes.
C.C.T. Mary had to turn to see the Person in @John 20.
{259}
J.T. He called her "Mary"; "and he calls his own sheep by name ... and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice", @John 10:3,4.
C.C.T. I was thinking He takes her off the thought of His death and connects her with His own Person. We may be taken up with His death and not with His Person.
J.T. And do not forget the brethren because He is to be found there. He came where the disciples were. Normally that is where He is to be found.
Rem. Does this find enlargement in @2 Corinthians 3 where we get the surpassing glory of the ministry of the new covenant? It finishes up with the words, "But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit" @2 Corinthians 3:18. It is "*we* all".
J.T. Quite so. It is a collective shining out; just as in speaking of the cup the Lord says, "Drink ye all of it", @Matthew 26:27. It is not an individual matter. I do not know how christians get on without partaking of the Lord's supper. Christianity is sustained by eating and drinking.
A.D. Does John give us a sense of this in his first epistle? He says, "That which we have seen and heard we report to you, that *ye* also may have fellowship with us", @1 John 1:3. Is the matter of fellowship linked with walking?
J.T. You are stressing the idea of the 'us'. Do you mean that the saints should have fellowship with the apostles? Quite so. There is another point in the same chapter: "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth. But if we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship with one another", @1 John 1:5 - 7 not simply with the apostles but with one another, "and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin".
{260}
That is, the blood keeps us right in relation to one another. The cleansing is there to keep us right.
J.McK. The way in which they address the Lord as Teacher would indicate the inclination of their mind and heart to learn more of the Lord in that way.
J.T. That is good. It is a teaching time; we need teaching, every one of us, and especially those brought up in man's organisations, human organisations. You will never get church truth in human organisations; hence the necessity of teaching. That is why John comes in at the last. The Lord says of him, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?" @John 21:22. I believe the Lord had him in reserve all the time for what is needed now; what is needed is teaching. They called Him 'Teacher' here: "And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher)".
J.McK. That is very helpful. If I come to the Lord in that spirit there is a further invitation from the Lord: "Come and see".
R.R.T. It speaks in another place of those who followed Him for the loaves and fishes. It is a very much deeper reason here -- "where abidest thou?".
J.T. Undoubtedly these two were allowed to visit; it is as if they qualified for it. I believe they belonged to the apostolic set. It is a new order of things that is in mind, so Peter comes into view in this section. It is said that one of them was Andrew and the other's name is not given. "Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard this from John and followed him. He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ). And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone)".
{261}
Now we come to the last Adam, the new order of humanity really. The Lord is putting a name on it, not on the cattle but on the persons, for it is a time of naming the persons and every one of us comes into that, for each has his name.
T.S. In John speaking and the two disciples following is it like the setting forward of the camp; and then would the encampment be where they abode that day?
J.T. Just so; it is a sort of mature order which is soon to take form in the assembly at Pentecost.
T.S. Is it like a levitical touch that John the baptist gives?
J.T. I am sure that is right.
F.R.A. What is the difference between the position here and in Luke where He is said to have nowhere to lay His head? Here they saw where He dwelt.
J.T. Well, we have already spoken of Capernaum being His dwelling place, according to Matthew. The Lord had some place there. He had a home; where it was we are not told but there must have been something of the kind, and they stayed there a certain number of hours. It was to bring out that He had a dwelling place. In Matthew the word 'house' is used; the Lord waited to be in the house to take up the matter of sonship with Peter for that belongs to the house. So here the dwelling place of the Lord is where teaching is to be found, because they call Him Teacher; the teaching is in the assembly really.
C.C.T. As we sit here under this ministry, the Lord would ask each of our hearts, "What seek ye?". We would find the place of abode.
J.T. "They went therefore, and saw where he abode". Well, He dwells in the assembly now though corporeally He dwells in heaven, as @Acts 3 says: "Whom heaven indeed must receive till the times of the restoring of all things" @Acts 3:21.
{262}
But He is known here by the Spirit in the assembly now.
G.MacP. John says the Spirit of God abode upon Him. He is the only evangelist who says that. On that line the thought of abiding and the thought of teaching would bring out the kind of material of which the assembly is composed.
E.G.McA. "He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode". That would really mean that the effect of where He abode would be seen in their walk, and would teach them to walk in the same way.
J.T. That they should follow in His steps.
E.G.McA. Peter makes much of what John should do: "Lord, and what of this man?" @John 21:21 -- but the Lord's answer to Peter is, "Follow thou me", @John 21:22. That would be occupation with the Person, would it not?
J.T. We are likely to make too much of the brethren, and if we do they will fail us. The Lord is looking out for us and He will give us our work.
L.E.S. Do we get the thought in `127:1?
<blockquote>"Lord, we do not ask the question, <br>Where abidest Thou? <br>Well we know where Thou art dwelling, <br>Well we know it now". </blockquote>
J.T. Well, that is the use of language in the hymn, indicating that we profess to know where He dwells; it is in the Father's bosom. We have to look into that. Is it so?
H.A.G. Do you think we have in this portion of Scripture what we find in @Joshua 5:13 - 15? "And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him: Art thou for us, or for our enemies? And he said, No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come. Then Joshua fell upon his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What saith my lord unto his servant? And the captain of Jehovah's army said to Joshua, Loose thy sandal from off thy foot: for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so", @Joshua 5:13 - 15.
{263}
He was in the presence of the Man who stood.
J.T. Do you mean that John's gospel is 'God with us'? Matthew is that too but it is more emphasised in John; the Deity is there.
H.B. We see how the Spirit helps in matters of interpretation in this section.
J.T. That is another thing, the need for interpreters. I suppose in these last days we who cannot read Greek depend upon translators. We cannot read the original in which the Spirit of God wrote, we are dependent upon the translators and the translations. Thank God for the one in our hands here because it is a very accurate one. We can safely use it publicly in a Bible reading like this. If we did not have it we should have to use the Authorised Version which would be very uncertain, and we should be making mistakes very often. For instance, we should call a man 'Rabbi', we should make much of a clergyman, whereas such are not deserving of anything at all. It is not a man with a reputation for earthly education, a degree, that counts, but what the man is. Jesus was "the Teacher", that is what He was -- a Teacher come from God. That is what Nicodemus said: "We know that thou art come a teacher from God", @John 3:2. These men discerned that and called Him "Teacher". We have to learn from this good translation, although the Authorised Version helps us a little, but not very much.
E.G.McA. Would you say that in John He teaches by His walk as well as by His words?
{264}
J.T. I would say that. It has already been noted how Ephraim was taught to walk by Jehovah. This gospel teaches us to walk by the walk of Jesus Himself.
E.G.McA. "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world". You said, I believe, that that was not a diminutive thought of the Lamb but a great thought; then you spoke of the incarnation. Did you mean that it called for the incarnation to set forth the walk that was so pleasing to God?
J.T. Just so. It was seen in this kind of Man. Some people say the Lord got His humanity from His mother but that is an entire mistake; He got it from God; God was His Father.
E.G.McA. That gives a great impression of the incarnation.
J.T. Yes, it does. That Person intended to use John for this purpose because Jesus loved him, as we are told. He was one to be relied upon and was able to write this wonderful gospel. It does not say that Jesus loved Matthew or any of the others, although no doubt that was true, but Jesus loved John.
Ques. Is there any suggestion in the interpretation of the disciple's name here?
J.T. Do you mean Cephas? It is to show that a structure is in mind. Of course there was a structure in Israel, too, but it was only a type, whereas the structure in the counsels of God that we are speaking of now includes all the saints. It is not a stone building as in Israel, nor a building made by human hands, but "whose house are *we*", @Hebrews 3:6. The saints form it. I would be ashamed of myself if I could not say I belong to the assembly. Cephas was a stone, meaning a part of, or an element in, or a person that could be used in the assembly.
G.MacP. Is this what the apostle Peter has in mind when he speaks of the living stones, a spiritual house?
{265}
J.T. Just so; but as noted, what is said of the matter in Matthew is a question of the *material* for the building whereas this is the *person himself*, meaning that the assembly is formed of persons. It is not exactly the idea of material but of persons.
Rem. You were saying yesterday that Moses and Aaron were men of influence. Would you say the holy influence of this Man is seen in a special way in John?
J.T. You mean the Lord. Quite so. His influence pervades the universe. As it says, "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things; and *he* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints", @Ephesians 4:10,11. He has sent the teachers, apostles and prophets down from beyond the heavens.
F.R.A. At the end of the gospel His garment is divided into four parts. The idea of four means that it involves the whole moral universe.
J.T. The Roman Catholics claim to have everything, the garments which Christ wore here on earth including the vest which was woven throughout in one piece without a seam. The soldiers parted them among them. I think the allusion would be to the fact that the Roman Catholics claim everything: they claim Christ, they claim the Bible, they claim to be the assembly too, and that they only are the assembly; but it is all false. The assembly is a spiritual matter.
R.R.T. Would it indicate here that when we come to Paul he is leading on to something that is to be a fixed matter in our souls? Their attention here is called to the Lord; there is the following and abiding with Him, and then this one becomes a stone, -- the matter becomes fixed and abiding.
{266}
J.T. Quite so. You can see in the idea of the Lord's standing that He has all this in His mind; He is ready for work. When the time comes here is a man whom He names, meaning that He has in mind the thought of assembly formation -- those who form the assembly.
F.T. That would be a spiritual name. Do we not see the thing evolving? Later it says, "Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal", @John 6:68.
J.T. Just so. Cephas is the same word as Peter, of course, only in another language. It suggests that the structure is in mind.
E.G.McA. Is it going ahead in your subject to ask what you had in mind in chapter 5?
J.T. I think we will have to leave that. It seems we should have another reading in John on this subject. We shall find it pursued in @John 5 because there the man who is raised up not only walks but is able to carry his bed. He is a man who is able to do things and carry things in walking. And then the Lord Himself is seen walking on the water, that is another thing. And then in the last chapter we have something further about walking.
{267}
WALKING (5)
@John 5:5 - 15; @John 6:16 - 31; @John 12:35,36
J.T. This fifth chapter records one of the signs in John's gospel and it is read because it makes so much of walking. The Lord said to the man, "Arise, take up thy couch and walk. And immediately the man became well, and took up his couch and walked". It was walking with a load, but it brought out the character of the power that was used, especially as the man had been there so long and had had such an experience of disappointment; for he said, "Sir, I have not a man, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool; but while I am coming another descends before me" (verse 7). The man had a remarkable experience in that way, and no doubt the Lord will help us to apply the incident, for there are many such now in a spiritual sense. The passage would indicate that the entrances, the five porches, imply various circumstances whence men have come to be healed. No doubt there is an allusion to the current conditions of christendom in these last days and the evidence of the applied resources of mercy. It was a house of mercy, or supposed to be that, as the word Bethesda indicates. But it comes very short, in the idea of mercy, of God's merciful services to men, what there is for men now. The Lord coming in and speaking and acting would indicate what is available even now in a spiritual way for the relief of men in those circumstances, whatever they may be connected with.
F.T. Is there something significant in the thought of 'the Man'? John speaks of the Man that comes after him and was preferred before him. This man at the pool says he has not a man. The Man is needed, is He not?
J.T. Quite so. There were men there but they were all cripples, no doubt. The angel was there too,
{268}
but very sparingly. He came down according to what is recorded: "For an angel descended at a certain season in the pool and troubled the water. Whoever therefore first went in after the troubling of the water became well, whatever disease he laboured under" @John 5:4. There was a suggestion of divine mercy, and divine intervention, but in a very limited way.
F.T. Would that suggest that in spite of the confusion that exists in christendom things are still within divine control? God operates sovereignly, as seen in the angel coming down.
J.T. Oh yes, there is something of that kind in christendom, even in eastern Europe, and now perhaps we shall see it in a little way in Russia; but certainly in the body of christendom this sort of thing exists. But I hardly think it exists in heathendom or judaism or mohammedanism. God is nevertheless very favourable and is acting in a certain area.
R.R.T. Would it represent what the religious system in the hands of man had come to? It is distinctly mentioned that "there is in Jerusalem, at the sheepgate, a pool" @John 5:2. The gate is connected with Jerusalem.
J.T. Quite so. John would imply that he knew about it; he had first-hand knowledge and was a true witness of the conditions. It is well, I suppose, if we are at all occupied in service, that we should know of conditions as they are and where they are, so as to be intelligent in what we are doing.
R.R.T. I was wondering whether the sheepgate would link with what we were speaking of as to the Lamb of God? It was the proper place, in that sense, for the Lord to appear in His mercy.
J.T. It was, according to what He said of Himself in chapter 10. You would expect to find a sheep there and in truth there was one.
{269}
Ques. Why does the Lord single this man out and ask him a question?
J.T. Well, it is His way. It is one of the instances in which we may learn levitical ways. We were touching on that as to those who are in the position of levites, that we should be acquainted with the state of christendom geographically and climatically and in other conditions, observing whether God has been accustomed to act for man in certain sections, whether there have been any of these movements and whether there are any places on the earth that are particularly favoured. We ought to know all these things if we are at all in the service of God, and ought to put ourselves in touch with universal conditions where the Spirit of God has any scope at all, because if we have assembly ears we shall hear about things that happen even if we are not there. We do not want to miss them. The Lord was governed by His own principles, of course, but it was right that He should enquire about this man although He knew; for we are told, "Jesus seeing this man lying there, and knowing that he was in that state now a great length of time" (verse 6). These are things to be noted if we are at all in the service.
Rem. I thought this case was very encouraging for the present time in that God is not moving in mass conversions but here and there He is signalising those whom He would have and asking them the question, What are you doing about it?
J.T. Some of us who are in the service have more opportunity than others who do not move about, and therefore we do know conditions as they are; what conditions prevail in South America or Australia or New Zealand or this country or Europe. It is a great advantage if we are in the service. It may be of interest to others, but it is more than that to the servant because these are the conditions in which he has to work if there are to be results.
{270}
L.E.S. I was thinking of the conditions in Nehemiah's day. There is a link with Nehemiah in the condition here in regard to the sheepgate. Eliashib the high priest built it, and evidently Nehemiah had ears to take into account what was happening although in circumstances of captivity.
J.T. You remember how Nehemiah arrived at Jerusalem and went out by night and certain persons with him to view the conditions of Jerusalem, and that led of course to viewing the wall and the gates. So that undoubtedly the names applied to the gates in Nehemiah's day were intended to come down to the Lord's day; these gates were not set up in the Lord's day; they had been set up long before. The sheepgate was an important gate, and the Lord made reference to the sheep.
E.G.McA. Was it not the only gate in the wall in Nehemiah's day that had no lock on it?
J.T. Some make a great deal of the fact that there were not any locks or bars on it. The question is whether if there were locks and bars they might not be shut against the sheep; there is just that possibility. But Eliashib did not turn out too well, although he was the high priest. These are things we have to notice because we are in the last days and things need a lot of repair. We need to become conversant with facts.
L.E.S. It shows how the Lord is able to fill out every position, does it not? He takes up the position that is set out in Nehemiah and fills it out.
J.T. Quite so.
E.G.McA. Would you say that the sheepgate was made available for this man so that he might enter into the flock in chapter 10, though he did not walk that way?
J.T. That is another thing to note. He did not turn out too well, so that the Lord said prophetically as to him when He found him afterward in the
{271}
temple, "Behold, thou art become well: sin no more, that something worse do not happen to thee" (verse 14). He did not turn out too well, he was not reliable like the man in @John 9. This man is to illustrate how certain persons today are available where mercy is supposed to be, right near to the work where the help is, and they get help, for the man was helped. The point in the Lord's mind was illustrated in that the Lord said, "Arise, take up thy couch and walk", and the man did it; he not only took up the couch, but he walked. He did what the Lord said. But what did he do afterwards? We see what time brings out, for time has a great deal to do with the work of God; it has a great effect, aside from any other influences. What time brought out in this man was that he was not reliable; he brought the Lord into trouble.
H.B. He went away to the Jews. He was still walking, but in another direction.
J.T. Yes, it says he went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus. He did not stay where the Lord was; he did not become a disciple at all, because a disciple should follow. He did not do that, and he got the Lord into trouble. Distance from the Lord makes us trouble-makers.
L.E.S. Would there be a link here too with @John 8 in regard to the woman? The Lord says the same words to her, "Go, and sin no more" Then He says, "I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life", @John 8:11,12.
J.T. So He did not have confidence in her either. We cannot tell just what the sequel was in her case, but evidently the Lord did not have confidence in her, whereas He kept His eye on the man in @John 9 and when He found him He put the question to him to bring out where he was: "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?" @John 9:35.
{272}
F.T. This man went into the wrong place; he went back into the temple.
J.T. Quite so; he should not have expected to find the Lord there. But did he want to find Him? It does not seem so.
R.R.T. Would this man represent the lack of the very thing we began with in this series of meetings? He had from the Lord now the power to walk but he had not learned how to walk; he had not come into the teaching of it. Like Ephraim, he needed to be taught how to walk.
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Do you think the matter of definiteness enters into it, so that if we have been helped with regard to moving out of our position we should be clear of all?
J.T. Just so. I believe that is the lesson to learn from this incident. It is a sign, and the Lord builds truth on it. He had performed this sign but the subject of it did not gain by it; he failed the Lord in that sense, and many are like that today. We get the blessing that is available but we do not go any further; and we become trouble-makers as surely as possible if we get away. The man went away and became a trouble-maker. He brought the Lord into trouble.
F.R.A. Do we get an illustration here of the Lord following up the initial work? We very often do not follow up the work in souls in that way.
J.T. The Lord followed the man up, even going into the temple, because it was an important sign as others were. The incident of the man in @Acts 3 for example, was an important sign bearing on the dispensation at the moment. And so this case was the same, but the man failed the Lord and brought persecution on Him, which is a very sorrowful thing, that the Lord may benefit us and yet we bring trouble on Him.
{273}
L.E.S. The point seems to be that there was no spiritual reaction in the man's soul to the Lord's touch. He did not even know it was Jesus.
J.T. Just so. You would think he would have known. Think of the Man that did so much for him! The facts are mentioned to show how much he was indebted to the Lord, and yet he failed Him.
A.D. Would you say a little more as to what you have in mind as to the character of the power here?
J.T. It is power connected with His word. The facts are that the man said, "Sir, I have not a man, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool; but while I am coming another descends before me. Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch and walk". It is a matter of the Lord saying the word. It is not any act of His hand, but His word, and that is the point with us today. There is much made of physical things in the service, but the point is the word, the power of the word of Christ and what it can do.
Ques. It says, "After these things Jesus finds him in the temple". Would that imply He was seeking him?
J.T. It shows that the Lord followed up His work. When he heard the man was cast out in @John 9 He found him and said, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?", @John 9:35 showing He was watching over the subject of His work. But then we might get out of hand. After being benefited by the Lord we get out of hand and become trouble-makers. It is pretty nearly certain we shall become trouble-makers if we get out of hand. It is like the staff of Moses; when it got out of his hand it became a serpent.
E.G.McA. Would you say that this man availed himself of the power now given him and walked in the wrong way? He took up a right position without any reality. If he had been in the temple he should have had the reality of the thing.
{274}
J.T. The Lord said, as we have already read, "Arise, take up thy couch and walk". It does not say He told him to go to his house. I suppose the Lord did with him according to what He knew of him sovereignly. But the power was there nevertheless, and the word of Christ retains its power, and it is good for me. If this man missed it, *I*  do not want to miss it. We want to get the good of what the Lord says.
F.R.A. What is the application of the man carrying his couch? It is an unusual thing for a man to carry his couch.
J.T. I think the point would be that there is a burden. Peter says to Aeneas in @Acts 9, "Rise up, and make thy couch for thyself" @Acts 9:34. It is one thing to make your own bed on which you lie, but it is another to show that you can carry it, meaning that you can carry your circumstances. The thing that carried you, you now carry. That is the idea here: the Lord has set the man up in superiority to his circumstances, but he fails Him nevertheless. The Lord says to the man in @Mark 2, "Child, thy sins are forgiven thee" @Mark 2:5. And then He tells him to take up his couch and go to his house. There is more in that; it is more interesting to see what happened in the house. This man's house is not in mind. There is very little made about the house now, but it is important that the gospel that we preach should bring in the house; not only that the person is saved, but the person's house or family. The Lord is stressing that now: "Thou and thy house", @Acts 16:31.
T.S. Do you think that this man never came into the land? I was thinking that he was just thirty-eight years in this state, and the thirty-eight years would be like the duration of the journey of the children of Israel in the wilderness.
J.T. They were in wilderness circumstances and these circumstances would be the same. Being an
{275}
invalid in these conditions for thirty-eight years would bring about a certain formation in the man that was not good. He was not a house man, he was not a family man, and the house and family must be kept in mind because God operates in that connection.
F.T. Is the idea of stagnation seen here? The thought of the pool and the man lying there would suggest stagnation.
J.T. Quite so. There is a great deal of stagnation spiritually around.
R.R.T. I was wondering whether this would raise a question with us as to why we tell things, what the object is; and a question as to the ones to whom we tell them. This man went away and told the Jews. It was evidently not a right testimony in regard to Christ. Would it raise that exercise with us?
J.T. Yes. There are certain incidents where the Lord enjoins that things are not to be told. The two blind men in @Matthew 9 were enjoined by the Lord not to publish their cure. It would seem as if the witness must be real, so as to impart reality to the persons who hear, and this man was not that.
R.R.T. So that the result is, as you said previously, that he really brought the Lord into difficulty. We bring the Lord and the brethren into difficulty if things are not right with us.
H.B. I was wondering if it would be something like Doeg who went and told Saul about David.
J.T. Quite so. The next walking we read about indicates that the Lord is above circumstances. He is above the agitation of the waters, meaning that this miracle and its result did not disconcert the Lord. The truth goes on; the testimony goes on. In chapter 6 it says, "And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them, and the sea was agitated by a strong wind blowing. Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship; and they were frightened. But he says to them, It is I: be not afraid" (verses 17 - 20).
{276}
I think this next miracle or sign shows among other things that the Lord is not really deterred or affected by results. There was trouble, but the Lord was above that and He would teach us to be above it and not to be disconcerted by what might be disappointments, because there are such.
L.E.S. Would this link up with @Luke 13 where it says, "The same hour certain Pharisees came up, saying to him, Get out, and go hence, for Herod is desirous to kill thee. And he said to them, Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and accomplish cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am perfected; but I must needs walk today and tomorrow and the day following" @Luke 13:31 - 33.
J.T. Very good. There were foxes in the Lord's path as there would be in ours, but the Lord sends a message. He does not go near him; He never says anything to Herod, but He goes on. He says, "I cast out demons and accomplish cures today and to-morrow, and the third day I am perfected; but I must needs walk today and to-morrow and the day following, for it must not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem", @Luke 13:32,33. I think that illustrates what we have here. The Lord is not deterred by the troubled sea. Note that it is not simply water but the sea. The sea is a wide area, and it was troubled, yet the Lord was walking on it. There is a certain elasticity in the measurement of the distance, "about twenty-five or thirty stadia", but the Lord goes on and comes in, as it were, on the situation in which the saints are. The Lord was in it Himself in chapter 5, and they were not with Him, but here they are in the trouble, on the sea; the sea is troubled: "whose waters cast up mire and dirt", @Isaiah 57:20. The Lord comes into all that and is seen walking above the
{277}
circumstances. It fits with the allusion to Herod who would try to deter the Lord as He was carrying on His work. Herod was a politician. We are often troubled by politicians; certainly the draftees are affected by politicians, as they are now in Canada, very much. Herod would make trouble, and foxes are worse than politicians; it is very difficult to follow up a fox because he doubles back on you. But the Lord goes on, that is the thing to see. The huntsmen know the traits of the fox and how to catch him in spite of his doubling back. The Lord knew how to deal with the fox.
L.E.S. Would that help our young brothers to pursue the course in spite of the difficulties that confront them?
J.T. That is the thing that has been in the exercises of some in this Canadian trouble. It is a real trouble and the brethren have allowed themselves to be troubled by it; the brethren have not been of one mind, they have not taken a straight course. It is a question of a good conscience before God. Watch that! Keep a good conscience.
E.G.McA. This expression, "It is I", would indicate the kind of Man referred to in @Luke 13 who was not turned aside by any threat. He said, "It is I"; He did not have to mention His Name. They knew that kind of Man. He was the kind of Man to look to in this case.
J.T. We can rely on Him; He inspires confidence. If we can only get the Lord into all these matters it will settle us and we can take a straight course.
L.E.S. Would "today and to-morrow and the third day" @Luke 13:33 involve different encampments in relation to what might be transpiring? We must not think that we have the whole matter every day, but we must be alert as to every day.
J.T. Just so. So that in each sign in John the course is pursued; they are not isolated items. The
{278}
signs in John stand in relation to one another, and the Lord pursues a straight course in relation to them: He knew what He was going to do, that is the point, He knows what He is going to do; he is not going to allow the foxes or the storms to hinder the work going on, so that He walks; He walks in any circumstances. He does not teach the disciples to walk in this gospel; Matthew does that. Matthew contemplates the early days of christianity in which we have the assembly. Christianity is built up on the principles of the assembly; it is not only that the things are done, but how they are done; and the book of Acts carries on the thought, showing how the things are done and who will do them. So that is the beginning of christianity. But John in contemplating things omits the teaching of walking on the water, and omits how the ass's colt is found. The Lord finds the colt Himself. In these last days the Lord has to do so much that He should not have to do at all, as in Nehemiah's day; you are impressed with what Nehemiah had to do. Subordinates ought to have done it, but Nehemiah had to do it because there were not others available. So it is today, that servants have to do so much that they would not have had to do in earlier days. Paul tells the Corinthians he did not have to do a certain thing, but he did it nevertheless; like the Lord Himself he was ready to do anything. So it is now, the levites must be ready to do anything, because men are short. There is a shortage of certain skilled men. There are a good many coming on now, but at the same time there is a great want of skill in what is done.
T.S. Why is that?
J.T. It is just the circumstances. We are in the last days, you know, when "difficult times shall be there", @2 Timothy 3:1. We are speaking now particularly of the want of skilled men, and how Nehemiah had so much to do. He was the governor but he had to do many
{279}
other things for the people that ought to have been done by themselves, so that he says in one place that he took counsel with himself, as if he did not have anybody else to take counsel with.
L.E.S. So that the care of all the assemblies should really have been the care of the elders.
J.T. Quite so. That was brought out in @Acts 20, where Paul exhorted them to take care of the flock.
J.McK. There is an allusion in verse 17 to what you have been saying about the dispensation: "And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them". Is that the present moment?
J.T. Quite so. What darkening conditions there are, apostate conditions! Think of Germany as it is today, once the cradle of the Reformation, where light shone so resplendently! It is darkened by apostasy and the whole of Europe is darkened.
F.R.A. We have an illustration of skill on the part of the Lord in knowing just where each disciple is, each one of His own. Knowing where souls are ought to be a point with us.
J.T. Quite so.
E.G.McA. It says in Mark, "And seeing them labouring in rowing" @Mark 6:48 but in John it says, "They see Jesus" (verse 19). Is that because they were acquainted with the one who introduced Himself as "It is I"?
J.T. I suppose it is what John represents himself. He is the writer of this gospel, and he said in a dark time, "It is the Lord", @John 21:7. That is a great matter. If we are near to Him we shall know Him when we see Him. There is someone like that who can recognise Him in all these times.
N.B. Was it right for the disciples to make this move? They move eventually without the Lord at the end of the gospel; should they have remained with Him here?
{280}
J.T. Let us see what the facts are. "Jesus therefore knowing that they were going to come and seize him, that they might make him king, departed again to the mountain himself alone. But when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea, and having gone on board ship, they went over the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark", @John 6:15 - 17. Let us see how this incident compares with @Matthew 14. Matthew records the same incident and if you will just look at chapter 14 you will get some further facts as to the disciples. It says in verse 22, "And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds", @Matthew 14:22. Well now, that has to be read with this, that they went into the ship under the Lord's compulsion. The Lord had something in that, because He was going to carry this matter out and show what walking on the water meant. Therefore we get much more about it in Matthew, because Matthew is the assembly gospel.
N.B. That helps.
E.G.McA. Would you say that administration in Matthew leads to the same end as in John here? They arrived at the land where they should be; that is the end in view, is it not?
J.T. Quite so; and the rowing is important: "Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia" (verse 19). They had experienced the rowing; it is not walking but rowing. There are very few who can row. Nearly everyone can walk, but rowing is a skilled matter and they were able to do that. We are told how far they went, showing that they could get along a certain length. The Lord knew that; He knew what they could do, but then He was going to teach them in the rowing and on the sea what He could do in these circumstances; and He would teach us, because we are in these circumstances and we have to learn how the Lord will come in to us in them. We might
{281}
struggle along and say, Anyway the sea is not very large and we shall get to the port; and doubtless they would have reached the port; but it says, "Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship; and they were frightened. But he says to them, It is I: be not afraid. They were willing therefore to receive him into the ship". That is a point to notice, that they were willing to receive Him into the ship. The Lord comes into view as a Benefactor to them, and then it says, "And immediately the ship was at the land to which they went".
N.B. Why was Capernaum their objective? Was it not the place where the Lord did not do many mighty works because of their unbelief?
J.T. We have already had before us that Capernaum according to Matthew was the place to which the Lord went from Nazareth. That is, He was unselfish in His selection of a residence. The brethren generally go to a hillside or a seaside or wherever there is physical benefit in selecting a house, but the Lord went to Capernaum. Apparently He had a house there and that would make it all the more interesting, that He was going to that point.
F.T. Does it not suggest the present dispensation, the Lord going up to the mountain suggesting His being on high and then our being down here amid all the circumstances the enemy brings about?
J.T. It is not only that He intercedes; His intercession does not need His coming down. He is on high to intercede for us, but besides interceding He comes down to where we are. That is just the point. The Lord says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", @John 14:18. Not only does He intercede for us, but He comes to us.
F.T. Is this in line with John's ministry? He takes up that which is going through, and the Lord is going
{282}
to help His people to go through in spite of all circumstances.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. How does this work in connection with the crowd? It says they were coming to make Him King.
J.T. The Lord is not going to let them make Him King. The point they had in mind was that He would be a Benefactor as King. It was not that they loved Him, but that He would do them good. This chapter brings out what He could do for them. What a thing it would be if we had a Man in this country that could feed millions of people! The Lord could have fed millions if He wished to, as He did thousands.
Ques. Is this position a result of the Lord refusing to let them make Him King?
J.T. Quite so. He is not selfish; He is not operating for royalty or a crown, or for greatness in this world. He has His own which are in the world, that is the point. He comes to them, and He intercedes for them above. That promise of the Lord is what we are working out now, perhaps more effectively than they did fifty years ago: "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", @John 14:18. Not only does He intercede for us today, but He comes to us.
R.R.T. In order to get the gain of it it is necessary that we be found with willing spirits; there must be willingness to receive Him into the ship.
J.T. The Lord looks for that.
Ques. Does the land immediately reached suggest settled conditions?
J.T. It is a fixed place, it is *terra firma*. At times we reach positions of security and firmness; when the Lord is there we get to land. So with Paul and his ship, it was a long, troublesome voyage of very great disappointment and loss, but they got to the land, some of them on pieces of the ship, it says, but they got to the land. So Jonah got to the land.
{283}
It is a question of getting to the fixed position in the service of God. At the present time it is only temporary because it is the millennium where we get fixedness permanently. We shall get fixedness permanently in the millennium and in heaven.
Ques. I was thinking of conditions which come up like unionism which stir us up to reach this firm ground. Do you think that is right?
J.T. Just so.
R.R.T. What is in your mind about fixedness permanently in the millennium?
J.T. The Lord has control of it. He has not got control of the earth now in the sense of being Ruler, but God "has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed", @Acts 17:31. Judging there is not judging in the sense of judicial dispositions, but judging in the sense of ruling. When He is in that position, He whose right it is, things will be fixed. Capernaum is Capernaum, and the cities will be known and have a fixed place, you can designate them. We who are heavenly, who will come out to rule five cities or ten cities, will know where they are and it will be our business to rule them. But not now, we are not ruling yet. It is our testimony that we are not ruling the world yet; we are praying for the rulers, but we are subject. We are aliens; we are strangers and sojourners on the earth. That is what I meant by fixedness in the millennium; now it is in heaven.
R.R.T. How are we to understand anything being permanent in the millennium? It comes to an end, does it not?
J.T. Well, it does come to an end, but not in the sense of destruction. It comes to an end in the sense of merging, for millennial conditions will merge into wholly spiritual conditions. There will be judgment, according to @Revelation 20, but not to dislocate the
{284}
position, save that it is a merging into another condition; that is what I understand. Flesh and blood do not inherit the kingdom of God, so that the millennium must cease in some sense, but the work of God is there and the inhabitants will merge into some further relation. That is a matter which would take a great deal of explaining, or perhaps we cannot explain it. It is not much explained; it is just left. But the position is fixed. It is God's territory. I am just contrasting the present time with the future time; the millennium will be a fixed state of things, the five or ten cities are known and certain rulers of them come down from heaven.
Ques. I would like to ask in regard to the disciples¬ experiencing this strong wind blowing. A little later in the chapter we find others going across the water and they do not experience this trouble. Would you tell us a little about how this strong wind blowing is affecting the disciples?
J.T. That would be the devil.
Ques. Locally?
J.T. It was the sea of Tiberias of course. The epistle to the Ephesians explains it, I think, that the prince of the power of the air was active, and it was against the disciples. How the devil stirs up things even now to disturb the meetings and the service of God!
E.G.McA. Is there the same satanic attempt here to turn back the disciples as there was by Herod in @Luke 13 to turn back the Lord? But the disciples kept on and the Lord came to them. There is nothing said here about the Lord speaking to the winds and the waves, nor about "What sort of man is this?", @Matthew 8:27. It is a matter of being acquainted with the Lord and arriving at the point they wanted to arrive at in spite of their difficulties. It was a difficult situation, but they finally arrived at the end. He
{285}
overcomes any difficulties brought in by the enemy, but He has the end in view.
J.T. What answers to that is the land. There is no disturbance on the land.
R.R.T. Essentially, the strong wind blowing was really contrary to the Lord's command. As you were saying, in Matthew He commanded them to go down to the ship, so that really the opposition was directed against the commandment of the Lord.
J.T. It was His matter and the devil was against it. The Lord could have quieted the elements, but there was no necessity for it here because the land was there.
T.S. Just what is meant in the presentation of Himself: "It is I"?
J.T. It is no other. If He said that to any of us one million years from now, we would know Him. There is only One who could say that in this sense. What a comfort it is that there is such a One as that! If all the world was to go out from under your feet the Lord would say, "It is I". He is the Maker of it and of the winds and everything.
E.G.McA. You would hardly say that if you went up to a stranger's house. It would require acquaintance, would it not?
J.T. Very beautiful! There was only One who could say that and they would understand.
F.R.A. It is something like Rebecca's asking who the man was. The servant said, "That is my master!" @Genesis 24:65 and she sprang off the camel.
J.T. She understood. The camels would take her to that man; they were a provision. Isaac, typical of the Lord, was looking for the camels; that is what he was looking for. The type is perfect in that sense.
F.T. Would the land suggest the peaceful quiet conditions that should exist in the hearts of the saints as allowing the Lord to come into these circumstances?
{286}
J.T. That is just it. We are in known circumstances of certainty and we cannot be disturbed there. The Lord is there: "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", @Matthew 18:20
R.R.T. So that if we are willing to bring the Lord into the matter, the agitation by this strong wind need not necessarily go on for months and years. It will be immediately settled, will it not?
J.T. That is very good; bring the Lord in. The solution of everything is that.
E.G.McA. I think your remark just now is most helpful. You said the Lord was looking at them. We sometimes look at the circumstances and forget that the Lord is looking at us.
Ques. Peter says in Matthew, "Command me to come to thee upon the waters" @Matthew 14:28. Why is that omitted here?
J.T. John is not dealing with the assembly as such, but more with individuals, the persons who form the assembly, however many or few. It is the persons, living persons; the idea of life is developed in John more than in Matthew.
F.T. You have something definite in mind in regard to @John 12.
J.T. Well, one thing to be said now is that chapter 12 is the turn in the testimony. That is, chapter 12 is the sequel to what we get from chapter 9 to the beginning of chapter 11, these chapters forming a group. We have in verse 36 of chapter 12, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light. Jesus said these things, and going away hid himself from them". He disappears out of view but He sets us up as sons of light; as believers in the light we become sons of light. We can be left, and that is another principle in John. He says in chapter 11, "Loose him and let him go" @John 11:44. Who is let go? The son of the resurrection!
{287}
He is a son of light and you can trust him. You can leave him, as it were. The Lord can afford to leave him, knowing that things will go well with him. If there are more such it will go all the better. That is what we get in @John 12. "Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among the dead. There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him. Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment" @John 12:1 - 3. There is a disturber here, that is Judas, but things go on nevertheless. Judas intervened, as it is said, "One of his disciples therefore, Judas son of Simon, Iscariote, who was about to deliver him up, says, Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor? But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was put into it" @John 12:4 - 6. He was another fox, a disturber; but he does not interfere after all, because the Lord was there to settle everything, and the settlement was, "Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial; for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always" @John 12:7,8. That is settled. He could have done much more to Judas but He did not; He did not need to. That was all that was needed for the moment; Judas was silenced, put out of the way, as it were. The Lord was then free to open up wonderful things in this chapter and among them the two verses we read: "Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light amongst you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you. And he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes" (verse 35). I think the brethren will see
{288}
at once that there is a word for us as to light and darkness, as to whether we are walking in the light or in darkness. God is in the light; God is light, and our fellowship is in that: "But if we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship with one another", @1 John 1:7. That is where the fellowship lies, where the sons of light are. And our point would be at the present moment that if we are not settled, if we are not sure, we are either cloudy or dark. Being on the land would mean certainty. While we remain questioners we are more or less in the dark, whereas the Lord says in verse 36, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light". That is to say, the darkness passes. John says in his epistle, "The darkness is passing", @1 John 2:8. It has not passed yet; it is passing; it passes in the soul of the person who is believing. He may not be too sure but he is on the way to it and as soon as he is surely on the way he is a vessel of light, a son of light. We must not stop halfway but go the whole way to become a son of light; the word is not 'children' but 'sons'. So that we have so to speak a cluster of stars in this chapter, sons of light, for the company in Bethany is really a group of luminaries. Judas would disturb that; Satan would disturb that, but it went on. The Lord saw to it by His word that it did go on. That is a point we should finish with, I am sure. Are we sons of light or not? Are we sure or not? If we are not sure, why not? Scripture is to make us sons of light.
F.T. It is noticeable that it says, "That ye may become". Does that suggest an end to be arrived at through a process, so that we may become characteristically that?
J.T. It is the end of a process, as you say. It is not merely luminaries or stars, it is persons in that relation with God, sons of light; persons who are luminaries.
{289}
F.R.A. With the stars there is no speech nor language, they just shine; so in this incident in the beginning of chapter 12 no one says a word.
J.T. That is good, because Lazarus is never said to have said anything, but he is a luminary. Is that what you mean?
F.R.A. Yes.
T.S. While some persons may think that a word is necessary and often speak about wanting a word from the Lord to tell them what to do, yet do you not think that in what is presented here there is light in God's operations, and we come to understand what to do from that?
J.T. That is pretty much what we get from the book of Acts. Luke is the writer; it is his second epistle or treatise, and what you will notice is that it conveys not exactly what the disciples are *told* to do, but what they *do*. They know what to do, hence they are the directors, and there is the apostles¬ teaching and fellowship. There must be the apostles¬ doctrine and fellowship, and breaking of bread (of course, that is not the apostles¬, that belongs to us and all the saints), and prayers; they belong to us too. Hence we know what to do; we have our prayer meetings and our meetings for the breaking of bread, and we know what to say. Therefore Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do *ye* judge what I say", @1 Corinthians 10:15. We ought to know how to judge things as to what they really are. That is what this passage means in relation to sons of light.
L.E.S. Is not this one of the passages that helps us to understand how faith operates? "Believe in the light".
Ques. Would these sons of light correspond to the lights that are spoken of in @Genesis 1? It says they are for signs and seasons and days and years. Would that help us in regard to the encampments which we have been speaking of?
{290}
J.T. As God sets man up he is wonderfully provided for, with these luminaries over his head. So that it says He made the stars also; the two greater lights and the stars also. They also are beneficial, and "star differs from star in glory", @1 Corinthians 15:41. But what we have here is sons, that is a moral idea; a son represents the relation in which we are with God because we walk in the light.
Ques. In @Acts 22 it says, "But they that were with me beheld the light, and were filled with fear, but heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me" @Acts 22:9.
J.T. You are referring now to Saul's conversion? Yes, there were those there who did not get all that Paul got. I think he was stressing what a time it was, speaking of it himself in @Acts 22. Those with him did not get all that he got; he got all there was. So with the brethren here today, some of us know what we are saying, others know that what they hear is right, but there may be some here who do not get all there is. We do not want to be like that. We want to take all there is available and not stop short of the idea of being a son of light. And it is not simply that I am a son of light, but I belong to the "sons of light".
Ques. It says, "Light is sown for the righteous", @Psalm 97:11.
J.T. It is a remarkable thing that it is sown. That is a word that fits in with Matthew: "But having heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee: and having left Nazareth, he went and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the seaside in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying, Land of Zabulon and land of Nepthalim, way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations: -- the people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in the country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up" @Matthew 4:12 - 16.
{291}
It does not say 'sown down', but 'sprung up', meaning that it is not Christ come down but sprung up. It is not Christ come down, and heaven on earth, but light radiating around as from an Object on earth instead of from heaven. That is Matthew. What a great thing it was! It was light springing up, a remarkable fact!
H.A.G. I thought in regard to "Light is sown for the righteous" @Psalm 97:11 that we might trifle with the light and it become darkness to us.
J.T. Yes; and if it is sown for the righteous, the righteous will get the benefit of it. The sowing is by some other hand. God may have used your forefathers for that purpose, or your immediate father, but it comes up in this time for you.
H.A.G. If the light in you becomes darkness, how great is that darkness!
F.T. The idea is a crop; is it not?
J.T. It is an agricultural figure instead of an architectural one; light springs up like a seed.
A.D. John speaks in his epistle of one who hates his brother being in darkness and not knowing where he goes. Sons of light would walk together in love.
J.T. Quite so. So that the apostle refers to "an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning", @1 John 2:7. That is what the Lord spoke, as we see in this gospel and in Matthew. The new commandment is a present thing: "Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you". And then he adds, "because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines", @1 John 2:8. I suppose this would refer to any who are coming into the truth, laying themselves open for it and ready to receive it; the darkness is passing in them. We cannot say it is passing in the governments of the world, although some beneficial changes
{292}
are taking place now, but we cannot say the darkness is passing actually among the nations. When this war is over they will revert pretty much to what they were, whereas the darkness is passing in the christians that are left here. In the millennium all will have passed and the Sun of righteousness will have arisen with healing in His wings, whereas now it is just passing in people who believe. The sons of light are persons in whom the darkness is passing.
E.G.McA. Is there a responsibility in this that leads to being sons of light? "Walk while ye have the light", and "While ye have the light, believe". You have a definiteness in your walk and the result is sons of light.
J.T. That is the idea. And what we said earlier should be kept in mind, that in verse 36 the Lord is able to go away and leave the sons of light; they are left down here.
E.G.McA. He seems to say that those of us who have experienced this and taken it on are that characteristically. That is not assumption, is it?
J.T. I am sure it is not. You just thank God for what you are. Why should you not?
R.R.T. Does believing in the light really involve recognition of the Person, as you were connecting it with Him? The great light and the light sprung up would involve believing on the Person?
J.T. It would. The Lord was the light Himself. It needed not only that persons should be there physically in His presence but it needed faith. That is the point that is made in the gospel; the blessing comes to you through faith; faith comes through hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
F.T. The Lord is going away and leaving the light here.
J.T. It is the position in the Acts. He went up and the light was here.
{293}
MATTHEW'S GOSPEL
@Matthew 17:24 - 27.
I wish to speak at this time, as you will understand from what I have read, about Matthew's gospel. Matthew was one of the apostles and was used to write this gospel. Like the other apostles, his name is in the foundations of the heavenly city which are adorned with every precious stone; so that the apostles are outstanding men. They are superlative in value. Peter was one, of course, and he uses the word 'precious' in a very significant way. Undoubtedly he had learned from the Lord how precious he was and how precious the other eleven apostles were. The devil would spoil them; the Lord told Peter that Satan had desired to have them to sift him as wheat, meaning that he would show there was not much of value in him after all. The test would be severe. The pronoun there is not 'thee' but 'you', which is plural; that is, it would imply that he would put the twelve of them through the high test that he had in mind, to bring out that they were not just what they seemed to be or what the Lord said or implied they were. But the Lord says, "I have prayed for thee", @Luke 22:32 using the singular, knowing that the pressure against Peter would be especially severe. The Lord told Peter, too, later, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst" @John 21:18 meaning that when he was a young man he did what he willed, like most young people. He went where he would and did what he would; but the Lord says, You will improve. The preciousness will be there, fully; you will improve; age will help you. I would say that to all of you young people here: age will help you if you are sincere. It will not help you otherwise. One may be converted and seem to make a good start, but the devil decoys him into the world, and age
{294}
then does not do him any good, but the contrary; the older ones become the worst. It is very solemn. But the Lord showed that in Peter's case it would be different, he would increase in value with age. I want to do that; I want to increase in value. The Lord has put a value on every one of us, indeed the book of Leviticus puts a value on us as christians; we are all valued. So the Lord said to Peter, You will increase in value with age, as you grow older; I mean He said that in effect, because He said, "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire", @John 21:18. That is, he would be wholly resigned to the will of God. The will of God is prevailing even among the nations; God is having a certain advantage with them, and it is a great time for christians to learn to do the will of God. As James says to a man who would like to make money, You go to another town and make money there -- like the Jews at the present time who make money fast even if they have to go to another town or another country to do it. But James says, "If the Lord should so will" @James 4:15. I will do so-and-so, that is, it is a question of the will of God and not of money-making with us.
So as to Peter the Lord said, "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee", @John 21:18. And I say to you young people, the older you become, the more serious you become -- I mean, normally -- and presently the time of departing to be with the Lord is coming, either by translation or death. It is imminent, and becomes more and more real, so that you are more disposed to be resigned to the will of God.
Now Matthew has all this in mind. He is one of the precious stones and doubtless he is precious in the sense of gathering up the Lord's mind about the assembly. He is the only apostle, the only evangelistic
{295}
writer, who speaks about the assembly formally, and I have no doubt that the Lord especially values Matthew because he did write about the assembly. Matthew came into the Lord's mind as one who would write about that which He loved most and best. The most beautiful thing in the whole realm of the universe, of the creation, is the assembly, outside of divine Persons of course. They are not things, They are Persons, but the assembly is a thing and it is the most beautiful. It is composed of persons of course, but it is nevertheless a thing though presented as a peculiarly substantial thing -- perfectly so, indeed, and measured. It is measured in the sense of being a cube, showing that it is substantial. It is not unreal; there is nothing imaginary about it; it is a substantial thing to be known as such. So the Lord undoubtedly regarded Matthew peculiarly because he was to write about the assembly; he writes about it in a certain chapter especially but all the gospel bears on that great subject. That is the theme, the trend of it -- it all bears on the assembly.
This leads me to another point that I have in mind, and that is that the masculine side is greatly stressed in Matthew. The stressing of it is seen in the history of our Lord as born into this world, and the facts as to His mother and His father, His father by reputation that is, Joseph. God is His Father, of course, but Joseph was His father because he was the husband of Mary; He is called the Lord's father in that sense, conveniently so; and he is made more of in Matthew than in Luke or in Mark, all by design, and all in accord with what is divinely done, the cause not far to seek. Hence we have in Matthew, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ" @Matthew 1:1; not those that were born of Him, that were descendants of His, but it is put in this way -- that the generation is His. One person in it is Abraham,
{296}
but it is not Abraham's generation. In Genesis there are ten generations given to us and we might have expected Abraham's to be given, but it is not; the greatest man in Genesis is Abraham, but his generation is not given. Adam's is given; Noah's is given, and those of others, but not Abraham's. Can we doubt that the Spirit with beautiful design and instinct omitted Abraham from the list of those whose generations were given, for the reason that he was to be directly in the line of the Messiah? He saw Him. Could Abraham wish to have his own generation portrayed in the presence of the fact that he saw the Messiah? And he rejoiced to see Him: "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced", @John 8:56. He would, as it were, hide in that holy presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, and as Matthew serves to give us the generation of that Person, Christ is first mentioned. It is, "the generation of Jesus Christ", @Matthew 1:1 not Isaac, not Abraham, not Jacob, not David, but Jesus Christ. He must be the First in that sense. So we have no generation of Abraham given in Genesis; in truth he is the heavenly man, and that is what one had in mind.
So I have read this passage because it speaks of sons. It is an outstanding passage in Matthew in that it speaks of sons; not children. We had it today that John speaks much of children. Matthew speaks about the Lord Jesus as a little Child with His mother; about nine times in the first and second chapters we have the little Child mentioned, not the Babe. Luke speaks about the Babe, but Matthew speaks about the little Child. Many other passages, as we had today, speak about and present the idea of children. The word 'child' is common gender, it may be male or female, but not so the word 'sons'. John speaks much of children; Matthew speaks about sons. John hardly speaks of sons at all. He
{297}
speaks of the Son of God of course; he must speak of Him, but as to ourselves he speaks of us as children exclusively, except in one passage. But Matthew speaks of sons in this particular passage, and that is why I read it, in order to bring out the masculine side and that it is worked out in sons or in sonship, and that it goes to heaven. Children do not go to heaven. I am speaking now of how Scripture speaks, and Scripture never says they go to heaven as children. Understand that when I say that I am not overlooking the fact that the Lord said of children, of little ones, that "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens", @Matthew 18:10. I am not forgetting that. Who can tell anything about the vast number of children that go to heaven in the physical sense? We have to leave that with God, and not forget that the Lord spoke about the little ones saying, "Their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens". It is the comfort of all mothers and fathers. But what I am speaking of is christianity. There are the children of the heathen and what not abroad in the world that God claims as His creatures; we have to leave that with God; He will do right with all such. But that does not touch at all what I am speaking of. I am speaking of christianity, and each christian who dies in the Lord goes to heaven as a son. The idea is going up, the masculine side is going up; the family side from the standpoint of children is down here. John says, "Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", @1 John 3:2. That is masculine. I want to keep to that point now so that we may have in mind that the assembly is in a masculine setting. In itself it is feminine, it is always feminine in the sense of gender when it is spoken of
{298}
as a person; for instance, the Lamb's wife, the holy city, the heavenly city descending from God out of heaven adorned as a bride for her husband. That is feminine. But Matthew is viewing it from the administrative side, dear brethren; I want you to keep on that line for the moment, and that must be in the main masculine; not that the feminine is shut out, because the virtuous woman in Proverbs is a great administrator. She is a woman, but her husband is absent; yet he is known here, he is known in the gates, that is where judgment is carried on, where government is carried on as seen with Boaz. The masculine side is presented in him. There he was in the gate. The transaction as regards Ruth was in the gate of the city; it was an administrative matter and so Matthew is an administrative matter.
I am speaking tonight just because of that: that we might all see that we have part in this administrative matter, be we sisters or brothers. I need only to cite 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians and Ephesians to prove all this, and Revelation too; indeed the whole history of the testimony is the masculine and the feminine so that it is said that "God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them", @Genesis 1:27. And He said to them, "Have dominion", @Genesis 1:26. He said it to both of them, so that the sisters and the brothers have to learn to have dominion; but there are things said about the sisters or about women, about the feminine side, that are intended to govern our minds as to the effect of femininity in this world. We cannot say that God could not do without it, But I would not say He could do without it; it is according to His purpose. The word 'man' covers both male and female, and God said, "Let them have dominion". But in the third book of the Bible God said that when a man-child is born the mother has to be unclean for seven days and then for thirty-three days;
{299}
but when a woman-child is born the mother has to be unclean for two weeks -- fourteen days -- and afterwards sixty-six days. We could not work out from a physical point of view why this should be. There is nothing moral, of course, attached to the mother of a female child any more than to that of a male child, but God is speaking from His own point of view. He has a long outlook and He sees the effect here of the female and the effect of the male, and He shows us that the effect of the female here is morally more serious.
You may say, Why are you saying all that? One reason particularly is because woman is so exalted at the present time. Now let the dear sisters here not think I am saying one word derogatory to the female sex; I am not. I am only speaking from the word of God, and God shows us in what I quoted from Leviticus that much more serious consequences flow from the feminine side. If they do not know it they should know it now and think about it and control themselves, so as not to lend themselves to the spirit of this world. It is only in the assembly that you get the right thought about everything. Of course you get the right thoughts in the heavens, but as regards persons and things we can only get the right thought in the assembly. We get the truth about man and woman and children and about nations; we get the truth about all in the assembly. The all-various wisdom of God is seen there by the most exalted creatures; that is, the angels in heaven see all this. The all-various wisdom of God is portrayed and worked out in the assembly, and it is for sisters and brothers alike to see that they belong to that and to control themselves according to that, so that they can be used according to that. Think of the magnitude of what I am saying, and that you yourself belong to it as I do, thank God! But that is not all: the question is to be available to God for
{300}
this great matter that He is working out at the present time. Matthew has this in mind, so that there we have a great deal about Joseph. Why should Matthew tell us more about Joseph than Luke does? Surely for a purpose; he is going to speak of the assembly not as the bride of Christ but as the great administrator of the universe presently; that she is to administer. So that the sisters too have to do with administration in the assembly now, and that is a most serious matter as to our conduct. We have had the matter of conduct before us today, that is, it works out in the idea of walk and education and affiliations and fellowship so that God should have something, should have material, workable material for the great purpose He has in hand. He is doing one thing at a time; other things are held in abeyance until the great matter is finished. So Paul puts himself forward as the completer of the word of God, and the completer of every man too, to present every man perfect in Christ; and he lays great stress in certain epistles, especially in Corinthians and Ephesians, on the female side. He stresses obedience, because without obedience in either male or female God has no material with which to work. He created the earth out of nothing, but not the assembly; He does not create that from nothing. He did not create Eve from nothing. He created Adam from clay, from dust, but He did not create Eve from dust; He created her from a part of Adam so that He might have something in the way of material for what He is doing. It is a question of the antitypes now for us. What is the potential part of the epistles but to bring out this very thing, to perfect the assembly, to make it useable for the purpose God has in mind.
Well, as I said, Matthew makes a great deal of Joseph, I mean relatively a great deal. The first thing he says of him is that he is a righteous man,
{301}
and he was righteous in regard of his wife. He was most careful, most sensitive, most tender in regard of her, exposed as she was. And then in chapter 2 he is entrusted with the mother and the Son, the little Child Jesus and His mother; they are both entrusted to Joseph. He takes the little Child to Egypt and God is there with Him, and when Archelaus died He sent Joseph back. Joseph knew enough to go back and he did go back; he was careful about his precious trust. That is what I am speaking about, the infinite preciousness of that trust; Joseph was such that God could trust him with such a precious commodity (I am speaking reverently of our Lord Jesus) and His mother, the little Child and His mother. If I speak to you about that dear little Child, that worshipful little Child -- because in chapter 2 He is seen as worshipful -- let us never forget that the Lord Jesus is to be worshipped. The wise men said, "We ... are come to worship him", @Matthew 2:1 let us never forget that; it is put down in the very beginning of Matthew and rightly in Matthew. It fits there. We have to learn to worship the Lord Jesus; let us never forget it. The wise men not only came to do it abstractly, but they brought things by which they could do it: myrrh and other precious things that could be used for the worship of the Lord Jesus. They had in their minds to worship the King; not the Child simply, but the King. If only a little child in appearance, in their minds He was a King; and so He was and ever will be an Object of worship.
So @Matthew 1 and 2 furnishes all this and a good deal more on the same line: how little children from two years and under were taken account of by Herod and how his wicked murderous attack was all aimed at the Lord Jesus to murder Him. It is really wonderful that God should entrust Joseph with the Child in view of the terrible hatred of Herod and others against Him; the precious Child, that He
{302}
should entrust Joseph with Him to carry Him to Egypt! It is a long way from Palestine to Egypt, and Jehovah the Father entrusted Joseph with this precious trust: the Lord Jesus Christ as a Babe whom the wise men, the magi from the east, regarded as the King of the Jews and whom they came to worship. One always dwells on those men with a peculiar restfulness. They came such a distance! What it must have cost them! One cannot say how many miles it was, but the east was the east; I would say it was probably in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates. They came that distance to worship the King of the Jews. There was no antipathy toward the Jews then; it was a question of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God. They came to worship Him, and they found Him; the star guided them to the place where the little Child was with His mother, and the heart rests there. Matthew presents that beautiful picture, and surely it is, dear brethren, written for us. Many saints after Pentecost never saw the gospel of Matthew; many of them died ere it was written; but we have it and all the epistles and gospels. The word of God is complete for us, dear brethren, and surely it is intended to complete us, to finish us. It is a finishing time with us, and the Lord is seeking to perfect us so that He may translate us to heaven for His pleasure.
Well now, I go on to chapter 17 because that is what I read, and I just wanted to show how sonship is stressed in it. The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews says, "For it became him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory ...", @Hebrews 2:10. That is my point, that He is bringing sons to glory. He is not bringing children to glory. It is the same Person but He is bringing sons to glory; it is just to impress us with that point that I now dwell for a short time on these verses. It is a chapter of great facts; it is
{303}
the chapter of the transfiguration, Matthew's presentation of the transfiguration. This point as to sonship is the last one in the chapter and it happened in Capernaum; Scripture not only says things, but they are said in certain places. Usually you get things said that will fit into certain places, because the places enhance or instruct as to the thing that is to be presented; this matter was in Capernaum. It says in @Matthew 2 that the Lord Jesus went to Nazareth. He did not reside there exactly; He stayed there in relation to His parents, His reputed parents. He did come back to Nazareth according to Luke to preach the gospel, and a wonderful time they had there afterwards; but it is said in Matthew that Jesus left Nazareth and came to Capernaum and dwelt at Capernaum. I do not believe there is any place mentioned in the gospels that has that honour save Capernaum. Nazareth was not just the same, but He was there, as I said, because His parents took Him there first of all when they returned from Egypt, and He grew up there and was a carpenter there. But He went to Capernaum. It was by the water side but Nazareth was away up on the hills so that it was no question of a better climate; it was no matter of that, the Lord never thought of that. He went to Capernaum because it was to be a centre of testimony. He says of it, "And *thou*, Capernaum, who hast been raised up to heaven, shalt be brought down even to hades", @Matthew 11:23. Why? Because of the mighty works that were done there. The Lord Jesus did wonderful things there, and it was there that this incident happened. It was a miracle too, the catching of one fish with a line and hook and in that fish's mouth was a stater, worth one dollar now according to the computation of persons that know. Peter had just met some persons who said to him, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?", @Matthew 17:24. That was a simple incident,
{304}
because people usually did pay this tribute. It was a tax that was laid on Jews in those days called the temple tax. We are very well accustomed to taxes now, I need not say anything about that; it is a tax time. When someone said to Peter, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?", Peter says, Of course He does. That was in effect what he said. It says, "And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying ..." (verse 25). Note it is when he comes into the house, because the Lord says, What I am going to say will have something to do with the family. He speaks about it to sons only; it is the great point in Matthew to bring out that the sons belong to the house regions. They go to glory; let us take it to heart and cherish it, that we do go to glory, and God is bringing us there; not simply lifting us there but bringing us there, bringing many sons to glory. He has made the Captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings.
Now Matthew in reporting on this is in keeping with the subject that the Lord gave him to write about. He gave Matthew his work and He gave all the apostles their work. He was the Superintendent of all these matters and He gave Matthew his work to do, and part of the work He gave him to do was to write this gospel. As I said in the beginning, he writes about the assembly and therefore the house must come into evidence. Let us not sit in the fields! You may say, It makes no difference; but it does. I could not speak to you as well out in the streets as I can here, because there are temple conditions here. It is not so out there.
And so it says, "And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers?". The Lord is saying in effect, I am going to speak to you about the family, and I
{305}
want you to understand that the families are not taxable; they are not taxable. I am not to be taxed when I go into heaven, nor are any of us; we are immune. And so the Lord uses this parable, but it was in the house, notice. And He says to Peter, "What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers?". The word 'children' in the Authorised Version should read 'sons'; the original is 'sons', it is not the ordinary word for children. "Peter says to him, From strangers". Well, that was right. And then what does the Lord say? As I said, it was in the house and the Lord is now speaking to us in the house; He is speaking to us as in assembly in a certain sense, and He is telling us that we all belong to the house. It is our place, not the field; Barnabas belonged to the family and he sold his fields and property and laid the money down at the apostles¬ feet. He was a true Levite. And so the thought is that we belong to the house, to the enclosure, the house which belongs to the Lord, where He has rights and liberties, and He is saying to us that we belong to that. I want all you young people, and old people too, to take home, each to himself, that we belong to the house, not to the field. You may have to go into the field but your place properly is in the house, that is, the divine house. I have often thought that Capernaum was convenient to the Lord and it afforded Him an abode that He could call His own house. It was not His father's house; it was not where Mary lived nor Joseph, nor his brethren; it was His own house. The Lord is speaking in this way to Peter when Peter came into the house; He waited until that time before He spoke to him about sons. He says to him, "Then are the sons free". He is speaking in the house, in the divine enclosure, in the place where it should be spoken. It belongs to the ministry of the epistle to the
{306}
Romans, and which Ephesians opens up to us. The house is a divine place, a divine enclosure, and things are said there that cannot be said elsewhere; therefore the Lord waited until Peter came into the house as to this question of who paid tribute and who did not pay tribute. And He says, You and I are sons. It is wonderful that He associated Himself with Peter in that sense! "Take that and give it to them for me and thee". What did he give? Not the fish but the money that the fish brought. It was caught by Peter who was a fisherman. The Lord says to Peter, "Go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater". A stater is a piece of money in value about one dollar or five shillings, and it took that amount to pay the tax. He says to Peter, "Give it to them for me and thee". He is announcing in the house that He and Peter were free from all taxation in a moral sense. We are under no tribute in a moral sense, we are free; the Lord says, "Then are the sons free".
That is just the word I would leave with you all. If the Lord Jesus is free, we are all free. We are all sons of God, as the Scripture says, by faith in Christ Jesus. Paul says, "God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father", @Galatians 4:6. The Father will not tax us; the angels will not tax us. The man that washes his robes has a right to enter into the city, he is not taxed by the angels at the gates. And so it is for anyone who is not in fellowship here, it belongs to you if you are a christian, and there is no tax put on you. It is contrary to the rules and principles that govern the house of God. There is no tax. We are free in the house. The Lord says, "Then are the sons free". That is all I had to say. May the Lord bless the word!
{307}
READINGS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL (1)
@John 8:1 - 36
J.T. Within recent times the Lord seems to have made a great point of John's gospel in view of the service of God. We shall consider it not as a whole but from the 8th to the 15th chapters. It is known to most of us that John's gospel is peculiarly divided into chapters and subjects. The divisions into paragraphs and verses in the New Translation are usually accurate, so that this section may be treated as a special section by itself. The subjects are distinct; this one is very distinct. The previous chapter closes with the words, "And every one went to his home. But Jesus went to the mount of Olives", @John 7:53 and then we have an incident of great importance morally and God doubtless would help us as to the significance of it. The significance of John's gospel cannot be overstated at this time. These sections lead up to the truth of the Holy Spirit, who is introduced in chapter 14, but the thought now is to look into this chapter because of its moral significance.
S.McC. Would this chapter help us in relation to things being clear on the moral side before proceeding further? It is essential the moral side should be clear, is it not?
J.T. Well, it is. The position the Lord takes up is significant. In regard to the generality of the people, every one went to his own home; that is to say the Lord is left, as if He were not of special importance. But then He Himself takes up a position, "Jesus went to the mount of Olives" @John 7:53; as if He were, for the moment at least, in relation with His Father. The mount of Olives denotes a spiritual setting, and the Lord intends to say something about what was to happen. He knew what would happen and in view of it we have, "And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them. And the scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman".
{308}
Now this incident so well known to the brethren is questioned by many critics, but it is clearly the truth; it is clearly Scripture. The Lord's attitude is what is in mind because it implies the moral side of the truth, how grace deals with incidents as they arise in the human family and especially among those who are professedly the Lord's people.
C.H.H. Is there anything in the fact that in chapter 7 He walks no longer in Judaea but enters into Galilee, and then in the next chapter we have the mount of Olives? Would it indicate that there was a change from what was of the law to what was spiritual? The mount of Olives was to supersede what the Lord spoke of in the moral question.
J.T. I think that is the point, that the Lord makes His own selections as to position. These paragraphs are not accidents. It says, "Jesus went to the mount of Olives". If we take that up in a geographical sense there is not much in it, but if it is a spiritual matter there is a great deal in it. In a literal sense it was just a mount on the east side of Jerusalem to which the Lord was accustomed to go; but undoubtedly it is of spiritual significance and that enters into what is related in the following passages.
J.F. Would you say that the Lord's ministry as coming from the mount of Olives would be definitely against what was merely formal or legal as represented by the Pharisees?
J.T. Very true; and they did not tell Him to go there; it was His own doing. Others went to their own homes, but then they came again to the temple in the morning, showing that there is some interest which the Lord sees. Then it says, "The scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst, they say to him, Teacher ...". These are the facts and it is a question
{309}
of our being able to deduce from them something spiritual. These meetings are intended to be spiritual; they are not intended to be casual occupations for any one of us. What is said is to be spiritual and the Scriptures are to be authoritative in them; the scribes afford the Lord an opportunity to open them up, which the Lord does. The first thing they say is that she is taken in adultery, a humbling thing, but the matter is so common! It is humbling to have to speak about it at all, but at the same time the Lord acts in the matter. The Pharisees act in it too: they set the woman in the midst; but then He stooped and wrote on the ground. It is one of the writings that was written by the Lord Himself. He did not write the gospels or the epistles but He writes what is written here and we do not know just what He did write. It is a very suggestive thing that He did write and stooped down to write. It opens up this great subject, this terrible immorality that is prevalent in this country and in other countries. But then there is the spiritual side that the Lord brings out and that is what we are aiming at.
S.P. Is that how matters are to be handled, as Paul handled the Corinthian matters from an elevation above the Corinthian level?
J.T. That is it, I would say; it is a wider matter than what is local, the place of responsibility. It bears on the Jewish position and what was about to be opened up through the Lord's death. The Lord's death had to take place to effect our entrance into it, otherwise we should never have 1 Corinthians or the gospels either. The great fact of the Lord's death is the thing to press upon our spirits. That had to happen.
A.B.P. Does the Lord have in mind the day of the Spirit? I had in mind verse 39 of chapter 7: "But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", @John 7:39.
{310}
I wondered if that shed its light over this, that the Lord Jesus was anticipating the day of the Spirit.
J.T. Well, it is more than that in the death of the Lord Jesus. "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified". The coming in of the Spirit depends on the Lord's being glorified; but that again depends on another thing, and that is His death. He must die.
S.J.H. What is involved in the stooping down?
J.T. It is wonderful! The Creator of the universe is stooping down! And there are certain accusers, certain accusations made by persons who themselves were not morally clear. So the whole position of judaism is involved and the Lord's death is meeting it all.
C.A.M. Is it right to connect the thought of the temple here with the reference to the temple as the Lord's body earlier in the gospel?
J.T. Quite so, the temple was His body. He said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up", @John 2:19. It is a question of what He would do. But now these men are assuming that they can accuse a person of this type, and the Lord answers them; He stooped down, we are told, and He did not make any great haste to rise up. He lets the thing have full effect.
C.H.H. Would that involve @Philippians 2?
J.T. Quite so, the Lord's own stoop. He was on an equality with God, yet think of it, think of Him stooping down here! He humbled Himself and made Himself of no reputation and was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Think of that!
R.W.S. Does not this give point to your allusion in prayer to Peter's word, "that God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ"? @Acts 2:36.
{311}
Is that not a complete answer to this stooping down?
J.T. It would be if you made much of the word 'Lord'; the first title is Lord and the next is Christ, and God is related to them both. The Lord's position in that sense is given by God. But this passage in John involves what He is in Himself; that is to say, if He dies, He dies; He has title to do it. The Father gave Him title to do it, to give Himself up, to give His life for the sheep. But it is Himself in John's gospel generally; it is not what He is made, but what He is. He is the Creator of the universe. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God", @John 1:1. All things were created by Him and nothing was created without Him, so that He is the Creator of the universe and yet He is doing this. He is going to deal with sin but He is stooping down to do it; He is stooping down to expose what men are and bring conviction into men's consciences as to sin so that there might be room for the Spirit to operate. The point in John's gospel is largely the operations of the Spirit with the Lord's own. So unless anyone is born of the Spirit he does not see the kingdom of God. Room must be made for the Spirit and that implies that there must be conviction of sin.
Ques. What is the point in His stooping down the second time?
J.T. The first stooping refers to Sinai, that is to say, "by law is knowledge of sin", @Romans 3:20. It is a sort of abstract statement but a very powerful one. They say in verse 5, "Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such; thou therefore, what sayest thou? But this they said proving him, that they might have something to accuse him of. But Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his finger on the ground. But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her".
{312}
That is searching by God through the lips of the Lord Jesus: "Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her". Not simply the first stone, but let him cast it *at her*. Is there anyone to do it?
J.T.Jr. You have the law given in @Exodus 20 and you have the Hebrew servant in the next chapter to show how the law was to be carried out; but there is the basis for taking up these things in such a one as we now have in this chapter.
J.T. Very good. So the Lord's attitude gives light to us, He stooped down and wrote with His finger. "But if by the finger of God I cast out demons", @Luke 11:20 we are told; the finger of God is the thing to notice. "But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her. And again stooping down he wrote on the ground". That is the second time He stooped. "But they, having heard that, went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last". Picture the scene! They did not go out pell-mell, it began with the older ones, it was orderly; men are orderly in the world but how much is it worth? We are thankful for the police of course, we are thankful for order, but what moral worth is there in it? They went out one by one beginning with the elders. What is that worth? They did not come back; there is no question of their coming into fellowship. The thing is negative, whereas the gospel involves what is positive, it involves the assembly; it is a positive thing that we are in today. First we get the gathering together, according to Matthew, and then we get the assembly, because the assembly is the fine point with God.
A.B. Is there something in the fact that although He stoops. He lifted himself up before He says.
{313}
"Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her"?
J.T. He lifted Himself up! Just think of the action of a divine Person who created the universe, that He lifts Himself up!
E.A.L. Do you think it is very significant that the Lord does not answer them orally? They say, "What sayest thou?". "But Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his finger on the ground", that is, He answered them by writing. I was thinking of what He said at the end of @Luke 16, "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, not even if one rise from among the dead will they be persuaded", @Luke 16:31. Moses was dead and they could not hear him, but the writings have a living voice. Was that the point?
J.T. Just so. Hence John says, "I write to you, children, because your sins are forgiven", @1 John 2:14 that is the first thing. "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong", @1 John 2:14. What a beautiful thing, a wonderful thing really, "because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you". "I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning", @1 John 2:13. That is the idea of writing, it is positive; it is to regulate.
B.W. "For I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust", @Romans 7:7.
J.T. Quite so, "By law is knowledge of sin" @Romans 3:20. The matter is down in black and white, so to speak. But then there is positive writing too, according to John's epistles.
E.A.L. Seeing it was not the mind of the Spirit to let us know what was written by the Lord, would you say this chapter teaches that there is much in the Scriptures that we can understand only spiritually and cannot get from the letter of the word?
J.T. Quite so. Look at the writings we have! The four gospels, the epistles, the Acts and the book of Revelation; and then the word in John's gospel
{314}
that if all the things Jesus did were written down the world itself would not contain the books. There is plenty written down: every scripture is inspired of God and profitable; and then the ministry of the Spirit of God has been going on day after day through all these ages and centuries. Day after day the Spirit of God is operating. That is expressed in what the Lord says, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". That is going on now; it is what the Spirit says to the assemblies now. The Lord has said things and the Spirit says things and this ministry of the Spirit is written down in such wonderful books as those we call the *Collected Writings*, and many others like them.
C.H.H. In Luke when the Lord answers the tempter He not only says, "It is written" @Luke 4:4,8,10, but "It is said" @Luke 4:12. Would that be the combination of what we have today, what is written and what is said?
J.T. That is how the Lord read the Bible. It is wonderful how much writing there is! Of course in these meetings that we have today we are attempting to *speak* to one another, as it says, "They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another" @Malachi 3:16:; and there are those present to confirm what we are saying.
S.P. Referring back to His having lifted Himself up, which is His own act, in verse 28 we have, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man ..." What are we to understand as to the difference between the two liftings up?
J.T. John's gospel speaks of three liftings up beside the two in this section, and they are very important to bear in mind and connect with each other. The Lord Himself is lifted up, but here He lifts Himself up. The lifting up of the Son of man means really that He is lifted up on the cross. He
{315}
did not do that Himself, others did it. They crucified Him.
S.P. A certain knowledge seems to come with the third lifting up in this chapter. It says, "Then ye shall know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things".
J.T. "When ye shall have lifted up": that is referring to the cross really, but the other two occasions are what He does Himself. The first lifting up is condemnation of the accusers, and the second shows that the accused is left standing there with nobody but the Lord. What would He do with her? It is a question of what He is going to do now. The woman is there by herself and the others are all gone. There is nothing positive in it at all, but it is a wonderful thing to think of, that the Lord of glory should be there in the presence of that woman, standing by her as she was left there by herself. She was in the midst really but now there is nothing to be in the midst of; there is only the Lord Himself. That meant that the basis must be laid for her to be forgiven. The Lord only says to her, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more". What is to happen after that? We cannot have people in fellowship simply because we can say to them, 'Do not sin any more'. We say more to them than that. The fact is the truth of the gospel and the truth of the church have to come in.
J.R.H.Jr. Would you say that spiritual liberty is connected with the second lifting up? I am wondering about James¬ epistle which he writes from a general standpoint, and when he comes to this matter of adultery he says, "So speak ye, and so act, as those that are to be judged by the law of liberty", @James 2:12.
J.T. Well, if you want to add more to what the Lord does. He does not add that at all, but it is quite right to add it and that is what we want to
{316}
come to. The Lord is there and the woman is allowed to be in His presence. He is not with her nor she with Him, but she is allowed to be in His presence and He says to her, "Go, and sin no more". That is all He says. That is not the truth that will develop the assembly; we need more than that.
R.W.S. This woman is not up to the level of the woman in @John 4, is she? The Lord does not seem to have too much confidence in this woman, whereas in @John 4 does she not represent a type of the assembly?
J.T. Yes, I would say that, because she left her waterpot and went into the city to call the men. He told her that He was the Messiah, but He did not say anything like that to this woman. We have to get at the facts here. This woman is just left there; the Lord says to her, "Go, and sin no more", and that is all He says. We must have more than that to establish the truth of the assembly and the discipline that is needed to bring out the truth of the assembly.
C.H.H. Is His stooping down and lifting Himself up to establish a new basis, so to speak, from which matters can be dealt with?
J.T. I think that is just the point, it is a question of the third lifting up, and the Lord does not do that at all, others do it. It is mentioned three times in this gospel besides the two liftings up in this section. So that this whole matter comes up now in view of the assembly, and what there is for us to go in for to have the assembly in a positive way. So verse 28 reads, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am he"; notice that, we do not get the liftings up here; "then ye shall know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things. And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him. As he spoke these things many believed on him".
{317}
Now we have something positive: "many believed on him". Apparently this woman does not; there is not a word said about what she does in that sense. It is what the Lord is bringing out as a sequence of this incident. We want to get the positive side in this passage; we have a wonderful line of thought here which will be a basis for other things that will lead up to the truth of the Holy Spirit.
R.W.S. So we are sitting down in the beginning at this low level, so that we might restfully and quietly move forward during these three days to the higher levels involving the Holy Spirit. The Lord sat down. Are not we in a similar position, sitting down and contemplating this moral matter restfully so that, as you have intimated, we might move on to the matters of the Holy Spirit, higher matters as we progress in these meetings?
J.T. That is what I am hoping will take place. Verse 28 helps greatly and gives a basis for what we have indicated as to our meetings, that is to say, the Holy Spirit in chapters 14, 15 and all the chapters that follow. There is no limit, according to what may be needed. But here we have a basis; that is to say, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things. And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him. As he spoke these things many believed on him". Many believed on Him. So that we have a basis now for proceeding in the enquiry as to the Holy Spirit. But here it is a question of the Lord's being lifted up, which is His death; He was lifted up upon the cross. Jesus died and was buried and the third day He was raised up, and when the Lord is raised up the Spirit of God is
{318}
given. He goes into heaven and the Spirit of God is given and the truth of the assembly is worked out. So that we have a solid basis for our inquiry as we proceed.
J.T.Jr. In chapter 20 the Lord formally turns over a matter like this -- as to retaining or remitting sins -- to such as would be able to handle it as He would handle it. After He has been lifted up and after He has suffered, He turns the whole matter over, really, to the assembly: "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained", @John 20:23.
J.T. That is very good. That is what John's gospel leads up to. In the meantime we have much that we can say about these details up to verse 36; so it goes on to say in verse 12, "Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true. Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and whither I go. Ye judge according to the flesh, I judge no one". That is to say, the Lord is here in grace. He is seeking to assert that. "And if also I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who has sent me. And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true: I am one who bears witness concerning myself, and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me. They said to him therefore, Where is thy Father?". Well, now you see what the Lord is aiming; at, that He is the light of the world. Much is to come in, the gospel is to come in because the Lord Jesus is the light of the world. He is not simply the light of men as in the first chapter, but
{319}
the light of the world, and this is all to work out in the details of instruction that we have following this remarkable incident. "Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true. Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and whither I go". That is to say, there is the light of the world and there is the testimony of two men, the great idea "that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses", @Matthew 18:16. That all comes into the truth of the assembly.
A.P. The woman was not the prime object of attack on the part of the scribes and Pharisees, but the Lord Himself.
J.T. They intended to ensnare Him in His words, so that the real issue was that. It is the scheme of the Pharisees and that is the sort of thing we have to deal with today. But then there is the testimony and the light of the world. What a glorious thought that is!
Ques. Does this chapter show how God secures His lovers? They quoted the law of Moses, but it says, "For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ", @John 1:17.
J.T. Just so. It says in @John 1, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him", @John 1:18. There is the revelation of God in Christ and then the light of the world is in Christ and then there is the testimony of two men as the Lord says here: "Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and whither I go. Ye judge according to the flesh, I judge no one. And if also I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who has sent me. And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true: I am one who bear witness concerning myself, and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me".
{320}
So that there are two Witnesses, the most infinite witness or testimony that can be produced, the Father and the Son witnessing of a matter. The foundation of that witness is behind our dispensation.
S.J.H. In verse 12 it says, "He that follows me". The Lord Jesus was left alone and He would have continued to be alone unless He had died.
J.T. The Lord has set down in this whole gospel the great principle that we are to follow Christ. He said to Peter, "Follow thou me", @John 21:22.
A.R. It says in @Matthew 18, "That every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three", @Matthew 18:16. The two witnesses bring it to the assembly. I was wondering if you had that in your mind?
J.T. Quite so, "that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses". Then we have much as to following the Lord Jesus in this gospel; it is enlarged on in the last chapter where He says to Peter, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me", @John 21:22. That is the point for Peter, a meddlesome brother; the point for him was to follow the Lord Jesus. He is the light of the world here and "He that follows me ... shall have the light of life". It is not simply the light of men, but the light of the world is shining.
F.S. The Lord presenting Himself as the light of the world is in contrast to the law which condemns.
J.T. Quite so; not a jot or tittle is written that is not useful; "By law is knowledge of sin", @Romans 3:20. It is useful because it brings about knowledge of sin. But
{321}
then we come to the light of the world; there is the light of life and the light of men too, but the light of the world is the greatest of all. The light of the world, the great Luminary of the world is Jesus. The whole sun is represented in Him.
J.T.Jr. Could you bring in the fourth day here as well as the first day of Genesis?
J.T. Well, the first day "God said, Let there be light", @Genesis 1:3 but we are not told what it was. The first day is abstract, that is to say, "God said, Let there be light. And there was light". Then the fourth day is the great luminary that is set in the heavens, the expanse. That must be some substance; there must be something there to cause the shining. It is very much like @John 1:4, "In him was life"; that is the substance idea, and that substance is light. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men", @John 1:4.
J.T.Jr. I see what you mean, the substantial thought is connected with life in Him.
J.T. That is right, there must be substance. There must be a substantial idea to convey light.
E.A.L. Would you say belief is connected with light in verse 31? "Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free". They are in effect those who accepted the testimony and the witness we have spoken of.
J.T. Quite so; so that He is the light of life, the Son. The Lord Jesus as the Son of God is the light of life. "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free". That is the idea, it is a Person now, the liberty the Person gives us.
C.H.H. Does that lead up to the truth of His deity in verse 28? The Son of man is beautifully identified with the "I am". The 'he' should not be there. "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am (he)".
{322}
J.T. Quite so, if you make "I am" a title of His deity, because that is really what it is. He is called "I am" in Exodus @Exodus 3:14; that is a title of the Lord Jesus.
Ques. What is the connection between the Lord here as the light of the world and what He says in @Matthew 5, "*Ye* are the light of the world"? @Matthew 5:14.
J.T. Well that is what saints are in principle; the Spirit has come down to be with us and we are the light of the world, a very great thing surely. It is because the Spirit of God is here; I mean it is implied in Matthew that the Spirit of God is here, and He is here now with us this morning. He is here for the gospel testimony too. It is a question of light; the Spirit is light.
J.R.H. Is this thought of the light of the world like what Paul says, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences"? @2 Corinthians 5:19.
J.T. Just think of the magnitude of that! "Not reckoning to them their offences"! Instead of imputing trespasses, it is reconciliation.
A.B.P. Would you explain what is meant by, "If ye abide in my word"?
J.T. I think the idea of abiding in a thing is an astronomical thought in John. Any element or feature of the universe abiding in a place, remaining in its orbit, is a principle with John; it is really astronomical, that a person remains where he is set.
A.B.P. That would link on then with His place as the light of the world. His word would hold us in relation to Himself as the light of the world.
J.T. Just so.
{323}
READINGS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL (2)
@John 9:1 - 41
J.T. You will notice the movements of the Lord here. It says, "as he passed on", as if to indicate that it is deliberate from His own side; and then it speaks of what He saw. It is not simply that His attention is called to it but it says, "He saw a man blind from birth". The disciples enquire as to this, assuming that there must be some cause for the blindness either in the man himself or in his parents. That is to say they conclude that what happens here in relation to the government of God must be causative, whereas God may act sovereignly in these cases; and in this case it is clearly to bring out what God can do for man in these conditions that are found in the race. As we consider the extent of the race, how numerous it is and what happenings there are! The Lord is indicating here that He can act sovereignly without regard to the parents¬ history. It is a question of what God can do, what He is entitled to do if He wishes to. It is a question of the sovereign works of God which are beneficial, for it is said the Lord went about doing good for God was with Him.
J.T.Jr. Would the works of God be a subjective idea?
J.T. I suppose that is what we are bound to conclude because it is the subject really of this chapter. This matter is great enough in the divine mind to develop into the subject of the chapter. The Spirit of God tells us certain things that happened and what moral effect the happenings had on the man. The moral effect is that he becomes a believer, not like the woman in the previous chapter; it is not said that she became a believer, but he became a believer for the Lord said to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?". It was in the Lord's mind that this should be brought out. So the question now is
{324}
as to believing, whether we believe what we are saying this afternoon, or whether unbelief is something that may mark ourselves. Does what is said bring out what is of God and faith? Are we developing faith?
S.McC. Is it suggestive that in the body of this great gospel we should have two incidents that are arranged for a certain purpose in the divine mind -- in this chapter in view of the works of God and in chapter 11 in view of the glory of God? Is there something significant in the selection of incidents with these things in view?
J.T. Just so. After this chapter we have the question of the sheep, the outcome of faith being to make one a sheep, constituting a believer a sheep. And then in chapter 11 we have the glory: the sickness was not unto death but for the glory of God. Is that what you have in mind?
S.McC. Exactly. Certain things were operative in view of divine thoughts being worked out, not just occurring in any haphazard way.
J.T. You see spiritual regularity throughout the book. It is remarkable to see the subjects brought out as they are and how they are placed spiritually.
R.W.S. In the first reading we were engaged with the women and the basic way the Lord met the sin question in being lifted up. Are we now to free our minds of the sin question entirely and see what God is doing apart from it?
J.T. Just so. It is said, "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him". Not simply the work of God, as is frequently stated, but the *works* of God; the whole subject of the works of God enters into the matter. The works of God are greater than the creation, as having a moral bearing. Jesus is the One accomplishing the works of God, He is the Operator.
{325}
C.A.M. I wanted to ask whether there would be a parallel with the first chapter of the Bible, occupied as we were with light in the first reading, that now there would be these works following, such as a man able to see.
J.T. Just so. It is a question of God doing such works, not what He did in creation. We can hardly say much about that because it is so far back. John says, "In the beginning was the Word"; @John 1:1 but then subsequent to that (I mean subsequent as to moral sequence), "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", @Genesis 1:1. We have something definite that He did; but before that, "In the beginning was the Word". It is "was", without saying what He did. Now here we have works; it is a question of God still but we have works. The man did not sin nor his parents, "but that the works of God should be manifested"; that is, not simply that they should be done but manifested. The thing should be seen.
C.T. Is there urgency attached to this? It says, "that the works of God should be manifested in him. I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day".
J.T. Just so, because it is daytime. "The night is coming, when no one can work". God works in the day and therefore it is said, "God called the light Day". "God said, Let there be light ... And God called the light Day", @Genesis 1:3,5. That is to say, the first day it was a question of light and things were to happen in the light, not in the dark.
J.L.P. Would the passage in @Philippians 2 fit in here, "For it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure"? @Philippians 2:13. Mr. Darby has a note in regard to "God who works" which says, 'internal operation of power, though seen in results'.
J.T. Well, quite so. I would say that this actual incident can be classified in that sense. Of course
{326}
this man was not a christian yet; this was in the Lord's own lifetime here, but Philippians refers to what is happening since the Spirit of God has come down. The Lord speaks of this time as greater than when He was here: "And he shall do greater than these, because I go to the Father", @John 14:12. That is what is going on now in this dispensation; it is a question of what God is doing through the Spirit and it has in mind what is to work out in the assembly. Here it is what the Lord does Himself to manifest the works of God. I am trying to stress the idea of manifestation, what a place it has in the divine operations, that is to say, what God's works are. As to the creation -- we cannot say it was the beginning as to sequence, because before that, "In the beginning was the Word", @John 1:1. The next movement is more the actual creation according to the facts of the case and the details given. The facts are that "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"; @Genesis 1:1 but here it is a question of the moral character of things and that it is to be manifested; as if God had peculiar pleasure in what is to be done now; it is the peculiar time for the works of God.
F.S. Does this blind man form a suitable background for the works of God in view of the Lord presenting Himself as the light of the world?
J.T. Well, it is man that is the subject of the works. We have to wait until the sixth day of the days in the first of Genesis before we get man. The works of God in man is the idea here.
S.J.H. It says in @Genesis 2: "But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground", @Genesis 2:6. In @John 9 the Holy Spirit had not come yet; it was the Lord, and He spat on the ground. Is there some suggestion in that?
J.T. The mist arose, as if something had to happen; it does not say that it rained. The idea of rain, of course, came in especially at the flood, but the
{327}
mist was something that you might say was more subjective. It arose from the ground, and it was needed for the divine operations in all that happened before the flood.
S.J.H. Chapter 8 would show the dryness of the ground; there was no mist in evidence. It was so dry that the Lord wrote on the ground. But here in a limited way He moistens it and accomplishes something. Would that be right? He spits upon the ground; He has come into Manhood; He has brought something in.
J.T. The Lord spits, just so, it is a remarkable thing; it is what comes out of the Lord Himself. It is a remarkable background for the way He is going to work, how He is going to operate. He made clay of the spittle. Now there was no rain on the earth before the flood as far as we know, but there was a mist that rose up and of course that would make way for the creation of man. The Lord created man out of the ground and evidently the formation was there before the breath was there. He "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul", @Genesis 2:7. But all that was in the time of the mist, and the mist would refer to something subjective to make the ground suitable for the divine operations.
A.B. It says that it moistened the whole surface of the ground. Is there something in that?
J.T. That is what I was thinking; it moistened the earth, made it suitable for divine operations. But then there is something here that corresponds. There is no mist, because the Lord here Himself makes the spittle. It is a product, as it were, humbly speaking, reverently speaking, of the Lord's own humanity; He had taken on that condition. He took on the condition of humanity so that He could make the spittle. Now this is a very particular thing that we are dealing with because it refers to the Lord's incarnation,
{328}
but it is a divine Person nevertheless. The spittle is from a divine Person and therefore the work is extraordinary.
Ques. Is that indicated in @John 10 where He says, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly"? @John 10:10.
J. T. Just so.
A.R. So that it is called 'mud', but then it is also called 'ointment' in this verse.
J.T. Yes, it is dignified. You can see that the Lord Himself, His own deity, entered into it.
J.R.H. Is this the same as what Paul speaks of as the working of life in the saints? "Death works in us, but life in you", @2 Corinthians 4:12.
J.T. Well, if there is death, but there is no death implied here. It is a living situation. It is what comes out of the Lord Himself and therefore it is a question of His deity but His deity in incarnation. So that you have material that can be made into spittle and then can be dignified as called ointment. The cure of this man is through an anointing, a very dignified word.
A.R. Why does He tell him to go to the pool of Siloam and wash?
J.T. To put him under responsibility to do things, to do what he is told, which is a very important thing. We all should learn to do things; we are not here to be idle. He is here to be doing things, and so you get throughout this gospel and, in fact, throughout all the gospels, the idea of man being put to work. As someone was saying to me yesterday, everybody should be doing something; even if he is defective it is wise for him to be doing something and, of course, doing what is right, not doing evil but doing what is right.
A.R. It is remarkable that in Genesis God tells Adam to till the ground.
{329}
J.T. Quite so, He gave him work to do. He told him to till the ground, gave him something to do.
A.B. Paul says, "If any man does not like to work, neither let him eat". @2 Thessalonians 3:10.
J.T. Exactly, "If any man does not like to work"; there are those who do not. It is a wholesome thing that it is obligatory on every one of us to be doing something.
A.P. Do you regard the action of the Lord in making the spittle a deeper matter than His writing on the ground in the previous chapter?
J.T. It is a deeper matter, I should think, because it brings about something positive. The man becomes a christian; I mean to say he becomes a believer, and that is a great thing. If a man's work is not a product of faith, what is it? There is nothing good in it, really. It says, "Whatever is not of faith is sin" @Romans 14:23; therefore the importance of doing things rightly, doing them well. It is said of one, "She hath done what she could". @Mark 14:8.
S.P. In chapter 3, verse 35, it says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" @John 3:35; does "in his hand" suggest that the Lord shows how things are to be done with exactness in all these incidents in John?
J.T. I would say that fully. Things are in His hand. So it is said of the Lord that He was weary with His journey, which is a most touching thing; He was wearied with His journey but still He went on working. He did not take a holiday, as it were, He proceeds to work, and therefore we have the Samaritan woman, a believer and a worker; a real worker in the service of God because men believed through her.
A.B.P. It says here, "I must work the works of him that has sent me". There is a compulsion, "I must work".
J. T. Just so, "I must work".
{330}
A.R. Does that enter into this man's mission? Siloam means 'Sent'.
J.T. It is that he is under orders, I think. "Here am I", said Isaiah; "Here am I; send me", @Isaiah 6:8 and He sent him immediately. We are all under orders and that is the point in John. I believe in chapter 13 the Lord stresses the idea of being sent.
R.D. Would this spittle be somewhat in line with the breath in the end of the gospel where "he breathed into them"? @John 20:22.
J.T. It might be so regarded, only that in the type used, 'breath' is from the lungs and we have to couple it with @Acts 2; we have to connect it with the mighty and powerful breathing there. They heard a powerful breathing, as if the lungs of God, so to speak, speaking reverently, were active to bring about something. @John 20 links on with that. It is a question of breathing, and the Lord breathed into them the breath of life, very like the action in @Genesis 1 when God breathed into Adam. The Lord breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" @John 20:22; something is to be received and then they are to do something consequent on that, that is: "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained", @John 20:23. So that in the breathing we have something from the Lord, it may be in view of what is judicial, or it may be positive in the sense of blessing. But now we are dealing with spittle which is a somewhat different thought, that the Lord uses something of Himself that brings about the ointment and this ointment is used to heal the man. But he has got to do something; he has to go to Siloam, and he does what he is told.
C.H.H. Is it not important that all these characters that come out in John's writings are put in movement? You were speaking this morning of the astronomical idea, as to planets abiding in the influence of the sun, that there is no such thing as a planet
{331}
being static; they are all moving. The Lord is moving and everything He touches moves.
J.T. Very good. You can see, too, how the works of God enter into that, how that God Himself is moving. He is behind all these things. It is a most touching thing that the blessed lungs of God, so to speak, are active; and then the Lord breathes into the disciples, which is the same idea. Then in this chapter we have what belonged to the Lord Jesus, so to speak, in anointing spittle; this shows that although we are to be very reverential and holy in all that we say, yet these things are brought before us to instruct us, because it is a time of instruction, of getting to know things. The apostle says, "I speak as to intelligent persons", @1 Corinthians 10:15 those who know.
B.W. Would the idea of moving in obedience be followed by the reward of having sight? That is, he was obedient, and we are told that "if anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment". @1 Corinthians 14:37. This man was rewarded in receiving his sight. Would it be that way for us if we move in obedience to the truth?
J.T. Just so. It is just what we have been saying, that God has pleasure in us, pleasure in His children, in those who move in His will. All these incidents are to bring that out. God has pleasure in this man as moving to Siloam.
J.R.H. In these references as to the spittle and the breath of the Lord had you something before you as to the Lord imparting something of Himself to the persons?
J.T. Yes, it is so different from what must be said as to the creation in the first of Genesis. On the fifth day He created the fish and the fowl; on the fourth day He created the sun, moon and stars: "And God made the two great lights ... and the stars" @Genesis 1:16; the word is not 'created' but 'made', although He does
{332}
use the word 'created' too. On the third day it was a question of the vegetables and the like, and on the second day it was the expanse, but it is not said that it was very good. God is the speaker, but it is not said that it was good. Still it is the expanse, something that God could utilise in His operational ways. On the first day it was light; so that is how the matter stands.
J.R.H. I was wondering if what the apostle Paul says in Corinthians about the life of Jesus being manifested in our mortal flesh would have something to do with this? It speaks about the works of God being manifested in this man.
J.T. Well, there is something in that. The works of Jesus are manifest in our mortal flesh; it is a question of the usability of flesh in a moral sense, not in a physical sense. Our flesh can be used of God for something, perhaps to show how @Romans 8 works out the question of flesh, whether we are speaking of it morally or physically. "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell", @Romans 7:18. Paul says; but then the flesh may be used in a good sense too.
J.R.H. It is a marvellous thing that what is of God should be manifested in man.
Ques. The man said, "It is I", @John 9:9. Is that the work of God appearing?
J.T. That is the next thing. It is a question now of who is going to speak about him and criticise the whole matter, because criticism brings out the truth very often. The Lord says, "I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day", showing what He is doing, giving us a lead; and then, "The night is coming, when no one can work". So that it is a question now of what the Lord is doing, He is ready to do things so that God should have pleasure in them. He goes on, "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world" -- again we
{333}
have the assertion that He is the light of the world, that is, as long as He is in it. It is not something that flows from heaven exactly, but as long as He is in it He is the light of it. "Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes. And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came seeing". What a great change there is in the man! But then the Lord is working; it is His own work, and all this enters into it before the man sees.
J.T.Jr. The Lord Jesus is working on the principle of being sent, as He says, "I must work the works of him that has sent me". The principle is that He is sent.
J.T. Hence if we are undertaking to do anything in the name of the Lord, whatever we do, it is said, "Do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus", @Colossians 3:17. Whatever we do is to be done in that way and therefore there is divine pleasure in it. That is what enters into the chapter I believe; it is the pleasure of God in the workmanship of Christ.
A.B.P. Is He leading up to the thought expressed in the end of the book, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you", @John 20:21 that they are persons who are trustworthy, that can be sent?
J.T. Well, they were constituted that. They showed themselves to be constituted suitable to be used of the Lord.
A.B.P. I thought possibly this incident had that in mind. The Lord stresses the fact that He has been sent, and He sent this man. I thought He might be developing material that would be trustworthy, that could be sent.
J.T. So that He says, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you", @John 20:21 But then, having said that, He breathed into them and said, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them"; @John 20:23.
{334}
that is to say, He is setting them to work to remit sins and to retain sins if necessary. He is constituting them suitable for assembly service, whether it be positive for good, or for disciplinary work. We have to do disciplinary work, that is, to retain sins if necessary.
A.R. Should those who are asked to preach or give an address have a sense in their souls that they are sent?
J.T. I would think so, but why do you say that?
A.R. You were asked here, were you not?
J.T. Yes, I was invited to be at these meetings and I had therefore to decide whether I had any commission in coming here, because the idea is commission. It is not simply that a brother is taking on something of himself, but is he commissioned? The Lord had a commission; He was sent. The word 'sent' means a commission, that you are given something to do. I must decide whether I have anything to convey to the brethren; it is not a mere matter of the meeting, it is a question of whether there is any commission in those who are carrying on the service, whether we can say God is in it, whether the works of God are being manifested in it.
C.T. Do we see great intelligence in this man after he does wash? He is able to answer them and says, "A man called Jesus made mud". Is it the intelligence of a man who is now growing?
J.T. Well, that is the next thing, the remarkable intelligence that is brought about by conversation and questioning. His intelligence is brought out by questioning; he is not volunteering. "The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was sitting and begging? Some said, It is he; others said, No, but he is like him: *he* said, It is I". That is to say, he is identifying himself as the man in question. Somebody is in question for good or for
{335}
evil and he is identifying himself as the man. He is an out-and-out transparent man; he is ready to answer the questions and he is favourable to the Lord in answering. He has the truth in his heart, he is a believer. He is consciously benefiting by the service of the Lord Jesus.
Ques. Would that be like the end of @Romans 7, "*I myself*", the man identifying himself?
J.T. Well, he is identifying himself there; it is the inner reaction of the word: "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?", @Romans 7:24.
L. Is the first thing that comes to light what the neighbours make out of it?
J.T. Well, that is the thing. What we want to see now is what comes out of an honest brother, a man in cross-questioning and criticism, because criticism is very common among us and in a certain sense it is wholesome. We want to see what comes out of it and how a man stands his ground and witnesses to Christ.
C.H.H. In verse 11 he says, "I saw", but in verse 15 he says, "I see", and then again in verse 25 he says, "I see". Would that mean that it was not only historical but continuous in the process?
J.T. Just so. I think he is considering the neighbours too. We have to consider the questioners, who they are, whether they are morally right, whether they are morally entitled to be questioners. There is honest questioning so that the truth comes out here as a result. The first question is that of the neighbours, and then the Pharisees question; but when the Pharisees question he says, "I see". When the neighbours question he says, "I saw", it is merely a historical matter; but when the Pharisees question it is moral, they are not reliable, just as in the beginning of chapter 8. There the Pharisees question to get something to accuse the Lord of. So it is here
{336}
with the Pharisees, as always, the questioning is not reliable, it is not transparent. We have to decide whether questioning is really transparent or whether it is dishonest.
C.H.H. I was only noticing that it is put in the present tense in verse 7, "and came seeing", and then in reply he says, "I saw". Then to the Pharisees he says, "I see".
J.T. "Came seeing" is a historical fact, and then he says, "I saw", meaning that he is honest about it, he has actually gone through it experimentally. Finally the Pharisees want to know about it and he says, "I see", not that he "came seeing", as if he said, I see now, I can show that I am cured; you can see that I am cured, I can read a book to show it. He is an honest man in his confession.
C.H.H. Is it anything like what Peter said to the Lord, "Thou knowest all things", @John 21:17 as though there was something in him that could be seen?
J.T. Quite so, you are referring to the last chapter of John. Peter challenges the question really; the Lord allows it. Peter has to say to the Lord, *You* can see that I am honest about it, that I love you. That is the idea, the Lord could see that Peter loved Him.
R.W.S. The work of God can thus be tested in any environment and be found to be the work of God. Is not this man therefore a model to us? It is not hard among ourselves as meeting here to act like christians and speak of these things; but at home or at the office or the shop or school -- it is in these circumstances where the reality of the work of God is brought out.
J.T. That is very good. The outside confession is very important in persons seeking fellowship, as we use the word. How can you tell about them? We have had persons we were not sure about. Sometimes you cannot be sure whether a person has the
{337}
Spirit, for instance, or there are other things in which we are tested. This chapter therefore is of great importance as to persons seeking fellowship, whether we can be sure that they are really christians, that they have the Spirit of God and are constituted fit for the assembly. That is what enters into this chapter.
J.K. The man is able to say what the Lord has done and then he is also able to say what he himself has done, so that in that way he brings forward the fact that he has moved in obedience, does he not? "A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw".
J.T. Very good.
J.R.H. Do you attach any moral significance to the washing?
J.T. Only that it is a matter of carrying out the Lord's wish.
J.R.H. It is a matter of the obedience of faith.
J.T. That is right, that is just what it is. Then we have to pursue the subject as we have it in verse 13. "They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees. Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put mud upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. Some of the Pharisees therefore said, This man is not of God, for he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man perform such signs? And there was a division among them. They say therefore again to the blind man, What dost thou say of him, that he has opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight, until they had called the parents of him that had received sight. And they asked them saying, This is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind: how then does he now see? His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his eyes we do not know. *He* is of age: ask *him*; he will speak concerning himself. His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed him to be the Christ, he should be excommunicated from the synagogue. On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask *him*".
{338}
Now what we have already said is plainly stated in this passage, and it brings out the idea of the man's wisdom in answering the questions of the Pharisees. He says, "I see"; as if he would say, It is not simply that a certain thing happened to me historically, but you can see that it is in me too; you can see that my eyes are capable of enabling me to see. So that all that is confirmed in the passage up to verse 23 and then we have in verse 24, "They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful. He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I know, that, being blind before, now I see. And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how opened he thine eyes? He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear: why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his disciples?". Well now, what strikes me is what a product this man is becoming, what a suitable person for the service of God and the companionship of the Lord's people! He is a man to be relied upon as suitable for fellowship, and ready to go on to anything the Lord proposes to him.
Rem. He is bearing testimony now.
J.T. Quite so, he is bearing testimony and the result shows that he is suffering for it and ready to suffer for it.
{339}
C.T. In bearing testimony is there the thought of reproach attached to it? "They railed at him".
J.T. That is what comes out. "They railed at him"; that is suffering. They said to him, "Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses". What a boast that is, an empty boast! How easily that sort of thing comes out in the service of the Lord in our local meetings! So it goes on in verse 29, "We know that God spoke to Moses; but as to this man, we know not whence he is. The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a wonderful thing, that *ye* do not know whence he is, and he has opened mine eyes". So that we are now in the presence of the Lord Jesus, and this man is true to the truth he has received so far. He is going to be a full disciple of the Lord Jesus, a *full* believer.
S.McC. In chapter 8 we had the thought of the truth setting free and the Son making free. Do we have both things in this man, the truth as you are now referring to it and the knowledge of it setting him free so that he is aggressive even in the presence of his adversaries, and then comes under the bands of the Son?
J.T. Do you not think the man is in the making, you might say? We have so many different angles by which to view the persons in whom God is working. This man is in the making and what is happening to him is the Outcome of examination, of criticism and suffering and he is true to the light he has. Therefore he is one we can commit ourselves to fully, and we are very much in need of men like this who stand by the truth as they have experienced it. Finally the Lord challenges him. He is cast out before that, that is, a brother is ready to go as far as that, ready to be cast out, to be excommunicated as it were from the fellowship he is connected with; he is ready for that, and then the Lord finds him.
{340}
A.B. The parents more than once say, "We do not know", whereas the man keeps to the point, "One thing I know". He is holding things rightly, so that development comes in relative to that "one thing", does it not?
J.F. What would be the significance of the man saying, "We know", in verse 31?
J.T. That is, you might say, the 'we' of experience, the dignity of knowledge by experience. There is such a thing as the outcome of experience. He uses the word 'we' not 'I' because it is common; that is to say, what he says is an axiom. "The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a wonderful thing, that *ye* do not know whence he is, and he has opened mine eyes". There is a man really affected, like the little maid in Naaman's house, a man affected by the truth. He goes on, "But we know that God does not hear sinners" (that is the 'we know' that I am enlarging on), "but if anyone be God-fearing and do his will", (that is the point of the chapter) "him he hears. Since time was, it has not been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind. If this man were not of God he would be able to do nothing. They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out". That is, he is a sufferer for the truth. You might say he is a martyr for the truth. That "they cast him out" was a very serious thing among the Jews. Now the next thing is how the Lord is governed by this action, and how fellowship takes place, how he is brought into the flock of chapter 10.
H.B. They use the word 'thou' to him quite frequently. Is he acquiring a distinctive personality through all this?
J.W.W. Does the consistency of his testimony involve the admission. "Thou art his disciple"?
{341}
Then the Lord Jesus taking him on says, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?".
J.T. The Lord is taking him on as sincere, which of course He Himself was, infinitely so. He is taking him on, and what the Lord must have felt about it! The man himself is affected by the truth; he is like the girl in Naaman's house; he was affected by the truth. He uses the words, "a wonderful thing". But then the Lord is waiting for all that, He waits for the man to be cast out. He waits for us to suffer, to be martyred; though there are very few martyrs for the truth, but the Lord is waiting for them. If there is anyone ready to be a martyr, He is waiting for you, to dignify you, to glorify you; that is the next thing. "Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, ..." The 'thou' is emphasised, it is definite. The Lord thinks of this man as a man to be spoken to definitely, so that the pronoun is to be made very definite.
A.B.P. Have some of our brethren been tested on this line in regard to the union? The naming of the name of the Lord and the expression of conscience has meant that they have been put out of employment in some cases. The Lord would take them on as suffering for the testimony, would you say?
J.T. That is the idea. There were eighteen of them in New York the other day who were retaining their place in the union in spite of the truth, disregarding the truth. They were brought down to ten, that is to say, God had wrought with them. I suppose the Lord had said to them, Thou, art thou to be affected by this? And I believe those eight who were saved were affected. Now He says to this man, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?". That is the challenge. Do you want to continue on in the union and disregard the fellowship, the enjoyment of the fellowship? That is what they were
{342}
doing, but some of them relented and came back and have been restored so far. So now the next point is to show how this man is brought into the fold, or into the flock as I might say. It is a question of the Son of God, of a bold confession of the Son of God.
C.T. Does he then answer as a man under subjection? "And who is he, Lord?": is that a man under subjection now?
J.T. He discerns the Lord's proposal; he discerns what the Lord is about to say, so to speak. He says, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" that is, that I may go the whole length of the truth, and the Lord sees that. "And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he". He is the One you want! The 'he' is emphasised, as the 'I' was when He spoke to the woman in chapter 4, "I who speak to thee am he", @John 4:26. Here He says to this man, "He that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord".
J.F. Would that be the answer to the man's saying, "It is I", in verse 10? He identified himself with the testimony and then the Lord said to him, "He that speaks with thee is he". He identifies himself with the One who is doing the work of God.
J.T. Just so, and he is ready for it; the man is ready for what the Lord is going to say to him, and the Lord says to him, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he". It is not like the 'He' that we get in Isaiah, "I [am] HE", @Isaiah 43:13 this is just the identification of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God. The word 'He' in Isaiah is a title of the Deity, a title of God, but this is simply that the Lord is disclosing Himself happily and freely and joyously to this man who is a believer.
P. You have been mentioning the thought of the Lord receiving this man into the flock; but then I suppose there would be the thought of retaining such a one. I was thinking of those affected by the
{343}
union; it is a question of retaining them for the fellowship. David subjected Ittai to a test, but he would not have any fear of losing him, nor would Naomi of losing Ruth.
J.T. You used the word 'retaining'. What is in your mind?
P. I was thinking of the brothers in the New York area. They had been received some time prior to the union matter, but it was a question of retaining them when the test came.
J.T. You mean it is a question of keeping them in fellowship in the proper sense? Quite so, that is what we are aiming to do and we reduced them to ten from eighteen and we hope to reduce them more, to keep them.
R.W.S. Is there something distinctive in confessing the Son of God as over against, shall we say, confessing the name of Jesus? Is there some feature that attaches to that title?
J.T. There is; we are on a higher level than the mere confession of Jesus, it is a question of the Son of God. The idea of confessing the Son of God is spoken of in John's epistle. "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?", @1 John 5:5. That is a great matter; we are on a higher level than the mere confession of Jesus, it is a question of the Son of God. It is a victorious matter and we want to be in the victory. The word is, "Thanks to God, who gives us the victory", @1 Corinthians 15:57 and the victory is the confession of the son of God. The question is whether we are all in that confession, not simply that we are believers in Jesus, but the confession of the Son of God is the point we are at now.
Ques. Does that go beyond the confession of Jesus as Lord?
J.T. It does. The title 'Son of God' gives the dignity that belongs to Him, the One whom God has
{344}
chosen, and the confession of Him as the Son of God is the victory, there is victory in it. "He is the true God and eternal life", @1 John 5:20 we are told, to complete the matter.
A.R. Do John's epistles suggest that you are fit for another world?
J.T. Well, I think they do. It is a question of sonship, God is bringing many sons to glory where glory is; it is a question of the glory that is in mind here. We shall see in chapter 10 that it implies the flock, being brought into the flock.
W.Wo. He becomes a worshipper here, does he not?
J.T. He does. That is just what it says, he comes into the service of God and is a worshipper.
J.R.H. This seems to fill out what it says in chapter 20, "These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God", @John 20:31. You referred to chapter 4 where we have a person believing that He is the Christ, and here we have one believing that He is the Son of God. How would you compare the two?
J.T. Well, it is to show how the work of God is progressing amongst us. If we are confessing the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, we belong to another world really; we are fit for it.
R.W.S. If any one of us is challenged, should we not discriminate as to how we will confess the Lord Jesus? Would not the opposition indicate the kind of testimony we should render, whether we should confess Him as Saviour or as Lord or as Christ or as Son of God? Does not this testimony seem peculiarly designed against the Pharisaical world?
J.T. I think, we might reserve that for a future reading. You are raising a question that implies the power we ought to have of distinguishing divine Persons, who it is that is speaking or being spoken
{345}
to; and that is a very big subject. It will come in later in relation to the Spirit.
C.H.H. Is the process in this chapter necessary in order to come into Paul's line and understand the assembly?
J.T. We shall have to wait for your question too. It will come in later. It is a question of distinguishing divine Persons.
{346}
READINGS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL (3)
@John 10:1 - 42
J.T. Questions were raised yesterday as to sonship, and the thought is that it should come up now, taking it from the end of chapter 9. The subject of sonship enters into chapter 10 because it bears on the question of sheep.
C.H.H. Does this section pass over from what is individual to what is collective? Sheep would be collective.
J.T. Clearly so; the word implies that. The chapter opens, "Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, *he* is a thief and a robber; but he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter opens". The term 'porter' here, without any allusion to a name or the person of the porter, applies to some secret power which is probably the Spirit. It is a question of opening to the shepherd. In verse 35 of chapter 9 it says, "Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?", @John 9:35. That is to say, the question is put to him directly as to whether he believes on the Son of God. The first 'thou' is emphatic, as if the Lord would probe the man and direct his thoughts to Himself: "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?". The time had come for this and the man is ready for it. So he says immediately, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage", @John 9:36 - 38. The Lord has been leading up to this and this man is ready for it. He says, "I believe, Lord". It has entered into his soul, into the whole make-up of his being; the Lord would henceforth be before him as the Son of God.
{347}
S.P. Is this believing on a higher level than Peter's believing in chapter 6, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God"? @John 6:69.
J.T. It is parallel, I would think. Peter implies something that he had known, it had been experimental with Peter and with the other disciples. It says that "from that time many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him. Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Will ye also go away?" as if the Lord was challenging them. "Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God", @John 6:66 - 69. That is, they had experimentally entered into what He was, but Peter does not use the word 'Son'; it is "holy one"; it is a priestly thought. I suppose we might say that sonship would underlie it but it is on another line; it is really a priestly thought in chapter 6. The Lord was the Holy One; the twelve had it in their minds, at least the eleven had, that He was this, He was the Holy One. The sheep here must be regarded as corresponding, only that it is a more general thought; chapter 6 contemplates the twelve, the apostles or disciples, as having official status. The Lord intended to confirm that too.
S.McC. In verse 2 it says, "But he that enters in by the door" in contrast to him that mounts up elsewhere. Would the entering in by the door set out the legal way in which the Lord came into the position involved here, as, for instance, Matthew sets out in the genealogy that the Lord came in in the legal way? I am using the word 'legal' in the sense of what is right and proper.
J.T. "He that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, *he* is a thief and a robber; but he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep"; that is to say, the Lord alludes to Himself, He is the shepherd of the
{348}
sheep. But then, "To him the porter opens". Is that what is in your mind?
S.McC. I was wondering if the coming in by the door is an allusion to the Lord's manhood, the way He came into the position; and whether the porter opening would suggest the Spirit signalising Him, as it were, in His entrance upon it.
J.T. Therefore intelligence had already come up somewhere as to who the Lord was. Who had that intelligence? I think what is in mind is the twelve, not Judas, but the twelve; they already had the intelligence as to His Person and He is entitled to enter in at the door as the Shepherd of the sheep. He would be, as Mary would put it, "Rabboni", which means 'My Teacher'; He is entitled to that. Such a one would say, I know His history, I know who He is and that He is entitled to the place; He is the One we can trust as our Teacher, as our Shepherd. It would raise the whole question as to what is current around us in the way of educational institutions with a view to qualifying persons who have to say to divine things. We have no status. When I say, 'we', I mean those who seek to walk in the truth. We have no status at all except in the sense that the Lord gives us a status; the Holy Spirit is operating amongst us and gives us some understanding of the Person we are dealing with. So it was with Peter's remark, "To whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and know that thou art the holy one of God", @John 6:69. But here the porter is more formal, "To him the porter opens"; we do not get that in chapter 6 but we get it here. The porter is evidently an unknown person but he is known spiritually. Does that meet with your exercise?
S.McC. It is very interesting -- your reference to the hidden side of service in the porter. One would
{349}
like more help as to the way in which the porter opens.
J.T. Well, that becomes a very interesting inquiry. I think we should approach it now simply, including the thought of sonship, because the idea of sonship is earlier: "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him", @John 1:18. The preposition 'in' signifies that He has entered into that position. That is not what He was eternally; He has entered into it.
J.T.Jr. Are you looking then at the matter as it is, with the Lord in heaven and the porter as representing the Spirit here, having come down at Pentecost? There is an order of things that the porter will recognise.
J.T. I think so; there is some intelligence about it. We have referred to chapter 6, but then I am going back further to chapter 1 as to "the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father", @John 1:18. How did He get there? Now chapter 10 raises this whole question as to how He got there and whether He is entitled to be opened to, whether He is entitled to a place such as we are in this afternoon without any official position outside at all. There is no official here, there are no formally constituted elders; we are here because of intelligence that we have, that we have acquired in some way, maybe in our houses and among our families; but we have acquired it in some sense. The porter is opening to us; that is, he opens the door to persons like ourselves because we belong to the sheep.
S.McC. Do you see any link in principle with the word of John the baptist, "He who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God"? @John 1:33. Is there a link in principle there?
{350}
J.T. I think there is a very strong link. That is the way John approaches the subject, I mean the apostle John, the writer of this book. The Spirit is in mind, but He is a dove; He descends like a dove upon the Lord, but He identifies Him as the One who baptises with the Holy Spirit.
J.R.H. John states that in connection with the Lord being manifested to Israel. Is that the idea of the fold in the first place, this being manifested to Israel bringing the Lord into view as to the place that is proper to Him?
J.T. You are quoting from @John 1, "I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water. And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water", that is to say, God, "*he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God", @John 1:33,34. So that there it is clearly stated, this is the Son of God. What He is is indicated clearly and John bears witness to it; that is, John is formally the forerunner of Christ in that sense. That passage enters into this position we are in now, as to sonship and how we apprehend it and how the Lord is known amongst us -- at least I believe He is known -- as the Shepherd. We know Him as the Shepherd and the Spirit makes the way clear for Him to have the place of our Teacher.
A.R. When you speak of sonship have you in mind that there is only one Son in this gospel?
J.T. That is right. The sonship of Christ is made very much of in John's writings, more than in those of any other of the evangelists.
A.R. We are only sheep in this chapter.
{351}
J.T. Well, just so. Another thing that comes up is that responsibility is not stressed in regard of sheep, showing that we are the objects of care.
C.T. Verse 4, "When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them"; is that the thought of care that you are bringing in?
J.T. "When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice of strangers". That is, we are not going to be carried away by any person who pretends to have something from God, and there is much of this abroad in christendom; we are not going to follow any such persons. We want to be assured that He is the Shepherd and then we know His voice, meaning that there is a work of God in us whereby we know His voice, the voice of the Shepherd.
J.R.H. In @John 9:34 the blind man is cast out. The word 'cast out' is the same as 'put forth' in verse 4 of chapter 10. You were speaking of being outside of the ecclesiastical system, and the man's being cast out is really the outcome of the work of God showing itself in him. But the Lord takes it on Himself here: "When he has put forth all his own".
J.T. The idea is that the sheep are detached from the whole Jewish system. We get a status here that is of prime importance; we have this place with the Lord and we know His voice. We do not know the voice of strangers and that saves us from all impostors, from all misleading persons.
S.McC. The Spirit having come in as He has, into a position where He is serving in the economy, would it be right to think that this word, "To him the porter opens", would apply in a meeting like this?
{352}
That is, to such as these the Spirit is active in opening.
J.T. The unknown person called the porter is conversant with the sheep. He has them in mind and then they know the voice of the Shepherd. Therefore the porter recognises both. He is conversant with the sheep and he is conversant with the Shepherd, so that we are saved with what John brings out here; we are saved from impostors in christianity. There are about one hundred religions, so-called, in christendom and we do not want any of them but what is indicated in this chapter.
C.H.H. Would the words that He "leads them out" imply that He was outside Himself?
J.T. I would think so, except that we cannot go too far in dissociating the Lord Jesus from judaism, from among the Jews; and yet that may be what is in mind in John's writings -- to dissociate the saints from judaism entirely, basing everything on the Shepherd and the Shepherd's voice and the ears of the sheep knowing His voice. Therefore the position is certain; our position is certain on these lines.
S.P. Would you say that the porter is in holy, sympathetic accord with the One He opens to and with the sheep too?
J.T. That is the idea. There is perfect consonance between the porter, whoever he may be -- and I would say it is the Spirit of God, without stressing it -- and the Shepherd. He is in accord with the Shepherd and with the sheep so that we are on right grounds, on 2 Timothy, separation, grounds, and we can go forward. We have fellowship, we have assembly status so to speak, and we are in touch with the Lord and with each other in assembly.
Ques. Would you say that in leading them out of the fold He does not establish another idea as to a fold? It says, "There shall be one flock, one shepherd", but there is no thought of another fold.
{353}
J.T. Quite so.
A.R. Do you mean that if christians in the systems around us allowed the Spirit to operate they would be delivered from them?
J.T. They would if they were sincere. They may be deceived, of course, and allowance has to be made for deception in a certain sense; but if we are all sincere, this is the ground we should be on, on the ground of the sheep and the Shepherd; in other words the ground of Christ and the assembly.
J.T.Jr. The porter would be disregarded around; He is not recognised. Much is made of the Lord's name but there is no recognition of the porter.
J.T. That is what I believe enters into this chapter. It is of prime importance that we should pursue this and seek to reach the truth of Christ and the assembly and to understand that the Spirit is operating. Room is made for Him.
A.R. Would what Mr. Darby said about sinning against the Holy Ghost be confirmed in what you are saying?
J.T. You refer to his book: *The Notion of a Clergyman: Dispensationally the Sin against the Holy Ghost*. We are saved from that by the tenth of John.
E.A.L. In @Romans 8:27 it says, "But he who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit", @Romans 8:27. Would you say that that stresses the unity of thought between the Lord and the Spirit?
J.T. Just so, He knows the mind of the Spirit. He makes intercession for the saints according to God.
E.A.L. In connection with what you have been saying about the porter and the Lord, the Lord says, "I am the door"; the door is personalised and the porter is a person, so we see that between these two Persons there is great unison of thought.
J.T. The whole chapter stresses that position. And the great result of @Romans 8 to which you have
{354}
referred is in verses 38,39: "For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities ... shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord", @Romans 8:38,39.
J.F. Is it true that in christendom men assume the place of porter and exclude Paul's ministry in that way?
J.T. Just so, officialism does that; and what has just been remarked is that the notion of a clergyman is dispensationally the sin against the Holy Ghost; dispensationally, if the brethren can take that in. The phraseology is most decided and clear.
R.W.S. Is not this just the time when we need the current ministry as to the Lord as Shepherd, and as to His Father as He speaks of Him in verse 15, and as to the porter because of the thieves and robbers and strangers which you are suggesting would involve the apostate condition?
J.T. Quite so, and I am sure all go with the suggestions that we should be clear of mere denominationalism and clericalism without mentioning names; that we should be clear of all that, and should be in the consciousness of the operations of the Spirit and the position of Christ as Head of the assembly in heaven; that is, His position in heaven and the Holy Spirit's position here. The whole matter is as clear as it can be; it is the ground the Bible is on, and it is the ground we shall be on if we allow the Lord to be with us until He comes for us. It is a question for each one to challenge his heart as to this matter of the sheep and the Shepherd because we need to see how love comes into the matter. We come very near to the thought of Christ and the assembly in this section in the terms sheep and Shepherd, because the Lord moves on to the idea of the Father and Himself and that He has received a commandment from the Father to lay down His life for the sheep. It is a question of the position of a Person having a commission,
{355}
being in the position of having a commission under God's authority and guidance in what He is doing.
S.McC. In 1929 there was a distinctive feature of the truth brought before us as to our Lord's sonship, and the saints were saved from division in relation to that recovered feature of the truth. Would you look at that as in a way an activity of the porter in opening, both in relation to the Person of Christ and to the saints?
J.T. I think what we said about @John 1 enters into that. The question was whether the Lord was Son eternally; the assertion was that He was Son before He became Man; or whether He became Son and entered into the position of Son in becoming Man.
S.McC. I was thinking of how the line of demarcation between those holding the truth and the ecclesiastical system became more defined because of what was held in the creeds.
J.T. Just so. So that in @Proverbs 8 where it speaks of wisdom as a person it was said that it was the Lord Himself; whereas the truth is that wisdom is a *thing* and it is to be so regarded in @Proverbs 8. @John 1 indicates that in wisdom's way the Lord has come in incarnation into the position of sonship. So that the whole matter of ecclesiasticism has to be refused and the Lord given His place as Head of the assembly, and the saints are to be viewed as the assembly. That is the principle we are on. If we are rightly in fellowship, that is where we are.
J.W.W. Is there a link with @John 21 where the Lord is commissioning Peter? In His commission He says, "Feed my lambs", "Shepherd my sheep", @John 21:15,17.
J.T. That was the point in chapter 21. The Lord said to Peter, "Lovest thou me more than these?", @John 21:15. 'These', of course, would be the other disciples; the conclusion was therefore that if Peter had a position
{356}
like that, then he was to "Feed my lambs", and "Shepherd my sheep", @John 21:15,17. That is the position that was left to Peter, and that of course has to be taken up now by ourselves, by anyone who is seeking to serve the Lord's people. It is a question of Christ's sheep and lambs.
Ques. Would you include @Acts 20 in this subject, referring to the Holy Spirit setting certain persons over the assembly? Paul says, "Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers, to shepherd the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own", @Acts 20:28. And then the apostle designates certain persons as "grievous wolves", @Acts 20:29.
J.T. That is the ground that Paul took as coming into the service. Have you something else in your mind?
Ques. I wanted to know how it relates to what we have in @John 20.
J.T. Well, of course it corresponds with all that we have as to John and Paul. John, you might say, did not have a ministry; Paul was the minister of the assembly. He had the mystery. John did not have that. Paul had the ministry of the assembly and laboured to present every man perfect in Christ; that was his line, a very great line; and John supports that in his gospel and in his epistles.
R.W.S. It is in 1 Samuel that David returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem; and then when he went to meet Goliath he rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with the keeper. We have had somewhere the suggestion that the keeper there is the Holy Spirit. Does that link on with what we have in this chapter?
J.T. That would be right, I suppose, as a type. David's brother chided him with seeking to come to see the battle but David says, "What have I now done? Is there not a cause?", @1 Samuel 17:29. There was a cause.
{357}
He had left his sheep with the keeper; he was in charge of the sheep but he left them with the keeper. Is that in your mind?
R.W.S. Yes. I thought it very affecting that the Spirit might be regarded in that way, not only as a porter but as the keeper too.
J.T. You can see how the blessed Spirit is here to do anything, so to say, that the sheep need, anything the assembly needs. He is here to do that. "He will give you another Comforter", @John 14:16 the Lord says, and that Comforter is the Holy Spirit. He also said, "Ye know him"; @John 14:17 the Lord assumed that they knew Him, and I believe that is supported by this chapter.
A.R. Is that involved in verse 10 where He says, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly"?
J.T. Just so, showing the full thought of His coming, that He had that in mind.
A.H. I would like to ask in regard to verse 6, "This allegory spoke Jesus to them, but they did not know what it was of which he spoke to them", Is the service of the Spirit engaging us now with the unfolding of what is hidden? There is much in the Scriptures in parables which we are having unfolded; for instance, in Ezekiel, much that is being opened up to us.
J.T. I would say so. We are looking at Ezekiel in New York just from that standpoint and we are greatly helped with it because the Spirit of God is made so much of in it. The prophet says the Spirit spoke with him; and in chapters 36 and 37 we have the idea of the Spirit's activities and the truth seems to be opened up to us. We have found the book of Ezekiel of peculiar importance in the light of what we have now as to the Spirit of God as One to be named, to be addressed in service.
{358}
J.R.H. In your reference to @John 14 where the Lord says, "Ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you", @John 14:17 was there a recognition on the part of the disciples that the Spirit was there in the Lord Jesus Himself, and in the power of His ministry?
J.T. I think they must have come to know that as we follow the truth as to the Lord's association with His own. And if we continue to follow the truth we shall see that the Spirit is known amongst the saints. The Spirit is known. We ought to be able to say in some sense that we know the Spirit as we know the Lord Jesus because the thought of knowledge applies to Both.
A.R. Does the thought of porter suggest Him objectively?
J.T. That is what it would amount to. He is outside by Himself; He is there to guide us into all the truth and so forth. But then there is the Son as well and in chapter 8 He says, "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free", @John 8:36. Sonship comes out in the teaching we have had.
W.L. Would you say that the thought of the porter was peculiarly in relation to the setting up of christianity, and peculiarly in relation to the fold rather than to the one flock and the one Shepherd?
J.T. Well, I think flock and Shepherd are more suited to our position. Allusion has been made to @Acts 20, and the saints at Ephesus who were elders; they were to take care of the flock in which the Holy Spirit had made them overseers. The Spirit had made them overseers.
A.B.P. The Lord refers to the Father's hand as though it were a place of protection. Does that supersede the fold? "No man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand", @John 10:29 a place of security.
J.T. That is the idea. We have often dwelt on that word 'security'; that is, we are in the hands of
{359}
the Son and in the hands of the Father. The Son's hand is powerful, of course, but the Father's is in a sense more powerful; I mean that is the way the thing is taken up in the economy. The Father is greater than all and no one can pluck them out of His hand, so that our position is secure, infinitely secure.
A.B.P. And very personal and intimate.
J.T. Just so. Very beautiful that it is so, that it is personal. Our relations are with Christ personally and with the Father Himself, and the assumption in all this is that we know the Spirit of God. We know Him in a personal sense. It is not easy to point out how it is so in the case of any one of us; at the same time this chapter proves that it is so -- that the Spirit is to be known, that the Father is to be known, and the Son is to be known.
Rem. What we have here as to the Spirit opening the door, the porter, is of great importance. I think even now the Spirit is bringing the deep things of God to us.
J.T. That opens up the whole question as to where the door is, what we are led into, and is it not into eternity? Are we not proceeding to eternity? The lines we are on are leading in that direction and the knowledge of divine Persons is involved in all that we are saying: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all engaged in this and it is to lead us, that is to say the assembly, into eternity. Wonderful, I think it is, to be able to see it thus! It is well worth looking into. It is important that each one of us here today should challenge our hearts as to what we are in, as to whether we are going on to eternity. That is a wonderful thought, that we are going on to that; and we are being led into the light of it and nourished in it, kept in it, in view of each saint being preserved in the assembly.
{360}
A.B. In your reference to 2 Timothy bearing on what you are saying, Paul says in chapter 1, "For I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him"; @2 Timothy 1:12 and then later, "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted", @2 Timothy 1:14. And your reference to chapter 2 in relation to the overthrow of the faith of some says that "the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his", @2 Timothy 2:19.
J.T. That is very good, that we have such an opening up at this time. Although we use the word 'assembly' and the words 'local meeting' and 'local assembly' and so forth, these are just terms that apply provisionally to the present time; but it is all with the view to the final thought which is eternity. We are going on to that, nothing less than that; as we often used to sing,
<blockquote>'We're travelling home to heaven above. <br>Will you go, will you go?'</blockquote>
That is all simple, and we are well taken care of in that the three divine Persons are occupied with us, taking care of each of us.
F.E.S. Would you say a little as to the thought of "I am the door" in that connection?
J.T. It is a question of the Person of Christ, what He is Himself. We are dealing with eternal things, and the terms used are just for convenience, but the point is that we are going on to eternity. If it be a question of God's house, well, God's house in the greater sense is eternity. It is the universe really, immediately and physically; but in the greater sense it is eternity. It is a question of eternal things and we are going on to that.
F.E.S. Would it add to the thought of security to which you have been referring in that as having passed through that door we are in the realm of divine security?
{361}
J.T. Just so. The word 'security' is, of course, useful to younger people, although we are all glad to use it; but that is the position. How great it is too!
J.L.P. Would it be the opened door which no one can shut?
J.T. Well, that is just what it is. That is in Revelation.
R.W.S. In verse 3 the sheep "hear his voice" and in verse 4 they "know his voice". In view of entering our eternal conditions, fixed conditions, is it important that we should discriminate between the voice of the Father, the voice of the Son, and the voice of the Spirit?
J.T. That is just what came into mind yesterday, whether we might not be led on to those lines in view of chapter 14, as to distinguishing or discerning the voices of the divine Persons, and who is speaking. I do not know that any of us would undertake to say we can do that, but it is perfectly clear that it is knowable, because it says, "Ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you", @John 14:17.
C.A.M. "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me". Are you stressing the idea of following into eternal conditions, especially because we are viewing the saints as a flock in their present condition?
J.T. Yes, it is in our present conditions, such as we are in today. We are getting near now in a collective sense to eternal conditions. This is the first day of the week and we have had the Lord's supper; the first day of the week ought to afford these conditions to us; we should look forward to them on the first day of the week. It is a peculiar day; it has a peculiar place. It is called the Lord's day but John also says it is the first day of the week, showing that the weekly position is the one that is in mind; it is not a question of the moon, the monthly position, but of the week, the seven days of the week.
{362}
F.K.C. In relation to your suggestion that the voices are knowable, it says in @Acts 8 that the Spirit spoke to Philip; and Peter said the Spirit spoke to him; and Ezekiel says the Spirit spoke with him; and Paul said the Lord said certain things to him; as if these persons knew exactly who was speaking to them.
J.T. That is very good. We often try to reach the idea of divine Persons and to know Their Name, to know the Persons speaking; but I think the Lord is intending now to bring the thing out for us. The Holy Spirit being brought before us so prominently is to make way for it, because He is the One who looks after all these matters. He is in charge, so to speak, of all these matters. The Lord is enabling us to make way for Him; and I think He is enabling us, therefore, to make way for eternal things, a system of eternal things.
Ques. Would you say verse 9 is the enjoyment of eternal conditions?
J.T. "I am the door: if anyone enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture". The idea of salvation is first and then going in and out and finding pasture: that is pretty much eternal things. But what is opened up to us on the first day of the week? I believe the first day of the week is intended for it, and the term is used in @Acts 20 when the disciples came together to break bread and Paul discoursed a long time. We know there is a lot to say about it, and we are trying to say some of the things today, as we always do at these special meetings. The three days seem to be the Lord's way of giving opportunity to open up these things.
C.T.Jr. Our knowledge of the Shepherd in verses 14 and 15 is linked with the knowledge the Son has of the Father and the Father of the Son. Would you help us on that?
{363}
J.T. That shows that we are coming near to eternal conditions, coming near to where the Father and Son are conversing together. They are moving together, but the Spirit is not mentioned here by name; but we know that He must be here and the porter, I believe, refers to Him. He is a person who looks after the sheep and knows them, and He knows the Shepherd as well and puts the sheep and the Shepherd together.
S.McC. In regard to the Spirit's voice, it has often been said that it must be through someone. But is it right to limit it in that way? The Father's voice spoke from heaven. The Spirit may speak directly, do you think?
J.T. I think the Lord is saying to us that there are higher levels for us to reach; I think we can say we know there are higher levels available to us.
S.McC. We are seeking help as to this matter of the Spirit's voice. The Spirit spoke to Philip, but there was no other vessel present. The voice must have been heard by Philip; he discerned it. The same is true of Peter.
J.T. You just wonder about it, whether we have been too careless about the truth, assuming that we know it but we really do not know it. There are higher levels that we have not touched.
A.R. It says in @Acts 10, "But as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him ...", @Acts 10:19. Earlier Peter said, "In no wise, Lord", @Acts 10:14 so that he must have spoken directly to the Lord, and the Lord must have spoken directly to Peter.
J.T. Yes, I should like to have a word with Peter about that. We shall have, too, presently.
Ques. The frequent references in Revelation to, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies" -- would that be on individual lines?
{364}
J.T. Yes, it is a question of what the Spirit says, and I believe it refers to all the ministry that is current; I mean what the Spirit is doing, the ministry He is giving to the saints. The Lord says what is formal in the addresses to the assemblies, but there is also what the Spirit says to the assemblies. Perhaps we have not been specific about that. Personally I am very concerned about it, as to whether we are concerned about what the Spirit is saying. What the Lord says is specified, but what the Spirit says is not specified; we have to wait and see what is coming out. What did we have of it in the Middle Ages? Very little; and then protestantism came on, and then the revival, and we are still in it and I believe it is opening up more and more. I think there are higher levels we have not touched.
E.A.L. In @1 Corinthians 12 it says, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit. But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all. But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit. For to one, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12:3 - 8. Then in verse 11, "But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases", @1 Corinthians 12:11. I was thinking that the knowledge: "For to one, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge" @1 Corinthians 12:8 is really what we are seeking before the Lord, that we might have this wisdom and knowledge so that we intelligently take on the truth by the Spirit.
J.T. And so the epistles to Corinth are so instructive. Indeed all these epistles of Paul are opening up the truth of the local assembly. The thought is to come to the local assembly first, and then to be
{365}
enlarged into the wide thought of the universal assembly, and that will open up into eternity presently. It is just a question of waiting for it and being ready for it. So that these epistles are peculiarly instructive as to the local assembly, and the general assembly too. As regards giving, for instance, in @2 Corinthians 8, Paul opens that up. How concerned he was that the poor saints in Jerusalem should have what they needed! And of course that would apply in principle at any time, that the saints should have what they need.
F.E.S. I wanted to ask further as to the thought of the door, whether that would be a precious way in which we are now led into the more intimate side of the knowledge of divine Persons?
J.T. I think that is just what we are trying to say. One is afraid to say too much because one might go beyond one's depth, but I do see that there are higher levels. The word 'level' is a very good one. There are higher levels that we have not touched.
J.T.Jr. Do you think the apostle alluding to the third heaven and paradise would confirm what you are saying?
J.T. Very good, I am glad you mentioned that. Paul says, "I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord", @2 Corinthians 12:1. Then he goes on to say he was caught up to the third heaven, and then he speaks of paradise. Paradise is a place of enjoyment, a place of delights.
J.T.Jr. He heard things; somebody must have been speaking.
J.T. Just so, that is good. He heard things said that "it is not allowed to man to utter", @2 Corinthians 12:4. But they are to be heard anyway; Paul could tell you that. Of course we are at a great loss that we have not Paul and Peter to tell us about these things, but we shall have them. In the meantime we have the Spirit, and if we learn to use Him, so to speak, humbly, we should get these things, because He has everything.
{366}
He is in charge of everything subjectively, and He is here below with us.
J. It was suggested at Galt that John became "in the Spirit"; @Revelation 1:10 that is to say, he already had the Spirit in him, but there came a time when he became "in the Spirit"; and it was suggested that the assembly has reached a point in its history when it has become "in the Spirit". What would you say about that?
J.T. Well, I do not want to be too pretentious. I am just a little afraid of assuming that, but still, what you say is very suggestive. "I became in the Spirit", he says; of course, John had the Spirit, like the others; but he says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", @Revelation 1:10. It is very suggestive that 'the Lord's day' has a place in all this, and 'the first day of the week' too, because John is the one that uses that term especially.
C.T. As to this thought of higher levels, do we find in @Luke 22 the master of the house showing us all things? It says, "And *he* will shew you a large upper room furnished", @Luke 22:12.
J.T. Very good. The master of the house would be suggestive of the Spirit. It is a large upper room and the Lord says, "There make ready", @Luke 22:12. All that is material, but the Spirit of God is not slow to take account of all these things spiritually and provide them for us.
C.T. Do we reach a higher level there, because first we get the man, the master of the house, and then the Lord Himself?
J.T. Very good.
A.B.P. In @Revelation 4 John says, "I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven", @Revelation 4:1. Do you think that in a sense we are beginning to see that door opening up?
J.T. Well, very likely. "A door opened in heaven" is very specific because it is opening into
{367}
something. It is not opening into the millennium exactly, it is opened in heaven. It is a heavenly thing; it is an eternal position and there is a door opened to us.
C.H.H. Is it important to see in @Acts 16 that the porter, the Spirit, closes doors? They attempted to speak, but the Holy Spirit forbade them to speak in Asia. It says that both the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not.
J.T. Well, the mind of God pointed to the west. I believe that is what is in mind, that the mind of God pointed to the west. When I say 'the west' I mean Europe and its outgoings. That was in God's mind and there have been great results, away down to Australia and New Zealand as well as in this country. Therefore the prohibition as to going to the east. The west was in the mind of God and I believe that has continued ever since.
C.H.H. Do you think that opening and closing doors for service is still by the Holy Spirit?
J.T. Quite so. He knows everything; He is in charge of everything in those matters. Of course we all know that the west has opened up, Australia and this country; these undoubtedly were in the mind of God at that time, that Europe was to be opened up and its inhabitants were to spread out and God was to follow them and carry on His work with them.
D.MacD. @Acts 7 speaks of Stephen being full of the Holy Spirit, and he beheld the heavens opened. Is that in keeping with what you have in mind as to higher levels?
J.T. Just so. Stephen is a forerunner, a martyr. "Thy martyr", @Acts 22:20 he is called; he is the only one spoken of in that way and the Lord, as it were, honoured him in doing it. Paul was not yet converted; Stephen was a forerunner, in a sense, of what was in the mind of God to open up through
{368}
Paul, and the truth of the mystery was in mind. The word 'mystery' is not to be forgotten; it is a striking word as applicable to the assembly, and Paul had to do with it. It is Paul's line of things -- the mystery. He finishes with that thought in the epistle to the Romans, his first great epistle. We shall go further on this point and hope to get on to the Spirit in chapter 14.
{369}
READINGS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL (4)
@John 12:1 - 36
J.T. The thought now is to pass on from the idea of sheep to that of a family, a human family, so that we have terms immediately relating to the Father and the Son and the saints; not that the saints themselves are called sons in this connection, but children, because it is a question of family. Sonship is not the point in John's gospel, except in regard to Christ; it is not attributable to ourselves in John's writings save in the book of Revelation. What is applicable to us as in the family is 'children', as the prophecy of Caiaphas says, "Ye know nothing nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish. But this he did not say of himself; but, being high priest that year, prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation; and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad", @John 11:50 - 52. That is prophecy; it is clearly a prophecy because Caiaphas was high priest at that time. It stated that the Lord died not only for the nation but to gather together the children of God scattered abroad, which would include ourselves. Therefore chapter 12 opens up the thought of children, of the family of God. There were three in the family, but it was without a head, you might say, because it consisted of a brother and two sisters, not a father and mother. But the Lord Jesus becomes the Father; He becomes the head of the family. That is in a simple way what is in mind, to pass on to the idea of a family. It says, "Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among the dead. There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him". So
{370}
that it is a resurrection scene, not an ascension scene; and Lazarus represents a risen man. Then there are the services of the sisters, and so Mary comes in and Martha; and then there is the devil's effort to interfere through Judas. But the position is maintained and the Lord is at the table and Lazarus is there who had been dead. The word is really 'the dead Lazarus'; he had really been dead, but he is now alive; so that the position is clearly maintained. Surely it is a matter for us to consider that we belong to a family; not simply that we come in under the figure of sheep -- while that holds as characteristic -- but that it is a question of men. Here it is a family of a man and two women; one of them had been dead and is now alive. It is a question of a person raised from the dead, the principle being the position of the assembly now as we are risen with Christ. We are risen with Christ according to Colossians. In Ephesians we go further.
F.E.S. Is the assembly viewed in John more as the family?
J.T. That is what is in mind; it is not the sons exactly, but the family. It is worked out in the epistles of John, especially the first epistle.
A.R. Is it seen in chapter 21 where the Lord says, "Children, have ye anything to eat?", @John 21:5.
J.T. Just so, they are treated as children; that is to say He takes the fatherly relation to them. But here it is a brother and two sisters and the Lord becomes Head of the family. That position is seen in the last chapter in that He addresses them as children.
J.R.H. The natural relationship does not come into view here as it does in the previous chapter.
J.T. Quite so; the natural relationship is opened up immediately in chapter 11, as it says, "Now there was a certain man sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister. It was the Mary" (notice *the* Mary, she is stressed) "who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick", @John 11:1,2.
{371}
The family relationship is made very clear there.
C.A.M. Would it be right to ask as to the origin of the family idea in John?
J.T. I think it is certainly reserved for the family at Bethany, therefore it has a Jewish setting first. But in chapter 11 it is made plain that it is not for that nation only but for the children of God who are scattered abroad. Therefore the question is who the children of God are. They are scattered abroad, but they are children of God, that is to say the family relation is asserted; but then, who are they? The identity is found in Bethany in these three persons.
C.H.H. @John 1:12 says, "But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God", @John 1:12,13.
J.T. I think that is a good connection. That is the birth, "who have been born", born of God, that is the point in it; that is where the family is seen clearly.
J.F. Would the children of God "scattered abroad" correspond with "I have other sheep"? @John 10:16.
J.T. It would indeed, other sheep "which are not of this fold", showing how accurate John is in regard of the family.
M.O. Would the Holy Spirit help us in relation to the family idea by bearing "witness with our spirit, that we are children of God", @Romans 8:16?
J.T. That is a very good reference. The Spirit of God bears witness with our spirits, a remarkable thing, not simply with us but with our spirits, a highly spiritual thought. "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God";
{372}
that is the general position in John's writings. "What we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", @1 John 3:2. That implies sonship.
A.B.P. Would they be seen here abiding in His word? They seem to be set in their proper place in relation to Him so that I wondered whether the thought of abiding in His word would fit in here. Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with Him, Martha serving and serving acceptably, and Mary at His feet; they are in their proper orbits.
J.T. That is to say there is the sense of responsibility here; it is not in the heavenly position. Every one of us in this meeting today has some place in this setting, brothers or sisters or even children.
J.R.H. In connection with your remark about resurrection ground, does this show that the sphere of eternal life is opened up?
J.T. Well, we have already touched that in connection with the sheep.
C.H.H. Would the children have the Spirit? You might be a son and not have the Spirit, might you not? But could you be of the children and not have the Spirit? In Galatians it says, "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", @Galatians 3:26 and then, "Because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts", @Galatians 4:6.
J.T. Very good, it is a matter of life therefore; sonship in that sense is a matter of life. But at the same time the full thought of sonship requires the Spirit, the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father".
C.H.H. Would that be a subsequent action, so to speak, "because ye are sons"? @Galatians 4:6.
J.T. It is because the light qualifies us, but at the same time it does not give a subjective status. That is to say, we need the Spirit of adoption. You would
{373}
not like to detach the idea of sonship from the Spirit, would you?
C.H.H. No, only I was thinking an individual could be individually a son and not have the Spirit, but you would be open for the development.
J.T. Quite so, and of course the Galatians were in a defective condition really. They had been damaged apparently and the idea of light is to be applied so that they might be set at liberty. Paul says, "Be as *I* am, for *I* also am as *ye*"; @Galatians 4:12 that is to say, Paul was not any different in that sense. In the *light* of things they were sons as he was a son; this presentation of the truth was to set them at liberty at Galatia because the enemy had damaged them.
A.B. Is it your thought that while each of these persons, Lazarus, Martha and Mary, maintains distinctive features, yet there is perfect co-ordination with them relative to the Lord? As you were saying in chapter 11, "That he should also gather together into one"; @John 11:52 the perfect oneness is seen.
J.T. You get a confirmation of that in @Hebrews 2, verse 10, leading up to service in the assembly: "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings. For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", @Hebrews 2:10 - 12. It is a question of the brethren, the family, and how sonship comes into it, that God is leading many sons to glory, and that implies the Spirit. At the same time it follows on with the thought that "he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren"; @Hebrews 2:11 that is, the relation of son is established.
{374}
S.McC. In regard to the children of God, is it a general thought more or does it have a specific place in assembly service? @Hebrews 2 goes on to say, "Behold, I and the children which God has given me", @Hebrews 2:13.
J.T. It is children in the sense of those grown-up; the children are made partakers of flesh and blood. It is in the sense of a grown-up family, but children as partakers of flesh and blood. The Lord took part in the same, so that it is a grown-up idea and a family idea.
S.McC. I was wondering whether the idea of the family of God in this setting would have a certain place in our minds in the beginning of the service on Lord's day morning? The Lord Jesus in @John 13 speaks of them as children; a sense of the restfulness connected with the place we have in divine affections would mark us as sitting down together, would you say?
J.T. Quite so. But the word 'children' is not of course a question of age, it is a full thought as to manhood; that is the idea of it, it is the full thought as to manhood and therefore corresponds with sonship. It corresponds with sonship in Paul.
A.R. Is that seen in John's epistle where he says, "My children"? Does that include grown-ups?
J.T. Quite so. "I write to you, children, because your sins are forgiven you", @1 John 2:12 that is, christians, they are in the full thought of christianity. Then, "I have written to you, young men", @1 John 2:13 a further thought as to growth, and "I write to you, fathers", the lowest and the highest grades spiritually, not simply literally but spiritually.
Rem. It is a matter of generation.
J.T. Exactly.
C.T. Does the thought of the love of the Father in @1 John 3, connected with the children of God, have sonship in view? "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", @1 John 3:1.
{375}
J.T. Yes, but there is more than that about it. "Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested", @1 John 3:2. What is to be manifested I believe implies sonship. "What we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is". I mean to say that when we shall see him, that is the full thought of the divine mind bringing in manhood.
R.W.S. Did you say that the thought of children with John is equal to sons with Paul?
J.T. I think so. The Spirit witnesses with our spirits that we are children of God, but then, that is Paul, and Paul would bring us on to sonship. The idea of derivation is in the children, but distinction is in the sons; the same people regarded in two lights.
R.W.S. I can see then that it is a family setting in John involving children; but with Paul it is sonship. I am enjoying the elevation of children in the family setting as equivalent to sons with Paul.
J.T. Very good.
A.B.P. I wondered if that would be supported in @Romans 8 where the apostle speaks of "the revelation of the sons of God", @Romans 8:19 but he also speaks of "the liberty of the glory of the children of God", @Romans 8:21.
J.T. "The liberty of the glory of the children" would be sonship.
A.B.P. I notice the title of "children of God" in that passage seems to be brought in as collateral with the thought of sonship.
J.T. Well, it is; it is a question of the use of terms to enlarge on the truth, because Paul's line is more sonship than children. John's line is, in the main, children; he hardly ever speaks of sonship except in its application to Christ.
{376}
J.L.P. Would manhood be seen in @John 16 where the woman gives birth to the child, but she rejoices because a man is born into the world? @John 16:21.
J.T. That is a very good point. It is not a child born, but a man born. The woman has joy over it; she forgets her suffering because of manhood, a man being born into the world. And all that must centre in Christ -- the thought of manhood, grown-up men, as @Ephesians 4 says, that we may come to full growth.
J.F. So that children in John's epistle would include the fathers. His first address to them is to 'children': would that include the whole family? "My children, these things I write to you in order that ye may not sin", @1 John 2:1. Then again, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God". @1 John 3:1
J.T. It certainly does, it is the whole family.
J.T.Jr. The babes in Christ alluded to in Corinthians would have some value?
J.T. They were not literally babes, they were young spiritually. They had not developed as quickly as they should have.
J.T.Jr. So he says he has to give them milk.
J.T. They were stunted; they had not come to full age. They had not arrived at manhood.
C.H.H. The notes in the epistle of John show that three words are used for children: one is a diminutive capable of growth, then a diminutive, and then one that is fully developed.
J.T. That all bears out what we are saying.
S.J.H. Do you think all should pay heed to this thought of the family, brothers and sisters and even the children? Would that be the way to view the children? Moses¬ parents saw him beautiful to God. They are to be brought into this full family thought.
J.T. Well, the children have not the Spirit and what we are dealing with is persons who have the
{377}
Spirit. We cannot claim them unless there is some evidence of the work of God. We are dealing with the spiritual work of God, not the physical work of God.
A.R. The only 'babes' here today would be "babes in Christ" @1 Corinthians 3:1 as referred to in Corinthians?
J.T. That is what we are speaking of, "babes in Christ".
C.H.H. A person fifty years old just converted would be one of John's babes.
J.T. Just so. We are dealing with what is spiritual and not with the little children who are here who have not got the Spirit and who do not even know about these things. They are not classified as children of God. Moses was a special child, I suppose, never one like him, of his kind.
Ques. Would you regard persons affected by new birth as having a beginning? "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit", @John 3:6.
J.T. That is the idea of the family of God of which we are speaking. It is a question of the work of the Spirit in persons¬ souls and whether they can be classified as children of God in that sense.
A.B. Is the word that you have in mind used by the Lord in @Mark 7 when speaking to the Syrophenician woman? He says, "Suffer the children to be first filled", @Mark 7:27. The footnote by Mr. Darby says, '"children" in the sense of being born of the family, used by John to signify this relationship in christians, as born of God'.
J.T. That is the idea exactly; that is very clear.
A.McD. Would @1 John 2:20 help? John in writing to the little children says, "And ye have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things", @1 John 2:20.
J.T. That is a splendid passage to bring in here. It is a question of the Spirit, the status that we have as having the Spirit of God; not only born anew but
{378}
having the Spirit of God, born of water and of the Spirit.
J.L.P. Would it be seen in type in Elihu who says, "The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life"? @Job 33:4.
J.T. Quite so. Elihu represents a man of understanding, a man among a thousand; that is the idea. We are dealing therefore with children of God in that sense.
R.W.S. The unction is said to teach in that section quoted in 1 John, "as the same unction teaches you", @1 John 2:27. That would bear upon how we are taught by the Spirit. Is that the Spirit there, the unction?
J.T. Quite so. The unction alludes to the Spirit there. The word 'unction' refers to what the saints are as having the Spirit; it teaches us.
J.R.H. Is it your thought that we should look at these persons in this house in @John 12 as marked by features of full growth, spiritual maturity?
J.T. Quite so. They are taken up by John as representative of the family of God, but without a head.
J.R.H. Do you see features of full growth marking them?
J.T. I would think so; John is dealing with that. We have full growth because we have the Spirit; that is to say, we are twenty years of age according to Numbers. A man who is twenty years of age has the Spirit according to Numbers, and I believe that is in mind here in John.
F.E.S. Does the thought of the Supper fit in with the family and this supper in chapter 12?
J.T. This supper is a family matter. Of course if you bring in the Lord's supper, you might say that is peculiar; but John does not give it at all. It is only a question here of what the family partakes of.
J.F. There is a history connected with each of these three, is there not? Lazarus had gone through
{379}
death, Mary had sat at the Lord's feet, and Martha had been adjusted.
J.T. Quite so. John would give Martha a greater place than Luke does. The Lord discredits Martha in Luke, but John gives her a greater place than Luke does. So they are full grown in the family as we are dealing with it now; it is a question of the family of God, full grown persons, that is to say those who have their sins forgiven and have the Spirit of God. They are full grown christians in that sense.
S.P. Is this setting of maturity that is seen here in these persons necessary to offset and meet the attack of the enemy?
J.T. Quite so. The enemy here is Judas of course. We ought to be full grown; it is a matter of being full grown as children, that is to say having our sins forgiven according to John's epistle and then having the Spirit, so that we are classified as of the family of God.
R.W.S. You remarked that this family had no head. What title would apply to the Lord as He is in the house? Would He be Father or would He be Head in relation to this family?
J.T. If we take up what we have said as to chapter 21 it would be a fatherly attitude; there He says, "Children, have ye anything to eat?", @John 21:5. It is a question of the position the Lord takes up as regards them. "I and the children that Jehovah hath given me" @Isaiah 8:18 it says in Isaiah. They are taken up as the family of God. The Lord takes up the attitude of Father to us; I think it is a feature that enters into John's gospel and in general into the epistles too. So He says, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35. It is not a question of the number of persons, but among you, "among yourselves".
P. Is the supper they made the Lord here a spiritual matter in our household settings?
{380}
J.T. Well, it is a question as to whether a meeting like this is as great or as dignified or as important as the first day of the week when we have the Lord's supper. This does not include the Lord's supper clearly, but it includes a meal that we have as brethren. We are together as brethren now, including the sisters. "For one is your instructor, and all *ye* are brethren"; @Matthew 23:8 that is our position now.
S.McC. In this gospel the Father honours the Son, and the Spirit distinguishes the Son in the way He comes upon Him and marks Him out. Would you say that the family here is now in accord with that, in that the Son is honoured in this sphere in Bethany?
J.T. Quite so. These three persons are full-grown persons but there is no head; that is to say, they are just a family, a brother and two sisters. Now the question is how the family is filled out; and that is in this chapter I believe, in the supper that is taking place here. The family is filled out in happy enjoyment, which is something we should seek to attain in all such meetings as this.
A.B. Is there something in the fact that first the locality is sought -- Bethany -- but the house comes later relative to the filling of it? In verse 3, relative to Mary's service, it says "the house was filled with the odour of the ointment". The locality is in mind at the outset but the confines of the house have to do with the filling.
J.T. Quite so, so that Bethany has a spiritual meaning. The family at Bethany has a spiritual meaning; that is, it can be widened out or opened up to the idea of the family of God. That is an that we have in mind now, but whether we can bring in localities is another thing; whether the idea of locality attaches to the assembly, or the meeting, we will say, here in Rochester; that is a matter to be debated in our minds now.
{381}
E.A.L. Would you say that whatever situation we see the Lord in we always have to recognise that He is unique? The Lord here would be the house-father, would He not?
J.T. Yes, that would do in Luke.
E.A.L. But, for instance, when you are in your son's house you would not supersede him as head of the house. The Lord is always unique and we must recognise that.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord recognised Lazarus, only the Lord takes a higher place. Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table *with* Him; it is not simply that the Lord was with Lazarus -- the Lord was Head of the house really; He was the house-father.
S.P. The maturity seen here in the persons would recognise His distinctiveness.
J.T. Surely, that is what John would stress, that we must recognise the distinctiveness of the Lord. So in chapter 2 Mary says, "Whatever he may say to you, do"; @John 2:5 but she says to the Lord, "They have no wine". The Lord says, "What have I to do with thee, woman?", @John 2:3,4. Now you see the Lord would ignore even His mother; at certain times we have to ignore the natural and make way for the spiritual.
J.R.H. In drawing attention to the position of Lazarus are you suggesting the truth of Colossians?
J.T. Quite so; we alluded to it already, that Colossians says that we are risen with Him: "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above", @Colossians 3:1. But in Ephesians we are already there; we are seated in heavenly places already; that is the difference between Ephesians and Colossians and we are now on Colossian ground. I mean to say, our present enquiry is in relation to Colossian ground, that is that we are children; we are risen with Christ. We have the full status of persons who are risen with Christ, but not raised up into heavenly places.
{382}
C.H.H. In @Luke 10 He entered into their house, but here they are with Him. That is very important, is it not?
J.T. That is what I thought, that we have to make the Lord's position different from simply a visitor, for He is the Head, you might say. He is ordering things. "Lazarus was one of those at table with him". Now it was the house of Lazarus in a certain sense, but the Lord is there: "they made him a supper", they are making everything of Him, so that it is a unique position. I do not think we can make anything more of it, however, than a suggestion of what we are having now in this meeting; that is to say, we are having something of this kind and we are brethren: "For one is your instructor, and all *ye* are brethren", @Matthew 23:8. There may be very little ability recognised, but we are all brethren; we have in principle brethren and family affection. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35.
J.T.Jr. It is mutual; *they* made Him a supper. It would be what we ourselves provide mutually.
J.T. Quite so. You may say, What is there in Rochester? They are going to have meetings; what are they providing? They do not undertake to provide for us in a spiritual sense; it is a question of what will be here in relation to the whole assembly. That is the idea, it is a question of the whole assembly in what there may be here at this time. So the Spirit is with us, and certain of us may have certain thoughts and the Spirit is with us in that; only the general position is a household one with affection one for another, that we are disciples of the Lord Jesus because we have love among ourselves.
C.H.H. Would it in any respect correspond with @Psalm 45, "Anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions"? @Psalm 45:7.
{383}
J.T. Quite so, I would say that; it is the distinction the Lord has always. "Anointed ... with the oil of gladness above thy companions"; @Psalm 45:7 we always recognise that in the Lord.
Ques. Referring to your thought of the family again, we never could speak of the family in a locality. Is that what you mean? For instance, we have the assembly which is in Corinth, but we could never say the family which is in Corinth.
J.T. That is quite right; I think the family is a general idea. It is not simply a local idea; it is a general idea. We are brethren wherever we are.
C.A.M. So that if I understand the thought as to this matter of the fragrance, it would be the Spirit's appreciation of Christ in the saints in oneness.
J.T. Very good. So the sound filled the house where they were sitting in the beginning of Acts. It is the same idea; the odour here filled the house. It is a precious product of the Spirit of God, only it is not directly the Spirit; it is the result of Him in His activities.
S.McC. There is nothing said in this setting.
Apparently there is no utterance so far as the record is given. Is it important in gatherings such as these that we learn how to sit in relation to one another, spirituality dominating the scene?
J.T. Very good. We do not want to make too much of the official, if we may call him that, who seats the brethren. That is to say we are all brethren and we should be quite free to take any seat that is vacant. I do not like the idea of setting persons in certain positions in the seats, making it a material matter. They should be all open. We are all brethren and One is our Master; the less we have of anything else the better.
S.McC. We want a little more about that. Last year you thought it rather commendable that certain
{384}
brothers were sitting in certain places. Now what have you in mind in what you just said?
J.T. Well, in Australia the matter was, in my mind, too straight, making too much of physical position; whereas the idea of brethren makes us all on the same level. It is not a question of gift in where we are going to sit; it is a question of our being brethren. That is the groundwork of the whole position, and the less official we are the better. We are just brethren together, a family circle really, that is the very best word we could use.
S.McC. I think what you are saying is important. We have noticed in regard to yourself when invited to come that you have said you would be with us, not in the sense that you would come and take meetings but that you would be with us. I suppose that is the thought in your mind, is it not?
J.T. Quite so, because it would be a poor thing to assume that everything is hinged on one man; that would never do. Everything hinges on Christ. That is the only One that things hinge on. So here they made *Him* a supper; everything hinged on Him.
Ques. Does this apply in the same way in the local setting?
J.T. Pretty much, because the local company must in some sense reflect the public or general company. The local position is the working out of things and it is well to keep the number down. During fifty years God has helped us to keep the numbers down, to increase the number of meetings rather than the size of them.
A.B. Is that why Lazarus is mentioned twice? "Where was the dead man Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among the dead". Then Martha is serving and it further says, "But Lazarus was one of those at table with him".
J.T. "One of those", though he is a distinctive man at the moment; he gives character to the whole
{385}
matter because he is a risen man. That could not be said even of the Lord yet. Lazarus was raised by the Lord, but that could not be said even of the Lord yet, so that Lazarus characterises the circle at this time.
M.O. Would the fact that Mary kept this ointment involve the service and help of the Holy Spirit? Paul's word to Timothy is, "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted", @2 Timothy 1:14.
J.T. I think it would. Paul had spoken to Timotheus in a very free and friendly way, as to his son; he calls him his child. He therefore spoke to him freely and the Holy Spirit is implied in the fact that there were furnishings in the relations of Timotheus, Titus and Paul. These furnishings would be supplied by the Holy Spirit because the Spirit is here for that purpose.
F.E.S. In connection with the thought of Mary's bringing the ointment, would you say a little as to the mutual side and the absence of what is official in a gathering such as this?
J.T. Let us read it. "Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. One of his disciples therefore, Judas son of Simon, Iscariote, who was about to deliver him up, says, Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor? But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was put into it". We have spoken of Lazarus and of Martha, now we have come to Mary. This is what the Lord says about her, "Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial; for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always". Now all this brings out something
{386}
of the constitution of the christian circle where the saints are, where they are wont to meet in holy fellowship, in holy, family relations. We can see how it applies to the local company. The question has been raised, How does it apply to Rochester now? The brethren in Rochester simply merge with the whole number that is here; they simply merge amongst us all and we become a larger circle, but at the same time we maintain the family idea, the fellowship, the love idea. That is the point we should reach now, the love idea, what we are going to get out of it. How much is the thought in mind of love amongst ourselves? It is a quantity but it is a quality too. What value is it? What kind of love is it? It is love amongst ourselves; it is a pure love. We are told to add love to brotherly love, and that is the point we have come to now. What have we here in this city? What are we getting from the different meetings whence we have come? Are we advancing in love? That is the great point.
F.E.S. Do you connect love with the ointment?
J.T. The ointment is the expression of it. It is very valuable, very precious. The Lord defends its preciousness; He defends Mary in providing it because it brings out her quality.
J.L.P. Does the Holy Spirit have part in the compounding of this ointment? I was thinking of the type in @Exodus 30 where the olive oil is added to the other drugs and it was to be a holy ointment. What is seen now, really, is the fruit of the Spirit, where the first quality mentioned is love, is it not?
J.T. Very good. Things of this kind, such as ointment, may represent some spiritual thought, and I think Mary is represented as to her quality. Her spirituality enters into the whole matter of the household. She exceeds all the others and therefore it is said of her (I believe it is she that is alluded to), "What *she* could she has done", @Mark 14:8.
{387}
A.B.P. Does the word in @Psalm 133 fit? "For brethren to dwell together in unity" @Psalm 133:1 is *like* the precious oil.
J.T. Very good. It has a beautiful relation to this chapter, because it is 'like' something. Certain things are mentioned as 'like', and this is like the precious ointment that descended from the head, and went down from Aaron's beard even to the skirts of his garments.
A.R. Does @John 13 suggest we may have love one for the other, which is relative; but love among ourselves is like love as an entity, like the pure nard?
J.T. Quite so. Love among ourselves is a very good expression; you have it as a quality but then it is quantity too. How much have we of it? What is the quality of it? Here it is a pound, that is the amount of it, and that is carried through to the end of the book where Nicodemus comes in and Joseph of Arimathaea. The quality of things rises as we go on in the book. The point now in this meeting today is what there is here in Rochester and what there is in all the meetings represented here. How much love is there and what is the quality of it? Because it is a question of quality and quantity.
A.R. So Nicodemus has one hundred pounds of myrrh; that would mean things are increasing.
J.T. Quite so.
S.P. Does verse 7 draw attention to the ointment or the act? "Suffer her to have kept this". Is the Lord appraising what she had kept all this time for this moment?
J.T. Yes. Think of what she kept it for! She thought of the Lord's burial, not simply His death but His burial. We are told "that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried", @1 Corinthians 15:3. We overlook that sometimes. And then "he was raised the third day according to the scriptures", @1 Corinthians 15:4. Now the burial is in mind here, showing how feeling
{388}
Mary was in regard of Christ, and that is the test of all our meetings.
Ques. Is the thought of 'great price' connected with this ointment worth noting?
J.T. Certainly. The Lord maintained the whole position against the devil, against the attack of the devil here in Judas. The Lord maintained the position of the most spiritual woman or person in the house, and that was Mary. "Suffer her", He says.
A.B.P. Is it significant that the one who brought in this charge has an official capacity which just does not seem to fit?
J.T. Very solemn that he should have an official position, that he should have a status officially. We are, therefore, to be on our guard against official action in these meetings.
C.A.M. Your thought would be to put a very special meaning on such occasions as these, for the privilege of bringing our appreciation of Christ into these settings will soon be over.
J.T. They will soon come to an end, I am sure. We are drawing near to the end of everything, that is what I believe; we are drawing to the end of this dispensation.
A.B. Is it important that in regard to the positive side there is no speaking? It is a question of operations. The only one who speaks is Judas; and the Lord defends the operations against Him.
J.T. Neither Lazarus nor Martha nor Mary is speaking here. The position is in power; that is the great matter. We do not need to carry on speaking in itself; it is a question of the power there is. Paul says that he would rather have the power.
C.H.H. This chapter develops the sons of light. Would you say that Mary was a son of light? because you do not get any vessel here; she was the containing vessel herself as a son of light in connection with His burial.
{389}
J.T. I would say the whole chapter deals with this. It is a question of light, that we are to be sons of light; not sons of God here, but sons of light. That is to say, as developed in the idea of light we are to be characterised by it.
A.P. @1 John 3:2 says, "We know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure", @1 John 3:2. I was wondering whether that might link with what we have in this chapter, where purity is connected with the ointment.
J.T. Quite so, and light too. So the chapter ends with the idea of commandment; the Lord says, "For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak; and I know that his commandment is life eternal", @John 12:49,50. I just wanted to call attention to the end of this chapter, that it is a question of commandment and life eternal. The commandment *is* life eternal, that is to say, it is the great blessing of God; not in heaven exactly, but what is to be set out here on the earth during the millennium, but already to be known in the assembly. "What therefore I speak, as the Father has said to me, so I speak". That is, the Lord is maintaining that He is acting under the thought of commandment and the commandment is eternal life; the great blessing of God is in mind, and it now characterises the assembly, and will characterise the millennium in the future because it is the earthly side of the blessing. "There hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore", @Psalm 133:3.
{390}
READINGS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL (5)
@John 14:1 - 31
J.T. It is hoped that we shall be free to touch on the means of discerning divine Persons as they speak so as to be able to name Them as they speak. I believe this chapter is peculiarly fitted for this subject. It has come home to us, I think, in recent times that God intends that He should be known in the Persons who are in the Godhead, that is to say, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We are baptized to that Name, to the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; so that They are to be known. The Name put upon us as baptized is that we might know the Persons, be able to identify Them.
C.H.H. Has it not been said that in John's writings it is at times hard to distinguish the Persons? It often requires spirituality to distinguish the Speaker.
J.T. Well, the pronouns are sometimes indefinite, especially in the epistles; but the indefiniteness implies that the Spirit of God is quite well aware that the indefiniteness is there, but that His thoughts and intents challenge our understanding; the intent is not to leave us in laziness as to matters, but that we should be alert and understand, and compare spiritual things with spiritual. Paul said, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things", @2 Timothy 2:7. The great lack is in understanding, and in comparing what is said and evaluating the words used.
S.P. Does the middle of verse 9 have a particular bearing on the truth for the moment and on what you are saying? "Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip?"
J.T. That bears on it exactly. One marvels at oneself as to how long one has been looking into the truth and seeking to tell others of it and yet how little one knows. I think this would apply to every
{391}
one of us perhaps; how little we know relative to the time expended by us on acquiring knowledge, on learning; and so I think Nathanael is intended to show how quickly we should learn, whereas Nicodemus was a slow learner. We should see which class we belong to, whether we belong to the Nathanael class or the Nicodemus class, because it is a time of learning and we have very little time, too; the time is short.
J.R.H. Does that show the importance of so yielding ourselves to divine Persons that the works of God might be manifest in us? The man we were reading of in @John 9 was a quick learner.
J.T. Quite so. He learned as opportunity offered and answered questions, showing that he is ready for instruction too. He is able to record what happened to him, but then he is able to add things that throw light on the whole subject.
S.McC. When the Lord was here, the Father was here as He refers to it in this portion; and the Spirit was there too in the Lord Jesus. Is it not somewhat the same now? The Spirit being here, the Father is to be discerned too, and the Lord, in their particular activities.
J.T. Well, you see how they are grouped here in verse 15, "If ye love me, keep my commandments", the Lord says. "And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter"; that is, the three Persons are there in the passage; They are grouped together. And then He proceeds, "That he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him" -- that is objective knowledge; it is outside of us, not learned within us but outside of us -- "For he abides with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you. Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live. In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".
{392}
So that the way of knowledge is clearly marked out and particularly the knowledge of divine Persons. The chapter is full of it.
C.H.H. So that in verse 21 of chapter 17 He says, "As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us", @John 17:21. Would that be the result of it?
J.T. Very good.
R.W.S. Is it right to connect the fulness of the Godhead with the Spirit? I am thinking of Colossians where we have the statement, "For in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell" @Colossians 1:19 in chapter 1, and in chapter 2, "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily", @Colossians 2:9.
J.T. "Of the Godhead" is not in the original in chapter 1: 'in him all the fulness was pleased to dwell'. @Colossians 1:19 What is your point?
R.W.S. Can fulness now be connected with the Spirit here below?
J.T. I would say so fully. "All the fulness" includes the Spirit, the three divine Persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, All dwelling in the Lord Jesus as incarnate, known as a Man here. That is a very important matter to keep before us, that "in him all the fulness ... was pleased to dwell". The idea of "bodily" is in chapter 2 where it is repeated, so that things are brought near to us in the Lord Jesus "bodily", that is to say, as incarnate.
S.McC. Is it right in the presence of the Spirit now to think of the fulness of the Godhead being here, near to us? You are alluding to the fulness connected with the Lord as Man here, and @Colossians 2; of course, alluding to Him as Man in His present position. Is it right to think of the fulness as linked with the Spirit's presence now that the Lord is on high?
{393}
J.T. I think so. "In him all the fulness ... was pleased to dwell"; @Colossians 1:19 that is the past tense. But in chapter 2 it is, "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"; @Colossians 2:9 that is the present time. The presence of the Holy Spirit is included in that; the Spirit is included in the fulness. And so you have the question of tense, as, for instance, in @Revelation 1: "From him who is, and who was, and who is to come"; @Revelation 1:8 if we say "who was", that is the past; and "who is to come" is the future; and "who is" is the present.
S.McC. One is just interested in what is linked with the Spirit's presence here below, the marvellous character of things that is linked with His presence.
J.T.Jr. In @Acts 2 the thought is that the house is filled.
J.T. Quite so, the sound filled the house.
J.T.Jr. "And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting", @Acts 2:2. Would not that be the idea of the fulness in the Spirit here?
J.T. Well, it is a question of what entered into the sound that filled the house. The disciples were all there and where they were sitting the house was filled.
J.T.Jr. I thought it would mean that the Spirit being here the whole fulness would be here in the way He came in.
J.T. That would be so because the Spirit had come in. The Lord Jesus had gone up into heaven; He had been there for ten days clearly, and then something happened, the sound coming out, and that sound implied that the Spirit had come in, and tongues of fire sat upon each of them. Each one was affected; it was a great matter. You might say the whole universe is in question, but it came in amongst the disciples where they were sitting and the sound carried it. It came from heaven, it was a sound up
{394}
there. Then we have the idea of light, but first it is a question of the sound and what it might have carried.
J.T.Jr. I had in mind that the idea of the Spirit coming in would be the fulness, that everything would be here.
J.T. That is equivalent to what has been remarked; that is to say the sound would carry all that with it. But then we have, as it were, to dissolve the whole matter humbly, and see what is what, what can be stated of it, what has come in; because you also have a material thought: "And there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth", @Acts 2:3,4. Now we are getting the matter brought out in detail as to what has happened; the sound carried it primarily, but it has to be worked out in each one of them. Each person was implied.
J.T.Jr. The Spirit is alluded to, therefore, definitely. It says, "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues".
J.T. That is how the thing began to take form -- substantial, intelligible form -- when they began to speak.
J.T.Jr. "As the Spirit", that is, the Spirit is viewed there personally.
J.T. Quite so. But then there is actual detail, because things are going to be broken up for us in the presence of the Spirit and the speaking comes out through the apostles as they were sitting there. So that it was the inauguration of christianity you might say.
J.R.H. Would Mr. Darby's footnote in @Colossians 2:10 help in this matter? "Ye are complete in him", @Colossians 2:10 and the note says, "Or 'filled full', referring to all fulness being in him. The fulness or completeness of the Godhead is in Christ, as towards us; and we, as towards God, are complete in him".
{395}
J.T. Well, the fulness referring to us is what is by the Spirit, but the fulness that was in Christ is infinite; the fulness, without saying what it was, is just infinite. But then we are filled full; that is limited, that is in creatures. We are filled full in Him and that, of course, would be subjectively by the Spirit.
B.T. In @Genesis 24 in speaking of the servant it says, "All the treasure of his master was under his hand", @Genesis 24:10. Is that a link with the fulness in relation to us?
J.T. Very good, "All the treasure of his master"; he was the chief servant of Abraham and all that Abraham had was under his hand. His name is not mentioned; it is a question of the Holy Spirit, but all was under his hand. It is very important for all that to come into this idea of fulness.
E.A.L. Referring back to @Acts 2, it says in verse 2, "And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting", @Acts 2:2. The footnote to "blowing" says, 'It is not "wind", but they heard blowing, as of hard breathing, for which the Greek is used'. In previous ministry we have had that that is evidently the personal work and the breathing of the Spirit, personalising this wind or the blowing. Does that help in connection with what we were saying?
J.T. Yes, the reference really is to the lungs; the human body is in mind, and it is a question of breath, of blowing. It comes through the lungs. It is a very touching matter; we can hardly speak freely about it because of using the word 'lungs' in regard of God, but that is really what is in mind, that the blowing was of that kind. It was felt and heard. It filled all the house, showing that what happened was really of universal importance, infinite importance,
{396}
and it means the inauguration of christianity. That is what it means in detail and things began to take form when the apostles began to speak. When they began to speak, things began to be intelligible.
E.A.L. So the felt presence and influence of a divine Person entirely controlled everyone there?
J.T. That is just what happened.
S.P. Could we bring in what Paul speaks of as the distinction of sounds in Corinthians and the power of the sounds? While it is in another connection, yet there is the thought of the distinguishing feature of it and the power that followed it. I wondered if you could bring that in here as being in the spiritual realm and thus distinguishing things and the power of them.
J.T. I think that is a very good remark. So that in this chapter as to divine Persons, it is a question of our learning to distinguish sounds and the Persons implied in the sounds.
S.McC. The Lord Jesus says in our chapter, "He that has seen me has seen the Father". There was the perfect representation of the Father there. It would be right, would it not, to think of the same now, that the Spirit might represent the Father or the Son at a given time?
J.T. It is true that the medium is the Spirit; the Father and the Son of course are above; the Spirit is below. The Spirit is here in wonderful condescension to be, as it were, at Their bidding, because as He hears He speaks. So that all the things that are brought out now are in the power of the Spirit, and for us it is a question therefore of being able to discern in what the Spirit would say, whether it is the Father speaking or the Spirit speaking or the Son speaking. Therefore the idea of discernment comes in and it is a question of whether we can discern and come to a knowledge of the divine Persons as They are seen in this chapter.
{397}
C.H.H. Would that be seen in @Acts 5? Peter says, "Why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?", @Acts 5:3. And later he says, "Thou hast not lied to men, but to God", @Acts 5:4. He is associating the Holy Spirit with God.
J.T. Just so, the Holy Spirit is God. Therefore it would be the Holy Spirit Himself speaking, and speaking as God.
D.MacD. Would it also be seen in @Acts 11? Peter says, "And the Spirit said to me", @Acts 11:12. He discerned who was speaking to him.
J.T. Quite so; in chapter 10 I think he speaks to the Spirit in that same sense as Lord.
R.W.S. Is it possible to distinguish which divine Person is speaking to us individually or is it a collective idea?
J.T. I think it is possible because @Romans 8 says that "the Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit", @Romans 8:16. It implies that we discern that it is the Spirit speaking with our spirit, saying that we are children of God. That is discernible. Do you follow what I am saying?
R.W.S. I think I follow but I do not know how to distinguish myself.
J.T. Well, I am prepared to say the same thing, only that I see the thing is distinguishable. It is not what you or I may know of himself, but what is true, what is possible. So @Romans 8 says, "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God", @Romans 8:16. That must be intelligible to us, that we know inwardly that we are witnessed to as the children of God by the Holy Spirit.
J.T.Jr. So in the same chapter it says, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God", @Romans 8:14 which would allude to an inward understanding of the Spirit, and that He would lead you even to making a remark in a meeting.
J.T. Quite so.
{398}
C.T.Jr. Is there a link with @Revelation 1 where it says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet"? @Revelation 1:10. And later it says, "And I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me", @Revelation 1:12.
J.T. That fits in exactly with what we are talking about. Notice the word 'see' as applied to a voice; that shows what we are speaking of -- that John could discern things. He talked with the voice and we are told what the voice was.
C.A.M. So that it would involve the direction of the voice, would it not? He was looking at the assemblies from a certain viewpoint, but the divine thought would be to look at them in another way, in a scrutinising way, would you say? The direction in which he was looking in a spiritual way was changed by the hearing of the voice.
J. T. That is true. John says, "I turned back to see the voice" and then he tells us what he saw. "I saw seven golden lamps", @Revelation 1:12 and the Lord Jesus, the Son of man, was in the midst of them, of the seven assemblies in other words. He really saw the seven assemblies in figure and then he saw the Lord Jesus speaking in the midst of them.
C.A.M. So that his turning back would give another view; would you say that?
J.T. John would have another view. But he turned back to see the voice; really he was to see what voice it was. Can we decide what voice it was? It goes on to speak of the Son of man being clothed with a garment and describes His appearance, His head and His hair; but then it speaks of His feet "like fine brass, as burning in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters", @Revelation 1:15. This is a different voice altogether from the one John had known. There is a great fulness in this passage, and it has to be opened up to get what is meant. The Lord Jesus is in mind there, but He is in mind in a
{399}
judicial character; He is going to deal judicially, it is a judicial voice.
C.T. Would the thought in @Acts 20 where the apostle says, "The Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city", @Acts 20:23 enter into this question as to a voice?
J.T. "The Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and tribulations await me", @Acts 20:23 that is what Paul said. He tells us what he understood by it, that the Holy Spirit was saying this to warn him that bonds and afflictions awaited him.
R.W.S. Is the voice which John turned back to see the voice of the Lord in discriminating judgment amongst the assemblies?
J.T. Quite so, it is a judicial voice. It is the Lord speaking judicially because He is dealing with the assemblies judicially.
E.A.L. Would you say that the word 'see' is used here to stress that John distinguished the Person behind the voice? As influenced by one divine Person he was in the Spirit and could detect Another who was speaking.
J.T. Well, he could; but then it was not the voice he was accustomed to when the Lord Jesus was here in the midst of the disciples. It was not that voice, it was a judicial voice, although He had spoken judicially when He was here; but now He is peculiarly judicial because the failure of the church has already begun, and the Lord is starting to deal with it.
R.W.S. All that would make John's recognition of that voice all the more remarkable.
J.T. Quite so. It was the voice of the Son of man, really, but then it was in a judicial sense and His garments are in keeping with that.
B.W. This voice was to John, but then it says the Spirit speaks to the assemblies.
J.T. In the letters to the assemblies there would be what the Lord said in the first part, but then the
{400}
Lord says further, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". But then the Lord had said something before. We cannot tell what the Spirit says because it covers the whole dispensation, but what the Lord says is specified.
S.McC. In @John 14 the Lord says, "I am in the Father, and ... the Father is in me". How do you understand that? Is it an allusion to the perfect state of love between divine Persons?
J.T. Well, I suppose we have to say it is really inscrutable. We cannot assume to understand fully. All these things are inscrutable, how the Father is acting through the Son and the Son acting through the Father, and the Son representing the Father. Anyone who sees the Son sees the Father, so that is inscrutable because They are two Persons; the Father and the Son are two Persons; They are not one. We are dealing with inscrutable things and peculiarly so in John's gospel.
A.R. "He that has seen me has seen the Father". Was the Spirit there also?
J.T. The Spirit is not mentioned there. The two Persons are mentioned, the Father and the Son.
A.R. I was thinking of what it says, "For in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell", @Colossians 1:19.
J.T. Yes, but we are speaking of another thing now. We are speaking of the Father and the Son. We are saying things that are designated of Them and the Spirit is not mentioned at all. Do you mean that the Spirit may have been there? Well, He may have been, but I think we should confine ourselves to the actual Persons mentioned.
J.R.H. Do you look at verse 20 as conveying what is inscrutable also?
J.T. "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". All these things are inscrutable but there is something we are to know about them "in that day". In verse 19 it says,
{401}
"Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live. In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". Well, that is all wonderful. It is absolutely true and it means enjoyment, wonderful enjoyment, wonderful privilege. We cannot speak of it as we speak of two or three men, we are speaking of divine Persons all of which are beyond us, are inscrutable. Yet there is something to know about Them, "Ye shall know"; there is something to know about Them that we can compass.
J.R.H. In verse 10 it is a matter of faith: "Believest thou not that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me?". But in verse 20 it is a matter of knowledge. Does it link up with chapter 6, "We have believed and known"? @John 6:69.
J.T. Quite so, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". That is what they had learned by experience. It had become common knowledge, you might say, or an article of faith amongst them.
A.P. Does "In that day" suppose the Spirit's day? Would it be implied that the knowledge of the Father was in Him and He in the Father? Would it be the thought of the service of the Holy Spirit to unfold this to us?
J.T. That is very good, because it is the Spirit's day we are dealing with. It is a feature of John's gospel, it is the time of the Spirit. It says in chapter 7, "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", @John 7:39. Now that is a remarkable thing, "The Spirit was not yet" it says; but what is meant in this chapter is that the Spirit *is*, He has come, He has actually come. The Lord says here that He is going to send Him and all this will come out when He comes. "Another Comforter" He is called, distinct from the Lord Himself.
{402}
W.L. Would you say that verse 18 would work out at the present time? If so, in what way?
J.T. "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". We quote that on the Lord's day morning many times, meaning that it is a provision at the present time for making up to us the full thought of the divine Presence. "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", He says, meaning that He will not leave us in that state but He will come to us, and the orphaned condition ceases when He comes to us. That is available to us, we might say, every Lord's day, every first day of the week.
W.L. So that you have in mind that it is not the Spirit personally, it is the Lord personally that we would recognise?
J.T. That is the idea, that the Lord comes and He comes through the medium of the Spirit. It is true that before the Spirit came the Lord was known amongst them; before He went up to heaven the Lord was amongst them; but now that He has gone up to heaven and the Spirit has come down one would expect that the medium would be the Spirit, that the Lord would make Himself known by the Spirit. So He comes to us in that sense.
S.P. In verse 17 it says, speaking of the Comforter, "Ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you". Then in verse 23, speaking of the Father, it says, "We will come to him and make our abode with him". Are those two distinct things?
J.T. These are all wonderful things, but they are wonderful as inscrutable. For instance, take verse 23: "If anyone love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him". Now that is not said of a company, it is said of a person, showing how all this wonderful privilege can be brought down to one person. Then if we were twenty persons or one hundred persons, how great a thing it would be!
{403}
J.F. What is the thought in "that they also may be one in us", @John 17:21?
J.T. That the thing might work out in us, "they" referring to the saints, that the idea of unity might work out in us but in that sense, "one in us" -- one in the Father and the Son, showing how wonderful the privilege is that is in mind in this chapter.
F.E.S. Is this inquiry in relation to distinguishing the voices limited to what is recorded in the Scriptures, or have you in mind what is present?
J.T. It is a question of the voice of the Spirit; the Scriptures have a voice but it is not the same as the Spirit's voice. The Spirit has His own voice, which is what is chiefly in mind; but there is the voice of the Scriptures too; and then as to circumstances, we often say, 'There is a voice to us', in this and that.
A.B. Is there a difference between the Comforter mentioned here and the Holy Spirit mentioned in @Luke 12: "For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said"? @Luke 12:12
J.T. That is good, I am glad you brought that up; it makes it very practical. "In the hour itself", at that time the Holy Spirit will help us, tell us what to say. That is a provision for us in a time of suffering and trial; so that the Spirit's voice is clearly discernible in that He teaches us in that trying hour.
G.L. Could we link this with the scripture in Isaiah, "And the Lord will give you the bread of adversity, and the water of oppression; yet thy teachers shall not be hidden any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers. And when ye turn to the right hand or when ye turn to the left, thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it", @Isaiah 30:20,21.
J.T. Just so. That is something that happens. A voice behind you, "This is the way"; it is very similar to the incident we have been speaking of in @Revelation 1. A voice behind us -- but what does
{404}
the voice say there? It is, "This is the way, walk ye in it"; @Isaiah 30:21 but in @Revelation 1 it is the Lord Jesus Himself speaking but He is speaking in the midst of the assemblies in a judicial way. It is not to point out the way but to speak judicially, that is to say, judgment is implied in it.
P. In @Acts 10 the Holy Spirit seems to identify Himself with the angel. In verse 20 He says to Peter, "Behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because *I* have sent them"; @Acts 10:20 but in the first verses of the chapter it says it is an angel. Then in verse 30 Cornelius says, "A man stood before me", @Acts 10:30. Would you help as to that?
J.T. Peter is sent by the Spirit, is he not? Not by the voice of angels but by the Spirit's own voice.
P. Yes, but in verse 3 it says he "saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius. But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of fear, said, What is it, Lord?", @Acts 10:3,4. And then the Holy Spirit speaks of having sent the men in verse 20.
J.T. That is to say, there are two agencies; one is an angel that came to Cornelius first, but then when Peter had to be sent it was not by an angel, it was by the Spirit Himself.
P. I wanted to know how it is that the Holy Spirit identifies Himself as having spoken to the men when it begins with the angel who advised Cornelius that he was to send the men to Joppa to fetch Peter.
J.T. But then the Spirit Himself gives authority to Peter to go, directs him to go, that is to say, it is the Spirit's voice now directing Peter to go. "*I* have sent them", He says. The agencies of that chapter are very remarkable; there are various agencies that are used in the services. The Spirit Himself is used in the services, speaking to this one and that one.
{405}
W.L. Do we see in these things that God is One, and that divine Persons in Their movements are moving in perfect consonance with each other?
J.T. Quite so. God is the source of all, He is the great source of everything; everything proceeds from Him. As we had it yesterday, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", @Genesis 1:1. "In the beginning God"; God is the source of everything and the Author of everything and the Agent of everything. Therefore if we speak of God we must imply that we speak of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. There is only one God, and furthermore God is one, and the Mediator of God and men one, the Man Christ Jesus. @1 Timothy 2:5.
J.L.P. We have had much before us in previous readings on the thought of love as in the family and a good deal of love enters into our present chapter, love for the Father and love for the Son. Do you think the Holy Spirit has been waiting for us to be developed in love in relation to Himself, and that as we thus love all three divine Persons the intelligence to which we referred earlier in knowing how to address Them would follow easily, so that it would not be a burden to us?
J.T. Quite so. The question is now how we are to reach our object in getting into the truth of the Spirit as we see Him here in this chapter, how He is here, what He is here for and what He is doing for us. The Lord has opened up the truth as to Him, and the question is how much we shall get out of it.
J.R.H. This promise of the Comforter is linked up by the Lord with the obedience of love, verse 15, "If ye love me, keep my commandments".
J.T. Very good. The Lord says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you. Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live".
{406}
The Lord is encouraging the brethren to expect things from Him and especially that the Father is going to send the Spirit. The Father Himself is going to do it in answer to the Lord's own request.
R.W.S. In verse 16 the Lord calls Him "another Comforter" and "the Spirit of truth"; and in verse 26, "the Comforter, the Holy Spirit". Would that mean that this title "Comforter" is very distinguished; a title, shall I say, elevated, and high on the list of all the titles of the Spirit? We had the confessing of Jesus as the Son of God as if that was a very elevated title. Is the thought of "Comforter" a very elevated and comforting thought for us?
J.T. I think it is intended to be that here; I think it is intended to be a formal title of the Spirit of God; that is to say, One who takes charge of all our affairs here on earth. It is a very high title and we ought to know it and count on the Comforter being available to us, to look after things spiritually as to us.
A.R. As to this matter of knowing Him, it says in verse 17, "Ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you". Do you think our difficulty is that we do not know Him enough objectively? We can all say that we know Him in His inward workings; we can say, "Lord Jesus" by His help, we can say, "Abba, Father" by His help; but our difficulty is that we do not know Him enough objectively.
J.T. That is good. We had readings in Toronto to bring out that thought, how the Spirit of God is apprehended objectively in the book of Acts. It is wrought out, I believe, through what the Lord is giving us now, bringing out clearly amongst us the
{407}
value and activities and operations of the Spirit of God, and they are all available to us.
A.P. Does the Lord in His ministry in these chapters pave the way for the extensive service of the Holy Spirit, both in relation to the Father and in relation to Himself?
J.T. I think that is what this chapter is intended for, that the Spirit is to be apprehended objectively as the Father and the Son are apprehended objectively. We are to apprehend Him operating by Himself as we have seen in @Acts 10: He said to Peter in regard to the men, "*I* have sent them", @Acts 10:20. He told Peter to go with the men, nothing doubting, for He had sent them; a very great matter. That is objective action on the part of the Spirit to direct Peter as to what to do.
A.R. When I say, "Lord Jesus", am I not speaking to Him objectively? And when I say, "Abba, Father", am I not doing the same thing?
J.T. Quite so. If you are speaking to the Father or the Lord Jesus that is objective; but then you can, in the same sense, speak to the Spirit objectively.
A.R. I was thinking that it would help us all to speak to divine Persons objectively; it would help us to speak to the Spirit Himself objectively?
J.T. Just so, the Spirit Himself.
S.McC. It is interesting to see the affecting link between the Lord on high managing our affairs and the Spirit here below managing our affairs, the wonderful character of these mediatorial activities.
J.T. And both Persons with the same title; that is to say, the Lord Jesus is a priest on high, but He is there too in the sense of a Paraclete; and that same word that is used of Him in the epistle of John is used of the Spirit here. There are two activities, one by the Lord in heaven and the other by the Spirit here on earth; they are both Paracletes, both serving in the same sense.
{408}
S.P. Is there any suggestion of this in verse 31 of @Acts 9, "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit"? @Acts 9:31.
J.T. There you have the comfort of the Holy Spirit, a very precious thought.
A.H. Is that why He says, "Another Comforter", another one like Jesus?
J.T. Exactly. They are both under the same head; Jesus is a Comforter and so is the Spirit a Comforter.
C.T. Is that why He opens @John 14 by saying, "Let not your heart be troubled", having in mind this thought of the Comforter?
J.T. Just so. "Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe on God, believe also on me. In my Father's house there are many abodes; were it not so, I had told you: for I go to prepare you a place". The whole thought in this wonderful chapter is to open up comfort for the saints.
F.E.S. In referring to the Spirit as we know Him, would you in any way bring in the way the Lord Jesus, as having become a man, has been the great One to be the manifestation?
J.T. That is a good word to use, because the word 'manifested' is used in the last chapters of this gospel: "Jesus manifested himself", @John 21:1. It is a question now of what we can discern in Jesus, because He is the only One of the Deity that has taken a human form, and we are to learn everything from Him. He is the One that reveals; the Father is revealed by Him, the Spirit too is revealed by Him, but the revelation is in Christ, the One who became Man. Therefore it is a question of our learning from the Lord as to how to know the Spirit. "Ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you"; that is what the Lord says.
{409}
F.E.S. Does that give point then to "another Comforter"?
J.T. Just so. It is the same kind of person. You can learn the meaning of it through the One or the Other. The word 'Comforter' covers both.
A.R. Is that what is meant when it says, "The Spirit joins also its help to our weakness"? @Romans 8:26.
J.T. Just so. The Comforter does, the Spirit does. He joins Himself to our infirmities.
S.McC. In Genesis before the period of faith, in type, is finished, before the cover is lifted off the ark, you have a remarkable allusion to Noah and the dove and the peculiar link between Noah and the dove. Would there be a reference in that type to the present moment, the peculiar interest and link between the Lord and the Spirit in regard to the completing of the dispensation?
J.T. I think so. In fact I have thought all along that the thought of @John 1 is taken from that chapter in Genesis, the relation between Noah and the dove. It is worked out from that in the way the Lord is manifested. The Spirit comes upon Him in the form of a dove, and John the baptist says, "And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God"; @John 1:34 he is bearing record because of the way the Spirit has come on Christ, how the dove acts toward Him, because He came in that form on Jesus. The idea of the dove is seen in Noah first and worked out in the New Testament in the way that the Spirit of God comes on Jesus.
J.F. Would there be a link with spiritual manifestations? We get the Lord manifesting forth His glory and manifesting the Father, and then in relation to the gifts we get spiritual manifestations.
J.T. I think it is just the difference between revelation and what is manifested, what is open, what can be discerned by the eye. The word 'manifestation' is very much used by John.
{410}
J.F. I wondered if the operation of the gifts would be a help to us in relation to learning more as to the Spirit.
J.T. In what they do and say. It is a question of our discerning what comes out in the ministry, what men of gift or ability, that the Lord has given, do and say. We see what is going on, but the Spirit is in all that. That is how we come to know Him.
J.R.H.Jr. Why does the Lord continually amplify this matter of the Comforter in detail, as He says in verse 16, "And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth"; and then in verse 26, "The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name"; and then again in chapter 15 he refers to Him, "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father", @John 15:26. Then again in chapter 16 he speaks of the Comforter in verse 7 and continues in verse 13, "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth", @John 15:13. Why does the Lord continually emphasise this matter as to who the Comforter is?
J.T. Well, it is clear that He is taking great pains to call attention to this glorious Person, that we should know Him. The Lord has in His mind at this particular juncture to bring out this great truth as to the Spirit. Is all this not to remind us that there are so many distinctive things to be noticed as to His Person? And let us begin to notice them. How are they noticeable in the persons who minister? We see how they do things, the Lord helping them, so that we gradually come to know that that is suggestive of the Spirit of God, nothing less than that.
A.B. Reference was made to @1 Corinthians 14. It says in verse 10, "There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of undistinguishable sound", @1 Corinthians 14:10.
{411}
Then Paul says, "I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding", @1 Corinthians 14:15. In that chapter we have the manifestation of God in the assembly, that "God is indeed amongst you", @1 Corinthians 14:25.
J.T. So that we say, for instance, "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding", @1 Corinthians 14:15. Now if we heard Paul sing we would learn things of the Spirit, because that is what is meant. The Lord means that when He says, "But ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you". We have all these traits defined and we are to notice them, look around to see if we see any of them among the brethren.
Rem. Paul says in @1 Corinthians 2:4, "My word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power", @1 Corinthians 2:4.
J.T. Quite so, demonstration of the Spirit and of power. Therefore we have to look at what we see in the ministers and the ministry, as to whether we can discern the Spirit in the things said and done.
J.K. Does not the Spirit bring to our remembrance the teaching and then guide us into it?
J.T. So that there is a great lesson book opened up to us in these chapters, especially in this chapter. We have to look into the lesson book and the lesson book really is the saints, not to make much of them, but the saints really are those in whom God is working and in whom the Spirit is operating. Therefore we have to see what is going on, what we can see in the saints.
S.McC. What you have said as to the ministry and the ministers is of great importance, because if I have a warped judgment as to the ministers I may miss the great point as to the Spirit or a divine Person.
{412}
J.T. Quite so. You put a cloud around a man if you do not look at him rightly, because it is a question of light, of ministering by the power of the Spirit; he is luminous and we must not cover him with a cloud. He is luminous.
S.McC. So we are challenged in that way as to how we look at the ministers, are we not?
J.T. Quite so.
J.W.W. "The planter and the waterer are one", @1 Corinthians 3:8. Would that be in full line with the Spirit's activities?
J.T. Just so, "The planter and the waterer are one"; the ministry is all one, all under the Lord. God gives the results.
A.R. Would the man in @Acts 3 be an illustration of what has been said? Peter says to him, "Look on us", @Acts 3:4.
J.T. Very good. You may say that is looking in the direction of the saints. Well, never mind, "Look on us", he says, and they did too, on John and Peter.
