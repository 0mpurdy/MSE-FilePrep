BONDMEN OF GOD (1)
@Mark 13: 32 - 37; @Revelation 1: 1 - 6
J.T. What is in mind for today and tomorrow, if the Lord permit, is the subject of bondmen, to be worked out, as the Lord may help, from the position He took Himself, which indeed is exemplified in what we had yesterday afternoon, @John 13. We may see that the features of the truth in the book of Revelation stand connected with the thought of bondmen. The thought runs through the book and has a great application now, as indeed always, but particularly now, in view of the end. It is necessary to accept the moral import of bondmanship if we are to understand the mind of God as applicable to the end. Even the angel who is used to convey the Apocalypse to John is himself a bondman, as he says at the end, according to chapter 22: 9.
The verses read in @Mark 13 enter peculiarly into the subject before us, for the mediatorial economy is in mind in the Lord's remarks, by which He shows that even matters at the end, in relation to His coming, are in the exclusive knowledge of the Father, the Son eliminating Himself from that knowledge. Our Lord's remarks are only intelligible as we understand the mediatorial economy into which the Lord has come, even to the extent of taking a bondman's form. It is His having taken a bondman's form which explains His word that even the Son does not know. He likens Himself, as will be observed, to a man going out of his own country; "having left his house and given to his bondmen the authority, and to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch". Then, the closing
{2}
solemn remarks are, "Watch therefore, for ye do not know when the master of the house comes: evening, or midnight, or cockcrow, or morning; lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. But what I say to you, I say to all. Watch". The mediatorial economy is really in mind, and our position in it; for we also are placed in a mediatorial position and service as bondmen receiving the authority. Those who are in the attitude of bondmen receive the authority; the Lord gave them the authority, but the great stress is laid on *watching*.
H.B. Will you make it clear what you have in mind regarding the mediatorial economy?
J.T. That into which the Deity has come, as over against that which relates to absolute Deity, which is exclusive and beyond us, which no man has seen, nor can see. The Son here, one of the divine Persons, became incarnate -- to carry out the divine will and purpose, to make known what God is in a moral sense, so that we have the Father and the Son and the Spirit -- we cannot reverse that order. The Son and the Spirit have taken relatively lower positions, but yet each acting as God; and the mediatorial thought is carried down to the bondmen who have the authority. So that it is an order of things that is brought near to us, in which we *are* indeed; for as soon as one is secured through the gospel, one is taken into the administrative side of the position, and, in that sense, is in a mediatorial position. You have, for instance, in @Matthew 10: 41 the mediatorial idea coming down to a disciple -- "He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward".
{3}
Ques. Is the thought of bondmen worked out in us largely in our attitude of mind? I am thinking of @Philippians 2, "Let this mind be in you ..."
J.T. That is so. I thought we might see how the Lord has led in that way, as indeed in everything, and we learn from Him, so that, as you say, it is a question of attitude of mind. The types, of course, come in and enlarge on this matter -- the well-known one in @Exodus 21, for instance, the Hebrew bondman. The position in Exodus is the result of God coming in, but through a mediator. The principle of approach is that God is to be served in sonship -- "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (chapter 4: 23); and then, in chapter 21, we have the Son, in type in the Hebrew bondman, taking a bondman's form. The Lord is thus alluded to in the type, as becoming incarnate, and in love deliberately deciding to remain in that relation; He loves His Master and His wife and His children, so that it is a matter of His own volition, and it is a matter of love, and of love serving; going to the very lowest position to serve. The whole divine system is pervaded by love, by love that will serve one another and serve God. Then the teaching proceeds in @Exodus 28 and 29, and shows that the service is in priesthood; these chapters stipulate what is required by God in His service and stress the priest -- "that he may serve me as priest", and not only Aaron, but also his sons, "that they may serve me as priests". We see thus, that while sonship is the basis of the service, and bondmanship the full testimony of love (for it implies that the bondman went into death to establish the matter, it is a system in which bondmanship prevails, love actuating it, so that love will go to any length to serve), yet God's stipulation requires that there must be also intelligence and holiness, and hence the priesthood in chapters 28 and 29. I think all that enters into the book of Revelation.
{4}
J.T-y. Would you say the bearing of that comes out in @Deuteronomy 15, where Moses speaks of the bondman *and the bondmaid* professing to love. They do not go out, their ear is pierced, so that they bear lasting evidence of true bondmanship?
J.T. That helps as bringing the bondmaid into the position, that is the feminine side. The chapter contemplates a brother or sister being released through the liberality which marks sonship. Bondmanship implies subjection, and then love carrying you beyond what is obligatory; you go beyond what might be demanded, you go the whole road. That was Christ's attitude; He said, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life" -- it was His own thought to go that way, it was the power of love in Him.
Ques. Would verse 16 of @Deuteronomy 15 show that? The bondman says, "I will not go away from thee -- because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee". It is the attraction of love that makes him the bondman.
J.T. Exactly; what love is as active here in Christ, or in the saints -- the length to which it will go. John's epistle develops it as worked out in the saints. The mediatorial system, as inclusive of all who are thus actuated by love, I think is to be understood. It is important that it should be understood that as we are secured through love's appeal in the gospel, and the appeal that comes to us on account of the great sacrifice of love in Christ, so that one says, He "loved me, and gave himself for me", we recognise that we are taken into the divine mediatorial and administrative system. So the woman in @John 4 immediately becomes a vessel -- not that the Lord sent her, but she becomes a vessel in her own mind and carries the thought on. "If thou knewest the gift of God", the Lord says, "and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and
{5}
he would have given thee living water", that is, He was administrating. The verses at the end of chapter 3 state that "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" -- love underlies it all. The woman in @John 4 takes on the work, in so far as she can, and carries the truth to others; the administration is ever widening, so that the Samaritans learn the Lord as the Saviour of the world, through that administrative act of hers.
Ques. Referring to Peter as in @John 13, would he come into the mediatorial system you are speaking of as a result of the action of the Lord?
J.T. He would have "part" with Christ. The Lord makes much in that section of whomsoever He sends -- anyone receiving whomsoever He sends receives Him. It is the apostolic line, for the idea is a *sent* one. Peter as restored, fully set up in love, comes into the administrative side finally in chapter 21. The test was, "Lovest thou me?" -- the Lord accepted finally that he did love Him, it came to light, it was manifest in him. The word used in the last reference meaning objective knowledge, meant, that the Lord could now see that love for Him was there, it was manifest. That is the thought; if love be there, the administrative representative side is there; the Lord committed the care of His lambs and sheep to Peter.
H.C. Is the apostolic side seen in the beginning of @Mark 12?
J.T. Bond-service is there, conveying representation. Verse 2 says, a bondman was sent by the owner of the vineyard to the husbandmen; and again he sent another (verse 4); and again another (verse 5). What underlies bondmanship is love. One of the best examples of it is in @Luke 15, where the bondmen are employed to clothe the prodigal in his heavenly attire. There is no rivalry, they are doing it happily.
{6}
E.G. Is the thought seen in the letter to Philemon? Paul says of Onesimus, "whom *I* was desirous of keeping with myself, that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings".
J.T. Well, exactly. He became attached to Paul through the gospel, he was his child through the gospel, and he had desired to retain him for service, but crediting Philemon with his service.
Ques. The apostle, in the epistle to the Romans, speaks of himself as a bondman and then he speaks of the fact that he served God in his spirit; would that mean that his service as a bondman was carried out not in a legal fashion, but under the influence of divine love?
J.T. Yes. His very being was in it, he served God in his *spirit*.
E.G. Does that show that without love I am of no use in the economy? The *word* bondman might be used. In @Revelation 2 the Lord speaks of His bondmen; but they are corrupted by Jezebel's evil teaching.
J.T. Well, they would still be bondmen; an unconverted man might be used. I think the Lord alludes to Judas in @John 13 -- "He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me"; that is, Judas's words were undoubtedly used and he was representative of Christ, too, in his apostleship, but he was a lost man, and I have no doubt that what the Lord meant in alluding to him, as He does in verse 20, would cover the truth as it has come down to us.
It may have come through unconverted men, but it is not invalidated by that; it stands, the representation of Christ holds throughout the dispensation, although much may have come to us through men whom we could hardly say were characteristically bondmen. We may say that what has come down to us came down by the Spirit, which is true, but it has come down also through men, of whom some
{7}
could hardly be called bondmen characteristically; but yet the testimony has come to us.
Ques. Are you referring now to the preservation of the Holy Scriptures, and such like?
J.T. Yes, all that is under Christ; and in the service He used what was available, that is, the best there was. You see throughout Scripture that God carries on, but sometimes with very poor instruments. He used an ass, for instance, and other such instrumentalities; so that we cannot be exclusive in what we say of what the Lord may use. Our concern now is what is *characteristic* of the economy, that love is the great thought underlying it all, and it is a proved love. So that, as we have often remarked, Peter in his replies, appeals first to the Lord's conscious knowledge, that is, what He had divinely, He knew everything. "Thou knowest all things", he says; but what is in the Lord's mind or thoughts may not be unfolded to us. In verse 17 Peter uses the word for objective knowledge, saying, "thou knowest that I am attached to thee" -- then it is an attested love. John's gospel makes much of the attestation of things, even as to the water and the blood that flowed from the side of Jesus, the one who writes, witnessed the blood, and his witness is true. Then, in his epistle, he speaks of the threefold witness, the Spirit and the water and the blood. So that what is in the economy into which we are brought is not a concealed matter, it is an attested matter, and you want to be of it characteristically, so that you can say, like Peter, "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee".
A.W.R. Would that be seen in @Philippians 1, where the apostle speaks of some who preached Christ out of envy, but others of love, and the apostle rejoiced that the gospel was preached?
J.T. You cannot think that the ones who were preaching out of envy belonged to the economy
{8}
characteristically, but still the apostle rejoiced that the gospel was preached. What a difference in those who preached out of love to support what the apostle was standing for! He was stressing that his position in prison was representative; it was manifest in all the praetorium and to all others that his bonds were in Christ, that is, he is representative in the position. We do not want to be in any position that is not representative of God and of Christ. If one is under discipline he is not representative of the economy, he is in prison under penalty; he has sinned and is falsifying the economy.
Rem. The Lord said of Himself, "Altogether that which I also say to you".
J.T. Yes, He was representative personally. It is a very important matter now we are in the last days, whether there is any representation of the dispensation, of the administrative system which is in the hands of Christ.
H.C. Paul says, in @Acts 20, that he had declared to them the whole counsel of God, but then he says, "these hands have ministered ..."; and then he says, "I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring we ought to come in aid of the weak".
Ques. In connection with what you are saying, is it not significant that the case of the Hebrew bondman follows immediately on the giving of the law?
J.T. Yes, showing that love would fulfil the law. Jehovah unfolding His rights in @Exodus 20 speaks of the "thousands of them that love me" -- not that *should* love, but that *do* -- He knew them. We are not told who they were, but we have the great example in the Hebrew bondman. He says, "I love" -- "I love my master". He is the first one in Scripture who says, I love. That is the basis of all that follows. One said to the Lord, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
{9}
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets". @Matthew 22: 36 - 40. That is the position in Exodus, that love, as Paul said in Romans, is the fulfilling of the law.
C.S. Are the qualities seen in Abigail, who was prepared to serve as a bondwoman?
J.T. Well, she is a type of the assembly, of course -- the feminine side. It is well to keep that in mind, for Scripture develops masculine love and feminine love -- in a spiritual way, I mean; love takes these two forms. The feminine, of course, is in the assembly; the masculine flows out from God to Christ, that is the supreme thought.
J.S. The little maid who served Naaman was an example.
J.T. Quite so. She was really a slave, a captive maid, but she was full of right feeling. "Oh, would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria! then he would cure him of his leprosy", @2 Kings 5: 3. That is the thought, she is administrating the truth really, showing how the thing is brought down to the least; so Paul says, the least in the assembly may carry on judicial service amongst the brethren.
H.P.W. Are the features that are accredited to Philadelphia suggestive of the bondman, especially keeping the word of His patience, as being akin to watching?
J.T. Yes. The idea of bondmanship must enter to the state indicated in Philadelphia: "thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name".
E.G. The thought of watching in this is mentioned three times in @Mark 13, the first coupled with prayer.
{10}
J.T. I think we should keep that in mind, it is stressed -- "But what I say to you, I say to all. Watch". The allusion is to the strenuous conditions that would result from the Lord's leaving the disciples and shows the urgency of vigilance as attaching to bondmen. He gave to the bondman the authority, to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch; that is, do not let in extraneous or adverse elements; see to that, and then, "Watch therefore, for ye do not know when the master of the house comes". And then again, "What I say to you, I say to all, Watch". The demand is upon us to be vigilant, whether as regards those who come in, or as to current conditions in christendom, or in the world generally, or whether as to the Lord's coming; vigilance is urgent.
Now this leads us to the book of Revelation, and perhaps no passage confirms the idea of what we are saying as to the economy more than these verses in chapter 1; indeed I believe they allude to the verses read in Mark, in which the Lord says, that the Son does not know "of that day or of that hour". We have here, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him", that is, He is so representative of the economy that the revelation is *given* to Him; carrying out His thought in @Mark 13: 32. He takes that attitude.
H.P.W. Is it important for us to keep the two sides going on together? On the one hand, there is the work -- "to every man his work" -- and then the watching. Would that be watching the movements of the Lord, so that the work is to go on hand in hand -- the outcome of the communion of our hearts with the Lord Himself as to what He is doing?
J.T. Yes. There are three main thoughts: the authority is given to the bondmen, *the* authority, that is, the whole position is worked out down here in those who have the authority; and then the
{11}
"work", each one having his work; he is not sitting on an episcopal throne exercising his authority, he has his own work to do and he is doing it; then the watching. The "house" is the sphere in mind; the door-keeper would be vigilant in regard to any that might come in, or as to the order of the house, and so forth; then the general thought of watching as to the Lord's coming, and then finally, "What I say to you, I say to all, Watch". *Every one* is to watch.
H.P.W. Our work is to be co-ordinated; have we to guard against independency? -- it is His work and He gives it, so that whatever is given is carried out under the Lord.
J.T. That is right, and in the sense of "the authority". If Paul and Barnabas are to be selected for the work, the saints are taken into account -- the assembly at Antioch. "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". @Acts 13: 2. The Spirit is making the appointment, but He is taking the assembly into what He is doing; the authority is in that setting, but on the principle their being bondmen.
Ques. Ought there to be an understanding between us and the Lord as to what the work is?
J.T. I think so; the servant gets his commission from the Lord. The *public* assembly has *taken* on the authority, and exercises it, not only as regards fellowship generally and the support of ministers, but even as to the *appointment* of the ministers. This is not scriptural. The episcopal idea is that the gift comes down through the hands of the elderhood; but as set out in Scripture, gift is direct from the Lord -- "with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery"; they had *fellowship* in it, but the commission and the gift are directly from the Lord. @2 Timothy 1: 6 is, of course, apostolic. The assembly has no authority all in regard of a servant's commission or even in
{12}
regard of service; they may show sympathy and interest, but to his own Master he stands or falls.
W.H. Would that be seen when Saul said, "What shall I do, Lord?" -- and then he is told to go to Damascus, as if he learnt in the company of the brethren what his peculiar service and gift was?
J.T. Yes. His particular service was not marked out for him till he had served a year at Antioch, but initially it was to come through the saints at Damascus. So that no servant is sent out in independency; in normal conditions the saints lay their hands upon him. In due course it will be seen that his commission and his gift are from the Lord. At Antioch you get the full levitical thought: they committed themselves to Barnabas and Saul and "let them go", but they did not send them, they were "sent forth by the Holy Spirit".
Ques. Would the assembly be able to see gift as it comes to light, and be concerned as to its development?
J.T. I think that is right; the assembly should be able to name the effect of the divine work. As we see the effect of divine work we are to name it. Take for instance Barnabas, he was surnamed by the apostles "son of consolation" -- that was the fruit of the divine work.
Ques. How would you connect the Lord giving a commission to Judas with an unconverted man now taking up such a position?
J.T. We cannot say very much; it is a question of what Scripture recognises, that Judas was used; and even an unconverted man might be used of God in His sovereignty. We are, however, speaking now of the characteristics of the economy, the true thought is bondmanship and what underlies that thought is, love as seen in Christ.
G.C. Paul, in writing to Timothy, says, "the servant of the Lord must not strive".
{13}
J.T. A very important side of the instruction governing service.
H.B. You have referred to the ministerial side of it, those who are serving publicly; would it include the bondmen and bondmaidens who do not take up that service, but have other work?
J.T. Quite so; we are all taken into it. In Revelation the bondmen of the Lord were sealed on their foreheads, there are a hundred and forty-four thousand of them; we shall see that the idea is inclusive of all the saints; every saint is in principle brought into the administrative side of the economy, not only to be benefited in it, but to be a benefit in it.
Ques. Would @Colossians 4: 12 bring that in? It says, "Epaphras, who is one of you, the bondman of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always combating earnestly for you in prayers, to the end that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God".
J.T. Praying is certainly a good part of the service, and especially if you have to combat; it is real work. "For this cause I bow my knees", Paul said, meaning that the work is so great that it is pressing on you. So Elijah put his face between his knees; that is real service, agonising in prayer, combating in it, that the end might be reached. It is a question if here is a greater service that can be rendered than that, and Epaphras was that kind of bondman.
Ques. Would this thought of bondmanship apply especially today when, in some countries, governments are making demands on the saints, and, in other countries, it is trade unions and such-like organisations? Would all that be met on the ground that you are a bondman?
J.T. I think we shall be helped on that point; it belongs to chapter 7 of our subject, but it is well to have it in mind here so that we may see the drift of what is in view, the varied features into which the
{14}
subject of bondmanship enters. Chapter 7 refers to "the bondmen of our God" being sealed; but the beginning of Revelation is striking as linking, on, as I believe, with @Mark 13, and explaining what the Lord said, that the Son does not know, the angels do not know, the Father reserving the matter to Himself. "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw". There is nothing outside of what he saw, so it is all on the principle of bondmanship -- the bondmen are all to know this; but there is one selected, a trusted one, one whom Jesus loved, to whom the Lord signified this revelation. The word "signified" is taken from the word "sign" -- it is what marks the whole book, but John understands it. The Revelation is signified to him by an angel and he testifies it as "the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ". The book of the Revelation becomes, therefore, the word of God, and John was to testify all things he saw; he is thus a first-hand witness.
We can see thus how the principle of @Mark 13 is stressed here, and that in these last days, when these great things that are signified by the angel to John are taking place, or about to take place, our understanding of them depends on bondmanship. There are those who take up Revelation and make much of the signs and symbols and compare them with current events, and all that, but it is a question of "the word of God" and bondmen taking it up, it is shown to *them*. The whole book is sent to the seven assemblies, through John, but the general thought is that the Apocalypse is the Apocalypse of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him, and He signified it, sending by His angel, to His bondman
{15}
John. It was for the bondmen -- that Jesus might show to His bondmen things which must shortly come to pass, and it is signified by a bondman, a particular one, a known, trusted one, namely John, who carried the commission out faithfully -- he testified of all things that he saw.
Ques. John says, "and the testimony of Jesus Christ" -- what is the bearing of that, following on the word of God?
J.T. It is the "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him", and then John is the bondman "who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw". "Jesus Christ" is a well-known formal title, it is not exactly the anointed One, that is "Christ Jesus", but rather the kind of man in the position of Christ -- Jesus Christ; a well-known title, known to the saints as signifying quality, signifying endurance, what goes through in spite of all exigencies.
Ques. John here speaks of the importance of seeing and reading and hearing and keeping, do these four things suggest important features of the bondmen?
J.T. Quite so. There is a special blessing attaching to the reading of the book. "Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written in it". The bondmen would be marked by taking these things up, and it seems as if the Lord would encourage us at these readings now to persevere in these thoughts. Many may not be able to follow very well, none of us understands much, but the Lord, I think, would encourage us, by the premium attaching to this matter, to draw out the interest of the brethren here, young and old, so that we might come into this -- the blessing. This is all introductory, for John wrote I suppose, after the Apocalypse was given to him, the Spirit helping him, and it should be an
{16}
incentive to us to follow what the Lord sets forth, so that we might be more prepared to continue to the end in the attitude of bondmen. It is not optional; many take up things as if it were an optional matter, but there is no such thought in bondmanship as that; it is imperative, the will of the Lord is imperative, I must die to carry it out.
H.B. Do the "oughts" in John's first epistle enforce this?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. "The faithful and true witness" is to characterise all that there is for God?
J.T. Yes. Things are so often taken up lightly and superficially amongst us, as if they were just optional, but that will not do at all in the light of bondmanship.
W.B. Does Habakkuk give you an idea of a trusted bondman in his outlook and his care for the work of God? He says, "I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved", @Habakkuk 2: l.
J.T. I think that is an excellent confirmation of what has been said. All the prophets were marked by this, as we shall see at the end of the book, the angel was one of them.
J.G. In Hebrews the apostle says, "Obey your leaders, and be submissive; for *they* watch over your souls as those that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not groaning, for this would be unprofitable for you". Then I was thinking of the word in Mark, "what I say to you, I say to all, Watch". In Hebrews we are to watch lest any one fails of the grace of God -- a word to all of us -- "lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright". He "found no place for repentance although he sought it
{17}
earnestly with tears". In these scriptures we have the thought of authority in those who watch for our souls, and that we should watch lest any of us fail of the grace of God.
{18}
BONDMEN OF GOD (2)
@Revelation 7: 1 - 8; @Revelation 11: 15 - 18
J.T. It may not be known to all, some not having the better translation, that the word "servants" in these verses is more properly "bondmen" -- that is why they are read. It is thought that we should revert to chapter 1 in order to see how the bondman who was selected by the Lord, and to whom this book is signified, speaks of God, by the Spirit. He writes to the seven assemblies (verse 4), "Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come"; and in verse 8 we have a further announcement: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty". The Lord has been helping His people in regard to God, both as to His absoluteness, which is beyond us to comprehend or even apprehend, and also particularly in His relativeness as come into revelation through the incarnation of one of the Persons of the Godhead; and it is significant that, in the introduction to this book, we should have these allusions to God, first "who is", and then "who was", and then "who is to come". God is thus alluded to, first, as nearly as possible for our apprehension, as to what He is absolutely -- He who *is*; then what He is historically -- He who was; and finally what He is prophetically -- He who is to come.
Over against this we have, in the symbols of the living creatures in chapter 4, verse 8 -- "they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come" -- the *historical* side as to God is presented first by them, what He has been in relation to the creation. The reference in chapter 1 is significant, that the bondman selected by the Lord begins with God, as we may say, as nearly as possible in the absolute, and if the gain of the help the Lord has given has
{19}
been absorbed, there will be this more inward understanding with us as to God. In the book of Exodus, to which we have alluded already, we have, in Moses, a ministry corresponding somewhat with John's, that is, a ministry flowing out of the peculiar revelation made, Jehovah telling Moses to say, "I AM hath sent me"; Moses was to be representative of that, not simply of God as known historically by the fathers -- what He was, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, but of God "who is". He is Himself, aside from being the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He is greater than what is known of Him historically. In our giving of thanks in the assembly, as a rule, we are more conversant with the historical side, we speak of what is historical rather than of what God *is*. Now Moses was conversant with God as no one else was, evidenced by his writings in the Pentateuch, and in the first ascription of praise that we get (we may say the introduction of assembly service in type) (@Exodus 15), we have the first mention of Jah, which is an allusion to the great name revealed to Moses, but evidently a suggestion of a special insight that Moses had spiritually as to God. (See foot-note in the New Translation.)
I thought we might begin with that this time, that we may follow on in what God is doing and be equal to these great matters in the Apocalypse. This book is not something brought out; it is not a declaration, but a "revelation", and it contemplates we have been saying, bondmanship, but also spiritual capacity, because the Lord spoke to the overcomer in Philadelphia about *His* God, as if there would be understanding, not simply of God in a general sense, but of *His* God, that is, God known by man according to what God is.
Ques. Would God being all in all connect with "him who is"?
{20}
J.T. I think that is right; you allude to @1 Corinthians 15: 28. He is all in all, meaning that everything is filled with Him, it is not a mere objective thought there as to those who are blessed -- He is all *in* all.
Rem. I was thinking of your remark that we appear to know more about God in a historical way, than as to what He is.
J.T. Yes. Of course, worship is acceptable to God, whatever its measure, for He is seeking it -- He is seeking *worshippers* whatever their measure -- but I think this opening contemplates a great measure in those who are able to speak to God as He "who is, and who was, and who is to come". In verse 8. God Himself speaks, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty" -- He adds that very comforting thought.
Ques. What do you mean in saying, that God all in all is not objective?
J.T. Well, in one sense God is always objective, but I mean the two thoughts are together. He is all, but in the sense of being *in* all, that is, every vessel filled. In the new man "Christ is everything, and in all". God is all as in us, the vessels are filled completely; there is no vacuum, nothing unfilled, in eternity. I only wanted to begin with this great thought that the brethren might have in mind in our present reading what God has been doing in helping us as to Himself, especially in regard to our worship, because (and it is a remarkable thing) this book is marked by the thought of the worship of God. As I said, the selected bondman addresses the assembly in this way, saying, "Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of
{21}
the kings of the earth". Then there is the ascription of praise, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages. Amen". Then, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty", as if to confirm what the bondman had said by the Spirit and to secure everything -- He is the Almighty.
Ques. Would you say more on the thought of knowing God in an historical way?
J.T. Well, it is not to be despised at all, we must have the historical, and that is seen in Exodus, the first ministerial book. The revelation to Moses includes the historical side, but his commission was from the "I AM". He who *is*, as we get it here; but He said at the same time, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob", that is, the cumulative thought is there, always carried through, but the Lord Himself said, "Before Abraham was, I am", not 'I *was*', but "I am", carrying the great thought of God down. We have alluded to the place the historical side is to have in our service; of course it is to be valued, we cannot be without it, it involves the cross, it involves the testimony that has come to us, but then there is the great thought of "who is", and we should inquire whether we have spiritual power to speak to God viewed in that way.
H.P.W. Have we the two put together in the two quests of Moses? He said first, "shew me now thy way", @Exodus 33: 13 -- would that correspond with the historical? And then, "shew me thy glory" (verse 8). Would that be God Himself?
J.T. Yes, that helps. It requires the incarnation God to be seen in the sense of His glory, but in principle, the revelation made to Moses at the bush
{22}
is what we are speaking of -- "I am". The first great contribution for the service of God in song, it seems to me, involves an inwardness with Moses who is the leader of that song; it is alluded to indeed in this book as "the song of Moses". There is an inwardness in it, and the singers are carried far beyond where their feet were at the time -- not only to the abode of His holiness, which would be in the wilderness, in the tabernacle, I suppose, but into the place which He had prepared for Himself to dwell in -- He would bring them there; that opens up all that we have in David. Even in Moses himself, in @Deuteronomy 32: 39, much is made, as will be seen in the New Translation, of the title, the Same -- it is the Deity. You get "Jah" used by Moses, in @Exodus 15, and you get "the Same" in his great poetical contribution in @Deuteronomy 32. Singing seems to me to be the leading mode of God's service, because it involves spiritual emotions, these giving the Spirit more scope.
F.I. Is your thought that we should sing to God, referring to what He is in Himself?
J.T. Well, we sing to Him as made known, of course. He is declared and revealed; the declaration is one thing (@John 1: 18), and the revelation is another, which is usually to individuals or groups of persons; but then *He* has come. "No one has seen God at any time", but John says that "he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him".
H.C. Moses said in @Exodus 15, "Who is like unto thee. Jehovah, among the gods?"; in @Deuteronomy 32 he says, "He is the Rock, his work is perfect ... Just and right is he". Is all that in the sense of the present greatness of God?
J.T. I think so.
A.W.R. In @2 Samuel 7, David says, "And now, Lord Jehovah, thou art that God, and thy words are
{23}
true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant".
J.T. Yes -- "Thou art that God ..." He was there, as it were, surrounded by God, and sitting before Him. It is in such circumstances that we get the deepest thoughts of God, they may go beyond what we have reached hitherto. But as reaching these conceptions in spirit, we move towards them. @Exodus 15 is a pattern for us; the singers go far beyond what they have reached experimentally, but their contribution is a known thing in the service of God henceforth. What Miriam and the women said represents the experimental side. What Moses and the children of Israel say is more objective; but in the song the Spirit of God had scope, and hence greater penetration as to God and His purpose was attained.
A.R. When you speak of God in the absolute, do you include Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?
J.T. Not under those titles.
A.R. Do you include in your mind the three Persons?
J.T. Certainly, but those three names belong to Them in the economy in revelation.
A.R. I was thinking of how you are suggesting that we might address God as such, the God who is, that would include the three Persons in the Godhead, would it?
J.T. We have to make allowance for the change involved in the economy. In service Godward two of the Persons are on our side, that is, we are served by the Spirit of adoption and we are served by Christ as the Minister of the sanctuary, so that Ephesians says, "through him" (that is Christ) "we have both" (Jew and gentile) "access by one Spirit to the Father". It is through Christ, by the Spirit, we have access to the Father, and the Father is addressed as God.
{24}
A.R. I was thinking of God in the absolute, as you speak, not exactly of God as the Father, but the God "who is".
J.T. We must include the three Persons if we speak abstractly, but I think we ought to learn to regard Them as Scripture presents Them in the relations into which They have come: "to us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him", @1 Corinthians 8: 6. Christ has brought us in, but the Father is God as the objective.
F.I. As to addressing God in the absolute, can you have the three Persons before your mind thus?
J.T. You say, addressing God in the absolute; it is just a question as to how far we can apprehend God in the absolute -- I do not think a creature can. But it is plainly shown in Scripture that the Trinity existed before creation -- that is, in absoluteness, yet there was nothing for Them to be related to.
F.I. It is a question of what has been brought out, declared or revealed, that you are in a position to rise up and offer praise or worship to God in that sense, as that God.
J.T. Yes -- "who is"; but I would have the Father in mind if I were in assembly and speaking to God -- in fact at any time. It is through Him -- that is, Christ -- who has taken a place alongside us to serve us and to serve God, it is "through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" (@Ephesians 2: 18); that is, I think, the proper setting for the service of God. The Father is the "one God". You say, Well, it must include the others. But why should we say that, when They have come into an economy in which two of Them are viewed as in an inferior position, which *They have taken* in order to carry out the will and service of God? I do not think we should attempt to circumvent the position.
{25}
When you address God, you address the Father -- "to us there is one God, the Father", but at the same time it is plain that the Son and the Spirit are in inscrutable equality with the Father.
F.I. So that, when you address God you still have Him in view as the Father?
J.T. Well, it is how He is known. The title "Father" belongs to the relative position, but He is same Being. We can apprehend the idea of Father and apprehend Him as God. The title God conveys the idea of the Deity as understandable by man; it denotes the understanding men have from God, as to Himself, that He is supreme and has all authority, and so forth; but what is behind that we have to leave. He has come out to us in the relation of Father, which is intelligible to us, and all that He is enters into that, and I speak to Him as Father with that in mind.
Ques. Does the order in @John 20 help? The Lord says first, My Father, and then My God. Would you have the Father before you in moving up to the higher position -- you go that way?
J.T. God is the final thought, you mean?
Rem. Yes, but reached through the Father.
J.T. That is what I was thinking, the idea is progressive, the Lord beginning with "my Father", a very intelligible thought, for they contemplated Christ as an only One with a Father. Then you go on from that to "my God".
Rem. I suppose we have always to remember that there are certain things that have been revealed and that are available to us; there are also certain things that are secret, as it says in @Deuteronomy 29: 29; those are not available to us. We are to take advantage of what is revealed, and to leave the other as God has left it.
J.T. That is, I think, what we are being helped in. The statement as to God, abstractly, is that no
{26}
one has seen Him or can see Him; it is not exactly that He is secret, but the creature *cannot* see Him.
H.B. The glorious greatness of God is behind all that is revealed.
J.T. Yes. The idea of Father is intelligible; the Son is contemplated as with Him.
W.A. What would be involved in the last verse of @Ephesians 2 -- the saints being "builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit", and then the thought "God is a Spirit"?
J.T. It refers to the way He has come in to dwell with men, all that belongs to the economy; it is God dwelling here by the Spirit.
Rem. To address God intelligently, we must know Him as in the economy.
J.T. Yes, it is Christ's Father and Christ's God. So, in the book of Revelation, we have the Lord speaking to the overcomer in Philadelphia about His God four times over in chapter 3. I am only detaining the brethren on this point so that enriched, as is fitting, we might consider the book of Revelation. The bondman selected is a known and trusted one, one whom Jesus loved, and he brings God in and gives Him His place as God, and Christ His place as the Christ, and the Spirit His place as the Spirit -- the seven Spirits that are before His throne.
Rem. One who is in the bosom of Jesus would have the ability to bring that out.
H.B. There is an ascription of praise to God on this line in the last chapter of 1 Chronicles, as David addresses God according to His greatness apart from what is historical.
J.T. I think that in both Moses and David, and indeed in all the leading servants you get this. The more spiritual we are the more we shall seek to touch it, and will touch it -- this ascription of praise or worship to God because of what He is. Think of what it must have been to God to look down here
{27}
those who could speak of Jesus according to what He is! The prophets could all anticipate that.
We might just approach chapter 7 -- as to this matter of the bondmen being sealed by the seal of the living God. We have them in chapter 1, fully represented in John, apostle as he was, now the bondman; then we have them in chapter 2, the enemy seeking to corrupt them through Jezebel; she teaches these bondmen to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices, so that it is a warning to us, as taking up this attitude of bondmen, that we are still exposed to the corruption of Jezebel's religious influences. In chapter 7 God is beginning over again in relation to Israel, and they are viewed as His bondmen. The four angels are seen "standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the sun-rising, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we shall have sealed the bondmen of our God upon their foreheads". God is sealing His bondmen, but it is with the seal of the living God. This was called attention to this morning as over against other marks that are put upon men, and are so prevalent today.
S.S. Would it help to see from @Acts 2: 17 that bondmen and bondwomen are brought in as being sealed with the Spirit of God?
J.T. That is a passage that fits into our scripture, too, for the seal of the living God implies something of the Spirit, and this passage in @Acts 2 is suggestive of a divine call now for young men and young women, and men too, bondmen and bondwomen, to come into what God is doing. Here we have the "seal", so that the bondmen of God are marked off
{28}
-- it is the seal of the living God. They are alive in some sense, not dead, not following with the stream of trade unionism and all those other *isms* that are stamped upon men; there is a very loud testimony against it all now, yet many are held in these unions; they have their own mark, their own characteristic stamp.
S.S. One would be thankful if you could help us a little on that line, particularly having regard to the fact that many of us who are in particular callings, are often obliged to join societies of professional men, that we might be able to operate in the professional world.
J.T. Well, I think there is light enough amongst the brethren on the matter; what is needed is courage to suffer, courage to go forward in what is right and accept the consequent sufferings. I believe the way out, the way of deliverance for every one of us, is in the acceptance of the consequences of faithfulness to the truth, and that involves suffering. Of course, as to associations as in all else God is infinitely fair, and He treats each item by itself, as we learn in the prophet Amos, "For three transgressions ... and for four"; God takes each matter up by itself and regards it by itself, so that we ought to be discriminative, and not to be too general in our classification. If we are in an association that is murderous, there is no question about that, it is utterly out of keeping with the christian profession.
E.G. Is that why we have had the greatness of God brought before us, so that we might have power to withstand all these influences?
J.T. Verse 8 of chapter 1 is encouraging in that way -- it is "the Almighty".
H.B. A word that comes in in Corinthians is very encouraging in that connection: "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty", @2 Corinthians 6: 18.
{29}
A.E.L. In @2 Corinthians 1 we are sealed and anointed -- "He that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us". Could you tell us the difference between the two in connection with what we are saying?
J.T. That is an important passage, as linked on with what we are engaged with. "He that establishes us with you in Christ ... is God" -- a very great thought; then, "has anointed us" -- God has done all that. He "establishes us with you"; the minister is linking himself on with the saints, carrying them along with him indeed. 2 Corinthians is to show, among other things, that the minister, to be effective, is to carry the brethren along with him, not to rule over their faith; he is established with them by God, and anointed, too, by God. Then, God has sealed us. Anointing is for testimony, for dignity, power; sealing is to show ownership, that we belong to God and this gives Him His place. Then the third thing is, "given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts", that is, to set us up, enriching us with what is needed to support us in this position.
H.P.W. You made a reference to the word as to Philadelphia, "I will write upon him the name of my God", and I was wondering whether having the seal of God in their foreheads would show the uncompromising character they take up, seeing the dignity that is put upon them as having the name of God upon them. Would it help in connection with unholy associations such as trade unionism and the like?
J.T. I thought so. I think it is over against what we shall come to later in the mark of the beast. It is not only that it is wrong to have the mark of the beast, but God makes definite issue with it in chapter 14. What you allude to links on with what we are saying, only, of course, the idea of writing, as applied to an overcomer in Philadelphia, would mean
{30}
that he is material for *such* writing as that: "the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name". There is the additional thought of the writing material; it is remarkable material that the overcomer in Philadelphia affords; he is not an ordinary believer, but an overcomer in those circumstances, and evidently he is impressionable, one upon whom the Lord can write such exalted names.
Ques. What is the thought in being sealed in their foreheads?
J.T. Intelligence is involved, I think; but it is prominent, that which can be seen; that is, you are not a unionist privately or secretly, you are not one at all, because you have this in your forehead; you want to be consistent with this seal.
H.C. Would it be consistent with the apostle's word, "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity", @2 Timothy 2: 19?
J.T. Yes. It is iniquitous for a christian to be linked with an association that is murderous in its spirit. A christian is to respect what is rightly due to man and to think of God's rights in relation to himself and others.
Rem. The mark of the beast is on the hand as well as the forehead.
J.T. He is taking on, not only the mental ability of the people, but also their physical ability; they are taken on wholly for his use.
H.W.R. Is it important to note the words, "the bondmen of our God"?
J.T. The thought is used much here -- "our God", and we need to remember that; not simply "God", but "our God is a consuming fire".
Ques. He has power to deal with everything most drastically. Is there any connection between this
{31}
and the engraving of the names on the high priest's shoulders and breastplate?
J.T. This is more ownership; the other is engraving in precious stones, meaning that the saints are cherished in the affections of Christ, each according to his name. I suppose it is the tribes in testimony, because the actual names are not given in the breastplate; the twelve tribes are there, but according to sovereign arrangements not according to their birth, which would allude, I believe, to the position of the tribes as encircling the tabernacle; it is taking account of them down here, how they are supported in that relation. On the shoulder-pieces, it is according to their birth, but the names on the breastplate inside, I think, correspond with the positions of the tribes in testimony outside, so that they should be supported in dignity according to the counsels of God; they are set there according to divine counsels, not according to their birth. Here it is the bondmen of our God, and the administrative number is intensified, not only twelve, but twelve times twelve; that is, God has His bondmen now to carry on; and He is going on in a large way, and in those who are entirely amenable to Him, not controlled by other influences, such as unionism. That is what christians ought to be in this world. This, of course, is Israel in the future in view of millennial testimony, but we ought not to be behind them, they are entirely His in view of the great administration that is opening up. It is a great triumph that God has these, and the winds are held up till He carries out this sealing.
E.G. What is the significance of the angel ascending from the sun rising?
J.T. The allusion, I think, is to the dawn of another day. The west is the *end* of something; the rising of the sun is always full of hope, spiritually it is what God is going to do *now*, and there is
{32}
assurance in the fact that He has His bondmen and He is sealing them and they are numbered -- He has made a selection. Notice, it is "out of" in every case, that is, they are taken out for a purpose and taken out of all that is contrary to God. They are entirely for His will -- the manipulative number twelve means that.
W.H. Would the representative number from each tribe represent that there is an answer to the truth in every feature of it?
J.T. Yes, the divine thoughts extending back to Genesis are to be worked out in spite of all. "These are the twelve tribes of Israel". They begin in Genesis, and God has never lost sight of them; now He has got them and they are His *bondmen*.
A.E.L. Why is the tribe Dan omitted?
J.T. Dan introduced apostasy into Israel, possibly that is the reason. The twelve tribes will be there, but his name is not given.
Ques. Is the expression "out of" an exercising word?
J.T. I thought so -- that, is why I mentioned it. Certainly I do not want to be in anything that is contrary to this seal. "Sealed out of" -- I suppose the tribes will be there in an external way; they are now going back to the land in unbelief, but God is going to make a selection, and this will be the fruit of His own work in them.
Rem. I was thinking of brethrenism in itself -- it may be the bondmen of God will come out of that as out of everything that is set up.
J.T. Yes, brethrenism may merge into Edom; that is really what it is. Brethrenism as a recognised religious sect on earth takes on the character of Edom; and God says at the end of the Old Testament, *I hate Edom*. It is not a question of christians individually, but the thing itself, according to the principle and history of it.
{33}
BONDMEN OF GOD (3)
@Revelation 10: 5 - 11; @Revelation 11: 15 - 18; @Revelation 15: 2 - 4
J.T. We are all aware, no doubt, that the word "servants" in these passages is properly rendered "bondmen", and what perhaps will occupy us chiefly this morning is the *prophetic* services of the bondmen of God. John himself is to be viewed in this book as a prophet, styled formally bondman of Christ, but in chapter 10 he is viewed as a prophet, having prophesied, and being told that he should prophesy *again*, because of certain conditions that rose in him as the mind of God was assimilated. The Lord Himself is seen as speaking under the guise of an angel in verses 5 to 7; the facts presented in the chapter show it is the Lord Himself. As having title to all below, He puts His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the land and swears "that there should be no longer delay; but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound with the trumpet, the mystery of God also shall be completed, as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets". The Lord's words here direct our attention to what God has made known to His own bondmen the prophets, that is, the glad tidings, and that they, in their ministries, had spoken of the mystery of God. God's bondmen are taken into His thoughts, as He said, "the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets", @Amos 3: 7.
Whilst special prophets are in mind here, it may be profitable to call attention to the place that the prophetic ministry is obtaining amongst the saints, and to inquire whether this scripture, indeed, the whole book of Revelation, does not enter into it, for it is a question of bondmanship in those who minister,
{34}
those who prophesy, and their being in the secrets of God, having understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, being conversant, too, in the closing days with the mystery of God, knowing that what is now in mystery shall soon be disclosed publicly. The Lord Jesus, in this chapter, is seen as taking possession in principle, or title, of the sea and the earth and asserting these things. Those of us who would take part in prophetic ministry, opportunity for which is available, are to understand that we are to be in the secrets of God. The Lord is giving assurance in the ministry He is giving, corresponding with this chapter, of His title to all, not only in heaven, but on earth, where men and nations are making so much of their titles and rights. There is so much aggressiveness in rulers that the Lord would steady us in taking us into His thoughts as to His rights to everything, and that we do not relinquish them, we stand by them. I thought we might have that before us, and the terms on which John is to be allowed to continue, for we are tested in the continuance of any ministry we may have. The testimony here was that the little book, as eaten, was in his mouth sweet, but in his belly bitter, and so it is said, "Thou must prophesy again", as if he is thus qualified to continue; it is a renewed test to him, as we all are tested in our services.
H.B. What is the point in the effect upon him, making his belly bitter?
J.T. I think it is that you *feel* things, you feel the effect of the accomplishment of the divine counsels and what the process is for the saints, what is involved in it for them, and for men generally. John was representative, I think, of a servant who feels things, both in regard to God's feelings and man's; we are not to be unfeeling in our service. The word of God is sweet as it is, to faith, to those who love God, but still, the consequences of it, or what it
{35}
discloses, may occasion much sorrow, and we are not to be unfeeling about that.
H.B. Then, it is not only the effect of his service on the one who serves, but he feels the effect of it on others.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. There is much sorrow current, and there will be more. God is going on with His ways, and of course the great culmination of His governmental ways will be Jacob's sorrow. It is a question of the spirit of prophecy always, the testimony of Jesus. "Jesus wept" -- it enters into the testimony of Jesus, that He could weep as seeing the sorrow of others.
Ques. The order in verse 9 is that the bitterness comes first; what would you say to that?
J.T. That was what the angel said, "Take and eat it up: and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey". I suppose that is the consideration of God for the servants, divine feeling, sympathy with us in our service as to what we have to go through. The Lord said of Paul that He would show him what great things he had to suffer. Actually, the sweetness was first.
A.W.R. Would Jeremiah be an example of that chapter 4: 19 in regard to Jerusalem? "My bowels! my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war". Would he be a sample man for the present day in taking up the spirit of prophecy?
J.T. Jeremiah is a representative prophet, a feeling prophet; he is the only one who wrote a book of lamentation; he represents the side of the truth we are speaking of.
Ques. Do you get the same thought suggested in Ezekiel, when he had eaten the roll, he lay on his
{36}
left side for three hundred and ninety days to bear the iniquity of the people of Israel, and for forty days on his right side to bear the iniquity of Judah? Does he represent one who bore in his spirit the feelings of sorrow that enter into that moment?
J.T. Quite so, he is representative, not only of the feelings of Christ, but of the actual sufferings of Christ. The testimony of Jesus is what is in mind in the prophecy, the spirit of it.
E.G. Is it your thought that the contents of this little book would probably involve details of the life of Jesus as a bondman?
J.T. Well, it is a *little* book, the details of the life of Jesus will make a *big* book; John himself said that if the things which Jesus did were fully written, the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. The littleness of the book would imply that its contents are not for enlargement, but necessary for the testimony. It is the history of Europe, I believe, that is, the history of the area in which the testimony has been in this dispensation. It is *opened*, it is not a mystery: it is *known*, and the fact that it was to be eaten would convey that although what it conveyed was known, it was not taken to heart. John was now to understand that serious consequences were involved in its accomplishment. The history of Europe is not a mystery, although the mystery of iniquity has been developed in it, and is intelligible to the initiated, but the actual history is a small matter; things relative to the testimony directly and indirectly, enter into it, but generally it is a question of a few things -- man's will, and God does not enlarge on that too much. He gives us enough, however. The little book is, of course, more than mere history; it is the mind of God as to the history: what would be the result judicially of the history -- already known, but now to be taken to heart as to its full bearing.
{37}
Ques. Would the last verse bear out your suggestion in connection with the history of Europe?
J.T. Yes -- "Thou must prophesy again as to peoples and nations and tongues and many kings". It is the mind of God, of course, but the little book gives you, in a small compass, what is to be known, and the suggestion is, I think, that we are not to spend too much time on current events. The little book is in the hands of Christ, and, as it were, it is all open, the end is sure. So that, in these verses that were read earlier, it says, he "cried with a loud voice as a lion roars", but in these verses it is a question of the *completion* of things, and what is interesting peculiarly is that the mystery of God is to be completed "as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets".
Ques. What is the significance of that -- the mystery of God being completed?
J.T. Well, it is not exactly what we call the mystery of the assembly. Paul had that peculiarly. It is what lies in the prophetic testimony of the Old Testament as well as the New, that the Lord Himself carried on, the prophetic ministry recorded in the three synoptical gospels. It is what God had in His mind in regard of His earthly people, how all will come out and develop publicly, but He directs our minds to God's bondmen the prophets, and that it was the glad tidings. I think if we read the prophets with this in mind, they will open up to us.
Ques. Would the bitterness that follows the eating of the little book stand in contrast to the world and the men of it who would read this history with great pride and exultation?
J.T. Just so. *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* and all modern occurrences are read with avidity. It is not that they should not be understood, but I think the suggestion is that things are told to us in a few words.
{38}
Rem. The little book, in that way, would enable one to prophesy in the midst of those conditions.
J.T. I think so. I think one should have a general understanding of what is in the little book. The Lord gives a prophetic outline in @Matthew 24, @Mark 13, and @Luke 21 -- three aspects of it. They are not copied from one to the other, but the discourse is comparatively brief; it is all, as it were, the Lord has to say on this matter. He has said enough for faith. In understanding what He said, and of course what is opened up by the other ministers -- Paul and Peter particularly, and Jude, and now in the Revelation -- one is able to take part in the ministry meeting, as we say, and to speak with intelligence and point, bringing in the mind of God as to all that. The Spirit being here would enlarge on what is written in the souls of the prophets, those who prophesy, so that the mind of God is understood.
W.H. Would the glad tidings be the unfolding of the mind of God in regard of Christ, giving you great scope, but the little book referring to what would stand in the way of that?
J.T. What is in it? -- exactly. One is struck with the number of prophets, major and minor, and the prophetic outline running through the New Testament, all entering into the gospel; the heart of God is set forth in the gospel and His bondmen are brought into His thoughts, hence the prophet Isaiah is evangelical. It is most thrilling, as you might say, at times, to read the magnificent strains of Isaiah in the gospel, and so, in measure, throughout all the prophets.
G.C.S. That is why Isaiah speaks of the nations as a drop in the bucket and fine dust in the scales.
J.T. Yes. The nations in themselves are nothing, and God sits on the circle of the earth. They are nothing in His mind, but then He has the gospel in mind, and a man who is needing the gospel is
{39}
reading the prophet Isaiah, he is going down from Jerusalem to Ethiopia reading the fifty-third chapter; and the evangelist says, "Understandest thou what thou readest? And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?" So "Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus", @Acts 8: 31, 35. That is the setting of the truth as we are speaking of it.
H.P.W. Do you think, in seeking to present the gospel in these days, we should have in mind the almost immediate appearing of the glory, and therefore we should speak in a powerful way of the coming of Christ and the kingdom? Should this have a large place in what we say?
J.T. I think it should, I do not know if you have counted up the appellations of the gospel in the Scriptures.
H.P.W. Yes, there are eighteen or nineteen.
J.T. Yes; showing the wonderful interest of God in the presentation of the gospel. The prophets inquired into the things they ministered -- "what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these. To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things, which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven", @1 Peter 1: 11, 12. All is gathered up in the gospel.
E.G. Will you say a little more as to the book being sweet in his mouth.
J.T. Well, I think the mind of God is always sweet to one who loves Him. "Thy words were found", says Jeremiah, "and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart", @Jeremiah 15: 16. But then he knew how to be sorrowful, too.
{40}
H.B. You have referred to the ministry meeting and to what should come before us in connection with prophecy; do you think, from what has been suggested in these scriptures, that it should have a bearing on the present conditions amongst the saints, or in the world, as the case may be?
J.T. I think so. I think, as has been suggested, the little book should be understood, because what is current is generally exaggerated in its significance; we are apt to exaggerate what is occurring. One who understands the little book would say, "he who now letteth [hindereth] will let until he be taken out of the way", @2 Thessalonians 2: 7. That is, *He is functioning*. While the appointed means of preventing the rise of antichrist is functioning the antichrist will not come; there may be antichrists, but *the* antichrist will not come; and our prayers should be always based, in that respect, on that sure word of promise. There *is that which* hinders and *He who* hinders, and they are functioning, so that whatever may occur in the meantime *is not final*, it is tentative more or less, to acquaint the saints with what is coming, that we might have sympathy anticipatively with the brethren that are to take our place here. They will suffer, but the Lord has promised the assembly through His letter to Philadelphia, that we shall be kept out of the great tribulation that is to come on all the earth to try them that dwell on the earth. Persons who are dwelling on the earth characteristically, even if christians, are to be solemnly warned, of course, but the heavenly saints are to be taken out of that, and that is a great comfort. Yet the little book is intended to instruct us by inference that we are not to be indifferent to current things. There is a protracted bearing of the book of Revelation, that it has reference to what was current when it was written, and what has occurred ever since too, bearing on the testimony of God, but then, it
{41}
mainly refers to a critical time, that is, the time after the hindering power is removed. In understanding this we are enabled, by what is and has been current, to understand what will be; and the prophetic ministry in our meetings ought to bear on all these things, so as to help the saints not to be merely theoretic. Surely I am not to be an earth-dweller if the tribulation is intended for earth-dwellers! -- that is the moral effect of it.
F.I. When you say we should be acquainted with current events, you refer, I take it, to what is taking place among the nations of the world now? In what way is that profitable for us?
J.T. It is God's provision, it is preparatory. The book of Revelation contemplates what has transpired from the time it was written, or given, until the end; but 2 Thessalonians teaches us that there is a hindering power. There is the mystery of iniquity which has been, and is, working, but there is the hindering power, so that it cannot develop *fully* until the hindrance is removed, and we can count on that, it functions and will function. In current events we get indications of what *will* happen, and that enables us to understand this book -- the section we are looking at now -- and to see how a thing can happen quickly; what would not be expected or dreamed of ten years ago has come to pass. The critical stage contemplated in this book implies that things will come to pass very quickly -- "When they may say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction ..." I think it should sober us, but it gives us an understanding, an insight into things, to see this. We are speaking of the prophetic word; it will not help us to look deeply into the newspapers. How voluminous they are as over against the little book! The Lord would say that the latter is all that is needed. And He can make this remarkable announcement, bearing on what was made known to God's bondmen
{42}
through the glad tidings, that that is coming to completion. Well, that is very comforting.
Ques. Would it be right to say that one result of eating the little book would be, "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men", @2 Corinthians 5: 11?
J.T. Well, exactly -- the terror of the Lord.
H.B. How would the voices in heaven, in chapter 11, bear on this? Would that be future, or is there a present bearing connected with it?
J.T. Well, it is the seventh angel sounding now. The Lord said, in the verses read in chapter 10, "the seventh angel, when he is about to sound" -- that is beforehand, but in chapter 11 we have the seventh angel sounding his trumpet. I am wondering whether the brethren are gathering up anything about the prophetic ministry, for John is reminded that he can now prophesy again. It is not because there are meetings that we can go on, there must be right feelings with us. So, in the beginning of chapter 11, we have two prophets, and they suffered -- let us not leave that out, that the prophets are sure to suffer. "Which of the prophets", said Stephen, "have not your fathers persecuted?" There was no prophet that was not persecuted -- so we may as well expect suffering. The two witnesses are called prophets, and they suffered.
Ques. Do you suggest that prophetic testimony is something additional to what we have had, the Spirit speaking at certain moments, prophetic ministry coming in in keeping with the conditions?
J.T. Yes, it meets current need. It is no question of foretelling future events, yet there is the spirit of that in it. It is always the testimony of Jesus, so that as the prophetic ministry searches a man, the secrets of his heart are made manifest, and the first result is that he worships God, and that is the great burden of the book we are considering, and the prophets,
{43}
too -- that God is to be worshipped. We are so prone to be diverted and make other things, perhaps business, an object, besides God. John himself had to be directed, in this book, that he should not worship an intermediary of God -- to worship God is the thing. So that prophecy, in this book particularly, is to subdue our hearts and remove from us all commanding objects but God; the Lamb, of course, is also to be worshipped -- but worship God. An unbeliever comes into the meeting and he hears the ministry, and the secrets of his heart are made manifest, and falling down he worships God. That is the great result, the great burden of the moment, the worship of God; that God is the supreme Object of worship, and *how* He is to be worshipped. The prophetic ministry affects a person so that he worships God, and then he reports that God is among you of a truth.
F.I. By bringing in the thought of the two witnesses, are you thinking that, for ministry to be effective, it must be preceded by right feeling and suffering?
J.T. Well, feeling goes with it; the assimilation of the little book causes deep feeling, and then the word, "Thou must prophesy again". You will not be set aside, another will not be taken up instead of you. Then, as a prophet, as a known person, who conveys the mind of God, according to chapter 11, you are persecuted. This is a searching matter. All this comes in between the sounding of the sixth and seventh trumpets; it is in the interval just coming on to the end that these things happen.
Ques. Is prophetic ministry only given in meetings convened for that purpose?
J.T. I think prophetic ministry may come into a meeting like this; there may be something for us *now*; the Lord seizes any opportunity to speak to
{44}
us, to search our hearts, the secrets of our hearts, and to make known the mind of God.
Ques. In what way would the prophetic ministry be given through sisters now? We read of women in the Acts who prophesied.
J.T. Well, we have to go by the fact that it *did* take place. We cannot say that it *is* taking place. I cannot say that I have much experience of it, but I can see that a sister could convey the mind of God in a prophetic way.
Rem. The woman of Samaria said, "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet"; then the Lord opened up to her the thought of worship, and, as a result of that, she goes into the city and speaks the word.
J.T. That is a good scripture in regard to what we are saying. We have often marvelled that the Lord spoke to that woman of worship, but the basis of that part of the conversation is that she says to Him, "I perceive that thou art a prophet". She was convicted and she proceeds to speak about worship, and the Lord carries on the conversation and says wonderful things to her on that great subject; but prophetic ministry is most important, for it deals with the secrets of our hearts.
W.B. Do you think that the prophet is conscious when he is speaking that the word is penetrating, that it is gripping the saints, so to speak?
J.T. He may be, I think he would be; but the thing is, is it penetrating, so that the secrets of the hearts of the persons who hear are made manifest?
Ques. Does it also affect the conscience? -- he is convicted of all.
J.T. I am glad you mention that, that is, all the saints present are brought into the thing. The man feels that everybody knows now, it is all out.
Ques. Is that character of ministry mostly when we are together?
{45}
J.T. Yes, it is the kind of ministry, more than the individual prophets, that is in mind here in the meeting contemplated in the chapter -- @1 Corinthians 14: 23.
Ques. Is that why the persecution comes?
J.T. Yes. If a man's conscience is touched by the ministry, and he does not judge himself, he is apt to persecute you. The general thing is that this ministry as current brings out persecution.
Ques. Would the meeting for prophetic ministry indicate to the Lord that we are desirous that He should speak to us; whereas, in other meetings, the Lord might approach Himself as seeing the need?
J.T. The Lord would take advantage of *any* opportunity, I believe, to speak to His people. "As they were listening ... he added and spake a parable", @Luke 19: 11.
H.B. We have an illustration of that in the prophetic word of Stephen. The message was so powerful that they must either bow to it or kill the man who carried it.
J.T. Yes, they were cut to the heart, and gnashed on him with their teeth. These ministry meetings are arranged so that there should be such a ministry, for @1 Corinthians 14 particularly deals with an actual meeting. It is not a sub-division of the assembly at Corinth, it is "the whole assembly come together in one place", as if God would say, This is My best, this is where I can operate most effectively. The ministry searches out the inwards of a man, his secrets are manifest, and he is convicted of all, judged of all; but he falls down and worships God and he reports that God is among you of a truth. He is part of the divine system now, in reporting where God is -- that God is among the christians.
H.P.W. Do you think that the day is such that the saints might definitely pray for expansion of this present ministry? One wonders whether, in our
{46}
ministry meetings, we have reached as far as the Lord would have us go?
J.T. I do not think we have. It is something the Lord is opening up as a provision in view of current most difficult times; and what is very important is transparency, that the secrets of our hearts are made manifest, that we should feel and own wrong things that are exposed, the dark spot should vanish. The passage read in chapter 15 says, "I saw as a glass sea, mingled with fire, and those that had gained the victory over the beast and over its image, and over the number of its name standing upon the glass sea, having harps of God". That is the thing, everything is open; these are a victorious people, people who have had their hearts searched and their secrets made manifest, and they are victorious over everything. They are not overcome by trade unionism or anything else of the kind; it says they gained the victory over the beast and over the number of its name. They are standing upon the sea of glass having harps of God. They are singers, they are victorious singers, everything made manifest, and therefore we get the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb -- the song of Moses, the bondman of God, that is the kind of man that is before them. It is Christ, of course, but it is the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb that they are singing; for the prophetic ministry is to result in the worship of God, it is to make singers of us. I am not overlooking chapter 11 -- "And the nations have been full of wrath, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the recompense to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those who fear thy name, small and great; and to destroy those that destroy the earth". That is, the bondmen are coming into their recompense -- that is in chapter 11; but the fifteenth chapter is an end, as you might, say, of this lesson, it is the kind
{47}
of people that are victorious and how they are made singers, and they have harps, *heavenly* musical instruments.
E.G. So they are in the good of the whole song now, and further on than when Moses sang, in @Exodus 15.
J.T. I think they are beyond Moses now. They have indeed their own song, as their words show. The character of their singing is what is presented, for we are told what they sing -- "Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and do homage before thee; for thy righteousnesses have been made manifest". That is what they say, but they sing the song of Moses, the bondman of God, and the song of the Lamb. What they sing would bear the character of these songs.
Ques. Would you say that we see a touch of this in @Acts 16, where Paul and Silas in praying, sing praises to God, and then the jailor falls down and worships God?
J.T. Well, there is something corresponding in that -- "in praying, were praising God with singing", showing that the service of God involves that the servants are superior, they are victorious in the most excruciating sufferings; they were victorious and sang praises to God and the prisoners heard; the prison was turned into a temple and the sufferers were the worshippers.
Rem. In chapter 13: 4 the challenge is put out, "Who is like to the beast? and who can make war with it?" Chapter 15 would indicate that there are those who have the victory.
J.T. Just so. God is all; it is the God of the Old Testament, of course; we are here on Old Testament lines, the continuation of the testimony there, but it is the suffering position. Moses had just gone through the judgments of God on Egypt; it was no
{48}
light matter, but he became greater and greater -- the man Moses was very great. It is what the bondman of God becomes morally in going through things with God, and now he is singing on the wilderness side of the Red Sea; it is the bondman of God. How he could write about the Hebrew bondman!
Ques. In chapter 13 there is an appeal to the one with understanding to count the number of the beast, and in chapter 15 they get the victory over the beast, and over its image, and over the number of its name.
J.T. "He that has understanding let him count the number of the beast: for it is a man's number: and its number is six hundred and sixty-six". It can never be anything but a man's number, and it is short of spiritual perfection. But in chapter 15 it is the greatness of *God* that is seen. The victorious ones say, "Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty". The elders in chapter 11 refer to "who is" in the verses read. "And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, saying, We give thee thanks, Lord God Almighty, He who is, and who was, that thou hast taken thy great power and hast reigned". They understand God: not simply as the God of the Old Testament, Jehovah Elohim Shaddai, but He who *is* and who *was*, who has taken His great power and reigned; and that is over against the number of the beast. It is countable, countable by wisdom; these had gained the victory over that, over the image of the beast and over the number of its name. They are victorious over all this, they have gone through it and met the thing in their experience and overcome it; with all its loud speaking and pretension, they have overcome the number of its name. The beast represents the acme of human power and the "name" would be that concentrated so as to be intelligible to man.
{49}
Ques. Would you say the knowledge of God as He *is* would fortify us against this?
J.T. That is the point, it is with God we have to do. The elders say, "who is, and who was", but these victors understand and they sing of God as the Lord God Almighty -- Jehovah Elohim Shaddai. They take in the great names of God known to the patriarchs and to Moses, and they say, "righteous and true are thy ways, O King of nations. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and do homage before thee; for thy righteousnesses have been made manifest". They are dealing with the history of the earth and the nations, they are the Jewish remnant undoubtedly, those who belong to Israel, but they know God. They are not on the same level as the assembly, but they are on a high level; they worship God, and speak of others who will do so: "all nations shall come and do homage before thee". We see in chapter 11 that the twenty-four elders worship God -- it is the completion of the whole matter. The seventh trumpet is the completion of the whole matter; it is really, "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come" -- not "the kingdoms of this world", as in the Authorised Version.
H.B. Why do they not refer to the prophetic side -- "who is to come"?
J.T. Well, I suppose what they say is enough for the position; Scripture is infinitely accurate. What takes the place of "who is to come" is that He *has taken* His great power. He who is and who was -- "thou hast taken thy great power and hast reigned". There is no longer anybody to come, He has come, He has taken His great power, and is reigning.
H.B. They have now *reached* that prophetic period.
{50}
J.T. Quite so. It is the completion of things here, and every point reached involves worship or praise.
Ques. Does John in chapter 5 of his first epistle give its present bearing on the saints in regard to his victory over the world?
J.T. Quite so. "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?" I think what the brethren might take in is the bearing of prophecy, the prophetic ministry and the concurrent result, namely, the worship of God. The song of Moses, "the bondman of God", comes into the worship of God; his song is included in the services of these victors.
J.M. As a practical application of what is in your mind: if I were connected up with a trade union, would the prophetic ministry come in to set me free therefrom, and, as being set free, would I experience something of God and of the knowledge of Him in this way, and, as gathering that knowledge, would I become a worshipper?
J.T. Yes, you get a harp; no trade unionist has a harp, a harp of God. This is clearly seen in the passage in chapter 15, which we have been considering (verses 2 - 4).
J.M. I would like, then, to ask, would you distinguish between a government provision and a trade union?
J.T. Certainly, government is of God; *in principle*, it is always good -- "it is God's minister to thee for good". @Romans 13: 4 -- that is a different matter.
Ques. Do you make any distinction in these unions? You spoke of what was murderous.
J.T. If we understand that one, we will understand the others; it is a question of *degree*. But we should understand the murderous one first; that is the key to the whole position. Even a trade combination
{51}
against trade unionism may be murderous, although not in the sense of open violence; but they have monopolies to take away the lives of other people, to crush them to death (@Proverbs 1: 19) -- it is the same thing in that sense. But the open disregard of the rights of God and men, backed by violence even to the extent of murder, should weigh first with every christian and forbid him to have any part in such combinations.
{52}
BONDMEN OF GOD (4)
@Revelation 19: 1 - 10; @Revelation 22: 1 - 9
J.T. These scriptures complete, I believe, the references to bondmen in the book. The subjects are the destruction of the great corruptress of the earth, who is described earlier, particularly in chapter 17, and then the marriage of the Lamb, and then the function of the bondmen in the millennial state of blessing, indeed in the heavenly city -- it is said in chapter 22 that "his servants shall serve him, and they shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads". Finally, both in chapters 19 and 22, we have the danger noted of servants, or bondmen of the Lord, worshipping others than Himself, that danger always existing; even, as in John's case, the most honoured are exposed to this danger. At the beginning of chapter 19 attention is called to the avenging of the blood of His bondmen, the bondmen of God, at the hand of this corruptress of the earth. In verse 5, "a voice came out of the throne, saying. Praise our God, all ye his bondmen, and ye that fear him, small and great", so that all bondmen are called into this celebration of praise; the occasion of it is negative, but it calls attention to the interest of the bondmen of God in this great deliverance, the destruction of the harlot. We have already spoken of current events in relation to chapter 10, what we may call political or international events. What is contemplated here is current history, history that enters into the assembly period, the present dispensation, and the bondmen of God are assumed to have interest in, and to know, this history, for it has affected the assembly, the service of God, almost throughout the entire dispensation.
Rem. I was wondering if the letters to the seven assemblies contain education for the assembly.
{53}
J.T. Yes, the history of the assembly is involved in those letters, in chapters 2 and 3, but the history of the work of God is also involved in them; so that we have the positive side running through. The bondmen would all be regarded as interested. Here we have the end of the history of the great harlot as she is called -- this is final, and hence the remarkable celebration, as if it is a burst of relief from the awful pressure that the spiritual had been under, because of this system.
Ques. Is the history that you refer to now more what might be termed religious history, than political history?
J.T. That is what I was thinking; chapter 10 contemplates more what is political, but as related to the testimony, the nations. This is a religious system, and we may call it a spiritual one, for it is characterised by the presence of spiritual influences, great Babylon is said to have "become the habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hated bird". So that we have to regard her, not only as the religious organisation, but as a system characterised by evil spiritual power.
E.G. I notice that in chapter 18, the word is to "heaven ... saints and apostles and prophets", but here it is addressed to "his bondmen"; have you any thought as to the difference?
J.T. It is a question of judgment in chapter 18 -- "Rejoice over her, heaven, and ye saints and apostles and prophets; for God has judged your judgment upon her". It would appear that they are regarded as having formed a judgment as to her, and now God is executing it. Chapter 19 is more inclusive; I suppose that verse in chapter 18 is exclusive, that is, it contemplates the highest spiritual intelligence, judgment and discernment. Saints are put first, then apostles, and then prophets; but all are called into
{54}
this ascription of praise in verse 5 of chapter 19 -- it is more general -- "Praise our God, all ye his bondmen, and ye that fear him, small and great".
H.B. Would that imply that the bondmen would be characteristically in keeping with the judgments of God upon this system?
J.T. Well, that is what is in mind; but chapter 18: 20 is more specific as to greatness and spirituality, as inclusive of those who were most capable of judging, heaven itself and the saints -- which of course is a characteristic word -- and then the apostles and prophets; they have a judgment of the system -- "your judgment". God is honouring them as executing what they have judged, and I think the verse enters into all our disciplinary meetings -- one would make it practical -- how heaven ratifies the judgments we have reached; if it does not, they are not effective, because our judgments ought to have always a wide bearing, the full bearing of the assembly. The execution of divine judgment now is in the assembly, hence the importance of @Matthew 18: "If ... he will not listen to the assembly ..." it is authoritative, it is invested with the heavenly prerogative as to discipline and judgment generally.
H.B. Do you mean then that in our judgments in the assembly, the universal position should be kept in view?
J.T. Yes; it is never to be *merely* local. So the apostle, in directing the discipline at Corinth, introduces his own spirit into the position, saying: "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this: to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". The fact that the apostle's spirit is there gathered in view of the discipline, I think, calls attention to the organism in which we
{55}
are, and that the bearing of judgment includes the whole assembly, and hence any local judgments or discipline should command the assent of saints generally; it should never be regarded as an independent matter, but one that concerns the whole assembly.
H.L. How does the assembly express itself so as to be refused -- "if also he will not listen to the assembly ..." @Matthew 18: 17? Would it do to come from the care meeting?
J.T. The assembly never speaks through the care meeting; the care meeting is only preliminary to the assembly. The only authoritative body is the assembly; Scripture regards it as having an authoritative *voice*. The organism, the "one body", must underlie all these matters. The assembly can speak; all are in it, the underlying organism is the secret of universal assent, universal understanding, too, of what is done.
H.B. If one hears the voice of the assembly at a disciplinary meeting, should it produce such repentance so that we move towards it?
J.T. Just so, and it was so at Corinth; the apostle mentions the great ultimate end, that is, "that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". The man was a real christian, as we say, his spirit was saved *before* the day of the Lord Jesus, and that is what we should look for, so that the second letter deals with that point; repentance had taken place, his spirit was right already; it was right enough for them to confirm their love to him. They were in danger of blocking the work of God in the man, but the assembly has prerogative to remit sin, also powers of healing and recovery. They were evidently overlooking this and not leaving themselves open for the operations of God in the way of healing and restoration. These feelings are essential to the discipline, we are to be amenable to the gracious actions
{56}
of God in the healing and restoration of a sinner. The Corinthians were slow, but the apostle would not go ahead of them, he would promote in them the feeling of forgiveness and the confirming of their love to him.
In the case of this system of which we are speaking, there is no thought of restoration, there is no hope at all of her. In the individual letters to the assemblies, Thyatira is the one that deals with this system in its incipient stages, it is viewed under the symbol of Jezebel, and the Lord says "she will not repent", and according to chapter 18, the judgment is now being executed. They were unable to execute it themselves, for, from the time of Jezebel, the only hope was withdrawal, separation; but God says, I have power to deal with her and I am doing it now; that is what occasions this great celebration of joy.
Ques. Do I understand you to say that there should be some knowledge amongst us of all that this history entails?
J.T. There should. If we are bondmen of God, if we are in His service, we should surely feel the awful pressure of this. It is a great blot on Christendom, dating back to the third century, and who could be a lover of God without feeling that this is an outburst of relief through what God has done in removing this awful blot on His creation! It was an accumulated judgment, as I understand it -- your judgment -- expressed in the groans of the saints who suffer from this pressure right down these ages.
Rem. So among the things found in her were souls of men.
J.T. Yes -- traffic in them.
H.B. These three mentioned -- saints, apostles, prophets -- are three assembly features as in Ephesians. In order to come into line with that now, would you say there requires to be this judgment expressed in the way of withdrawal?
{57}
J.T. That is the idea. Heaven is in the judgment, according to Matthew, what is bound on earth is bound in heaven -- that is how the matter stood. Now heaven is mentioned first, it is in accord with all the judgment the saints, apostles, and prophets had. The accumulation of judgment is remarkable, and now God takes it on to deal with it Himself.
Ques. Would it seem that God allows this system to go on for the education of His bondmen? Then, as they have suffered and received the instruction, He executes the judgment; but He waits on them till they have received the instruction.
J.T. Yes. Other scriptures show that Babylon had "fallen"; there was a certain releasement of the pressure at that time, but only making her worse. There was relief from it in her fall, she lost prestige and power, but she became worse; she became "the habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hated bird". She became worse, and she has continued in that fallen condition up to the present moment.
Ques. Do you think the fall of Babylon would make room for God to call upon His people to come out of her?
J.T. I think that is how the thing stood historically. Her power became more limited, she lost political power; it was a way for those who feared God -- His people -- to come out of her. The point is that they should not be partakers of her sins -- "Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins, and that ye do not receive of her plagues". If any of God's people are in her, they will be judged in her -- at least that is the bearing of their position -- as Jonathan was judged with Saul. The apostle was concerned that the Corinthian saints should not be "judged with the world", and it is a very solemn reminder to anyone who is in this system, or its extensions (for there are extensions
{58}
of it) that there is a danger of their being judged with her; so the word is, "Come out of her, my people".
A.R. How does that fit in with what is said to Thyatira, "But to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come"? They evidently are owned, although remaining in the system.
J.T. I think that historically the recognition of a remnant would synchronise with the divine call to come out of her. The letter does not direct the saints to leave anything, they are taken account of just as they are in each assembly, the idea of formal separation is not stated in the letters. Each assembly is taken account of in its general public position and what is of God in it is owned, but we can discern that Philadelphia could not exist save on the principle of separation, nor could a remnant in Thyatira really subsist save on that principle.
Ques. Do you suggest that what you speak of is consequent on the letter to Thyatira -- things have developed?
J.T. I think it would be consequent on the ministry that would flow out of the letter to Thyatira. There was a ministry right down, opening up each letter and making application. "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". What the Spirit would say in any given period would be an amplification of what Christ's letter governing it contained.
Ques. Why is it said she corrupted the earth (chapter 19: 2)?
J.T. I suppose it is the political state of things, speaking practically. Europe and her out-goings, that being the area of Jezebel's machinations. Who
{59}
has not discerned that the whole ordered condition of things has been corrupted by her? In verse 5 of chapter 19 certain ones are called upon to praise God: "all ye his bondmen, and ye that fear him, small and great", as if they would be brought into the praise. Verse 20 of the previous chapter is more limited, but God would bring all His people into the result; even if we have not a true judgment about her, God will call us into the result. It is often seen in a local meeting, that most do not really enter into things, the discernment or judgment of evil, but when it is manifest, and the judgment is executed, then they can come into it and the results of it -- the position that flows from it, the gain to God, for every disciplinary action ought to yield to God. The discipline in itself yields to God.
F.S. Should we have these feelings in eating the Lord's supper, in relation to those held in bondage, that they should worship the Father, that we should feel and be concerned as to those who are missing?
J.T. That is a good suggestion, for the Lord feels their absence. He would say, Where are they? And those who love God know where many are, who are not walking in the truth, they have a judgment as to them. 2 Timothy says, "The Lord knows those that are his". Well, we are with Him in that. But then, Where are they? The Lord asks, "Where are the nine?" Many of them, alas! are in Babylon.
Ques. Would the apostle's word in @Ephesians 3 help us on that line, he says, "that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height"? Would it encourage us on the line of seeking to have "all the saints" before us on such occasions when we enjoy so much?
J.T. That is right. As lovers of God we love the brethren, and hence feel their absence. 2 Timothy says the Lord knows them, and I think He would
{60}
remind us as to where they are -- Where are the nine? It is very sorrowful to think of them in the evil system referred to in our scripture.
F.I. Does Thyatira refer to only what we might call the communicants in the church of Rome, or does it view the whole of the profession positionally connected with Thyatira? Is not the public position of the church today Thyatira?
J.T. I think so. It is the fourth assembly addressed, and contemplates the public body characteristically, and which goes on to the end. The other three continuing represent conditions: Sardis, the outcome of the movement called the Reformation; Philadelphia, the result, of a subsequent movement of the Spirit of God; and Laodicea, the result -- in pride and worldliness -- of the human mind stimulated by the activity of the Spirit in the revival of the truth, as seen in the Philadelphian result. It would be Protestantism as to what it has come to. Thyatira has to be apprehended by itself, but it represents the public body right through; and the whole public body is viewed in the destruction of Babylon, because all the religious, organisations have become, or will become, affiliated with it in one way or another.
Ques. Would the last three be included in that expression, "the rest who are in Thyatira"?
J.T. That is an expression you only find there; it is tantamount to the word "remnant", that is, what remains for God or what the Lord had been describing. Thyatira is one of the seven and owned as an assembly, but suffering this woman, this corruptress. "The rest" are there, they are not viewed as detached from it, they are there; they are just viewed as a remnant with the promise of the millennium. That is the position, Philadelphia is the carrying forward of that thought, and the development of it in the light of the assembly.
{61}
H.L. Does the great sheet let down from heaven cover the present situation you are referring to? The unclean birds are seen later on in chapter 19.
J.T. The sheet that came down from heaven alludes to what God has taken on, viewed in its historical capacity, but as *cleansed* and thus linked on with what God is doing.
H.L. I was thinking of the world in reconciliation, and the unclean birds are now seen in chapter 18 as *only* unclean.
J.T. Well, but those in the sheet came down from heaven; Peter says they are unclean, but heaven says they were cleansed. What was in the sheet represented the then current work of God among the nations.
H.L. I thought that sheet referred to all men and the world in reconciliation.
J.T. But the world's reconciliation, seen in @Romans 11, does not go so far as cleansing, it is simply a question of the provisional attitude of God towards the world.
H.B. What is under consideration is the responsible side as to the general profession.
J.T. Yes, it is what the public system has become. Although the mind is directed to Rome, it really takes in all the public systems.
H.B. The extensions you spoke of would include all the clerical systems.
J.T. Exactly. All these public systems, that have taken on things that belong to Rome, are not clear in the matter; what the Lord exposes and condemns, clericalism, priest-craft linked with worldliness, seen in all current religious organisations, mark Rome; indeed generally they have come out of Rome. Hence all will ultimately be included in Babylon and judged in her.
Rem. It says, "as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they
{62}
say, I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come". I wondered whether a certain measure of separation would not be implied on their part in those words, "as many as have not this doctrine ..."
J.T. It would, as to personal state, but not as to public position, I think.
E.G. Is not "the overcomer" a state further than "the rest"? It goes on to the overcomer in that next verse.
J.T. Yes, but the promise to him would indicate the measure of his overcoming; he is not an overcomer like the one in Philadelphia; he shepherds the nations with a rod of iron; that is what Jezebel was doing in her corrupt way, undertaking to rule the nations. The promises to the overcomer in Philadelphia are very far in advance of that.
What we are speaking of now is the idea of a judgment about things, and whether the bondmen of God, those who serve, are really conversant with this terrible thing and have a judgment about it; if we have not, we can scarcely serve the saints. Paul says, "ye and my spirit being gathered together", that is, I do not want to be outside what is being done in the assembly in the way of discipline. Underlying all that is the idea of the body, the organism, the power of feeling -- what exists universally.
L.D.M. In @Ezekiel 9: 4, Jehovah said to the man clothed with linen, with the writer's ink-horn by his side, "Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof".
J.T. "All the abominations" -- that is instructive, the power of feeling things, and that nothing is left out. That corresponds with what we are speaking of, how it is contemplated that we have a judgment
{63}
about things, that we have a judgment about this terrible thing and all its outgoings; God will link them all on in the final judgment.
Ques. Does chapter 18: 2 give you the idea of what is governmental? It speaks of it as the *hold* of every unclean spirit and every unclean and hated bird. J.N.D. has a note that this means a prison where they are confined.
J.T. I have no doubt it is governmental, but it is a means the system has of silencing any elements regarded as contrary to it.
Rem. I was thinking also of the door being opened; that is for the overcomer, not for the unclean bird. God in His governmental dealing with the system has in it a hold for the unclean bird.
J.T. Yes. It silences all conscience; it has a means of repression, but then it is really governmental, that is, all these evil things are confined there.
W.B. As we judge the spirit of Babylon as seen in @Psalm 137, do we have a corresponding appreciation of what the assembly is for God -- "Jerusalem above my chief joy". The psalmist refers to sitting down by the rivers of Babylon; then he goes on, "Daughter of Babylon, who art to be laid waste, happy he that rendereth unto thee that which thou hast meted out to us. Happy he that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock".
J.T. This is a good illustration of a true judgment -- you mean. That is what God looks for. There was a paper written nearly a hundred years ago entitled, *The Notion of a Clergyman*, *Dispensationally the sin against the Holy Ghost* -- a very remarkable production that really cut at the root of all this. God would have us stand clear of it, for any one who does not is included in the judgment that is expressed here -- "Come out of her, my people, that
{64}
ye have not fellowship in her sins". One is not clear of the matter if he is there.
H.B. Then if one desires to be a bondman or a bondmaid, this is the first essential.
J.T. It is; you get a harp, as we were saying. The point is that the political system of things is signified by a little book, and the thought was, "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come", and then there is the celebration. Now we are occupied with the religious system and the result of its overthrow, so that it is a question of having a judgment, and, as having a judgment, we can sing -- we come into the realm of singing. You get no such celebration throughout the book as in this chapter 19; the first is negative, that is, those who have a judgment of Babylon and rejoice in its destruction; then those who rejoice in the marriage of the Lamb -- "the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife ..." -- she is true to Christ in all this. Now the celebration continues; it is in two parts, the first is because of what is negative, the destruction of Babylon, and the second stands in relation to the true wife of Christ and the marriage of the Lamb to her.
W.H. What is the force of the word "Hallelujah"?
J.T. It is a word brought down from the Old Testament; it denotes the praise of Jah, and I believe, a keen spiritual insight into the Deity as revealed. In the first section we have it, and then "a second time they said, Hallelujah"; and then again the elders and living creatures say, "Amen, Hallelujah". It is God who is before them, they are employing Old Testament language, but it is a word that includes the Deity, I believe, and keen insight into it. The Psalms, of course, give us the word, and, as brought into christianity here, we are entitled to use it, and we do use and should use it. Then the twenty-four elders -- this is the last mention
{65}
of them -- and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God. They refer to the assembly in two ways -- those who have experience with God, and those who, as creatures, are sympathetic with God, and they say, "Amen, Hallelujah". So we have Hallelujah three times in those four verses, and then a voice came out of the throne saying, "Praise our God, all ye his bondmen, and ye that fear him, small and great". But the Hallelujahs are confirmed in the praise of the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures; the highest intelligences and the most sympathetic join in this celebration, showing what a thing it was, what faith understood, and what is within the capacity of spiritual understanding; and then there is the outburst of praise and worship in the sense of relief.
E.G. After the first celebration it says, "her smoke goes up to the ages of ages".
J.T. That would mean that the judgment is *eternal*.
W.A. Do you think John had this in mind when he said, "Herein has love been perfected with, us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that even as *he* is, we also are in this world"?
J.T. Just so; that shows how these elders and living creatures exist and have their places, they are in that light -- "as *he* is". It is in that light we can judge things, we have a true standard.
The only other thing we can say now is as to the bondman's place in the heavenly city. You have here, "his servants shall serve him" -- the word for "servants" here also is "bondmen" -- it refers to the public service of God, that is, you might say, the religious side. There are those who serve in the assembly carrying on the service that is due to God, the bondmen do that and they have the utmost liberty there -- "they shall see his face", so the thought of bondmen is carried on to the heavenly
{66}
city. Then the danger is again seen of bondmen worshipping intermediaries, great servants of God. John, we are told, "fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who shewed me these things. And he says to me, See thou do it not. I am thy fellow-bondman, and the fellow-bondman of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Do homage to God" -- a very good word to finish with. The angel is saying, I am just one of the bondmen; he takes that place, as Peter did -- "I myself also am a man", he said to Cornelius; whereas his professed successor in Rome looks for worship now, he looks for the very thing that John would render and which the angel sternly forbids. The Lord's people are sometimes in danger of that, of paying unseemly attention to those whom God may use.
Rem. You are not suggesting that distinguished servants should not be honoured and listened to in their service. I was thinking that sometimes the natural mind in us takes an independent form in disregarding servants and what the Lord is obviously giving through them.
J.T. It is very important to add that.
{67}
MAKING WAY FOR GOD
@Genesis 15: 8 - 11, 17, 18; @Matthew 3: 1 - 3, 11 - 17; @Revelation 3: 20
The object of this address is that we might be instructed as to the divine way, how each may *make way for God*: first, in regard to things that relate to himself, his own blessing; then as to public testimony, how, as engaged in that, one may make a way for God; and finally, how a believer may make way for a divine visitation and the subsequent entertainment of a divine Person, and then an entertainment of him *by* a divine Person; in other words, how we may make a way for the Lord so as to entertain Him, and that He, as a consequence may, as He loves to do, entertain a christian, as the scripture read in Revelation says, "I will .., sup with him, and he with me".
The first part of my subject, as I intimated, is what relates to the individual believer's blessing, how he may be established in the mind of God for him. So I selected Abraham, who is the characteristic believer, the father of all believers. He was concerned as to *knowing* how the promise of God should be fulfilled to him. There are many who are content with much less, very much less, than what is intimated in divine promise. Divine promise is the outcome, as we perhaps know, of divine purpose; that is, God can accord a promise as having purposed. His promise obviously will not go beyond the limits of His purpose, but it may extend to the fulness of His purpose for us, and His purpose for us is very great, I need not say; it is commensurate with Himself as having come out in Christ, so that "whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son" -- He calls him and justifies him and glorifies him. Thus the purpose
{68}
of God, as I said, is commensurate, in keeping with Himself; it is worthy of God, it becomes Him.
But then there are promises; these are all on the line of assurance; the promise and the oath (@Hebrews 6: 18), were two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie. Where you have these promises and oaths and covenants, the *assurance* of the believer is in mind, and many need establishing. In making His promises, God undertakes to act for their fulfilment. It is impossible for God to lie, we are told, that is, we know what He is in a general way, but the promise and the oath are to afford us certainty, to establish us. Then He has to begin to work, and so you have in this chapter, for the first time, the expression, "the word of God". The chapter involves a vision, and I suppose if God speaks on the principle of vision to us. He abstracts us from what would be hindering to us in taking in the vision, and to Him in presenting what He has in mind in the vision. We are not accustomed to vision now, but Scripture speaks much of it. God speaks to man, we are told, "in a vision of the night". He takes account of us and knows how ordinary things interfere as He is seeking to commune with us, and so He abstracts us in His own way so as to have scope for what He has in mind to make known.
This chapter, therefore, is remarkable, God is taking on Abraham to assure him that henceforth he is to be an established believer, established not only in the knowledge of God, but in the certain knowledge that God cannot lie. He was to be assured for a long time to come, too, four hundred and fifty years -- with us it is much longer, I need not say; I mean the fulfilment of the promise took that number of years. Abraham in his lifetime would always revert to this with comfort, and it is important that each of us should have some little transaction with God of this sort, beginning with the idea of His
{69}
word, for His word penetrates, as we are told, it is "living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart", @Hebrews 4: 12. That is to say, there is the searching of the being; he is, in every chamber of his heart, exposed to himself: distinction is made in his soul between thoughts and intents, so that all selfishness is exposed and God would say, It is due to *you*; it is not only due to Me, but it is due to you that it should be so. You will labour under great illusion if it is not so, if you are reserving any dark crevices in your heart, in conversing with Me, entering into any, engagement with Me, or I with you.
Abraham says, "how shall I know ... ?" And God said to him, "Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon". This is Abraham's matter, it arose from Abraham's wish to know, to be assured -- hence, in this sense, it is Abraham's matter. It is for him to act now so as to *make way for God*; for God, in the fulfilment of His promises to us, does not only work all round us; He does work around us, but He has in mind, in working thus, to work *in* us, to get *in*. We are skilled in keeping Him out; able, perhaps, to tell others how God will enter into their souls for blessing, able to preach the gospel, and yet we have never made a way for Him into ourselves, and He is waiting to get in. He is saying to us, Unless I do, unless you make a way for Me, there is no possible confirmation for you of what I promised you; it is an inward matter, do not keep Me out. There are things that are impossible in this sense, morally speaking: God says, I cannot work in you unless you let Me in. And, in selecting female creatures, a heifer and a she-goat He would intimate that He is
{70}
looking for a certain result here; they denote, in type, responsive affection. The Lord knows what you are capable of, but it is finding its outlet in other directions than towards God. The woman of Samaria, as we have often remarked, was a woman of great affection, and she found an outlet, a lawless outlet. In truth, any letting out of our affections exclusive of what is Godward, is indeed lawless, for we are to love Him with all our heart and all our strength.
So He prescribes three-year-old creatures. Abraham would have to find them, and in finding them among his cattle -- he had large flocks and herds -- he would no doubt be wondering what it all meant. Well, God intends to set us thinking when He purposes to do something for us, because He wants to work in us. He works for us outside of ourselves, but He wants to work *in* us, and He cannot really succeed in His purposes of love for us unless He is allowed to work in us. So there are these two female creatures, and then a ram of three years old, which involves a progenitive idea, that there is to be some result for God as an outcome of this. And then the birds -- they are *not* to be divided, that is, you can retain *whole* thoughts of yourself, but in a little way, in this process, the smaller the better; the whole thought must stand in all this operation.
So it is now what Abraham will do; God did not tell him what to do with them, but they were for God; it became God that these sacrifices should be provided, and we may be sure that Abraham was particular as to the history of each creature, he would know its age. But now, having slain the creatures, he divides them, as you will observe. It says "he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid the half of each opposite its fellow; but the birds he did not divide", that is, the pieces of the larger creatures were matched. There was to be no severing of the pieces in the passover lamb, the whole
{71}
thought went through, it is food for collective position and service. But this is earlier than the passover, this is how an individual is to *know*, and there must be the separation of the pieces, and they are identifiable, they belong to each other. Well now, as in this process, if we are having to say to God, we may be sure that Satan is not far away. In one's holiest moments, one is humbled to be made sensible of the nearness of the enemy, and the facilities he has to act on us. In the most holy moments that we, as christians, may experience we may find this. It is very humbling, and tends to make us small, but still, the whole idea is in the birds; do not lose the sense of that, the smaller one is the better, in these circumstances.
The birds of prey came down. There are two sets of birds here, that is, those that Abraham provided, according to verse 9, a turtle-dove and young pigeon -- symbolic of good; but then there are other birds, birds of prey, as you will observe. "The birds of prey came down on the carcases; and Abram scared them away". These are other birds. We must have discernment in reading Scripture; cutting in a straight line the word of truth, not simply the Scripture, but the *word of truth*, for truth is interwoven, very intricately at times, in what is presented to us. Abraham sees these fowls that came down -- what is the intent? To spoil all that he was doing. I urge young people to listen to what I am saying, for, unless you come into this sort of experience in some sense, you will never he confirmed, you will never be settled or assured in divine love's provision for you. You have to learn to scare (the word "scare" is in the New Translation) them away; do not entertain them. That is the difficulty that, in your holiest, most sincere moments, and the moments in which God is set to help you, the enemy is there. Even in a meeting like this, Satan comes, as we have often
{72}
said, to rob souls that are listening, of what is being presented. So Abraham scares them away; God did not tell him to do it, but he did it; nor did God tell him what to do with the creatures, what he did was the outcome of intelligence.
Now, I have said all that as part of what is in mind, that is, making a way for God. If these creatures He has directed us to bring, or to provide, are damaged by the devil or his emissaries, God is interfered with. So the epistle to the Romans teaches us how we are to have control of our minds; it is one of the greatest acquirements of the christian initially, to learn how to control his mind. "*I myself*"; not simply "*I*", but "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". The delivered christian seen in @Romans 7 has complete control so that the mind becomes servile and held for one use, namely, God's law. That is not the ten words simply, but God's law, whatever it be specifically. So, if the enemy comes -- and he does come -- and young people are hampered with him and wonder how it is, it is because we do not learn how to control our minds and use them according to their power as rightly controlled. Abraham scares the birds away, they are foreign, they are antagonistic. That being so, "it came to pass when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, that behold, there was a smoking furnace, and a flame of fire which passed between those pieces" -- that is the power of God. Abraham made the way for it in scaring away the enemy; so God acts to *confirm Abraham*, and the whole territory from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, is secured to the believer, to Abraham and to his seed. How restful he would be after that! He would be not only a believer, but a confirmed believer. "He that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God". That is what He is aiming at with every one of us. The young
{73}
christians at Corinth could see how established Paul was; no storm could overturn him, he was established, but he says, "God who establishes us with you ..." That is, he was established with the Corinthians. It is peculiarly strengthening to be told that I am sharing a special blessing with one far ahead of me and distinguished in every way in the things of God.
Well, I now go on to John the baptist. From the believer -- for Abraham is a characteristic believer now, confirmed in the purposes of God -- I pass on to the minister, to speak of how, in our public service, we make a way for God. Christendom as it is has blocked the divine way; God cannot move out to the regions beyond now. I use the word 'cannot' in a moral sense, there are things God cannot do in that sense consistently with Himself. Paul says, "I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ" (@Romans 15: 19); in doing that he made a divine way; he provided, not only a way for man, the divine way for us, "the way everlasting", but he provided a way for God. In the Acts, "the way" for the christian implies the fellowship, but then there is a way for God, so that God can go from city to city, town to town, and village to village, as indicated in the addresses to assemblies in Asia (@Revelation 2 and 3). John the baptist is, I think, the great example for us in this respect; it is he that is selected by God for this service peculiarly, so that it says, in the passage from which I read in Matthew, "in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh. For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, saying, Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths". He is making a way for the Lord in preaching repentance, but I
{74}
am not going into the details at all, there is no time for this; I would like more particularly to call attention to John himself, that is, the kind of man he was as a public minister.
Luke tells us that the word of God came to him, that marks his ministry: as the word of God came to Abraham, so it did to John. It is a question of the mind of God, and what one would specially desire is to convey briefly an impression of John the baptist. I have read from Matthew, rather than any other of the gospels or from the Acts, because of the point the Lord makes, in speaking to John, about *righteousness*. John the evangelist presents John the baptist in the most attractive way, I think, of any of the evangelists, and that is because he so stresses John's admiration of Christ, the great estimate he had of Christ. I believe (if one may be allowed to speak familiarly of such a matter) that, if heaven were to catechise a prospective minister, what would be stressed would be, the minister's estimate of Christ. How do you regard Him? What is He in relation to yourself? Do you think yourself at all comparable with Him? Now I think John the evangelist is like that in regard to John the baptist; he shows how he measured up with the divine requirement. He is presented, as I said, as a sort of ideal for all ministers of Christ.
So, almost as soon as the Lord is seen here as Man in John's narrative, we have John the baptist quoted as saying that He was preferred before him. He is urgent and energetic; he says, I want to say at once about that Man. He is preferred before me -- that surely is a fine thing to start with. No one can be of any service really in the ministry of Christ, save he learns to be a *second*; and John puts his word in at once and says, He is preferred before me. That matter is settled; great as I am, John says, great as other people think I am, that Man is preferred
{75}
before me, and for a good reason -- He *was* before me. It is no question yet of the ability of Christ in testimony, it is a question of the *Person* of Christ, who He is; I must be clear as to that, and that is the point John makes. Jerusalem sent word to him and said, in effect, We are giving you a place in Jerusalem; your fame has reached us and we recognise you. Men will do that if you have gift; if you have ability it will be recognised, men will recognise you so that *they* may be enhanced. Jerusalem would be greater as honouring such a man as John; it would distinguish him by a title, whatever was needed. But John would honour Another, not himself: he says, "In the midst of you stands ... he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". Do not think of me, think of the Man who stands in the midst of you; that is the minister making a way for Christ. I will not make a way for Him, if He is not great in my esteem; such is our make-up, that we are so self-centred naturally; but if we are to make a way for Christ, He must be everything. He is before us; He is *preferred* before us too. John the evangelist does not speak so much of John's preaching as the others do, he stresses John's remarks expressing his great appreciation of Christ. How he loves to speak of Christ, how superior He is! He will make a way for Him; and so here in Matthew he says, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths". And then, "*I* indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear; *he* shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire; whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor, and shall gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable".
Now, that is all perfect, and I have, as I might say,
{76}
a feeling of regret in having to point out something that you do not get in John's gospel: that the Baptist would dissuade the Lord from something that the path He had entered upon required. Jesus comes to him; and it is when Jesus presents Himself to me that I am tested. I can talk of Him to others, but when I am face to face with the Lord, and He would stress His humility, I may shrink from the full truth -- I may even protest against it. In ministry as the Spirit of God may empower a brother to bring out the humility of Christ, let us not be afraid of it, it is part of the testimony. What wonderful compression marked Jesus! Think of Him saying -- and I refer to it with the deepest reverence -- "I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and the despised of the people", @Psalm 22: 6. How could He say that? Is it not part of His testimony? If one refuses it, he is not equal to this, not equal to the presence of Jesus. What wonderful compression, what wonderful sense of reduction comes before us in the incarnation, as we hear Him speak in that way! John the baptist is not just ready for that, he says, "*I* have need to be baptised of thee; and comest *thou* to me?" His words seemed to say that he knew better than the Lord! Let none of us ever be in that position. Prohibitionists, for instance, assume to know better than the Lord, though they do not say this in words. In many other instances, people who think they are pious, are really assuming to know better than the Lord. That will not do; nor will any of us be used or be useful unless we submit to the truth. Many have legal thoughts, thoughts that hinder us going in for the full truth.
"Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him; but John urgently forbad him, saying, *I* have need to be baptised of thee; and comest *thou* to me?" That was true, but then the Lord was doing the will of God, which
{77}
required that He took this lowly place, and that John should serve Him in it. John was there expressly to make a way for Him; but without this service the divine way would have been blocked. The Lord was going on to a beautiful scene in this section, to the opening of heaven and the Father's voice owning Him from there -- I cannot stop to speak of it, but it is most affecting; but John, for the moment, was not making way for it, by introducing his own insignificance; without doubt his feelings as to himself were true, but their introduction at this juncture was contrary to his commission as the forerunner of Christ. Let us not be afraid of humility in anyone; none of us has a lot of it. Wherever you see it, let it work, let humility have its full way. The Lord was the embodiment of it. "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me", He said, "for I am meek and lowly in heart". Jesus answered John: "Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". "Suffer it now, ..." -- John in acceding is brought into full accord with his mission as Jehovah's messenger to prepare His way, so that all flesh should see His glory. Think of the Lord having to say to me, Suffer Me to do this! Why should He? Would it not raise the question, whether I am ready to submit? He is the Lord of glory, and should I not submit unreservedly as He comes to me in this way?
It is very suggestive that, when the Lord spoke about righteousness, John the baptist submitted. May we not be touched with the importance of righteousness in this matter? -- and not one righteousness, but *all* righteousness. The way of God requires the fulfilment of all righteousness; and not merely that Jesus should do it, but that John should do it. He said, "Suffer it now; for thus is becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". And John suffers Him, thank God! He is now in the full dignity of his mission. Think of the honour of baptising the Lord Jesus!
{78}
He came in that way in love identifying Himself with the remnant of Israel, not indeed that He needed to be baptised -- surely not. He is the great Baptiser Himself, He baptises with the Holy Spirit -- but the way of God required this lowly attitude of Jesus, and John suffered Him, and the glory honoured Jesus at that point. The way of God has brought in the full light of the divine glory, of heaven opened. John was never more consciously in it, I am sure, than he was at that moment. He says elsewhere, "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God". He had made a way for Him. How great a thing it is to make a way for Jesus, whether in myself or publicly in my ministry; so that heaven declares its pleasure in Him, and I am in all that light and blessedness!
Then finally, in the Revelation, the simple thought in mind, as I said, is to make a way for the Lord to come to any of us. He knocks: "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking". Speaking simply, you might open the door because of His knocking; but the point is, "if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me". It is contingent, not on the noise made by the knocking, but on His voice, it is *His* voice, that is, you know *who* is knocking. We may hear the knock and not Him that did it; knocking may be some severe thing that happens. There is no voice in a knock, but it is "my voice", the Lord says, it is His voice heard accompanying the knock. "If any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me". Now some of us may never have had any experience like this, perhaps have not thought of it. We have had severe things happen in our circumstances, business losses, and what not -- knocking is there; but then it is the Lord's voice in the knocking, or with it, that is, it is *Himself*.
{79}
A parallel passage to this is in the Canticles, the Lord is out in the night; it does not say He is suffering anything outside in Laodicea. He presents Himself in His greatness to Laodicea, One who can give counsel, gold, eye-salve. He can provide everything that the Christian needs -- or even what the whole profession needs. So that it is not Christ as in need outside, as suffering outside; here, He has resources. It is not that in the Canticles, it is One whose locks are wet with the dew of night, He is exposed and He comes and knocks at the beloved's door, and she is in bed, and she is too lazy to open; she misses Him; but here He says, "if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me". Is there anyone here whose heart is too hard to take this in, the Lord's appeal! He says, I will sup with you. If you are able to discern My voice, and you open to Me, I will come in and I will sup with you. But then He says, You will sup with Me. Supping with Him is Philadelphia, supping with Him is *part* with Him. And the Lord is appealing to someone here, maybe to all of us, as to opening and making a way for the Lord to come in, as hearing His voice. It is a characteristic of a sheep of Christ to hear His voice. Hearing His voice, you open to Him, that is, you are moved by His voice.
The feminine speaker in Canticles says, "it is the voice of my beloved"; well, it was, but still she did not open, and He left, and she suffered loss. Now, dear brethren, the closing word is, Let us not be in that plight. Knocking is going on, but are we hearing His voice, the voice of Him who knocks? Let us hear His voice, His own accents; it is the Lord, let Him come in; as He comes in, He sups with you. But He further says, "and he with me" -- and that part would involve the blessedness of assembly privilege.
{80}
UNLESS I WASH THEE
@John 12: 1 - 3; @John 13: 1 - 20
J.T. What is in view initially is to call attention to the fact that the Lord moves, according to this gospel, independently of external religious observances, feasts, days and so on, as if He had done with everything in the world into which He had come, and was in spirit in another world, and another order of things. So that we have, in these two scriptures, first, "six days before the Passover", a definite number of days; and then, in chapter 13, "before the feast of the Passover". As accustomed to an annual occasion of this kind according to a great religious date, we are apt to be affected as religionists are affected, by what is accepted generally; and in these days the Lord would draw us out of it all, even the religious side of the world.
The synoptical gospels take the opposite view, they record the Lord as taking part in the Passover, preparing for it. Even in regard to His personal service, there is a difference; in John. He does not wait for John the baptist to be removed. John presents Jesus as serving before, whereas in the other gospels John the baptist is cast into prison before Jesus takes on His work. So that it is "in season and out of season" in John, and particularly in view of the last days, when the so-called christian religion has taken on so definitely the character of the world, apostasy too, the tide running very strong.
The Lord would have us outside, and apart with Him, and would show us how it can be, that is, by Himself washing our feet, not simply that we should in our own view be clean for such an occasion, but "Unless I wash thee ..." -- that is, *He* must do it. The first instance in which He came to Bethany six days before the Passover is evidently to bring out
{81}
what was there, that they were ready for a great occasion, not a merely religious occasion, not an occasion recognised by the world, but one in view of His coming -- they were ready for that, they were not taken unawares. He would have in mind to bring out what was there and to add to it. The first scripture is sequential, as we have noticed, the idea of sequence is much stressed. It begins "therefore". It alludes to what was in the Lord's mind -- that He would bring out what was there as the result of His earlier services.
H.C. Is the outlook of the religious people governed by the question of observance, as in the religious calendar, in verse 56 of chapter 11? They say, "What do ye think? that he will not come to the feast?"
J.T. Yes; "many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover, that they might purify themselves. They sought therefore Jesus, and said among themselves, standing in the temple, What do ye think? that he will not come to the feast?" They knew nothing of this occasion at Bethany. They had the idea of purifying themselves; they were only questioning about the Lord, regarded as a public Person, they had no light in their souls about Him. Six days is a measured time before the feast. It would give opportunity to bring out what was there, and what was there was remarkable, especially in what Mary had, that is, she was preparing; it is not presented that she expected Him, but there was *readiness* to take advantage of an opportunity. We also are to be ready, not simply for a meeting like this, but to be *always* ready. We never can say when opportunities will come to us, so that the point is to be ready. When the Lord was brought into the temple, according to Luke, Simeon was ready and so was Anna. We have around us the idea of 'Lent', which is a preparatory thought,
{82}
but Mary was always ready; even when the Lord visited the house at the outset, according to Luke, she was ready, that is, she was prepared for what was then needed -- an open ear to listen to Jesus.
Ques. Are you connecting chapter 12 with the thought of the place Bethany, or the household?
J.T. I think the place at first -- He "came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus". In the previous chapter it says, "there was a certain man sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister. It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick". Chapter 11 gives us the importance of the place, Lazarus was characteristically of it as a man. It was the village of Mary and Martha, which makes it more characteristically affected by them; and then we are told who the Mary was, that is, alluding to what happened on this great occasion, which was in the house, so that this visit has in mind where the dead man Lazarus was, that is, the man who had been dead, but "whom Jesus raised from among the dead". So it would appear as if Lazarus is in mind, but the house would be a great thought, for it was the house -- not the place -- that was filled with the odour of the ointment.
Ques. Is it that persons and conditions like this would attract the Lord to come there?
J.T. I think that is the thought, carried through to chapter 20 -- "the doors shut where the disciples were". But here particularly "the dead man Lazarus", who had gone through this extraordinary experience, a person of that kind -- 'where the dead Lazarus was', as it is literally -- and yet he is very much alive, but he is alive by Christ's power; that is the kind of man. He is not a religious man; I mean he does not represent accredited religion at all, he is a dead man as to all that, but he is very
{83}
much alive in relation to *another* order of things, made alive by Christ -- "whom Jesus raised from among the dead"; hence the occasion is for Jesus -- the outcome of the result of His work.
Rem. Such a man would be very serviceable to the Lord in view of what He had before Him -- going to the Father.
J.T. Quite so. Take this great result; whilst it may be regarded as the Jewish remnant, the very best result, you might say, seen as a household, it is about to be absorbed in something greater, I mean it is carried forward into chapter 13 into the personnel of the assembly.
Rem. In chapter 13 it is what He *has*, His own, and the washing is stressed, but in chapter 12 it is one raised from the dead. The apostle said, "So that, my brethren, *ye* also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God", @Romans 7: 4.
J.T. I think that enters into this. It is a question, therefore, of how the truth of Romans is taken on by us, but this passage goes further than Romans. Romans does not give us resurrection with Christ; we have to go to Colossians for risen persons -- "raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead". These chapters in John are constructive, the twelfth runs into the thirteenth. The twelfth is the terminus of the line of truth beginning with chapter 9, but then it is not left to stand by itself, for the Jewish remnant is carried over into the assembly, and what comes out in chapter 12 is the new order of humanity conveyed in the Lord saying, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit". That intervenes, and chapter 13 involves it, that we are now in the presence of a heavenly order of things. Resurrection
{84}
is essential to it, but there is more in the humanity than is involved in the Lord's remark as to "much fruit". The doctrine of it is in @Hebrews 2; it became God in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Leader of their salvation perfect through sufferings. So that "both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren". That is the full thought of what we get here, but chapter 13 is to bring us into it, that we might have part with Christ in it.
W.H. Does chapter 12 suggest that the family at Bethany had gained from the exercise of death and resurrection? They evidently *had* something -- they made Him a supper, in view of passing on to what you referred to. It says, "There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him. Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price ..."
J.T. There was wealth there, such as was needed. So the first thought is the Lord coming to the place, in view of Lazarus; and the second is, they had the means of making Him a supper, and it was mutual -- *they* did it.
Ques. What would answer today to the thought of making Him a supper?
J.T. One can understand it is a Jewish setting; making a supper here for Christ is initially a Jewish thought, I think. *He* makes *us* a supper. He has instituted a supper for us, which implies that there is really no place for Him in the world, and that He is absent. As yet there was some place at Bethany, for He went out of Jerusalem at one time to Bethany and spent the night there; I suppose it is characteristic of the Jewish remnant that they will make something for Him. His supper for us would mean there is no place for Him here. His death is in it; it affords an opportunity for us to go out of the world, so after
{85}
it they go to the mount of Olives. It is a means of exit out of the world, but an authorised one; it is in accord with the Lord's departure which He should accomplish at Jerusalem; He has thus made a way out for us, that is involved in His supper. If applied today, the supper at Bethany would be a question of what there may be in any place; what have you here to eat? He said later. Here they had what was requisite for a supper, such as was suitable for Christ, a meal for the expression of love.
Ques. You referred to perfection. I was wondering if you had in mind @Hebrews 6 -- "Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection". They made Him a supper here; had they reached a stage of perfection before they made the supper?
J.T. I think they had, I believe it is the finished result of a certain ministry. Colossians has the same thing in mind, to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. The Colossians were not that, they had not gone on to the full result of the light they had -- here they did. Here it is not Christ among the gentiles, Christ in you (@Colossians 1: 27); it is Christ among the Jewish remnant, but the Jewish remnant seen as having acquired wealth, not from the ministry of Moses and the prophets, but the Lord's personal ministry; it is final so far. It is a Jewish setting, not yet the assembly, but ultimately merging in it. "He led them out as far as Bethany" corresponds.
H.B. "Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price". Is that a further thought?
J.T. Yes. The facts given are progressive. We reach the highest point contemplated in the section, that is what is alluded to, as if the full thought was reached, beginning with chapter 9. That is a great inquiry in any given place, as to whether we are going on to perfection or are stationary; satisfied
{86}
with a certain thought reached, a point decided by ourselves. The Colossians were doing fairly well, but they had not gone on to perfection, they were somewhat hindered, and there is always something peculiar to a place, which hinders.
H.P.W. Would you say a word as to how the pure nard is acquired? You spoke of it as being ready, would you say a little as to how what she had was acquired?
J.T. You took notice of what was said as to its being a sequence -- I think that is important. "Martha served ..." "Mary therefore ..." -- she is introduced as well known, that is, a previous history is in view; the result in Martha is serving. "Mary therefore ..." raises in your mind the whole recorded history of this sister. How did she acquire this? What is it? "Having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price", and the Lord's comment about that is, "Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial". The history, as recorded in @Luke 10, would show that she was governed by the current light. It was not an accident with her that she sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to what He was saying -- that was according to current light, that was the light that governed her position. The Lord had been on the mount (@Luke 9), and the voice from heaven had said, "Hear him"; she moved in that light, or rather, she sat at His feet because of that light. She was passive, but she was active in the sense of hearing. I believe the allusion is to saints, brothers and sisters, who recognise the present light; it is peculiarly intended to attract us, and to bring about what the Lord intends to be brought about. She began thus and the history of @John 11 would show how that was perfected, so it is now a deliberate intelligent act. She has the very best thing for the occasion, and she knows what to do with it, and the effect is felt. I think
{87}
the thought is perfection. You have reached the result of the ministry in which you are, which is shining upon you. Would you say that?
H.P.W. It would answer to the hundredfold of @Luke 8: 8.
J.T. Yes. We are often very slipshod in the way we take in the truth and appropriate it and assimilate it, so that there is not full growth. I think the scene presents perfection as the outcome of what the Lord had ministered.
Ques. Would you say, that where it speaks of Christ having loved them to the *end*, that is the object in view of which you are now speaking, the object in view is this state of perfection?
J.T. Quite so. It is an earthly position that He came to in Bethany, but in chapter 13 it is before the passover, and the identification of the "supper" spoken of is not clear. What happened is stressed, how "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end", and "knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God" -- that Christ is everything is settled. All that man is going on with religiously is just left. Jesus is not moving in relation to it at all, but in relation to another world; He is going out of the present one, going to God, going to the Father. He has everything in His own hand. In the light of all this the believer today is not hindered by current religious conditions.
E.G. You were saying, if we do not go on to perfection there is something that hinders in the place; do you refer to what is in local gatherings?
J.T. Well, I referred more to the character of the *place*. The apostles told God about what happened "in this city" (@Acts 4: 27), as much as to say. That is what we have to contend with in this
{88}
city. So it is well to take account of what the characteristics of a city are; our prayers are to have that in mind, for it is what we have to contend with, characteristics that may leaven us and dull our view, not necessarily open opposition.
Ques. If we do not get full advantage from the ministry the Lord is giving, but succumb to the influences around, and do not go on to perfection, I was wondering, seeing the concern of the apostles about those at Colosse and Laodicea, whether we might not eventually land in the Laodicean state.
J.T. Yes. Colosse and Laodicea were adjacent meetings, affected generally by the same conditions. No doubt the subsequent history of Laodicea was in mind.
G.C. In chapter 13 the Lord says, "Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for I am so. If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet". They say Teacher and Lord; the Lord says, Lord and Teacher. Would that be seen in Mary sitting at His feet submitting to the Lord, and then coming under His teaching and learning from Him?
J.T. Well, that comes under the heading of the instruction flowing out of His act. They had called Him Teacher and Lord, whereas His words are, "If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet". He asserts His position under these circumstances, not here *our* Lord, but He is *the* Lord; He has power to subdue, and moreover, He has power to teach -- who teaches like Him! He puts the titles in the proper order, saying, the Lord and the Teacher; the first stands related to the commandment, according to chapter 14; and the second to the word; the teaching would involve the word "My words", as He says. But what we ought to see particularly is the necessity, not only that our feet should be washed, but that *He* should do it. In the
{89}
light of all the passage states, it says, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end. And during supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas, son of Simon, Iscariote, that he should deliver him up, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God". These facts are to be noted as to the position, the outlook, and what He has; He has a free hand now, and He loves His own that are in the world, but He is in dignity, He is at supper.
A.R. Will you say a word as to His departing out of the world to the Father? Then in verse 3 it says He came out from God and was going to God. What is the difference between His going to the Father and going to God?
J.T. The first, I suppose, is what is opened up in chapters 14, 15, 16 and 17 -- God viewed by Him as His Father; going back to Him. He had not been there before in the relation of a Son with a Father; He had been there, of course, as to His *Person*, but He had not been there in that *relation*; so that it would be the setting up, I think, of the new order of things, the new order of administration above, where He is exalted, receiving all from the Father. It would be the beginning of the new order of things, and administratively, of what we call this dispensation. But then God is a wider thought carrying with it all that belongs to Him under this title. The same order is seen in chapter 20: "My Father and your Father, ... my God and your God". But here it is "the Father" and "God".
A.R. Would you connect it with @John 17: 5, "... the glory which I had along with thee before the world was"? Going back to God and taking up His place again in the Deity.
{90}
J.T. Verses 1 and 3 of our chapter have the *economy* in mind: verse 5, "Glorify thou me ... with the glory which I had with thee before the world was", alludes to His part in the intrinsic Deity, His part in it. His going to the Father and to God in chapter 13, I think, is still in the economy. He is contemplating an economy into which He has come, and that that economy holds as much in heaven as it does here; He carries on there as He carries on here. He would do nothing, but what He saw the Father do; that all refers to the economy, to the inferior place He took outwardly, and that continues. He goes back there as having died, and the dispensation is set up finally in heaven.
McG. Will you say a word as to what is involved in part with Him?
J.T. We need to see what is in His mind. Judas is there alongside Him with Satan in his heart; Satan had put it into his heart to deliver up Christ. The position is that Jesus is in dignity, but now He rises from supper, which is proceeding. It is not what we do. In chapter 12 *they* made Him a supper, but it is not said who made Him this; it is something He is proceeding with. He is there; and He rises from that and lays aside His garments. These are not merely religious garments such as are current, they denote what is spiritual, the spiritual dignity that belongs to Him in this position -- He lays them aside. We have to note every word that is recorded. He "rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel he girded himself: then he pours water into the washhand basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded. He comes therefore to Simon Peter; and *he* says to him. Lord, dost thou wash *my* feet?"
What is to be noticed is, the dignity of Christ in this position; He is going on with this supper, it
{91}
is not finished, He is going on with it, and He divests Himself; He does everything. He has no attendant. Moses had an attendant, the high priest had attendants but the Lord has no attendant here. He does it all, which is another feature of John -- He does it Himself, and He comes to Simon Peter. I suppose He carried the basin round as they lay at table, and He comes to Simon Peter. That is, He has to come to this and that person, He is performing a lowly service. Well, what is my thought of what He is doing? Am I ready for it? Do I understand it? Do I see any necessity for it? Maybe I am clean as far as I see; but He says, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". *He* must do it.
E.G. Will you open that out -- that *He* must do it?
J.T. Well, it is the great thought. We may think ourselves quite equal to any position, but the Lord says, I must have to say to everything. John would put that before us, it is what the Lord does, and He will do it, He is doing it. Am I letting Him do it? If not, things are not right, whatever I may think of what is done. He comes to Simon Peter, and he has a reputation that things are right with him, but are they right with him? Is the Lord having His way with him?
Rem. It suggests that a certain amount of will on our side oftentimes hinders the Lord.
J.T. That is the point here. "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". It is "first Peter" -- Peter had that distinction; well, has the Lord His way with Peter? Is the Lord having His way with him? If He is not, the Lord says, you are out of it; you may be doing much, but you are not having part with Me.
H.P.W. Is the service done at the Supper with us?
J.T. It may be; it is not easy to say; the point is, primarily, Is the Lord doing the thing? Later the
{92}
teaching is that we are to do it for one another, but it must be in the light of His doing.
A.R. Would you say what "part with me" refers to?
J.T. It is what He is going on with. He had been going on with the Jewish system, especially according to the synoptical gospels, but now He is going on with the heavenly order of things. We want to get at what is in His mind. "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father"; and then again, "knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands". What is in His mind? The word "knowing" alludes to what is in His mind at this moment, because divinely He knows everything, but what is He speaking about? What is He thinking about? Well, He is going on with the Supper, and the disciples are having part with Him -- because they were ceremonially clean. But there is something more needed; there is more needed than was needed in Bethany, and, primarily, even for the supper they are now partaking of.
H.P.W. Do I understand you to mean that what the Lord is particularly going on with now is to bring before us all that His own Supper opens up? There it is not so much a question as to whether adjustment is brought about by the Supper, but as to what is in His mind.
J.T. Yes. As we proceed with this chapter we see the wonderful things that were in His mind -- right up to chapter 17, where He leads us into the greatest possible things.
P.S.P. What is the significance of the act itself?
J.T. Of course it is in some sense to remove soil, but the disciples were already recognised as clean here, so it is a spiritual matter, above what is ordinary. Many may think themselves quite fit for the things the Lord is going on with, but He would
{93}
inquire, Have I had to do with you in this matter? The service is more to be *experienced* than to be defined.
P.S.P. Is it the application of the death of Christ?
J.T. Of course it is, there could be no washing without that. But notice, *He* puts the water into the basin; that is to say, He is placing it where He can use it in relation to me. Not the great general thought of the water and the blood; it is water placed so that it can be used in relation to me, or to any of us. It is a necessity in view of having part with Christ, and no one who loves Him wants to be out of that.
Ques. What is involved in the expression, "thou shalt know hereafter"?
J.T. That would allude to their then perfect means of knowledge, we are now in the time of knowing everything -- "*Ye* have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things".
Rem. What you have been saying would guard against any thought that we have ability of ourselves to move forward into this higher realm. Your thought is that it involves some personal service from the Lord.
J.T. That is the thing one has in mind. Definitions are quite in order, but we want to get hold of this one thought -- "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me".
{94}
THE DISCIPLES POSITION REGULATED BY CHRIST'S
@Matthew 5: 1 - 12; @Matthew 8: 18 - 27; @Matthew 14: 22 - 33
J.T. The strenuousness of the instruction is in mind in Matthew. Among other things, it requires that disciples should be regulated by the Lord in any position He takes up. In chapter 5 He goes up to the mountain, and, having sat down, His disciples *come to Him*; they move according to His movements and position. Then in the next scripture read, He entered into a ship and His disciples *followed* Him -- that is, they move again as He moves. Finally, He compels the disciples to go on board a ship, as if He would keep the matter going; if we take up the attitude of being governed by His movements. He would exercise His authority to *keep* us on this line. The times are difficult, they are strenuous and perilous, and they are becoming increasingly so, so it is thought that the consideration of these scriptures would help us in pursuing as we began.
First, the Lord opened His mouth and taught, we are told. In chapter 5 the crowds were in mind, as if they were hindering, so He went up to a mountain. Again, in chapter 8, seeing the crowds, He commanded to depart; and He dismissed the crowds again, according to the third scripture read. So that throughout withdrawal from the crowds is contemplated. The special thoughts the Lord has in mind require the withdrawal from what might influence us adversely, for crowds such as are contemplated in Matthew are more or less indifferent -- they may be interested or they may not. Certainly the influence of crowds does not promote spirituality, although we may have to serve in a crowd.
The first scripture indicates the gain of being governed by the Lord in His movements. So, having
{95}
opened His mouth, He taught them -- and it is all *blessedness*. He speaks of blessedness all the way down to verse 12 -- nine times. That should be a very good start for us as showing the gain of being governed by the Lord's movements. He begins with the poor in spirit, that they are blessed.
Ques. What would be the evidence of being poor in spirit?
J.T. It would be that one finds no sustenance in what men find sustenance and enjoyment in. The Lord was supremely that -- poor in spirit *as regards the world*. As poor in spirit you would not find sustenance in anything you have here.
J.M. What connection -- do you make between discipleship and bondmanship?
J.T. They run together, but, in the former, teaching is the general thought. It is worth while; they are choosing the good part and the Lord is assuring them and confirming them in their choice, in coming to Him, in speaking of blessedness. He does not say *they* were all these things, but He comes to them at the end -- "Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you, and say every wicked thing against you, lying, for my sake". They were persecuted -- hence, "Blessed are ye ..."
C.H. Are these the features that are to mark us in the present aspect of the kingdom?
J.T. Yes; these are the qualities that are blessed. It points to the intrinsic features of the kingdom, and they cannot be overcome, because in the very worst that can be done to you there is blessedness.
Ques. Is the thought, if we are to be divinely instructed, we are to be where He is, a moral position?
J.T. Quite so -- here moral elevation.
C.H. Would David set forth one who was poor in spirit in a special way? He speaks of the poor man in the Psalms.
{96}
J.T. Yes, I was thinking of that very word; undoubtedly it is the Lord Himself in @Psalm 41: "Blessed is he that understandeth the poor". According to @Luke 6: 20, the disciples were thus regarded as corresponding with Him.
Ques. Would it be right to say that, if we are to be in the gain of bondmanship, discipleship is the way to it?
J.T. I think so. It refers to the mind a good deal. You come to Christ through the gospel and you see it is worth while; there is something in this, not simply relief for your soul, but something for your mind, and general outlook. Chapter 4, of course, is basic to this: how the Lord was in the wilderness, how He overcame the devil, how the light sprang up; and how He called two sets of brothers, how they moved at His call. Then the wonderful power there was in Him; He went round the whole of Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom and healing every disease, and "his fame went out into the whole of Syria, and they brought to him all that were ill, suffering under various diseases and pains, and those possessed by demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them. And great crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and beyond the Jordan". Then He goes up into the mountain -- that is an inkling to faith that there is something to be learnt in moral elevation, involving strenuous movement, for He has to go *up* the mountain, and His disciples come to Him. I think the Lord takes account of that; His disciples come to Him, and, having opened His mouth, He began to talk of blessedness. At the end He virtually says, You have part in this too, so that it is not something beyond us. It may be a matter of persecution, so that there is nothing for the flesh at all, no incentive at all; it is repulsive to fleshly feeling.
{97}
Ques. Would the verses in Isaiah bear on this? -- "Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand the report? Them that are weaned from the milk, withdrawn from the breasts? For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little", @Isaiah 28: 9, 10.
J.T. Yes, in the sense of detailed instruction. The passage refers to teaching suitable to children, those in view being in a low, sottish condition; there was a testimony, "But they would not hear", and it took a judicial form (verse 13).
F.W.W. It is like @Matthew 11. He first says, "Come to me", and then, "learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart".
J.T. Just so, only here He is not calling attention to Himself yet. Later He says, "I say to you" -- but here it is blessedness that He speaks of, and blessedness that attaches to certain qualities whoever has them. So, whatever you have in this sense He appraises it and encourages you in the sense that it is something of value.
Ques. Would one's spirit stand very much in the same relationship to discipleship, as the mind does to bondmanship? If your spirit is not pure you may turn away.
J.T. Yes, I think so. The spirit is the first-mentioned as part of the being -- "your whole spirit, and soul, and body", as if the spirit comes first. The mind is connected with bondmanship in @Philippians 2. God had been working and the qualities mentioned here as occasioning blessing, are the fruit of His work. These qualities are honoured here; we all need to come into this blessedness. Maybe we are missing it through not taking sufficient account of the qualities that exist in us. Possibly there is a little more in us of the work of God than we had thought of,
{98}
and perhaps we do not rest enough in what God has done in us. The epistle to the Romans, being analytical, helps us as to these qualities, if we have any of them, for we may as well take account of them in their true value as the work of God. The mind and spirit are both called attention to in Romans, but the mind particularly -- "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". I have found my feet through the analysis of @Romans 7, and I am enabled to take account of what I have and to move on.
Ques. Is that the spiritual mind?
J.T. The first thing is to see what the faculty is that God has given me. I am determined that I can employ it and dominate it and that it is to serve the law of God, not any other.
Rem. Paul in Corinthians speaks of our having the mind of Christ.
J.T. The mind of Christ is a great thought, it is the thinking faculty. The mind is often used in a moral sense, but the faculty has to be taken account of by itself. Through analysis I come to see that I can employ it and dominate it, so that eventually I "prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God".
C.H. Is that why the Lord says, "Blessed are ye ..." as though He would give them credit for being able to enter into the persecutions?
J.T. Yes. He puts it on you, that it is *when* you are persecuted -- "Blessed are ye, when men shall ... persecute you". Suffering in loyalty to Christ, you come into this blessedness.
Rem. The persecution would come when you are setting forth these features that you have been taught.
J.T. Yes, "And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted", @2 Timothy 3: 12.
{99}
E.G. It is remarkable that persecution should follow the thought of peace-makers being called the sons of God.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Is the faculty of the mind referred to in @Colossians 3: 2 -- "have your mind on the things that are above"?
J.T. Just so, you have power over it. It is a great matter to reach that, that you have power over your mind.
<blockquote>'No infant's changing pleasure <br>Is like my wandering mind', (`51:2)</blockquote>
said a great servant. We all have to accept that, but it is a great thing to control the mind, to shut out certain things and allow other things.
J.G. You helped me greatly in your remark that we should keep control of our minds.
J.T. It is what is pointed out, I think, as to Abraham; he scared away the birds -- those evil thoughts or powers that would damage him -- spoil what he was doing.
The next point in the passage read in chapter 8, is the extension of the Lord's authority. It says, "Jesus, seeing great crowds around him, commanded to depart to the other side", for He was staying in a particular place. Spirituality wanes in such circumstances; even after meetings such as this, we are apt to speak of things that have no value at all spiritually. Holiday-making combined with the service of God is also fraught with danger. I am only saying this to be practical; we are apt to lose what we have gained unless we are on the alert, and the Lord sees this and commands to go to the other side, to take up another position, a new set of exercises. That is, you never can relax spiritually without letting the enemy have an advantage, and he will rob you of what you have gained. So "seeing great crowds around him" -- that would emphasise more what
{100}
we are saying, they are *around* Him. He had done what He intended to do in the place, that was finished; we are told, "when the evening was come, they brought to him many possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were ill" -- that work is finished. The Lord has something else now to take on -- He commanded to depart to the other side. And then we have two men: the first says, "Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go", that is, I am not behind any of the disciples. "And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven roosting-places; but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head". That is, one may think he is quite up to the mark; but the Lord will give you further tests; He has not where to lay His head -- are you ready for that? Then another says, "Lord, suffer me first to go away and bury my father. But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead". These are two remarkable tests at this point. The second request seems very reasonable, but these reasonable things brought into christianity are dangerous. This man who speaks as not behind any disciple illustrates how we may be affected by ministry. All he had to do was to act on the Lord's command to go to the other side; that is the moral position, it is a question now of doing what the Lord would have us do. Great services are being carried on; the Lord is doing things in pieces and He has finished this bit, now He is preparing for the next. If you have not got this in your mind, the enemy will get in. We must not let our minds be at a loose end.
F.I. So Peter exhorts us to gird up the loins of our minds.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Will you say again what you said as to the first man saying, "I will follow thee"?
{101}
J.T. Well, he was taking the ground that he is not behind anyone; he said, "Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go". That was the ground he was taking. The Lord's answer would show that he was saying a little too much.
Ques. Would all this suggest self-complacency and self-importance, and an absence of definiteness, which would be great hindrances to discipleship?
J.T. That is part of the teaching. The Lord is very considerate of us, and He knows what is behind what we say better than ourselves. It is a serious undertaking, for the point is discipleship, that you are in accord with the Lord, that wherever He goes, you will go.
Rem. So the man in verse 19 was marked by self-confidence, and the other by a lack of definiteness.
J.T. "Suffer me first to go away and bury my father" was a demand of nature, but the urgency of discipleship excluded even this, and the Lord, as sacrificing everything, must be the Judge.
J.M. In the third case, @Luke 9, we have one who wanted to return to say good-bye to his people.
J.T. Yes. These two incidents in Matthew suffice for the teaching in view. The Lord went into the ship and His disciples -- the characteristic ones -- followed Him. You want to be there, making no remarks about it; the point is to *follow*.
C.H. Are these adjustments necessary to us if we are to be the true followers?
J.T. I think so, you feel how they challenge the heart; you want to be really what the teaching requires -- a *disciple*.
C.H. Is it peculiar to most of us, too much forwardness or too much backwardness?
J.T. Yes. *His disciples followed Him*, and the passage says, "the water became very agitated on
{102}
the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves; but *he* slept".
Ques. Would you say that would be normal christianity today -- following the Lord in faith?
J.T. That is the thing -- *do* it, it is the *doing* of the thing. So @Acts 1 says, "things which Jesus began both to do and to teach". Then our scripture says, "having arisen, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. But the men were astonished, saying, What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?" The point is, what we learn and what all in the ship get, as a result of a move like this. The men in the ship are learning. The word "men" is not the same as the word "disciples". The men in the ship are brought into the matter. The effect of the testimony is widening; those who are in the testimony of God ought never to be narrowed up, there ought always to be some widening out of things. Even if people are not sharing in the thing fully, they are affected; all that are around us ought to be affected by what is happening if true discipleship marks us.
Ques. Are those referred to here especially those that came by the way?
J.T. That is it; then the thought arises that disciples are *made* (@Matthew 28: 19).
A.W.R. Would this be a test for us in the midst of the present political situation in the world? At the present moment there seem to be storms arising, and disciples are tested.
J.T. Quite so, and there should be *more than we began* with coming out; a continual enlargement of thought, even if numbers are not increased. People who come in contact with true disciples are affected, that is the idea, there is a testimony going on. You would say that?
{103}
Rem. Yes, indeed. I was thinking a disciple would not be very serviceable if he cannot go on when the Lord seems to be asleep.
J.T. Just so; disciples should know that all is well. "The Lord awoke as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine", @Psalm 78: 65. In Samuel's day the ark was taken, the glory departed, they were being tested, and no doubt Samuel's constitution was being built up, as many others in those days, and God came in, He "awoke", He thundered on the Philistines and discomfited them, but the *men* of Israel completed the work, pursuing the enemy beyond Beth-car. Here the men in the ship inquire, "What sort of man is this?" It is a new kind of man and that is what is needed -- a new kind of man to carry on. He had commanded to go to the other side.
Rem. The experience of the disciples in @Matthew 8 and the result of it, as stated in verse 27, would correspond with the exercises set out in @Psalm 44: 22 - 26 and @Psalm 45: 2, "But for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are reckoned as sheep for slaughter. Awake, why sleepest thou, Lord? ..." The discipline goes on, and God appears to be asleep; but the cry goes out from the heart to wake Him. The result is in the experience detailed in @Psalm 45 -- an intelligent apprehension and appreciation of Christ and of the assembly; also ability to speak of it.
S.R. Is the thought that we should be restful in circumstances out of our control? The disciple is not above his master, but as his master.
J.T. I think so. And knowing the Lord, I expect Him to come into any stormy circumstances I may be experiencing. I have learnt the Lord in that way, and I am expecting Him to come in and quell the storm; and He does that, even in regard of international
{104}
commotions, as we look to Him. The Lord comes in. He comes in and makes a way for us.
C.H. Is this not a good exercise developed in the men -- "What sort of man is this?"
J.T. I thought that. The apprehension of a new kind of Man sprang up in these men -- at least that is the opportunity for them.
C.H. Do we not get occupied much with ourselves, but the exercise is, What this Man is?
J.T. Yes, so you are now occupied with Him. In chapter 14: 33, as we shall see later, "those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God's Son".
G.C.S. Walking on the sea is moral superiority to it.
J.T. Yes; superiority to circumstances effected by the devil. We are living in difficult times, and they are becoming more and more so. Chapter 14 contemplates a troubled sea, yet the Lord walking on it.
J.M. Will you help us as to what the disciples represent as having been compelled to enter a ship and go over, and the Lord remaining to dismiss the crowds?
J.T. This is introductory to the assembly, in connection with which the Lord specially undertakes for us. Sometimes the crowds are attractive; it says, there were five thousand men, besides women and children -- a large number. I suppose we should take that to heart, for we are apt to attach importance to big meetings, and the like; "immediately", the passage says, "he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds. And having dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pray". That is, He performed two services; He dismissed the crowds, which would mean that out of crowds of people evil might rise -- even if people have been ministered to by Christ --
{105}
if they do not remain under His control, evil may arise. Stress is laid on the dismissing of the crowd: and then He went up to pray. He could pray below, but He goes *up* to pray, alluding, I suppose, to His position above now in relation to the assembly.
F.I. So that we might rise to the height of His greatness in being able to speak of Him as Son of God.
J.T. That is the lesson here. It is "those in the ship" -- they are not called "men" here as in chapter 8 -- they say to the Lord, "Truly thou art God's Son".
Ques. Would similar features be seen in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego? They were in the fire, and there was one like the Son of God there.
J.T. Just so -- "the fourth". Here the disciples were "tossed by the waves" -- corresponding somewhat with the position in the furnace. The Lord joined them, walking on the sea, and He joined those in the furnace.
C.M. Is the little ship a wrong place for us now, or do the two thoughts go on together?
J.T. I suppose the ship was the Jewish position, and then there is the leading up to assembly position. The circumstances are not to be altered. Then they rejoin the ship, which would point to the end of the assembly period, I suppose. Those in the ship spoke to the Lord and told Him that He was the Son of God. That is remarkable; I am sure the Lord loves to hear such a confession as that from us -- not simply that the disciples do it, but the people in the ship do it -- there is a widening thought. The Lord had put them into this position for their education. We need to be subject to the Lord. He has the very best thing in mind for us, that we are going to have part in the assembly.
W.B. What answers to the troubling of the sea today?
{106}
J.T. Well, it is what the enemy would cause as against the saints as in the position indicated.
Rem. This is not a sudden squall; such a wind is blowing all the time. There are occasions when special occurrences happen, of course.
J.T. "The wind was contrary", which is to be expected. As we are placed in any position or circumstance by the Lord, the enemy will oppose.
Ques. Verse 32 says, "When they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell". What would that suggest?
J.T. Well, these adverse circumstances will come to an end. But the Lord walking on the water is in complete superiority to these adverse circumstances, and the assembly was to join Him there, as seen in Peter. This is the great lesson here.
A.W.R. Until we arrive at the knowledge that He is God's Son and are in the light of His present position, are we not liable to regard this as an apparition?
J.T. Yes. This idea of phantom belongs to the realm of superstition. This is education for the assembly now, as I said, but the position of the remnant is also in mind. Then the homage to the Lord -- it is a very great matter that people come to speak of the Lord Himself and call Him the Son of God. The Lord in compelling them to enter the boat, had all this wonderful experience and education in mind. It was entirely His own thought. The boat represents a known accommodation in adverse conditions of the testimony, but walking on the water is a wholly new experience and depends on faith as apprehending Christ. Peter says, "Lord, if it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters". His faith was weak, but he moved to Christ under this command.
{107}
GROUPS SEEN IN RELATION TO THE CROSS
@Matthew 27: 45 - 66
J.T. The groups or classes of persons seen here at the cross of our Lord, are in mind to be considered at this time. In the section read, you have those who do not understand the words spoken by the Lord, though uttered in the most perfect way, with the clearest pronunciation. They say, This man calls for Elias, thus indicating that they regard the Lord as a mere creature, praying to another creature. Then there are the military, keeping guard; they are affected by the testimony at the moment along with the centurion, and confess the Lord as Son of God (verse 54). Then those who followed Him from Galilee and ministered to Him, some of whose names are given. Following on them in the narrative, we have Joseph, whom we may associate with Nicodemus, another disciple who reverentially cares for the body of the Lord. Then the chief enemies of the testimony -- the priests and Pharisees -- carrying on the service of the devil, are seen at the end, endeavouring to defeat the testimony by an artifice which the governor allowed (verses 62 - 66).
I thought we might become more reverential and humble in presence of the truth through the consideration of these groups, challenging ourselves as to which we belong to, for they exist today. This section gives us only some of the classes; there are the soldiers mentioned earlier, Pilate and his wife, and Judas. This is a most solemn and searching chapter for us, and intended to sober and humble us, and subdue our spirits.
F.I. All these different classes represent certain conditions in which men are found today.
J.T. Yes, they have their counterpart today, and we are challenged as to which class we are in.
{108}
Obviously those who followed the Lord from Galilee ministering to Him, represent the fellowship, as we might say; though "afar off", they were with the Lord in heart, and intelligently, according to their measure. John in his gospel refers to them as standing by the cross. Then there are those who are capable of being affected immediately by the current testimony, as it is presented. They make a confession; it is an encouragement as to fellowship; we may reckon on the current work of God seen in the immediate effect produced, over against positive opposition to it. Earlier, those standing by said to the Lord, "If thou art Son of God, descend from the cross" (verse 40); and again, "For he said, I am Son of God". Here, the centurion said, "Truly this man was Son of God" (verse 54). Whatever has been said by the haters of Christ -- and much has been said -- God would have the very thing affirmed that has been denied, and that is an important matter. It is a sure effect of the work of God over against what is asserted in opposition to Christ. We have the word in @1 Corinthians 15, "your labour is not in vain in the Lord", hence one can always reckon on immediate and genuine results from the testimony, over against what is being alleged in opposition.
H.B. Would a crisis in the testimony bring this to light, or is it general?
J.T. It is the general bearing of the testimony here. The chapter shows it is a very public matter. The chief priests and elders take counsel against Jesus; they are the leading religious people. Then there are Pilate and his wife, the latter capable of being affected by the testimony that was current, and recognising that the Lord is a "righteous man". Then the remorse of Judas is recorded, and the Lord's position as standing before the governor; all this is public; and the soldiers sitting down, then the superscription of His accusation, and His own voice
{109}
in a cry. No passage could be more affecting, more profound, more far-reaching. You have the voice of Christ in the clearest possible manner, and yet His language is not understood. He is regarded by those around as a mere creature -- how current this is today! -- and dependent on another creature -- a double blasphemy.
W.McB. @Psalm 22 comes in here.
J.T. Yes, the actual words He used are quoted, a translation into Greek being furnished in the text. It is in the vernacular, it should be understood by those present; and yet it was *not* understood. So today there are plain things in testimony, and yet not understood. "Why do ye not understand my speech?" the Lord said. It brings out those who do not understand, exposing "the ignorance of senseless men", @1 Peter 2: 15. The words here would have been understood in any setting, save in relation to Christ, showing the perverse will at work. Over against that, we have the military men taking account of heaven's action. As the Lord cried and died, "the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent, and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many. But the centurion, and they who were with him on guard over Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that took place, feared greatly, saying, Truly this man was Son of God". God is thus seeing to the matter. This sign did not come immediately at the first cry (see verse 46), so the real opposers commit themselves. It was after the second cry, the Lord having died (verse 50), that God intervened, having undoubtedly these military men in mind. They would represent the current work of God in connection with the testimony. It had become
{110}
effective in them, and so they say, with the centurion, "Truly this man was Son of God".
Ques. What is the difference between the two cries?
J.T. The first cry is in regard to the actual wrath of God, when Christ was paying the penalty of sin, "Why hast thou forsaken me?" The second has in view the termination of the man that sinned, in the actual *death* of Jesus, though the penalty in the forsaking had already been borne. The second cry corresponds with the other gospels; it involves that the man that sinned is done with morally. The whole thing is settled in regard of penalty, first in the actual sufferings, not merely physical, but of a spiritual nature which the Lord Jesus endured; then the second cry is in relation to actual death, conscious as the Lord was of what He was doing. It was not weakness: He cried with a loud voice.
J.G. Jesus suffered without the gate and sanctified the people, therefore we go forth to Him without the camp. Would you say a little as to the bodies of the beasts burned without the camp.
J.T. It sets forth the absolute termination of the man that sinned, the sin-offering is alluded to. There was a difference in the sin-offerings in that the blood of some of them was *not* carried inside the veil. These latter allude to our apprehension. The blood carried inside and placed on the mercy-seat refers to the fulness of the thought of atonement. God is appeased, and the answer to that is the burning of the whole carcass outside the camp. The burning of the sacrifice outside the camp corresponds with the second cry; the man that sinned is dealt with *in toto*.
P.S.P. Death is dispossessed.
J.T. Quite so, and there is the testimony to it. Christ is raised again for our justification.
{111}
Rem. It says, "after his resurrection" that those alluded to here came out of their graves.
J.T. It is a question as to *when* the tombs were opened, but it is mentioned here in connection with a group of facts. The coming out of the tomb was of course after His resurrection -- some days after, no doubt -- but it shows how God confirmed Christ's resurrection. It stands in relation to the facts as confirmation for our faith. These things mentioned affected the centurion -- "seeing the earthquake", and so on. There is a group of great general facts, and their bearing, brought forward; they are for faith. As the testimony is effectively rendered, God works in souls. He had worked in souls earlier, but here He does it instantly. It is an encouragement to us to go on, seeing that God works in relation to verbal testimony presented, as in the voice of Christ, and God confirms the word by signs following. Other things help us besides the actual voice. We have the concurrent work in souls, and the confirmation of testimony in signs following. "Knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord", the apostle says.
-.M. The veil is rent here from top to bottom; in Luke it is in the midst.
J.T. In Luke it is a fuller thought, in the midst: God coming *out* to man. Here it is more from the top to the bottom. Matthew gives us God acting authoritatively; it is from above, as it were; the whole Jewish system (in its legal efforts, hindering the truth of christianity) is set aside. In Luke it is just "in the midst". It is grace: God, through the death of Christ, making a way to reach *man*. You can never understand the gospels save through the epistles, there you get the educational side and you come to the gospels for confirmation. How great the position is here! The facts are brought to bear on us by the power of teaching in the epistles, so they become embedded in our souls. As to the passage
{112}
before us, we shall do well to put ourselves alongside these women -- they came a long way.
Ques. Was all carried forward in testimony through the apostles? Paul spoke of Jesus and the resurrection.
J.T. Yes, on the principle of levitical ability. No one understands the gospels until he understands Romans.
W.McB. How do we stand by the cross of Jesus today?
J.T. By honestly accepting the teaching of 1 Corinthians. The *word* of the cross rightly received gives you to understand it. You understand it thoroughly. It is not a metal cross worn on our persons: there is no value in that!
E.G. Is the "holy city" a sphere where such a testimony would be received?
J.T. The Lord had exposed the literal city in the most scathing terms, but the primary idea of Jerusalem is never abandoned by God. The saints at Jerusalem, after the Lord, as risen, came in among them, would be ready for those risen ones coming in; they "appeared to many", Scripture says. The Lord made a way for this, in coming amongst His own on the first day of the week. It is like bringing His sheaves with Him; He has the risen saints. We have to leave with God what happened to them afterwards. The testimony of their resurrection entered into the constitution of the assembly -- real risen saints coming out of their graves; they may have been thousands of years dead.
J.G. What about the one hundred and forty-four thousand (@Revelation 14)?
J.T. Those are not actually risen, they are the fruit of testimony and are with the Lord on Mount Zion. They are near enough to heaven to hear the song. Three groups are brought together: those who form the assembly, the living creatures and elders;
{113}
the victorious saints, those put to death under the Beast, no doubt; and this group, "bought from the earth", but on the earth, yet very near to heaven so as to hear the new song.
It would greatly strengthen us in the assembly if we saw these men who had come out of their graves alluded to in this chapter in Matthew. What a triumph for Christ are these risen saints in the holy city!
P.S.P. Would that word, "compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses" connect with the resurrection scene?
J.T. The cloud of witnesses are those recorded in @Hebrews 11 as living by faith. These risen testify to Christ's resurrection. Christ the first-fruits, then those that are His at His coming. These are among the latter, although appearing early as a testimony. The Lord spent forty days in making the saints spiritual, first appearing to Cephas, the erring brother, and then to others. The more spiritual we are, the more we can visualise this; how formative and confirming these appearings would be! You have James included, and then all the apostles -- the authoritative ones. These appearings would not be limited to the forty days, they would come into the period of the Spirit, as in Paul's case.
Ques. What is the value of the introduction of these appearings in @1 Corinthians 15?
J.T. To bring us into the spirit of things. One of the greatest results in reading Scripture is to be brought into the current of things, not simply the letter. What it must have been to see the Lord in the presence of five hundred brethren!
H.B. Would the movements of the women referred to here show how we arrive at things? They followed Jesus from Galilee.
J.T. Quite so. The next chapter shows, alas! how unbelieving they were, but undoubtedly the Lord
{114}
educated them in those forty days, so as to be ready for greater things. They came from Galilee which speaks of *reproach*, and are now standing at the cross -- a gibbet with Jesus on it! the supreme thought of reproach. The apostle could say, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world". All these events brought down to us make for spiritual enrichment.
F.I. The appearings could hardly be confined to the forty days, as Paul is included, so the appearing to the five hundred may not have been then.
J.T. It may not have been. Colossians is the teaching epistle by which we come into the good of this. Paul writes, "buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead". That is, I take it in, in *faith*; and then secondly you have *quickening*, so that there is the means of appreciating the thing. Thus we are able to testify.
We should fix our minds on those who followed the Lord from Galilee, so as to understand the fellowship. Like the twenty-four elders, they are experienced believers, having followed Jesus, and that from Galilee. Here they are in the place of supreme reproach, along with the One who was the centre of their affections. Then we have Joseph, who is called a disciple, though he is not in quite the same class as the women, nor as the centurion -- still he came into it undoubtedly. First we have the immediate result of the work of God which is always to be recognised, then a man called a disciple who comes in after the death of Christ, not seen in relation to His cross, but to His burial. It is what the soul discerns. If I discern Christ as Son of God, I am in the light of another world, and I am called into the fellowship of God's Son. Fellowship has
{115}
to be noted. The women are of one mind, and experienced in it; they followed the Lord a long way, *ministering* to Him.
Rem. It says they beheld "from afar off".
J.T. Matthew is an assembly man, and takes note of distance. John speaks more abstractly, he says, standing "by the cross of Jesus". Evidently they were near enough for Him to address His mother and John; if He speaks, He will regulate you. From Matthew's point of view, there is distance.
Rem. "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
J.T. You cannot overcome the world save as in that power. The Son of God belongs to another world. You might be judging the world and *not* out of it, like Lot. An *outlet* is the thing. The Lord is giving us to understand what we are to confess. Not that this Son was *begotten of the Father before all worlds*. We are *not* confessing that, for Scripture says that He was "marked out Son of God in power ... by resurrection of the dead". I confess *that*; also that "we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life".
E.G. What would the hewn tomb suggest?
J.T. It was a suitable grave; Satan could not rob Him of that. God robbed Satan of the advantage of the grave that he intended for the Lord. There is satisfaction in the enemy's intent being defeated, even if nothing positive is gained; "but he was with the rich in his death", @Isaiah 53: 9.
Ques. What is the force of the Word "demanded" used by Joseph (@John 19: 38)?
J.T. Joseph, I suppose, could approach the governor in the liberty indicated. God ordered it that there was such a man, an equal, as we may say.
{116}
Pilate could recognise the status of Joseph. God selects a certain man for a certain work.
Then we have the chief priests and Pharisees making provision for what they deemed might take place. "And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, secure it as well as ye know how". They did so; it is man's final act, and the next chapter opens up heaven's great act -- a messenger from heaven is sitting on the stone! That is derision, "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh".
Ques. Would this action on the part of the priests and others imply fear that after all they had not got rid of Christ?
J.T. Yes, that same fear is present in opposers today; why are they so active? They are constantly saying this or that to add to their heaped-up opposition. They are afraid.
Ques. May we look for intervention today?
J.T. Yes, heaven will come in, so our resource is in prayer. The women were on the alert. "What I say to you, I say to all, Watch". In every matter of this kind where man does his worst, and Satan does his worst, God comes in for us.
{117}
PRAYER
@Genesis 20: 7, 17; @Job 42: 7 - 10; @Acts 9: 10 - 13
I have in mind to speak about prayer, particularly to call attention to God's interest in those who pray. He knows them. He tells us that if a man love Him; He knows him; and whilst that is general -- God knowing us in all our parts and features -- He also particularises in what He knows in each of us. Of course He knows all divinely -- the good and the evil -- and in order to assure us it is so, He speaks of books in which He writes names and works, not that He needs to do this on His own account, but to assure us of the accuracy of His knowledge of us. So we have Moses alluding to God's book -- "blot me ... out of thy book" -- but God takes counsel with Himself as to this blotting out of names. We have the book of life and other books. God, as was said, assuring us in this way of His accurate knowledge of us, for He regards all of importance; but the Spirit says, "If any man love God, the same is known of him". God knows him, and he who loves God prays, characteristically at least, in regard of divine interests -- those things which are of the greatest importance to God.
There are believers who are of a *missionary* mind, and if there is any likelihood of a convert, they pray for such. In this they serve well, but in Scripture, prayers for saints are enjoined more than those for sinners, and this is confirmed by example. The most active and most efficient servant of God is the man who needs prayer most; so, while praying for a likely convert, let us not forget those who serve God, indeed all saints. The names on the breastplate are not sinners as such, but saints; so, if we love God we shall pray for what is nearest to His heart, and of chief importance to Him. Not that we omit "all
{118}
men", for we are enjoined to pray for them, but let us remember that the great urgency of prayer according to Scripture is in relation to those in the testimony.
Now these three men that I dwell on are selected as illustrative of what is in mind, men whom God has taken account of as persons who pray. Perhaps no service is so effective, and none so within the range of all as prayer; and God, in these scriptures, would encourage us as to His valuation of the prayers of saints. You will remember how the living creatures and the twenty-four elders each had golden bowls full of odours which are said to be the prayers of saints, as if they were treasured by the most distinguished and most sympathetic of those who are the subjects of God's work, reflecting in this way God's estimate of prayer. It does not say in @Revelation 5 that they *offered* the prayers, but they represent persons who are sympathetic with the heart and mind of God, and with His people too. In chapter 8 you have the Priest, not at the altar without, but inside at the golden altar; He has a censer, and the fragrance from it makes efficacious "the prayers of the saints". Let the youngest understand this, that as he offers his prayers, however meagre, yet if it is *really* prayer, if he is praying with prayer, like Elijah, his prayers are made efficacious by our great Priest at the golden altar. What I refer to is intended to draw all saints into this great service.
Abraham is the first to be noticed, and he is seen in relation to a king. It is befitting that he should appear thus, as he is heir of the world. We, too, are in that heirship, every one of us, and are even to "judge the world". Abraham also represented that side. He says, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" But God says of him, "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of
{119}
Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice". He is the man. The heir of the world must be judge, for the world needs to be judged, and He who is the great Offspring of Abraham, the Lord Jesus, "Son of David, Son of Abraham", is to be Judge. Scripture says, God "hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained". Christ comes in thus, for He is Heir of all, and Luke presents Him to us in relation to humanity, and in his gospel He is seen praying some ten times.
Abraham foreshadows all this, and in this sense Jehovah speaks of him to a monarch. The thought sometimes arises in one's heart, Did God ever speak to anyone about me? did He ever say he will pray for you? How regretful we would be if we proved remiss in this matter, and failed to pray for a needy one. God has His instrumentalities in this way, and even rulers and kings are subjects of prayer. God has His own way of making communications to these rulers, however wicked they are, as we speak; He has avenues to their hearts. The heart of the king, it says, "is in the hand of the Lord ... he turneth it whithersoever he will". He has a way of controlling things -- and He would give these kings to understand that He has a praying people. The question of the rule of this island is always a burning one, disturbing the minds of men and women; one has been through the agitation here from time to time, and agitation as to government is world-wide today. There never has been such a time of disturbance -- unnecessary -- uncalled for, as we say; but God would say to all who are disturbed, whoever they may be, I have people who pray. In the experimental book of Psalms, written by persons who observe things, God alludes to His people as "a few men in number, of small account, and strangers" in the land. "They went from nation to nation, from one
{120}
kingdom to another people" -- they were not nationalists, they were pilgrims, "strangers in it".
God would say, I have those people. Now I want to be among those whom He so regards, those He can speak of to the great ones of earth. "Touch not mine anointed ones", He says, "and do my prophets no harm". What a comfort this is when storms rage and waves rise! Abimelech was doing harm to Abraham. God could have sent an angel and rescued Sarah, but no! -- He goes Himself. He goes in a vision. He could get there by this means more quickly and more easily than by an army; He says to Abimelech, You are doing harm to what is Mine. What a comfort that is! It renders us independent of human power: that God can approach a man in authority, and speak to him of "my prophets"; and that is not all. He intimates that Abraham can *serve* Abimelech, and *will* do so. He will pray for you, He says. How great a matter this is! And God can so regard any of us, for it applies in principle to all the saints. Here is a man the monarch was damaging, and God says, Release his wife, and he will pray for you. And we today have to do with the whole course of things nationally, socially, commercially, and militarily, but we are not concerned save on account of what belongs to God, that it should not be damaged, so we pray for kings and others, as the word says, "that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty"; also that a way may be made for the testimony, so that there is no interruption, by war, epidemics, or what not, to what God is doing.
So here we find this monarch acting under divine influence and on divine advice. God was successful, if one may so speak, for we find Abimelech amenable to right thoughts, and often kings are more amenable than we imagine. Though God holds them in with bit and bridle, He can find a way to their
{121}
hearts, and can appeal to their reason, and in this case can point out to Abimelech that He has a man who will pray for him. One could hardly have greater distinction than to be called attention to in this way.
The book of Job from which we have read is remarkable in relation to the gospel sermons which may be preached from it; indeed, it is intended for that, but also intended to show how a christian, a legal christian, an earthly-minded one, a self-occupied one, a proud one after the flesh, may be turned into a praying man, a priest. God styles Job His servant, and if He commits Himself to a man under that title, He will see him through, so that He may exemplify it. If God regards me as a servant and I fail in it, discipline begins; He will institute discipline if I am deflected. Satan is the instrument here, but he is limited in his dealings with the people of God; he never has full sway.
Then there are Job's three friends, showing the danger of special friendships -- with such, we may get a good deal of mutual flattery. Job became eloquent in speaking about his own attainments and qualities, and these three men had ability to do the same, enlarge on their forefathers, belongings, and so on. This may be seen at any time when people are together with natural affinities of one sort or another -- men of culture and ancestry. How men and women love that kind of thing! Job says, "But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. Yea, whereto should the strength of their hands profit me?" @Job 30: 1, 2. He pours contempt on them now. The band is broken, thank God; for it can do no good.
These common bonds of sympathy with men because of wealth, education, or ancestry are now disrupted, and the quicker the better, wherever they exist. They were more than ordinary men in that
{122}
there was something of God there, especially with Job, and God never took His eye off His servant. The book proceeds to show how patiently God pursues this man, till he is thoroughly broken up. "I know that thou canst do everything", Job says; it is a fine conclusion to arrive at -- "and that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine. Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered what I did not understand; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not". He has come to an end of all his pride, all the darkening counsel of his speeches, his words are ended (chapter 42: 2, 3). We may thank God for that. Not that there was nothing of value in his speeches, there was, but they were jewels in a wrong setting. Job could speak of things eloquently and yet not understand what he spoke of. He says further to God, "Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak ... I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee: Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes". He places himself in the hand of God, a thoroughly self-judged man. What will God make out of him? If God is to have the instrumentalities He needs, there must be the abandonment of all pretension, of all that attaches to one naturally; there must be the getting down to bedrock in self-judgment, if God is to do anything in me and by me. How blessed was "the end of the Lord" in Job's case!
After God had spoken to Job, He says to Eliphaz, "Mine anger is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job". God is here intimating that He is extremely fair in His dealings with His children. Things are graded in His dealings, Job, as a matter of fact, was much more vehement in his denunciation of his friends than they were of him, but God says, "Ye have not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job". Let us give every one his due --
{123}
God is infinitely fair, as I said, and never loses sight of His servant Job. He could work things out and He makes Job a priest. He classifies him by himself and his friends by themselves. They are not lost, but God can say, "my servant Job"; He does not call them His servants. Then He continues, "Take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you". Now Job is a true servant and is to be regarded as a true priest, and they are to go to him. How different his relation with them now! Not a social coterie, as earlier, but a priestly circle, where prayers are offered, not flattery. Coteries are to be abandoned, so that we may take heavenly ground, and have friends in a true sense, as John says, "Greet the friends by name". So these three men are instructed to take seven bullocks and seven rams to Job, and "Job shall pray for you", God says. He is now a true servant of God; God knows he prays, and that he will pray for these men. What a difference from the time when he poured scorn on them as inferior! They are not lost, they are secured through Job. He is the priest. That is what is going on, and God will bring us into this, that we become benefactors of our enemies, doing good, as Scripture enjoins, to those who persecute us. One would urge the importance of coming into line with this, that we pray for persons whom we have regarded as our enemies. It is the great triumph of christianity as seen in @Romans 12.
Finally we have God's great servant Paul. The Lord says to Ananias regarding him, "Behold, he is praying". It is a characteristic word, a word coming from the Lord Himself with peculiar force, for He was a praying Man here below, and when He was praying in a certain place, and ceased, one of His disciples said unto Him, "Lord, teach us to pray".
{124}
One would take note of those words, "when he ceased" in @Luke 11; it is well to stop when you have unburdened your heart to God, not to meander on and on, and tire the brethren. The longest prayer in Scripture takes only eight minutes to express, and we read that when Solomon "had ended praying", the glory of the Lord filled the house. It was delightful to God. So let us make our words few, when praying publicly, not that we may not pray at length privately, for the Lord "spent the night in prayer to God".
When on one occasion the Lord had ceased praying, one of His disciples said, "Teach us to pray". If we do not know how to pray, the Lord is ready to teach us, so He says, "When ye pray, say, Father, thy name be hallowed; thy kingdom come". He will set you on the way, not that you are to confine yourself to what is said there, but it is furnished as an example. One would have loved to have seen and heard the Lord speaking to God -- what an attitude, what an expression -- what emotions! It is not only the words that are important, but the attitude. So you get standing, kneeling, lifting up holy hands in regard to prayer. It is a service, and it gladdens the heart of God. When Daniel prayed, "the commandment came forth", Gabriel said, and Daniel is addressed as "one greatly beloved". As the Lord Jesus prayed on the mount, the fashion of His countenance became different; in like manner, as we become engaged with God, we are sure to be affected. If God is really engaging my soul it is bound to leave an impress.
So here the Lord tells Ananias that Saul is praying. It is as if the Lord hints that Ananias is a man who prayed too. He appeals, as it were, to a praying man; why should you fear a man who prays? He is doing it now! the Lord says. What force and pungency there would be in those words as addressed to
{125}
a man who understood what the Lord said: '*You* say, he is a murderer, and would take you to prison, but *I* say he is praying!' What a difference! And straightway Ananias goes and places his hands on him. You can commit yourself to anyone who is characteristically praying. Heaven has its own way of recommending persons who pray, and if they pray they are no longer self-reliant or independent -- they trust God.
May the Lord bless the word!
{126}
HOW LOCAL CONDITIONS ARE IMPROVED
@Luke 10: 38 - 42; @John 11: 1, 5, 20 - 28, 39, 40; @John 12: 1, 2
What is in mind is to show how local conditions may be improved, so that among the people of God divine circumstances in any place may be bettered. David had in mind to make divine circumstances better in his day. He had greatly improved them already according to the early part of the second book of Samuel and the first book of Chronicles, but in @1 Chronicles 17 he proposes to make them still bettor. That is an example for us, for at best in the localities where we are set there is great room for improvement in every instance. God is pleased to go along with what there is, limiting, of course, His forbearance, for there are things He cannot allow, but He goes a long way with His people in their localities, in spite of conditions which are unsuitable to Him.
The addresses to the assemblies recorded in @Revelation 2 and 3 show that the Lord takes account of what is favourable and what is not. These addresses were to the intent that there might be improvement. In the last address the Lord counsels persons, who are not at all in accord with His mind, to buy from Him. They were saying in Laodicea that they were rich increased with goods and had need of nothing, but the Lord said they were poor, and blind, and naked. He is ready to give, or even to sell, so that conditions should be better. If they would not accept gift the Lord was prepared to sell. There is no other remedy for these matters but to turn to the Lord. He is ready to give, but if you prefer to buy, He is ready to sell. He counsels that you should buy *from Him*. There is no gain in going elsewhere; you *must* come to Him. You may go to this brother or that
{127}
brother, which is right up to a point, but if you would be fully furnished with what is necessary you must come to Jesus, and if you are not ready to receive, He will sell, He is ready to give anything that is needed; He is ready to provide white raiment, eye-salve, and gold.
Well, now I take Martha and her village as representative of what I would like to convey. I take Martha to convey the thought of local conditions; It is a village and it is to be improved in Martha. The Lord comes *three* times to the village, in each of these Martha is seen. Martha received Him into her house the first time. On the first visit the Lord rebuked her, and of course this would be to improve her condition; on the *second* visit He instructs her, also to improve her condition; and on the *third*, He comes, and she *shows* the improvement. He sees the result of His dealings with her, indeed with all the family in Bethany. They were all right in relation to this visit -- Lazarus, Martha, and Mary. The point is really the improvement in the conditions in Bethany, and that largely lay in what the Lord effected in Martha.
Bethany was a locality in which God had something. In each locality God would have something which He can call His own, as in Corinth; "the assembly of God which is in Corinth". He had in that wicked, gentile city that which He could call the assembly of God. In speaking thus, it may be added that we are fitted for the testimony down here, as well as for our eternal portion, according to the counsels of God. If He has set us in a town or city, we are to represent Him there. The heavens represent Him. They declare His glory and the firmament sheweth His handiwork. That is, they display God in that way; He made them for that purpose, and so He prepares us to represent Him in the place He has set us. So in our eternal portion everyone will be in
{128}
his right place, and each fitted in relation to the others. We are all to be together, and we are to love one another. Ephesians shows that the saints in a locality have love, not only for the local saints, but for *all* the saints. God "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". A great thought is that we all go up together. Everything is with a purpose and there is not the slightest discrepancy in the result, but there should be something in the way of representation *here*, and also something that the Lord can come to, happily and freely. The Lord does come -- not corporeally, of course, but in a spiritual way.
Now I take up Martha for this purpose. It is hard to leave out Mary, for they are always seen together. What the Lord says to one He says to both, we may say. They have the same advantage as regards ministry. Martha heard the same things as Mary, but the results are not the same. Mary began to be acceptable to the Lord earlier than Martha. She made a *choice* -- Mary had chosen the good part. There is no evidence that Martha chose, she had no time, she was taken up with *many* things. Some are so busy that they do not choose what is divine at all. God also chooses; His sovereignty means that He chooses. He had made up His mind about us beforehand, as we learn in @Romans 8; He foreknew us and "whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified" @Romans 8: 29, 30. In answer to that process the feature that He likes in us is definite action, and among the things He looks for is *choice*, making a choice. Perhaps some of you here have never thought of that. I do not say a *general* choice, but a choice in some detail, in some definite
{129}
thing. Mary made a choice, and she was sitting down, enjoying and profiting by the thing she selected. It bore in the right direction, and the Lord likes that and commends it.
Well, Martha was cumbered about much serving. I may further say here that, in comparing the two sisters, Martha seems to have been the householder. We are not told the name of the village here: it is called "a certain village"; and Martha was the householder. She was, as it were, the leading brother in the meeting. She was the one that looked after things, and she would receive the Lord. She received Him into her house. Of course the leading brother will receive the Lord; but we have to bear in mind that the Lord is not here personally, so we have to receive Him through the brethren. Every leading brother would professedly make way for the Lord, but Martha did not treat her sister properly, nor did the treat the Lord properly, although she received Him. Our attitude to the Lord may be seen in the way we treat the brethren. She says to Him, "Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me". She implied that the Lord was not right; she rebuked Him. "Dost thou not care?" She is implying that *He* was negligent. She thought He would say, Mary, get up and do something. So the leading brother may be disappointed that he is not justified when the Lord comes in. The Lord does not come to justify *him*. He may bring up something that shows he is not just right; in fact, if I am expecting to be justified in anything I am sure to be disappointed. I knew of a brother who expected to be justified when a ministering brother, as we say, would come round, but the Lord disappointed that. It would do one more good to be condemned.
The Lord said, "Martha, Martha". The Lord called her *twice*; this implies that she had acquired a
{130}
certain place in the Lord's mind, she was in His mind for blessing, and something will come in for her good. Her name is down for blessing -- it may be through rebuffs, reproofs, knocks, but the list is there, and her name is on it for blessing. In @Matthew 5 the disciples came to Jesus and He began with blessing for certain classes of people. God has blessing in His mind for certain classes of people, so Martha is marked out by being called twice by the Lord. She is coming into great things. The first thing to be noticed here in Luke is "a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha" -- it is the idea of a locality and one responsible in it. The Spirit of God begins with Martha and not Mary.
Well I want to come on to John to show how the betterment came about. The village is never lost sight of. Take the city in which we are, since the time God began to work in it, it has never been lost sight of. God has in His mind every locality in which His people are, and He wants to improve what He has in it; not to improve the town, but to improve what is of Himself in it. That is always what is in God's mind. David is the great example of this -- he expressed to Nathan his desire to improve the divine circumstances here.
Well, @John 11 keeps the village in mind, and Martha and Mary, and Lazarus. We do not get Lazarus in Luke, we do get a Lazarus but not this one. He is added in John, because if the circumstances for God in a town are to be improved, a brother and two sisters in it are better than two sisters only. This is a comfort to us in our day. So that if local conditions are to be improved, there will be personal addition; an increase in quantity as well as an increase in quality. What is needed generally is increase in *quality*. Increase in quantity without increase in quality is a doubtful advantage. We come to John and we find a certain man, Lazarus of
{131}
Bethany, is sick. This sickness is not unto death, it is for the glory of God. It is a severe illness, it means death, but it is not *unto* death, that is, death is not the final end, but resurrection; for resurrection is where the glory of God is seen.
The first thing we get here is, "Now a certain man was sick ... Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha". The *town* is emphasised again. Doubtless what is stated indicates the judicial ways of God with His people. His judicial dealings are always in accord with His love. Discipline is the result of God's love, but, mark you, it was "for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it", that this man lay sick.
The next thing I call attention to is verse 5: "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus". Martha is mentioned first. At the beginning of the chapter Mary is clearly the principal one in the Lord's mind. She is specially drawn attention to. "It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick" (verse 2). She has the chief place among the three. In the three mighty ones mentioned in connection with David, there is one that is greater than the others. Mary is the chief one here; you cannot alter that; but Mary is not my subject, it is Martha. The Lord has something in mind when He mentions Martha first. Mary is spiritual; she is never easily irritated. She is not mentioned in verse 5 except under the heading of sister. It is sometimes a good thing that a sister who is perhaps thought to be spiritual -- and who indeed *is* spiritual -- is not brought to notice, but Mary will not mind that, for she has plenty of capital. She is not petty, nor irritable because another is more noticed than she.
Now it is said that Jesus loved Martha, and when Jesus came (verse 21), Martha spoke to Him. I go on from that to point out what she needed in the way
{132}
of instruction. She is, I may say, not very concerned about doctrine, and yet it is very necessary. Now, sisters -- you will pardon me for saying it -- are not generally interested in doctrine. They often ignore it sad to say, and are not concerned about it. Lydia was very attentive to doctrine. The Lord opened her heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul, and, dear sisters, *we* all need to attend to the things spoken by Paul. Well now, Martha needed the doctrine and we cannot have good local conditions without good doctrine. When Jesus came, Martha said, "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died".
The Lord could have kept him from dying, but Lazarus being dead enabled Him to open up what she needed to know. He would teach them much from it all, and, dear brethren and sisters, we are very deficient in teaching. We need to pay heed to the teaching of the apostles, particularly Paul: all the apostles writings of course, but especially Paul's; Lydia listened to Paul. One from whom we have profited much said, 'Do not forget John; but cleave to Paul'. Paul had the heavenly side of the truth, and he gives us the assembly.
Martha said, "But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee", verse 22. That is, she knew He was a godly Man -- perhaps, in her view, even more than Man; and she believed God could do for Him what He asked; but we shall never get on in our souls unless we have a clear grasp of the deity of our Lord. From this point of view Jesus needs not to ask, for He can do all Himself, and so He says to her, "Thy brother shall rise again". How much could be put into that! She says, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day". She was an orthodox Jewess, believing in a general resurrection, and some of us are like that, and thus practically on Jewish ground.
{133}
We may speak of *what the brethren hold* -- which just means that you have an orthodox creed of your own. Jesus says, "Thy brother shall rise again", and then He brings out that marvellous truth: "I am the resurrection and the life". I *am*. What a word that was! Are we ready for the truth about the Son of God -- ready for something fresh -- ready to take in things now in a new and living way, our souls open for the truth about Christ? so that if a neighbour asks what you are going on with, you can say something definite and living that you have learnt about Christ. The Lord has in mind a betterment of conditions in the locality, so He makes this marvellous statement. Are we ready to take in something great now? He says, "I am the resurrection and the life". Martha may have heard great things, but evidently she had not heard this before. The Lord works in a wonderful way. He allowed her brother to enter into death in order to open up to her what she needed. Further it says, "He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". Put into the language of the first epistle to the Thessalonians that word just means what we have in chapter 4: 16: "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first". Then the further statement in @John 11 that "whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die", means what @1 Thessalonians 4: 17 teaches us, "we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord". That is what happens when the Lord comes. Those that live shall be changed. As the apostle writes to the Roman believers, "He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
{134}
his Spirit that dwelleth in you". @Romans 8: 11. Now, is Martha ready for all this? Are we ready for it?
Fifty years ago God brought up the great subject of eternal life. Of course, it had been taught from the outset, for it is, and ever will be, an outstanding feature of the truth. It is through it we have the victory. Here the Lord says, "I am the resurrection and the life". The great truth is that *He* is the resurrection and the life. The opposers said that eternal life was a *person* and thus beclouded the truth, but in emphasising this great truth of eternal life, we are to make clear that it does not affect the *Person* of the Lord Jesus Christ it is not to affect in our minds the truth as to His deity. Scripture says, "He is the true God and eternal life". He *is* it as Man. He is the eternal life but He is *more*, He is the true God. So He says to Martha "Believest thou this?" Just to make it a creed is to impair the truth. A living Person is it. How little we really believe! I often challenge myself before the Lord, as to whether I really believe the great facts of christianity. Do I really believe? Let us challenge ourselves. Do I really believe these great realities? Therein is the victory! No local conditions -- political, social, or otherwise -- can overcome me if I believe these things. Martha says, "Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world". That is her faith, but why did she not wait for more? The Lord had not stopped. He will not break off as long as we are attentive. Still, she had taken in much of the great things the Lord had spoken to her. By going to Mary she shows clearly that her sister had a distinctive place with her.
So she calls Mary, and Mary went out and came where Jesus was. The Lord then commands the stone to be rolled away, and Martha said, "Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days". Then the Lord said to her, "Said I not unto
{135}
thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" When the stone had been rolled back Jesus "cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth". She saw the loved one come forth. Think of that, that she should really see the glory! He came out in answer to the power of the voice of Christ, saying, "Lazarus, come forth". Think of the glory involved! What a local brother he will be, and what a local sister Martha will be after such a sight!
That is all I have to say, except to point out that the Lord comes again to Bethany, and things in the family all fit. "Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment" (Chapter 12: 1 - 3). There is now a great change -- a great improvement in the state of things. Indeed the scene is perfect from the divine point of view, except for Judas, who lifts up his voice against Mary. There is just the one jarring note, as Judas interrupts: "Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?" And as Judas criticises Mary, we can understand how Martha would say, I am sorry *I* criticised Mary. How she would feel ashamed to think how *she* criticised Mary; she would own that Mary had been right all along. Thus, when Jesus came six days before the passover to Bethany, the conditions in the place were most pleasing to Him. Certainly, we may assume the Lord never enjoyed Bethany better before, and it can only be by
{136}
improving conditions that there can be happy circumstances for God to come in. Chapter 12 shows that His object was reached; the glory shone, and they were all in the good of it, and they know what to do; Martha served; Lazarus sat at table with Jesus; and Mary anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair.
{137}
AMENABILITY TO THE WILL OF GOD
@2 Kings 2: 19 - 22; @2 Kings 6: 5 - 7; @2 Kings 4: 38 - 41
It is the word "cast" in these scriptures that led me to read them, to link them together -- the salt *cast* into the source of the waters, the stick *cast* into the Jordan, and the meal *cast* into the pot of pottage, alluding evidently to the amenability of instruments of correction and adjustment to the will of another -- to the will of God.
Whatever is "cast" is amenable to the action or will of another. The best example, perhaps, which we have of this is in @Exodus 15, where Israel having crossed the sea, could not, as thirsty, drink of the waters of Marah -- they were bitter, brackish waters, meaning that death is bitter. The Lord "tasted" death. He knows its bitterness, and if we are to be brought into accord with Him in our constitutional fibre there is to be the tasting of what He tasted -- the tasting of death. So it is said, "Jehovah shewed him [Moses] wood", @Exodus 15: 25. Moses had to be shown it, and he cast it into the waters, alluding obviously to the amenableness of Christ to the will of Another. It is a great principle introduced by Christ, which is to pervade the people of God -- that we are to be amenable to the will of another; another's will is to be submitted to. We are not to be self-willed, for self-willed persons are useless, or worse, in the things of God. Christ was amenable to the divine will -- "not my will". He said, "but thine", namely, the Father's will. That is the great principle which the Lord exemplified and stressed; it has come down to us, and aside from it there is no possibility of anyone having part in the testimony of God, or in the assembly. Self-will is abominable to God; it is as iniquity and idolatry (@1 Samuel 15: 23).
{138}
Israel had to learn at the very outset of entering the wilderness, that if Christ tasted death in all its bitterness, they were not to be immune; we cannot be like Him save on that line. Moses *casts* in the wood. The passage does not say that God had told him to do that, but he did it. The people had believed in the Lord and in His servant Moses. That is, if the principle divinely set up is to be carried down, those in the lead are to exemplify it. Moses brought out the thought of what appears to be impossible to us, that is, the tasting of death here, for in truth it is that. Death is death, but the believer's taste is altered. The casting in of the wood conveyed something that is to be received into the soul, the principle that I am amenable to the will of another -- the will of God, and it may be expressed through the brethren. If adjustment is to take place I must be amenable to the will of God, whether directly or through the saints. So that as the waters became sweet and Israel drank, there was a statute and an ordinance made for them; the principle was legalised, so that it is imperative, and no longer optional. Moses casts the wood into the waters and there is an immediate change.
I wish to carry the thought to the second book of Kings; second books always bring in subsequent truth to what has been asserted. Elijah comes into the second book; he stamps the first book from chapter 17 onwards. One principle which comes into the first book of Kings is what a man *is*, and it is carried into the second book. We do not know who Elijah's father was, nor any of his relatives; we are only told that he was of the inhabitants of Gilead; that is all! It was no question of his ancestry or history or any official status, but of what the man *was*. He says to Ahab, "There shall not be dew nor rain these years, except by my word". What a man *is*, is of great importance today. In connection with
{139}
Elijah, one man falls (@2 Kings 1: 2). The official man fell, the king of Israel fell through a lattice; that is the position now. Great Babylon is fallen. The spiritual understand that; God has finished with the whole public system. Then another man goes up to heaven. The days were coming when Elijah must be received up into heaven. This foreshadows the present time. "It came to pass when Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal", @2 Kings 2: 1. As one man fell, another man is taken up by God into heaven. Christ has been taken up, we know. He has been received into heaven, received up in glory: and the time is come for the assembly to be translated too. So that it is *falling* on the one hand, and *ascending* on the other. That is the position of this book.
Elisha represents what is in this book in *power*. He understands he could not carry on at all without that -- a double portion of the spirit of Elijah is his request; nothing less. That is what is needed, for we must have a standard that is according to God. We are not to compare ourselves with ourselves, that is deterioration, we must have the divine standard. Elisha asks for a double portion of Elijah's spirit. We are enjoined to *ask*. The Lord says, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" @Luke 11: 13. You see the need, and the standard that God has set, and you do not want to be, at least in principle, anything below that. The point is to get the idea of ascension -- going up! The king of Israel had fallen -- he had no option. Elijah said to Elisha, "If thou see me when I am taken from thee", @2 Kings 2: 10, and the word to the disciples was, "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven". @Acts 1: 11. The significance of His going
{140}
up is brought down to us by the Spirit, and we are to understand it. Elisha got what he asked for, and hence the great power which marked his ministry.
My first point now is the passage in the second chapter where the land is described as barren (@2 Kings 2: 19). The situation of the city is good, but that in itself does not suffice. The land is *barren*, and the waters naught. It looks as if the men said We are just resigned to these sorrowful conditions. What can the man of God do? First, *they* have to provide a *new* cruse. If there is to be anything done at all in a needy locality, the brethren there must be brought into it. Do not, therefore, settle down and fold your arms and say, This is the position, nothing can be done. Bring a *new* cruse and put salt therein. No old vessels, no old methods, it is the *new* divine way that is effective. Many brethren are using old ones, but we are in a dispensation which is characterised by things being new, it is stamped with the word new -- newness of life newness of spirit, the renewing of the mind, the new man and so on. I am not to be taken up with the things of the day (not that I ignore them), my mind is to be applied to the things of God. The principle of what *is new* must stamp the position; particularly the manner of serving God is to be different. Possibly the men at Jericho had never before had anything like this suggested to them. It is a new thing that is needed here, the old ways will not do at all. They were to put salt into the cruse -- not salt that had "lost its savour", but what would make others savoury. We ourselves are to be new in principle.
Elisha goes forth to the source of the waters and casts the salt in there. That is, it is the will of another -- Elisha's will, and he is representative of God. This matter must come under the power and will of the Spirit of God. It is no patent medicine, it is the source that is wrong, and it is corrected. Every
{141}
one of us has to observe this principle -- to deal with sin as it works at the root. It is needful to go back habitually as far as we can in our spiritual history, and see how things have been from the outset. In this way we maintain a healthy state before God; we maintain as a state the mind of the Spirit, which is life and peace. The woman in @Luke 13 had been bound for eighteen years, she had ceased to be of any use in the service of God. The Lord in healing her referred to the evil from the outset. You may say our early days were much brighter, but what has happened if things are not what they used to be? Elisha settles the matter here. He says it is the source of the matter that is wrong. Thus what is new is employed, involving spiritual power, and the waters are healed. We have to get at the root of matters -- why is there so much barrenness? The remedy is in the recognition of the will of Another and getting at the source of things. The three passages I read furnish a thread which runs through this book, and, in fact, runs through the history of the testimony.
The next point is in chapter 6. It is a question of service; but first, service carried on with *borrowed* things. The brothers that are engaged in it are sons of the prophets, very uncertain sometimes, but here they make a good suggestion, not like the others who made suggestion to Elisha that misled him (chapter 2: 15 - 18). Here Elisha accepts what is said, "the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us. Let us go, we pray thee, to the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell", @2 Kings 6: 2. They did not want to move without the prophet, they were making a suggestion which was commendable, and be answered, "Go". They were not acting lawlessly. There is no thought of getting rid of the prophet, so one says, "Consent, I pray thee, to go with thy servants".
{142}
They would have him with them, and he said, "I will go". This is a happy state of things, so far, there is no thought of self-will. It is a suggestion which arose out of the sense of limitation, and they move in the right direction, they move towards death -- towards Jordan. The prophet agrees to go, it is not on his own initiative, but on theirs. Every spiritual brother, however distinguished he may be, will gladly take on a spiritual suggestion; so Elisha went with them.
When they come to the Jordan they cut down wood. If brethren are dwelling in the vicinity of Jordan and are accepting death in a general way, it is well to let them proceed, on right lines of course. So they cut down wood, but presently the axe-head falls into the water. Now the underlying condition has been exposed. I am now speaking of what interferes with the testimony in a place, although marked generally by exercise, as we say, and energy. In this instance the Spirit of God would bring out the defect that was there, so as a man was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water. The instrument was not properly put together; how could it be? It was borrowed. The suggestion is, that the worker is the handle, and the borrowed thing is the axe-head or "iron". They do not fit, evidently the handle was too small. You are dealing with something that is greater than you are, as was said, "Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?" @Job 38: 2.
The axe-head was iron. It fell into the water and sank. This brought out the fact that it was borrowed; that is, such workers as these sons of the prophets represent are not in the habit of getting things from the Lord directly. The man who used the instrument evidently did not tell the prophet before that it was borrowed. The prophet did not need to borrow, he had plenty. He used the mantle of Elijah to cross
{143}
the river, but he did not use it as Elijah did. It is well enough to use what you get from another, but use it as it should be used by *you*. Are you equal to the thing? Elisha was equal to what he used; in using Elijah's mantle he said, "Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?" and divided the Jordan. Elijah had "wrapped it together" and smitten the waters, *not* calling on Jehovah; Elisha did *not* wrap it together, but smote the waters, saying, "Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?" Ministry is given to be used intelligently, according to our measure, as Elisha did with Elijah's mantle. This man does not say, Where is the God of the man whose axe-head I am using, and hence the great sorrow. He says, "Alas, master, and it was borrowed!" He was using the axe-head as if it were his own, but it was not, and now he owns this. The preventive is that I am amenable to the will of another, to the will of God, that is my lesson in all this.
Elisha cut down a *stick* -- it is a smaller thought: they were felling *beams*. We do not want to be too big in our minds. "Who hath despised the day of small things?" The Lord does not. He is with us as we work in a seemly way, but this brother working with borrowed tools is not to be thrown aside; God is going to make him better. The man acknowledges the fact of the borrowed tool and Elisha says, "Where fell it?" -- and he showed him the place. You have to put your finger on the thing; you have not spoken of this matter, and God is bringing it to light. The iron went to the bottom. Elisha "cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim". How impressive and assuring that was! This brother was felling a *beam*; a brother standing by might rightly say, Perhaps you were going beyond your measure. We are to work according to our measure, "as God has dealt to each a measure of faith". Now as the result of Elisha's service, the iron is swimming;
{144}
it is superior to the current, there is a miracle, it is the power of God. It may be there is a brother in this town needing to be saved from the current of things. Many a man is superior to the religious current who is not free from the business current, and is carried along in this sense with the world. This axe-head was brought up from the depths of Jordan by the power of God; typically it is life from among the dead. We see here that God comes in when everything seems lost. Now we are going to get service on the principle of life, and not on borrowed principles.
In chapter 4 we have the sons of the prophets, but there is a dearth in the land. Elisha goes to Gilgal, which is more than Jordan. Gilgal is where Jordan is understood. It is not simply that we talk of the abolition of death, but it is understood. Elisha had been there before in the company of Elijah. It is in the company of Christ that we truly learn what a thing is. Now there is dearth, and he is concerned about food -- food for the sons of the prophets. Food for the brethren must be provided. The Lord says, "Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?" @Luke 12: 42. How much the Lord thinks of a person who feeds His people! Elisha says, "Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets", @2 Kings 4: 38. He is concerned about that. The sons of the prophets point to a generation that has come down from spiritual men. They may be spiritual or they may not be, they have to be watched. Elisha was concerned that they should be fed, so he directs his servant to "set on the great pot", and one went into the field to gather herbs, we are told, and he gathered wild gourds. If we are to have pure, wholesome food we must not be speculative in our ministry; and, as hearing, we must prove all things
{145}
and hold fast what is good. Here they did not know what the things gathered and put into the pot were; but they were "wild colocynths". Many such things are current, things given out which have not been tested by the Scriptures. You may say, That is nice, I have never heard it before, but it may not be right, it has not been tested out. We are to be marked by love of the truth. This man "found a wild vine, and gathered from it his lap full of wild colocynths, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage". That is not what is marked by intelligence and love of the truth. What was furnished was "wild". It was poisonous and no one knew, so the error was very serious, but fortunately someone cried out that there was "death in the pot".
They cried, "Man of God, there is death in the pot". They had recourse to the right man. Elisha represents the Spirit of Christ in these matters. It was he who suggested that the food should be there, but someone went out into the field and gathered a lapful of something poisonous which he shred into the pot. You can see that it was an error, but he was not under control. However, in the presence of the danger they knew where to turn. This is most important. They address Elisha as "Man of God". How great the advantage in such circumstances if there is one! Nothing is said to the offender, but to Elisha, the right man, as I said, the man who knew what to do. The poison is there, and the poison must be dealt with. It is more difficult to deal with the poison than with the man who introduces it; it is easier to deal with a teacher than with his false teaching -- the teaching soon *spreads*. Elisha met the evil here by *meal*. It was brought. In such cases the brethren are brought into the thing. In chapter 2, as we have seen, the people supplied the salt. Those responsible are to have something in such difficulties. Here Elisha says "Bring meal" -- setting forth the
{146}
Lord Jesus in His perfect humanity. How subject He was! Indeed we may see that the Lord had recourse to the Scriptures, and in infinite accuracy, bases what He was saying at times on the Scriptures, although He was the Author of them. He wrote them by the Spirit, He would lead the way for us, and show how the Scriptures are to govern all that is presented as food or instruction. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them", @Isaiah 8: 20. So that the meal would be the Lord Himself, what He is in character as Man. Christ must be introduced according to what He is personally and characteristically -- so that the saints should have wholesome food. The meal cast into the pot brings in the thought of being amenable to the will of another; it is a type of Christ. When the meal was introduced, they poured out and "there was no harm in the pot".
I have ventured to bring these three points before you, as applying to local positions, and there is hardly a locality that they do not refer to. Generally speaking, the soil is extremely hard everywhere and becoming harder. The way consequent difficulties are to be met is by *submission*, the principle of yielding to the will of another -- and we shall see results. The hardness of the soil will give way; the ministers and the ministry will grow better, and the food will be produced which will build up our constitutions for those exigencies with which we have to contend.
{147}
ENERGY AND INTELLIGENCE ATTENDING THE INCARNATION
@Luke 2: 8 - 38
J.T. I have in mind that we might dwell a little together on the energy and intelligence that attended the incoming of Christ into this scene, and His introduction in the temple. Luke makes much of order, but he associates energy with order in the things of God, and particularly in this chapter. It is a question of the testimony of God. The first chapter links on with 1 Chronicles, this book itself beginning with Adam, and Luke carries the thread of the testimony forward to Paul imprisoned in Rome. The testimony is thus seen among the gentiles in Rome, where great energy marked it; Paul, though a prisoner, was marked by peculiar energy in his writings and speakings.
We have here first of all, the shepherds abiding without, keeping watch by night over their flock; they are exposed to the elements as in their service. Then we have, in verse 9, "lo, an angel of the Lord was there by them", and we get his announcement; then, in verse 13, "suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host ..." and in result, the shepherds go to Bethlehem in haste. Then we find great spiritual activity in Simeon and Anna, particularly the latter. It is as if the Spirit of God put this down in the beginning of the history of Christ here in testimony, to indicate what was to go through, namely, energy allied with spiritual intelligence.
The shepherdly spirit and principle seen here is carried down from the earliest days in testimony. Abel, Jacob, Moses, and David, great leaders in the testimony, were all marked by this spirit; now we have come on to the period of the great Shepherd of the sheep, reminding us of what belongs to the
{148}
shepherd particularly in our dispensation. Peter is charged to shepherd the sheep, there is always something of that to be done, however few the sheep. Eliab made little of such activity in David: "with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness", he inquires of him. He had left them with a *keeper*, and he could tell Saul how he risked his life to save a *lamb*. He was marked by a shepherd spirit, spiritually too, feeding and leading Israel as a flock with integrity and skilfulness. So here the shepherds are abiding without, keeping *their* flock -- they were not hirelings. The lesson for us is to take care of the flock night and day.
W.F. We must be prepared to make sacrifice.
J.T. Shepherds have been persecuted from the outset. Abel was, and shepherds were held in abomination by the Egyptians -- representing the world. People speak well of you if you look after your *own* affairs, but love looks after the affairs of others.
J.G. So, because of this, the shepherds get the communications.
J.T. "An angel of the Lord was there by them", which we can count upon -- a *heavenly* visitant. In caring for the Lord's interests, however small or obscure, we can count on personal touches from heaven. Heaven took notice of the shepherds, and the glory of the Lord shone around them. They were greatly favoured. Take a place like this, marked by darkness, even as we read in Matthew, the people sitting in darkness and there light springs up. The angel comes and indicates that the shepherds are known in heaven, they talk about them up there, and the glory shines around. Heaven's interest is remarkable. It all furnishes a suggestion of what was in the mind of God; unselfishness is needed in watching His interests. The bridegroom in Canticles presented himself as affected by night conditions.
{149}
"My head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night". He was suffering. Jacob said the frost consumed him by night, and if we do the work of a shepherd rightly *we* shall suffer.
Ques. Why is there such a communication to shepherds?
J.T. Attention is called to that service as being honoured in heaven. It is to remind us that however obscure the manner in which we carry it on may be, heaven's eye is upon us. The wording in verse 9 is striking, "an angel of the Lord was there by them", as if they were in mind. Paul could say, "an angel ... stood by me", also, "the Lord stood with me". So, too, when Gideon was threshing wheat, an angel sat over against the place, as if to honour him in what he was doing. Heaven takes account of whatever we are seeking to do to please God. Here, they were doing the thing well. Whatever we do, let us do it heartily. The shepherd thought was very pronounced in the early testimony. Abel was the first shepherd, and the thought is carried right through. The Lord Himself is the great Shepherd, who knows His sheep, and they Him, "as the Father knows me and I know the Father". The thought is carried up to the highest level spiritually, hence its importance.
F.I. "Abiding without" would be outside of all connected with the organisations of men.
J.T. As there outside the shepherds are illuminated. "Fear not, for behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy ..." There is the wonderful announcement of Christ's birth, and then "suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host"; they come in, in relation to the angel. The angel is thus honoured, he is serving. The idea of an angel is usually one who is representative of heaven, of God or Christ -- a messenger. The link is now with him, he is serving. So there is a great increase of heaven's interest, a multitude called *heavenly*, not
{150}
now simply angels, though linked up with an angel. The brother who communicates the truth is enlarged in the truth. The shepherds are honoured and now the angel is honoured; the heavenly influence is increased. "Glory to God in the highest". It is a celebration to God, and then, "on earth peace, good pleasure in men"; there is the ever-widening effect of divine intervention, but all linked on with the lowly obscure circumstances and conditions that pleased heaven. We get enlargement on these lines. In Revelation we cannot number the hosts who celebrate the Lamb. So, however few we are today, we are in touch with heaven, and with all God has on earth, too. Thus isolation becomes abolished in the presence of spiritual power.
W.F. It was very establishing for those shepherds to realise there was such a number to execute the work of heaven.
J.T. What a message they received! "Glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people". It is going to spread, and spread, and spread, but it is announced to them. The heavenly host formed a chorus, linking on with the messenger of the glad tidings, showing how he is honoured, and thus the praise of God began. Luke has that in mind.
J.G. This is the Seed of the woman coming to light.
J.T. God was dishonoured and His glory taken away, but here is One who will glorify Him. He has got man back for His pleasure. The angels are singing about *men* -- God's good pleasure in them.
F.I. The isolation the shepherds were in was broken first by the angel, then by the multitude.
J.T. This is written for us, we need to be brought into it. Heaven is aglow, there is no change or waning there as to Christ. Whether it is the accomplishment of God's purpose, or joy over a sinner that repenteth, we are to be drawn into that. We are
{151}
apt to be lethargic, not seeing much doing, whereas there is a lot doing, and we are to be drawn into heaven's feelings. Heaven in this sense is not a great distance away. The angel "was there by" the shepherds, and "suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host".
Rem. The angels set the shepherds in movement.
J.T. That is another good thought, mutual communications in a locality. "Let us make our way ... as far as Bethlehem", let us share in this energy, they, as it were, say. They are quite intelligent as to what has happened -- "which the Lord has made known to us"; they connect everything with the Lord who is over all. This mutual side is important; we may get together and have a word over the Scriptures, but "let us" is a good resultant word. It is one of the leading phrases of Hebrews. "Let us make our way ... as far as Bethlehem". In the light of what God is doing, let *us* do something. They get light to move and they get it verified. Whatever they did with the sheep, we have to leave; if they were like David, they would leave someone with the sheep. If you go to a *conference*, you do not close down locally! They came with haste, they had to find their way, but they found what the angel had intimated. They knew what David's city meant; they were, we may say, spiritual men.
P.W. They display great diligence. So Mary went into the hill country with haste.
J.T. Yes, you look for intelligent energy. That was a good meeting Mary and Elizabeth had! We have another beautiful touch there which Luke affords. The unborn babe is affected by the voice of the salutation of the mother of the Lord. What delicacy of organism is portrayed! It is linked with chapter 8 where virtue goes out of the Lord and heals the woman. "The body is of Christ". The assembly
{152}
as the body of Christ is an organism. Mary, kept these things and pondered them in her heart, we are told here. "And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen, as it had been said to them". You are struck by the beautiful intelligence which marked them and the accuracy of everything, and how the praises of God proceed, the shepherds glorifying God in verification of the truth.
When you come to Simeon, he is called "a man in Jerusalem", and it says, "the Holy Spirit was upon him". The Spirit is connected with this man three times in the passage. A true *priest* is brought in now and we are told what he is occupied with. There is need of a priest, as the Lord is there Himself: need now not only of a father's and mother's handling, but of priestly handling. Luke stresses that side, and so gives us this beautiful example of priestly intelligence. Hence, as was said, the Spirit is mentioned three times in connection with this man. He "came in the Spirit into the temple", meaning that he came in, in the power of the Spirit, affected by the Spirit. First we have Mary's sobriety and her intelligent rumination over things, which results in building up a constitution in intelligence, and then Simeon actuated by the Spirit. With the Babe in his arms, he can speak of Him in His particular relation with the gentiles: "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel". He sees that the gentiles are to be unveiled, to be brought out of darkness into the view of God. What remarkable intelligence! The gentiles are to be *first* in the mind of God from His point of view.
F.I. So the handling of Christ in this priestly way enables him to take up service in relation to God.
J.T. Yes, in keeping with what preceded. First we have the praise of angels, then the shepherds, and now Simeon, followed by Anna. This incident as to
{153}
Simeon shows how we are to be in the assembly where the Lord is to be handled; that is, how we regard Him in our mind. "This do in remembrance of me" or 'for the calling of me to mind'. It is the place *He* has in our minds. He is also to be regarded in all His offices in the assembly, every office is to have a recognition there. His affection for the saints and His mediatorial services have place. It is how you handle Him, so to speak, in mind and affection. Having Him there, the light shines. It says "as the parents brought in the child Jesus ... *he* received him into his arms". It is in taking the Child up as a priest would and could, that the light comes into his soul about Christ. He *begins* with the revelation of the *gentiles*. It is not his own thought, it is prophetic, it is God's thought. Simeon is divinely illuminated. The presence and position of the Child is the explanation of this; the light of God shines there. The idea is how Christ is held. If you misuse the Lord your mind is not right, it is defiled, warped. There is a condition there the reverse of priestly, and light will not stream in. Simeon in a sense got off Jewish ground, he makes provision for Israel, but puts them second. Luke had in view Paul's doctrine coming in, and the place the gentiles had in the mind of God.
P.W. You are ready to "depart" if you hold Christ in this way.
J.T. Simeon is acting according to the mind of God, he was told by God that he would have to die; "according to thy word", he says. He is beautifully subject, being in the light of the mind of God as to Christ and as to himself. If Christ has come in, you can afford to go. The "Lord's Christ" is the One who does everything for God, and you can depart happily in the light of that.
F.I. Having seen God's salvation brought in, he can go out.
{154}
J.T. It is a thought that should be with us. We would not like to leave unless there was provision to carry on. Not like Hezekiah, who said, "For there shall be peace and truth in my days". So, if young men and women are *coming on*, the old brethren can depart in peace. Paul desired to remain on account of the saints, he saw he was needed.
J.G. Moses wanted to see another leader follow him.
J.T. The man who had the Spirit -- that is the idea; it is a very important matter. The Spirit of God in continuing this narrative begins the book of Acts with an allusion to the "things which Jesus began both to do and to teach".
Then you have Anna in this chapter -- the sisterly side -- a woman spoken of with great distinction, first referred to in her early life, then in her womanhood, and now in advanced years. Like Phoebe, she is mentioned with distinction, so too Lydia. There is no relaxing with Anna, she is carrying on, "she coming up the same hour gave praise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem". She provides the great answer to @Romans 12: 1. Her body is presented a living sacrifice. She is held honourably in the eye of the Spirit from the very outset. She is a great example for sisters, as Simeon is for brothers; both are examples, of course, for all of us. She is called a prophetess. Simeon held Christ in his arms; Anna speaks of Him to individuals, she is evangelical.
{155}
EARLY COLLECTIVE MOVEMENTS
@Acts 1: 14, 2: 1 - 4, 41 - 47
These scriptures are read in order that we might dwell upon the collective movements of the saints seen in the beginning of our dispensation. The result of the Lord's work in the saints is seen in their outlook, attitude, and movements, as left to themselves when the Lord ascended. It is touching to contemplate the Lord as having said certain things to the disciples according to this account and then being taken up. "When he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight". It is not presented as if it were His own action. The Lord must have felt keenly the incident of His being taken away from the disciples.
No one has keener feelings than the Lord, and, we are told here, He was taken up from them and a cloud received Him out of their sight. He would look upon them with the greatest affection, "I will not leave you orphans". He had said to them, and now they were for the moment left, but everyone did not go to his own home as on a certain occasion during His ministry. These disciples loved Jesus, their hearts had become attached to Him; the Lord could *see* they loved Him, just as He could when Peter, in his final appeal in @John 21, said, "Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee". That is, there was something the Lord could take account of with Peter, something objective which witnessed to his love. Let no one speak of loving Christ unless there is some sign of it that the Lord at least can see.
So here they gaze after Him, and two men in white appear and say, "Why do ye stand looking into heaven?" There seemed a good reason for it,
{156}
just as when Mary gazed into the sepulchre, there seemed a good reason, but in each case it was a misguided look. Mary needed adjustment, and the disciples did here. Christ had been removed *out* of their sight, it was a fixed matter, so that it was useless to continue to look, as if He could be seen still with their natural eyes; they have now to learn to look otherwise. The two men adjusted them and we are always being adjusted if amenable; many are not amenable. So the disciples returned to Jerusalem; the two men did not direct them to do that, but they did it, and they did what was right; they were moved by right instincts. They return from the mount of Olives, not now to their own homes, but they go *up* to the upper room where were staying the apostles and others.
These facts, presented in this chapter, are of great moment if understood as bearing on the position today. Mere religious instinct does not lead to the upper room; something more showy and on a human level is demanded. Nor does it lead to such society as we find in the upper room; those who were lovers of Jesus, subject to Him and representative of Him, were there. If you had introduced modernism there, those men would have repelled and repudiated it with indignation, there was no room for it. Today alas! the schools and seminaries are full of it and other such things, but if any, or all of the elements that the people of God are now darkened by had been introduced there, they would have been rejected with authority. These men are brought forward for our example that we, as christians, might move in correspondence with them. Earlier the Lord had presented Himself to them. They had loved Him, but He would cause them to love Him more. He "presented himself living", Scripture says. In Canticles, the bridegroom is introduced as "shewing himself through the lattice", the marginal reading
{157}
is 'flourishing himself', which no doubt gives the idea. If I love the Lord, He would seek that I should love Him more and more. He would present Himself in such a way as to attract me, hence in @Acts 1, He presented Himself living, and "being assembled with them", spoke to them of the Spirit of God. They had the opportunity of hearing the Lord speak of another divine Person; indeed, He spoke of the Father, and of the Spirit as associated with them. They could not possibly be in a position of greater advantage than they were then, the Lord being "assembled with them". What an opportunity they had of hearing one divine Person speak of the other holy Persons of the Trinity! We know but little of what it is to be assembled as having Christ with us.
I mention all this to lead up to the collective thought. He was aiming at that, and so now; He would lead us into the understanding of the assembly and how He is to be known in it, and how we are to serve in it. Current religion gives no instruction in these matters, but rather the opposite. As the Lord assembled with His own, and spoke of the Father, and of the Holy Spirit, what feelings, what an atmosphere would pervade that holy gathering! They would be enriched, they would be filled with the holy atmosphere, occasioned by the presence of the Son of God.
They enquire of Him (verse 6), "Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?" If Simeon (@Luke 2), had overheard this he might have informed them that Israel was not first now! In the mind of God, Jesus was to be a light for the revelation of the gentiles, they being mentioned first. The Lord does not enlighten them as to times and seasons. "It is not for you", He says, "to know the times or the seasons ..." Why did they not speak about the assembly? The Lord could say, 'Do you not recall what Simeon said -- that Israel comes
{158}
second?' We should understand the light that governs the position, and all questions should be in accord with that. The times and seasons "the Father hath put in his own power": that is a very important word. "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things". The Godhead is there, and all reserves are with Him. The Son and the Holy Spirit, to effect the divine purpose, have taken positions involving limitations (but, of course, retaining their part in abstract Deity), the Father, according to the economy into which the three divine Persons have come, being regarded in Scripture as the one God, (@1 Corinthians 8: 6; see also @Mark 13: 32). As to ourselves, there is plenty to know, but let us not attempt to go beyond what is revealed. There are those who intrude into what is not seen, worshipping angels and so on. The Spirit of God sternly condemns that. Let us ever remember that we are creatures, and as such, limited. The Lord tells them what they *needed* to know, saying, "Ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses ... to the end of the earth"; so that their work is laid out, and there was plenty to do, and so it is today. The Lord marked out a large field for them, and, as the Holy Spirit came, they would receive power to enter upon it. There is today scope enough for all, and power too as we are dependent on God in the work. So in @John 4 the Lord says, "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are already white to harvest". Although it is a dark day, the field is wide, and the harvest white and plentiful. As long as the dispensation lasts this is true. Other men laboured, and we enter into their labours; let us then be lowly, but zealous in the work, and God will continue to bless us. Our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.
The Lord was instilling a right outlook into the minds of those whom He was leaving. We cannot but feel He was loth to go, but it was needful; He
{159}
was taken up, and they were left here with these thoughts. "And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding him ..." They were intent, their hearts were with Him. All was intended to affect their feelings and understandings, and who can say what were His as He was carried up? There they were -- orphans -- yet surely with a sense that they would be taken care of, that they would experience fatherly care. Did they remember His promise (@John 14), they would know that they would not remain orphans. As they were gazing upward, two men in white stood by them and instructed them, and now what are they to do? If Christ moves, what are you to do next? If you get additional light, or if something comes home powerfully to you, there must be a change of outlook, a movement governed by it; so we find they did not go to their own home. Jesus had gone up from the mount of Olives, and these men came back with the idea of moral elevation. They go to Jerusalem to the *upper* room -- where all these rich and holy thoughts the Lord had conveyed to them in the power of the Spirit would be cherished. And we are told who were there. There was no society like these men and women; the place was the home provisionally of the lovers of Christ, where His rights were maintained.
So we have the collective idea now, they move together. "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren". There are care meetings held with sisters absent, and yet they are not absent in one sense, for it is their matter, and they should ask their husbands about things if they are to pray intelligently. But here it was "with the women"; and prayer marks the company. Of old, prayer was valued as in our dispensation, so much so, that when Solomon prayed, as he ceased, the glory filled the house (@2 Chronicles 7: 1). God was
{160}
so pleased with it that there was no room even for the priests. It is to remind us of the importance of prayer.
When Daniel prayed, Gabriel said, "At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved ..." What a thing to have the sense as praying for divine interests, that one is greatly beloved! Heaven moves towards him and sends one of its most distinguished messengers to Daniel. And what a message he brought! God has fixed limits to all we may be enduring, and He shows Daniel the end for Israel. "Seventy weeks are determined", Gabriel says: the complete accomplishment of God's thoughts comes in after the prayer (@Daniel 9: 24). So we must value the prayer meeting, and give plenty of scope for it. The women were in the upper room, and the brothers not silent. It is a very pitiable thing if brethren come together for prayer and do not pray. Here heaven's notables were present. There is so much to be prayed for, and one is always concerned in a prayer meeting that nothing should be omitted. All the interests of Christ should be covered, and God would fill the place with glory. He will make us joyful in His house of prayer. There is great restfulness and assurance where, in faith, brethren lay their burdens before the Lord. He gives a sense of having taken them all on, and that He will do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us. We often speak of the Spirit in a theoretical way, but it is the Spirit that we have experienced as having been with us constantly -- the power that *works* in us. There is the same power as at Pentecost, only the vessels are so weak and dislocated that the Spirit is hampered, conditions for such a display as at Pentecost are not available.
Then we have the appointment of one to take the
{161}
place of Judas. In this connection Peter quotes Scripture. It is important that our procedure should at all times be based on Scripture. It was the mind of heaven that twelve apostles should be secured, that there should be no discrepancy, but that *all* should be together as the day of Pentecost was fully come, or "now accomplishing". We may read Acts and overlook that what took place is connected with the day of Pentecost; it was no accident, it was a spiritual matter. "When the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing". "When" indicates time, and directs the spiritual mind to earlier teaching. What I am stressing is that this company are moving together intelligently. They repair the breach by the appointment of an apostle in lieu of the missing one, and heaven ratified their provision. Thus they are together at the suitable time -- it is a selected time. Scripture had spoken of that day, and they would understand what was written, as the psalm referring to Judas was understood. Pentecost was one of the most important of the feasts. It is called the feast of weeks, when the days were counted after the sheaf of the wave-offering was presented, and it is important to count those days. The disciples may not have had much teaching on the Pentateuch, but they had spiritual understanding. The Lord had instructed two of them on their way to Emmaus, "beginning at Moses", and He had opened the understanding of those gathered together (@Luke 24). We must not assume that they did not hear about Pentecost, they did, and the Lord would open their understanding as to it. Peter would no doubt say to John, What do you think about the feast of weeks? Such questions are asked in our *readings*. The most precious things are revealed to brethren coming together with their Bibles open.
We read of the feast of weeks in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. It is mentioned in
{162}
Deuteronomy in connection with two other feasts, three being selected out of seven. God wishes us to understand these three by themselves. In Leviticus you get seven, you have the whole range there. In Deuteronomy God says, "Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before Jehovah thy God", as if these were the feasts to be specially understood; and He says further, "They shall not appear before Jehovah empty". We are to appear before God with spiritual substance. How great to be brought into the divine system and made to enrich it! The male represents that side of the truth. You will notice in the chapter referred to, @Deuteronomy 16, that there is no limit to the *time* of observance of the feast of weeks. The other two feasts are limited as to time. This, no doubt, alludes to the antitype, for the Spirit leads us outside of time.
The feast of weeks has particular reference to our dispensation, the disciples were all together on that day; as already said, it was no accident. It is the great type that speaks of the coming down of the Spirit according to the Lord's promise. So now they move together, there is not one absent. Is there anything for us in that? Many of us are away when the best things come in; we are absent and miss them. Anna was not absent as Christ was brought into the temple. Sisters sometimes have a heavy day on Monday and say, I shall not go to the prayer meeting, I shall go to the reading. And thus they may miss an advantage never again offered. The Lord had prayed the Father to send the Comforter, so suddenly there was "a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing". The disciples came together in the light of Scripture, and heaven accredited their action, and so today what we expect in intelligent faith will come. Let us be more expectant, coming together in the light of the principles that govern the moment. We may come together in our own way, but heaven
{163}
does not regard that, It says, "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit". Notice that word "all". Why should one be absent? Thomas would not miss it *this* time! I would again remind the brethren that absentees from meetings do not know what they may lose.
Finally, I wished to show how, as the result of the first great evangelical effort, converts were brought into what was there, but not with their own thoughts. A truly converted person does not wish to retain his own thoughts, they are extraneous now, they will hamper him and others. These three thousand mentioned in chapter 2: 41 imbibed the light and principles and feelings that were already there, they would not bring in anything to vitiate what was among the saints, it all comes from heaven. You will notice that when they were convicted, they said to Peter and to the other apostles, "What shall we do, brethren?" Why are "the other apostles" mentioned? Why not Peter alone? It is to show that the principles governing the apostles, who had all been affected by the Holy Spirit, were injected by the gospel into the converts. They saw eleven of the apostles standing there, and Peter with them. Who are these men? they would inquire; they are like Peter. They would recognise that the apostles represented the Lord, and they addressed their questions to them, as well as to Peter, showing they were drinking in the spirit that was there. A truly converted man has instincts, and would regard any one of the apostles as one who could answer questions. The apostles excelled any that had existed before, they were the workmanship of Christ; manifestly of Christ. The apostle exhorts the Thessalonians to "know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake"; that is the principle here.
{164}
So these three thousand were baptised, and "added", and we read, "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". These converted ones had drunk into what was there, and they are not to go off to their own sects, to the Pharisees, Sadducees and so on. A converted man will not go back; he will follow the line of the truth and what is said of these enters into our present position, as to whether the truth is affecting us, whether we are persevering in it, and it is giving character to us, whether we are continuing in the apostles teaching and fellowship, that fellowship where the Lord's rights are observed; and in the breaking of bread, which is the expression of that, and then in prayers.
In what I have said, I have sought to give some little idea of the early christians, and how they moved together. The Lord would say to such, I can add to you. Why are we not added to? Suitable conditions may be wanting. Other things are stated here. "Fear was upon every soul ... and every day, being constantly in the temple ... they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart ... and the Lord added ... daily those that were to be saved". It is as if the Lord said, If conditions are there, additions will be there; and these are the conditions -- saints moving together in the light governing the position. Under these circumstances He would say, I can trust some of My own to you, such as are in the counsels of God. Would that one might grasp it oneself! The apostle could say, "For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that *they* also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory". There are precious souls all round us who are included in the counsels of God, and the Lord would have us to seek them, that they might obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
{165}
JOHN THE BAPTIST AS SEEN IN JOHN'S GOSPEL
@John 1: 6 - 8, 15, 19 - 37; @John 3: 26 - 34
J.T. Spirituality, as attaching to John's gospel, is seen illustratively in the way in which John the baptist is introduced. As compared with the synoptical allusions to him, he is seen mainly as calling attention to Christ, as to His Person, and in this gospel no failure is attributed to him. He is introduced as "sent from God", and that he might witness concerning the light; as if the standpoint of this gospel requires such an one to bear witness to Christ -- one sent from God. And then we have his readiness to do so even at his own expense; as the incarnation is stated in verse 14 we have John's witness, and that he cried saying, "This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me".
In all the passages read we have the same character of testimony, all bringing out that there was at least one man here who, at the outset, appreciated Christ, unselfishly witnessing to His personal greatness. So that we have him saying in verse 34, "I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God"; and in the end of chapter 3 he is referred to as "the friend of the bridegroom", one who rejoices because of the Bridegroom's voice. So that he effaces himself and makes much of Christ -- he disappears out of view saying that his joy is fulfilled, standing and hearing the Bridegroom. Although having a great personal mission from heaven, the time came when he stood and listened to Christ. He spoke of His heavenly glory; He had come from heaven as above all -- "He who comes out of heaven is above all" (chapter 3: 31). I think that John fits in with the present time in that sense as an example for us to speak well of
{166}
Christ, as apprehending His Person. The Lord says of him later that he was a burning and a shining light. When opposition thickens, as it is thickening according to chapter 10, He went to where John baptised at first, showing that He had kept John in mind. *We* might also keep him in mind as the one who spoke so well of Christ.
W.W. Is it in order that we should speak well of Christ, that you draw attention to John?
J.T. Yes. The Lord challenges the disciples elsewhere, "Whom say ye that I am?" @Matthew 16: 15. We ought to be able to *say* who He is.
Rem. I was thinking about verse 6, how God in the different ages had His men. He had the prophets to speak, but John seems to have a peculiar place. In @Luke 24: 44 the Lord speaks of Moses and the prophets, they spoke of Him, but John has a special place.
J.T. He was one sent from God; the word "from" suggesting also that he was *with* God. The first credential of such an one ought to be that he speaks well of Christ, and this marks John strikingly. He was "a man sent from God", not sent *by* God merely, but "from God". He *was* sent by God, but he was sent *from* God, that is, he has been with God, as already said; and the more we are with God the more we will think rightly of Christ. So of the Word it is said, "*He* was in the beginning with God"; and the Spirit comes out "from with the Father", as chapter 15: 26 (New Trans.) reads. He testifies of Christ -- there is first-hand knowledge, the Spirit knowing the feelings of the Father, and of the love wherewith the Father loves the Son.
W.H.R. In what sense was "the life ... the light of men"? Was it the Lord down here?
J.T. Quite so. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light appears in darkness,
{167}
and the darkness apprehended it not". It is Christ as Man.
H.S. Are we to be with God in order to get this appreciation of Christ, to speak well of Him?
J.T. Well, that is the lesson in verse 6: a man sent not simply *by* God, but "sent from God". You get a man earlier -- Jehu -- anointed and sent by God, but you could not speak of him being with God first; he was a fast driver and did things ruthlessly. John was sent from God; so that he is qualified to speak well of Christ. There is no voice from heaven in John, as in the synoptic gospels, speaking well of Christ; John in a sense takes that place in this gospel. The voice from heaven announced, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". John was with God in the wilderness; he was in the deserts till the time of his showing to Israel. He was where there was no fleshly gratification: God would be before him, and he came out according to this gospel as "sent from God". Those who are really sent from God will have right thoughts of Christ, and will convey them in words, too.
A.E.L. Would you say it was a revelation from God to John?
J.T. Yes, he says, "He who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit" (verse 33). The idea of being sent was carried through. The great contrast between John and Christ is seen in what John says, that Christ is He who "baptises with the Holy Spirit". He said previously, "I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him" (verse 32). He does not say anything about the voice, although it happened at the same time. *He* is the voice! *He* is the one who speaks well of Christ here.
{168}
F.I. Have you in mind that, as being with God, we should have a sense of the greatness of Christ, so that we see that all that has come in will be carried through?
J.T. At the end of the account he gives of the baptist, John the evangelist says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand". And then there is a terrible penalty attached to not being subject to Him: "he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him". The One whom the Father loves carries things through, showing that the administration of the economy is in the hands of the One who is loved. It is in the hands of the Son, that is, a divine Person in manhood.
F.I. In contrast to the Son, one of the greatest men in the Old Testament, Solomon, when he is finishing his course, turned aside from God, but here John the baptist is able to hand over all into the hands of this Person knowing that it is going to be carried through.
J.T. He *stands* and hears, meaning that his mission is finished. In verse 35 it says that John stood: "on the morrow, there stood John ..." He can stand as seeing the Spirit coming and abiding upon Christ; that is, God has committed Himself to Christ restfully -- not taking Him on as He took David on and others. David had to say, "Take not thy holy spirit from me" (@Psalm 51), but here there is an additional thought -- "abiding" -- One great enough for the Spirit to abide upon Him! John stood after that. He was baptising, and Jesus came to him to be baptised, but John says, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world". He introduces Christ. He says later, "I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God". He not only saw the truth of Christ's Person, but bore witness to it, and that is the point; you say what you
{169}
believe, you testify to what you see. The Lord would help us to speak of Himself according to His full dignity, that is, according to what He is in the economy into which divine Persons have come; and what He is in His abstract personality. Although in the place of subjection, and receiving all from the Father as this gospel teaches us. He is yet equal with the Father, and that as Man.
A.E.L. John's record is that "This is the Son of God".
J.T. Yes, that is the point, "This is the Son of God". Then the following verses show that he fully understood what it meant; he is admiring the Lord; and in chapter 3 he is decreasing, "I must decrease", he says -- he is joyfully going out of sight; he is no rival to Christ. He has fulfilled his mission.
A.E.L. From this record you would hardly know that John baptised Him. It is because of the greatness of the Person.
J.T. His actual baptism is left out purposely.
J.M. What is involved in the term "Son of God"?
J.T. In this gospel it is His divine personality that is stressed. There is nothing said about *our* being sons of God in this gospel, therefore it is more His own distinction. Matthew brings out the fact that we also are sons, and of course Paul develops it doctrinally; but John leaves that. It is implied, of course, we being brethren of Christ, but He is stressing the greatness of Christ, *His* sonship, which implies Deity.
W.H.R. So the Lord in chapter 9 says, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?"
J.T. That is a striking passage. In @Romans 8, you have the thought, "if Christ be in you ..." (verse 10). This gospel opens that up. Certain persons mentioned are those in whom Christ is characteristically. He is in John the baptist sacrificially, because he calls
{170}
Him the "Lamb of God". In chapter 9 Christ is seen as Son of God by the man who had been cast out. The Lord had in mind that that man should understand sonship; it was one of the features of the truth to be set out in that man. He has neither "sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him" (chapter 9: 3). That is the thought, the effect was to be seen; it is a great point, not simply what we think, but what can be seen in us. So the Lord heard that he was cast out; He waits for *that*. There is a very striking link there with the present time, because it is the outside place that is needed for all these great things. The Lord waited till he was cast out, and then He finds him and says to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" He answers, "Who is he, Lord?" The Lord says, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he". And he says, "I believe, Lord: and he did him homage". I believe that that is the point today, to be in the outside place, whether we leave the evil or it casts us out, it is the same thing. When the Lord hears that we are outside, He finds us. That is the point to be noted, because I do not believe that those who remain in a position where Christ's rights are not owned, get light. They do not get the light that belongs to the full position. The Son of God has inaugurated, and is carrying on, another order of things, and that involves separation.
The first thing that is said of John as to his own action, I mean as to his personal testimony, is that he "bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me". He *cried*. It is not simply *saying* here, but *crying* so that everybody is to hear. It is not what we think of Him, it is not simply that we should know who He is, but what do we *say* of Him? Here John's testimony is stressed, "he has cried, saying ..."
{171}
A.E.L. "He was before me", what is meant by that?
J.T. It is a question of Christ's Person. John was born *before* Christ. He alludes to the Lord's deity, not His history on earth. John's remark refers to what was before time. We have, "In [the] beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". There is no article before the word 'beginning' here; it would mean that the Lord *was* in the beginning, when or whatever it was. In Genesis we read, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", @Genesis 1: 1. The angels were evidently there at that time because they were there when the foundations of the earth were laid (@Job 38). So that, whenever there was in any sense a beginning, this Person was there already. *He* did not begin then; God forbid such a thought in anyone! He *was* there, He *was* at that time, He *was* with God, and *was* God. He was there, as this narrative gives it, "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being". He was the Person who did everything, who made everything. All came into being by His instrumentality. There was not one thing, John says, that received being without Him. That is a striking statement as to created things.
G.E. He Himself had no beginning.
J.T. The marvellous way things are put here fits into our minds so that they should be fixed as to that. This is an outstanding passage as to the deity of Christ. In seeking to help christians it is wise to start with this verse; all christians in the world should agree on this verse. Some may shrink from the truth of separation, but if God has wrought in a man's heart he would freely accept these early verses of John.
H.S. Christ has, at least, this place in the heart of every christian.
{172}
J.T. I think so. The peculiar wording of this passage is intended to fit into our minds so that it we can all be on common ground on this point, and we cannot go any further if we are not. I think John the baptist is the characteristic man as to this. He is ready for this! A man who had the greatest place in the testimony, and had the opportunity of assuming to be the Messiah, or one of the great prophets; but he effaces himself, preferring One greater than he. Then when the incarnation is first given by John the evangelist (verse 14), in saying "we have contemplated his glory ..." John the baptist cries and says, "he was before me". It is John's witness of Christ -- "he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me". He had already said it, and now he is crying as to it!
W.H.R. John saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove. What do you understand by that?
J.T. Verse 32 reads, "And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him". I have no doubt the allusion would be to @Genesis 8. There are peculiar touches in that chapter about the dove. She was sent out by Noah and received back to him; she came back, she found no rest for the sole of her foot. Finally, she came back with an olive leaf in her mouth, not a floating dead one, but "plucked off", showing that the link now is established with life, vegetable life. She is spoken of as over against the raven, a different bird. It is the distinctiveness of the dove. And we know how it is spoken of in the Canticles, the love-book. It would allude to the Spirit, in that sense, coming in on the Person of Christ -- nothing to disturb, because evidently the dove is very sensitive. So that we are enjoined not to grieve the Spirit, nor to quench Him. The dove represents the Spirit in its entirety, it is a whole
{173}
idea. It is not given by measure, it comes unconditionally, unreservedly, on Christ, as if to honour Him as great enough for it. It was in entire keeping with the voice from heaven, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", not given in this gospel, as we have said. Then the Spirit, showing that there is nothing at all to disturb, is there.
A.E.L. Would sealing be a similar thought? Sealing and anointing are both applied to the Lord.
J.T. Yes, I think sealing is that He is marked off as peculiarly the Father's.
J.M. There is a good deal in this gospel about seeing -- "I have seen and borne witness ..."
J.T. Yes; thus we are challenged as to whether we have eyes to see. What John saw was remarkable. The word to him was, "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending ..." Of course, there were many others there at the time from Judaea and Jerusalem; people came from all directions to John to be baptised, and this must have been a day of great note. Did all see what happened? The word to him was not simply, Upon whom the Spirit comes, but "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending". That is, You are to see it. Your testimony is not to be second-hand, it is to be first-hand. What testimony we have is through others, but John the baptist is honoured in seeing this, being a witness of the Spirit in the form of a dove coming on another divine Person. Think of the magnitude of that; of one being told that he is to see that. So that he is a competent witness. And then he adds, "And I have seen ..." He is a first-hand witness, as already said.
J.M. Is that not a principle -- we have to see things for ourselves before we give witness?
J.T. Yes. The thought runs through this gospel, "Come and see". In these last days doctrine is not enough, it is what is *seen*.
{174}
Ques. Why does John say, "And I knew him not"?
J.T. I think that it is to show that his knowledge of Christ is not a mere knowledge derived from personal physical contact. He was His relative after the flesh -- John's mother is called Mary's cousin. Before John was born and before Christ was born, John was affected by Him through the hearing of his mother. His contact with Christ for testimony was spiritual. Relationships in the flesh do not help in the testimony. All must be on a spiritual basis.
A.E.L. How do you account for the expression, "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world", in this gospel, and then, later, "Behold the Lamb of God"?
J.T. Well, it points to the place that Christ had with John. Both statements are connected with the movements of Christ. What John saw, what he bore record of (verse 32), was not a movement of Christ, but a movement of the Spirit on Him. But the expression, "Behold the Lamb of God", is the outcome of a movement of Christ. First, He came to John -- "he sees Jesus coming to him" (verse 29); then secondly, (verse 36), he saw Jesus "as he walked". It alludes to the manner of Christ's walk, I believe. @Genesis 2 is in mind, Adam naming the creatures. He would observe the peculiar features of the sheep, or of the lamb; and I think, therefore, what is meant is that Christ is in John sacrificially. He is not only apprehended as a Person who was before him, but He is a sacrificial Person, as seen in @Isaiah 53 -- over against other lambs that are mentioned. The word "lamb" as in Scripture is generally connected with sacrifice, as in @Genesis 22.
W.H.R. His taking away of the sin of the world -- would that be as before God?
J.T. It is the sacrificial side; it is not the military side. It involves the judgment of God, but He will deal with sin in a military way too.
{175}
W.H.R. I suppose that has been done in the death of Christ?
J.T. Well, it has; but "takes away" is a characteristic word. It is better to keep it so than make it merely historical.
J.M. What do you mean by military action in this connection?
J.T. Well. @Revelation 19 shows that He will come down militarily to deal with lawlessness, actual removal requires military action; but this is the sacrificial side, sin could never be dealt with according to God otherwise. It might be dealt with punitively, all sinners might be sent to the lake of fire, but we need the sacrificial side to bring out what God is in regard of the world. The sacrificial side meets that; it brings out what God is. The military side is detail really. Taking away sin in a sacrificial sense reveals God. This is the greater thought. The taking away is a great moral thought. God stands out in it.
Ques. Was that a necessity before God could move?
J.T. Well, a sacrifice had to take place. I think it is well to keep the thing in its present tense. He is the Taker-away of the sin of the world, as the Lamb of God: not the Son here -- He is the Lamb.
Ques. Is that why there was no following to the first "Behold"?
J.T. The time had not come morally. The next day is the day for *following*. Verse 35 says, "On the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples. And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God". He is not now coming to John, as in verse 29; coming *to John* meant that He was going to die, "he sees Jesus coming to him".
F.I. I do not quite understand what difference you are making between "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" and "Behold the Lamb of God" in verse 36.
{176}
J.T. Well, "as he walked" -- John stood and saw that. But the other is "Jesus coming to him".
F.I. It is a further movement here -- Behold the Person. They saw Him and they said, "Where abidest thou?" and He said, "Come and see".
J.T. The first is the sacrificial work, the taking away of the sin of the world; there is no following yet. But in verse 36 the Lord is *walking*. The order here is, first what is to be understood as a finished matter; not that it is not to be continuous in its effect, because it is, but it is in principle a finished matter; and the next thing is the Lamb walking -- what that Person is now, where is He going? He is not walking aimlessly. In @Genesis 18 three persons came to Abraham. They were detained and entertained by him, and they accepted the entertainment. But they were on the way. Abraham was not the final objective in their minds, it was Sodom; they were going to Sodom. Abraham interceded for Sodom, but the judgment was not stayed. Abraham went to his place, and Jehovah went on, and the judgment is executed. But now the Lamb is walking; not now to die, but to reach some result. It is the time to gather results now. I think that verse 36 is the Lamb's movements as gathering results, and we all want to be in that. We are all results of the taking away of the sin of the world. The world is not left as it was, there are people coming out of it.
A.E.L. The Person who accomplished the work is becoming the Object of attraction.
J.T. Yes. "I, if I be lifted up ... will draw all to me". @John 12: 32.
J.F.C. Is this gospel, coming in last, intended to be peculiarly steadying to faith when general departure has begun?
J.T. Quite so. It is full of that.
J.F.C. Which is important -- what *has been* seen, or what *is to be* seen?
{177}
J.T. Both are important: the latter implies continued freshness. This comes out in what the Lord says to those following: "But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye? And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou? He says to them, Come and see". That is the principle -- "Come and see". It is not now to see Him, but to see where He abides. If we see Him walking, and follow Him, then the next thing is, where He abides. He says, "Come and see". So that we are set in movement; it is really an astronomical idea, there is now a moving system with a centre. And hence as you run down the chapter you have "Come and see". There is constant movement now, in relation to a centre -- not aimless movement. So that as we come to chapter 4, to the poor soul that meets the Lord at the well. He says to her, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him ..." The Person would be before her. And presently she moves, and others move; so that it is not a stationary thing. In the cathedrals, and the parishes, and the dioceses, the see of Rome included, things are all fixed, as if people were going to stay here. Even if we get a nice meeting-room, there is a tendency to settle in. But John has in mind that we are to be in movement.
J.F.C. It is the Person that is putting us together in the present time.
J.T. Well, that is why I suggested looking at this scripture. We need to understand movement in relation to Christ.
F.I. This would affect us on the first day of the week -- "Come and see".
J.T. In seeking to help the Lord's people who have not found Christ as a centre, it is a great advantage to
{178}
get them to come into the circle of life, and see what there is -- however little.
P.T.W. These things are written to get believers to "believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name", @John 20: 31.
J.T. Yes. "That ... ye might have life", and it is "in his name". If there is a living state of things at all, however feeble, then it is worth seeing, and we should not be afraid of asking people to "come and see". Get them in touch with what is living.
G.E. In chapter 17 the Lord prays "that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory". Seeing is the great thing all through.
J.T. I think chapter 12 is the kind of thing that we should keep in our minds. The Lord comes to Mary of Bethany the third time. His first coming is seen in @Luke 10, and He comes a second time, according to John in chapter 11, then a third time in chapter 12. In the first, Mary is mentioned as at the feet of Jesus. Now He comes "six days before the passover", and Lazarus is in mind, whom He raised from the dead. He is alluded to as "the dead man Lazarus", and yet he is raised from the dead; meaning that he is dead as regards this world -- a Colossian thought. Jesus came there, and Lazarus sat at the table and Martha served. Then (verse 9), the Jews began to come to see Lazarus also, not only to see Jesus. There was something there to see as a testimony to Christ's power in Lazarus.
G.E. Should that be seen amongst christians?
J.T. Yes, a living state of things. I believe that is the great thing that John has in mind -- eternal life. It was brought before us by the Lord half a century ago. The point was to get brethren to live, instead of going on with a mere form of meetings, and the order of the assembly not followed much. Then, if you have that, the order proper to the assembly
{179}
will be developed. God planted a garden in Eden, and He set Adam to dress it and keep it. The dressing and keeping refers to an order of things, and it is what the Lord has been engaging us with for many years; how in a living way we come back to divine order -- and what God delights in, growth in life, regulated by divine order.
R.W. Would you speak of John's gospel as being new creation?
J.T. Well, it is more the family side. It is birth: birth is a greater thought, really, than creation -- to be born of God. "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". It is children; also brethren, as in chapter 20 -- the family of God.
W.H.R. When Peter raised up Dorcas he presented her living.
J.T. So the Lord in the Acts presented Himself *living*; that is, that we might see life as *in Him* -- the true thought of it.
{180}
GUIDANCE FROM HEAVEN
@Matthew 2: 1, 2, 9 - 12; @Acts 9: 3 - 6; @Acts 10: 9 - 21
I wish to speak about guidance from heaven; it is a feature of our dispensation that light and guidance come from heaven; not from man-made dignitaries, religious dignitaries, ecclesiastical dignitaries, nor man-made councils -- guidance is from heaven. Many other things might be said about heaven and its prerogatives in this dispensation, but I confine myself to this one thought, that from the earliest times the heavens were indicated as the source of light and guidance. The sun and the moon as made were set in the heavens "for signs, and for seasons", and "to give light upon the earth" (@Genesis 1: 14, 17); the stars also, that is, all were made by God for the purpose stated, and He has never lost sight of this fact, but Christ having entered into heaven accentuates the thought. He has "gone into heaven, ... angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him", @1 Peter 3: 22. "Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things" (@Acts 3: 21); that is, it is a fixed state of things until a certain time. "Whom the heaven must receive ..." That is, Christ according to divine appointment is there, and hence there is light and guidance from that point, from heaven, beyond any possibility of human interference; so that we can be quite confident as to what comes, knowing whence it comes -- that Christ is there, "received up in glory", and installed there in the place of power. "From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool", @Hebrews 10: 13. He is not quiescent, He is not inactive; He *is* active, indeed, much more so than we are apt to think. Infinite vigilance is there, the Keeper of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps!
{181}
So Matthew, who particularly stresses this point of the heavens, begins early to show that they were active as Jesus was born. What is recorded by Luke is that, "unto you is born this day ... a Saviour"; it was immediate, according to Luke, the announcement by the angel was "this day". But Matthew gives us a later incident, for the word should read, "Jesus having been born ..." However long before is not stated, but what is stated is that the wise men found "the little child" -- not "the babe"; the sign to the shepherds was, "Ye shall find the babe", but here it is "the little child". That is, He has advanced in age, so that it is now a matter of history that the King has been born -- the "king of the Jews". It is a matter of history, but history of the greatest possible moment; nothing would be greater as an event, a birth, than the birth of the King of the Jews. Although gentiles, the wise men do not hesitate to refer to Him in this way; not simply as the King of mankind, but the King of the Jews -- humbly, although gentiles, respecting the divine choice. It is not a matter of curiosity with them, they are not sightseers, nor are they tourists fulfilling a double purpose -- seeing Jerusalem and its environments at the same time, but they come to see the King! Where is He? they say. They do not seek a guide to show them the sights of Jerusalem -- it is the King of the Jews they want. And that is all there is today, dear brethren; sights -- localities in themselves -- lose their value in the presence of the King. It is now a question of the King, what He will do and where He will be. He is not viewed as a Man -- He is "the little child". From the human side there is development. He became a Babe, and grew into manhood, which truth Luke gives in more detail. The sign given of old was that "a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his
{182}
name Emmanuel ... God with us". This is God's way.
Matthew makes a great point of things being according to prophecy, and prophecy required that Jesus should come in as He did, and He came in *exactly* as prophesied of Him. So that when I use the word 'development', I mean that He was real in every state He took up; it could not be otherwise; a Babe, a young Child, a Boy, a Man. "Jesus himself", we are told, "began to be about thirty years of age", @Luke 3: 23. He "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man", @Luke 2: 52.
But then in His abstract personality, there is no change. In a word, the truth is the *incarnation*; that is, a divine Person taking another condition -- that is the thought. The mode of taking that condition is described in prophecy, and fulfilled, according to the gospels, with infinite accuracy. We have to understand both sides of the truth. One side is, He is God; "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". He was God! Never personally less than God; but in time, in testimony, as I said, we have the Babe, the little Child, the Boy, and the Man -- I am using the exact words of Scripture.
So these wise men from the east arrive at Jerusalem, in their quest of the King -- not "the little child", but "the King"; for that is who He was. As the angels said to the shepherds, "Unto you is born this day ... a Saviour": not One who was to be that, but it is the *Person*, the Saviour Himself! And it is not, who will be, but "who is Christ the Lord". @Luke 2: 11. These wise men had that in mind; whatever His age was, He was the King of the Jews. They were looking for the King. There were not before, perhaps, such men in the east as these -- what men they were! "We have seen his star in
{183}
the east", they say. Who told them it was His star? They had light in their souls from heaven, and they move in that light, they move towards the Jewish position. Jewry was a small affair then, compared to what it was under David and Solomon; but these wise men did not despise it at that time, they came to Jerusalem. There is nothing said about the star until they *leave Herod*; and they are later divinely directed not to return to him; but still they came to Jerusalem, they came in the direction of the King of the Jews, where He *should* be born. They would say in their hearts, Where shall we find Him save in the capital of Judaea? They did not know the scripture that He should be born in Bethlehem. There is nothing said about their knowledge of the Scriptures. I speak of this now to show how the work of God manifests itself in those who are the subjects of it. If we get light from heaven about Jesus, the next thing is, Where is He? Where is He to be found? There are many companies who claim to have the Lord with them -- independent companies -- but no independent company can have the Lord Jesus with them. He was never independent. One great feature of Christ was submission to the will of God. Where is He to be found? Well, if He is the King of the Jews, the men from the east would conclude, He will be found among the Jews -- He would not be born among the gentiles.
These wise men thus make their way; they move in the light that had come to them. It was heavenly light -- it was a star, one known as the star of Jesus. These men must have been astronomers. They, no doubt, could tell you the names of the planets, but I know of no others who have discovered the star of Jesus! These were the ones. They say, "we have seen his star ..." From another point of view, all the stars are His -- He made them all. "All things were made by him; and without him was not any
{184}
thing made that was made". @John 1: 3. There was not one thing made that He did not make! But this star was a peculiar star; evidently not a fixed one; it was a movable one. Being the star of Jesus it moved in relation to Him -- necessarily so. It moved in the orbit of that Centre -- and that is really the point to be made here, that if we get light about Jesus all our movements must be in relation to Him.
Now Jesus was not at Jerusalem. However accurate their calculations as to where He should be, He was not at Jerusalem. The Scripture did not say that He should be born there; they went to the wrong place. Not that I would discredit these men, far otherwise; but there is nothing indicated about the star at Jerusalem. What one would remark here is, that if one is seeking light -- if any light, any little inkling of Christ, comes to one, and one moves in it -- it involves *another way*, not the way that we have been on, or that the natural mind would take. Most of our brethren are in the wrong way. "There is a way that seemeth right ..." you know, to many, but there is "another way". Of Rahab it is said that she was justified by works "when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way", @James 2: 25. She is a heavenly personage, in principle. She belonged to Canaan. She was a Canaanite, but she ceases to be that; she began really to be, in type at least, a heavenly personage, when she received the spies. She was justified by works; and anyone who is to be justified by works proceeds on "another way". He is not a *missionary* -- I mean to say, he is not a man who proceeds on the ordinary religious lines, but on a different way, a way that would be unaccredited by the world, by the religious leaders of this world; if he gets light from heaven he proceeds on "another way". Let us see to it that, if on wrong lines, the old will not do, old methods will not do. Nor will it do to say to a
{185}
person, You are on the wrong way; you want to point out the other way if you are to be justified by works. Point them to "another way". Rahab was justified by works in this sense. As to the magi, we are told "they departed into their own country another way" (verse 12). Heaven had intervened. Do not go to Herod if you want the right way; do not go that way! If you do, you may be incited to murder the brethren! That is what he did; he murdered the little children -- terrible wickedness.
Some of us were saying this morning that men may read the Bible, even look into it for guidance, and yet be murderous in their thoughts. That is what Herod did. He gathered all the chief priests and scribes together and demanded of them where Christ should be born. He had recourse to the Scriptures in order to murder! You say of some who oppose the truth and turn away from their brethren. They have the Bible -- they read the Bible there and claim to act according to it. Yes, but I may do that, and yet have murder in my heart. Of course, I do not say that it could be literal murder, but we might be hating the brethren and looking for a scripture to justify our hatred of and separation from them, and scripture says, "Every one that hates his brother as a murderer", @1 John 3: 15.
What these men show is right instinct. When they heard the king, they departed, "and lo, the star which they saw in the east, went before them". They are on the right line now. "I being in the way", says one, "the Lord led me", @Genesis 24: 27. True enough, they got light in a way at Jerusalem in spite of the conditions there, but there is no star -- no star mentioned there -- and the star is the great means of guidance in all this. It is a question of Christ. We must never get out of the light of Christ -- it *makes all things bright*. If the way is there, *go in it*; that is, "I being in the way, the Lord led me"; and
{186}
that is what happened; they saw the star and it was joy to their hearts -- "they rejoiced with exceeding great joy".
We should be *feeling* christians. Many of us are stoical; we receive light in the mind, in a sort of mental way, but there is no joy in the countenance, "I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance", says the psalmist; a healthy countenance is a joyful countenance. "They rejoiced with exceeding great joy", and presently they found the little Child. The star had directed them to the little Child, not Herod; if Herod only knew, he would slay Him, but the star directed them. Dear brethren, if we want to know where Christ is, heavenly light directs us to where He is; not the territory simply, nor the city, but where He is -- "where the little child was". The star directed them, and "When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother ..." "The little child" is always mentioned first, bearing out what I have been saying, that the Person of the Lord is distinguished all the time. He must always be pre-eminent. Every lover of Christ joins with John as he says, "he was before me", and "He ... is preferred before me". God will have it so, and love in me will have it so. A lover of Jesus will always make provision for His distinction above all others. And so they bring forth their treasures -- gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and they worship!
It is the time for the worship of the Son of God. The Person of the Son of God has been made clear to us, and it is to draw out our worship. They worship Him! Then we are told that "being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way". They are spiritual. They are more spiritual than they were when they came. No one ever comes
{187}
into contact with Jesus and worships Him without being more spiritual, more rich than he ever was before. If you met them now on the return journey you would find them more spiritual than when they were on their way to Jerusalem. Their eyes had seen the King in His beauty! Although a little Child, divine beauty shone there, and it drew forth their homage and their wealth.
Well now, I go on to another side of the truth, that is, to Saul -- it is a well-known scripture. What I have in mind now is to point out how a brother gets heavenly guidance; he has been in the wrong way, he has been in the service of the enemy, "breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord". There are many who are affected in this way, alas! and this scripture is to teach us how one of such receives guidance from heaven, and the kind of guidance he gets. If we read the account given in chapter 22, we shall see that Saul asks the Lord what he is to do, but according to the best manuscripts that question is not in @Acts 9; it is omitted -- the last half of verse 5 and the first half of verse 6 are omitted in the best version.
The Lord is concerned about this converted man as to how he is to be guided, without his asking, as if the Lord were to say, Now you need guidance. You say, I was converted yesterday. Thank God, but have you moved since? Where have you moved to? As soon as the light comes in from the Lord, you need guidance. Do not forget that you are not to be a free-lance any more -- you are not to go where you please any more -- many do. And many so-called evangelists let their converts provide for themselves. Not so Jesus! Here, He does not even wait for Saul to ask Him what he should do. The Lord says, as it were, This is imperative, you *must* get guidance, you *must* know where to go; if you do not, you will make a great mistake, you will get into wrong company.
{188}
Saul, rightly, wanted to know, and every right-minded subject of the work of God will say, What shall I do? Where shall I go? But the Lord anticipates all that here. He says, It *must* be so, you *must* know what to do, you must be guided aright. The light shone round about him, and the voice said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" He fell down, and the Lord says "Go into the city ..." Do not trust your own mind. Well, you say, That is a mere accident, for it was near Damascus. The next narrative says, "Go into Damascus" (chapter 22); but here the Lord says, "Go into the city" (verse 6), "and it shall be told thee what thou must do" -- what thou *must* do!
One may say, There are several different companies, I do not know where to go. Well, the Lord says, "Go into the city". There were other companies there, too, companies to whom he might have gone. He might have gone back to Jerusalem, there were sects there; he belonged to the sect of the Pharisees -- he might have gone to them; or he might change his mind and go to the Sadducees, or to the Libertines, but the Lord anticipated all that, and simply enjoins him to go into the city. He did not say, I will go before you and prepare the brethren to look after you, but that is what the Lord had in mind. You may say, Those people that meet down there -- I do not know that there is much amongst them. It may be if we had known the few at Damascus *we* should have said there was not very much there! The Lord had to correct Ananias about Saul. He says, Lord, why this man has come here to bind the saints! How ready we are to intimate that we know better than the Lord! One often sees that -- in trivial things, too. It may not occur to us that we are criticising the Lord, but it is the fact. Ananias thought he knew Saul of Tarsus better than the Lord did! Think of what we are capable of! And
{189}
he was a good brother, too. The apostle Paul says later that he was a pious man, and well spoken of by the Jews there. But the Lord has in mind in sending Saul into the city that He would go before him and provide what he needed, provide guidance. Go into the city, He had said, and it will be told you what you must do.
The brethren there will insist on the principles that govern the house of God, and you must submit to the truth they set before you. And Saul did submit. He says, "I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision" (chapter 26: 19). If there is any little bit of light from heaven, do not be disobedient to it. The Lord will tell you where to go, and prepare His people there to help you. The Lord has them here for that purpose. "I will also leave in the midst of thee", He says, "an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord", @Zephaniah 3: 12. He has them here in this city. You go amongst them and you will get help, the Lord has left them here for you; if they need it, He will prepare them to receive you, to meet your particular case. It may be a difficult one. Certainly Saul's was a very difficult one, but the Lord made Ananias capable of helping Saul. He went to Ananias and prepared him to receive this brother, and he received him graciously and instructed him. He says, "Why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptised, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord" (chapter 22: 16). That is what he needed -- to call on His Name. Maybe there is someone here seeking light in that way -- the Lord would direct you to His people, and if you find them, you will get light amongst them; the Lord has left them here to serve those who are seeking light and help.
Finally, I wanted to say a word about Peter. I have been speaking about these brethren from the east who want to see the Lord. They want to find
{190}
Him. They have a little light from heaven about Him, and it shows them where He is; well, they find Him! They have found Him, and they worship Him. Then I spoke of a brother who has just been converted -- what guidance it is he needs. He wants to come in amongst the brethren. He may have been very distinguished elsewhere -- Saul was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel -- but now he must come in humbly and recognise that they know more than he. Those brethren at Damascus knew more than Saul; although he was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, he knew less than Ananias. He had to take a low place and come in amongst the brethren and learn from them.
The next person in mind is a brother who is serving with great success. Peter is the leading apostle amongst the twelve, and we are told in the ninth chapter that he went everywhere in his service. He is in Joppa, and is on the house-top; but he has certain reservations in his mind. He needs instruction about the mind of heaven as to humanity. National feelings are inimical to the growth of the saints, and to qualification for the assembly. No mere nationalist can be an assembly man -- the assembly is too wide and great a thought for that. Peter was doing great service in his own country, but then God was not the God of the Jews only. He was the God of the gentiles, and He was cleansing the gentiles. Here was a man, a centurion. We may regard such a calling with reserve, but this soldier received light from heaven, and evidently continued in military service. He was in command of the Italian band, and he had a trusted servant and "a pious soldier", with him, and he sent him for Peter. I am not saying that a christian should be free to become a soldier -- if I were one and could be free, I should "use it rather", but God is no respecter of persons, and what God has cleansed we are not to
{191}
call common, whatever the man's employment. If God has taken a lead in that man's history we are to follow it.
Peter was not ready. What I have in mind now is enlargement in regard to humanity and service to men; for at this juncture in the testimony it is a question of the Son of man; He stands related to all men, not only the Jews. And not only that, God is cleansing men -- wonderful thought! "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common". That is what the voice from heaven said, which came down to Peter's ears. He is hungry -- what has that to do with it? Why did he become very hungry? Because God wanted to speak to him, as it were, through his stomach. Here are eatable things: Oh no, Peter says, I would not eat those. God says, I have cleansed them -- "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common". This happened three times. Peter, when he gives an account of it, calls the sheet a "vessel". The ninth chapter speaks of a vessel as applied to a man -- an "elect vessel"; the tenth chapter uses the same expression in regard to the sheet bound at the four corners which came to Peter. It is capable of holding what God has cleansed. It looks as if they were all unclean animals -- perhaps people looking on us might think we are unclean, but not from the standpoint of heaven -- God has cleansed us. What a blessed thought that is! *God* has done it -- saved us and called us -- it is by the "washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit" (@Titus 3: 5) that God saves us.
The Lord, maybe, has a word as to *our* outlook. Perhaps we are national. Not that I would say a word against any person being subject to the authorities -- we should pray for them. They are God's ministers, whoever they are, in this very city -- God's ministers to us for good. It is well to see that. There is no thought at all of christians interfering
{192}
with governments ordered of God, they are God's ministers for good; we are to be subject to them, and pray for them. But then, national feelings, and limiting ourselves to our own country -- that is the danger. God is dealing with *mankind*. It is the kindness and love of God to man that marks the present moment -- "to man", and here is a sheet full of all kinds of creatures, "four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air". And the voice comes -- all to make the minister enlarged in his view, so that he might be used of God in a wider area of mankind. For God had the gentiles in mind for blessing. Simeon said in the temple, in @Luke 2, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles ..." -- that is what the Child was. The gentiles had come into the view of God for blessing, and that holds good now, hence He would enlarge our view so that our service should take character from that outlook. And Peter says, "it came even to me" (chapter 11: 5). Heaven is thinking of His servant, not now as sent to the circumcision, but sent to the gentiles -- making his hand supple so that he might use the key properly, and open the door to the gentiles. The Lord had said, "I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens" (@Matthew 16: 19), and now he has to use them; as Ananias had to open the door to Saul, Peter has to open the doors of the kingdom to Cornelius and his company -- and he does it well. As he is speaking, "the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word". It is not simply upon those who were in the company -- in meetings such as the present one some may not be listening to all -- the point is, "those who were hearing the word". God did not wait for them to make any confession. He gave them the Spirit before they made any confession; He knew what was going on in their hearts. But the point in mind is that Peter is enlarged by
{193}
guidance from heaven; and I would urge that the brethren should take up this point and maintain the heavenly outlook -- look there, and guidance will come from heaven. It will come even unto you. It came. Peter says, "even unto me".
{194}
THE GLORIES OF CHRIST APPREHENDED IN ASSEMBLY SERVICE
@Exodus 24: 1, 2, 9 - 18
J.T. What is in mind is to draw attention to the greatness of the mediator, the increasing greatness of the mediator, in this book -- that is, of Moses -- seen particularly in this chapter; and the distinction made between him and all others. The word in verse 1 is "Go up to Jehovah". The others do not go up to the *mountain*. Verse 9 says they went up, without specifying the place, it is more the idea of ascension or elevation, but after verse 12 the mountain is mentioned frequently. Jehovah saying to Moses, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there". In the verses at the end, the mountain is spoken of a number of times as that into which Moses was called and went. In verse 18 it is said he "went into the midst of the cloud, and ascended the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights".
For general instruction it may be remarked that Exodus has the service of God in the wilderness in mind. The word earlier was, "ye shall serve God upon this mountain", and the message to Pharaoh was, "Let my son go, that he may serve me". And as in the wilderness they are at first led by Moses, but chapter 19 says *they* are moving. "In the third month after the departure of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai: they departed from Rephidim, and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness; and Israel encamped there before the mountain. And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: Ye have seen what I
{195}
have done to the Egyptians, and how I have borne you on eagles wings and brought you to myself. And now, if ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation".
This message conveyed the mind of God as to them, and then we are told later (verse 17), that "Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the foot of the mountain". So that God is in mind; and the mediator has led the people out of the camp to meet with Him: he is serving the people and God in that way. He brought them out of the camp to meet with God. Much intervenes before we come to this chapter 24, which is the end of a section; what follows has to do mainly with the rearing of the tabernacle, and service in an official sense; but in this chapter, while God's service is in mind, it is less official, and *youths* instead of priests are officiating; but Moses is particularly signalised. It is helpful in view of assembly service to see how God would make room for Christ in our service. He is anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows. We get that in the Psalms -- love active towards Him, as in @Psalm 45; in this psalm He is greatly signalised in His personal dignity and attractiveness.
So we may see that more scope should be given, in the service of God, to Christ personally, ascriptions of praise to Him in relation to His functions in the assembly, and the glories that attach to Him there. The sanctuary is provided typically -- from chapter 25 to the end -- but running through the teaching of the book of Exodus is subjugation, that being affected in us; and in that connection, recognition of the glories of Christ. The sanctuary is seen fully in the end of this book; as the tabernacle was set
{196}
up, the glory of God filled it. All is seen ready for God, and He enters, and is to be served there. The Minister of the sanctuary is needed for this, anticipated in chapters 28 and 29.
F.I. Is your thought in referring to chapter 19, where it says, "they stood at the foot of the mountain", that to rise to the top of the mountain we have to see the position that Christ has as Mediator?
J.T. Well, that is how the truth stands. The line of ascension is marked by Him, and Jehovah in speaking to Moses says in verse 1 of chapter 24, "Go up"; that is in relation to others; but as to himself only we have added, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there" (verse 12). It is *his* place -- Christ's place, typically -- as over against Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu and the elders.
W.H.R. Who would the others who were in ascension with him signify?
J.T. Well, Aaron is not yet constituted priest, but the order mentioned is Aaron and his two sons and the seventy elders. They would represent the saints, ourselves, as in the type, going up. That is, the service of God takes that course. "Go up", it says, but not to any place. The place is not specified, but the principle of going up to God. "Go up to Jehovah". Yet in verse 12, Jehovah says to Moses, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there". As to him, the mountain is specified all through from verse 12 to the end of the chapter, marking off the distinction of Moses as over against the others. Christ goes beyond us in the service, having a definite place above -- "and be there", Jehovah says to Moses. He is on our side and brings us out to meet God on our side, but He has personal distinction, which is in our view in these chapters strikingly, to call forth, I think, the affections of the saints to Christ in His varied glories, relations, and offices in the assembly; and it seems to me that the brethren are
{197}
not making enough room for Christ in this sense. We proceed immediately to the Father (in many instances, at least), whereas more scope is needed to bring out the relations of Christ to the assembly, and what He is in it; His varied glories there, as I said. The assembly normally is able to sustain the glories of Christ, as they are sustained in heaven.
A.E.L. What is the thought in verse 1, where it says, "... and worship afar off"? What form would worship take? Would it be adoration simply?
J.T. It would be an inward movement Godward, and a corresponding outward movement or attitude. The word generally used in the New Testament implies prostration towards another in fondness or affection in a reverential way. The expression, "... worship afar off. And let Moses alone come near Jehovah", would of course carry with it the dispensation, but still God said that He had brought them to Himself, and the thought was to have them near to Him, as we learn elsewhere. But He makes the distinction here that they were to worship afar off. He is calling attention to Moses and his personal distinction, hence we need always to have impressed upon us Christ's dignity as standing with us.
F.I. Do you mean that the worship of God cannot properly be carried out unless we have before us these varied distinctions of Christ?
J.T. Well, we are at a disadvantage unless we make room for them.
J.M. Would the cup bring before us the Lord's glory as Mediator of the covenant?
J.T. It does. He is Mediator of the new covenant. That is one of the glories of Christ. There are varied glories, and the assembly should be the home of them, as it were. Heaven is of course the home of them -- they are seen fully there -- but the assembly should be a sort of reflex of what is in heaven.
{198}
J.M. In the assembly we are introduced into a scene of glory.
J.T. That is the end in view, glory to God in the assembly in Christ Jesus. That is, it stands "in Christ Jesus", but it is for God's glory. What is said as to Lazarus at Bethany was, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it", @John 11: 4.
The Lord's supper stands in relation to Christ. It is not the Father's supper, and it is not God's supper, and it is not the Spirit's supper -- it is the Lord's supper; and the section in Corinthians that teaches us as to it is full of lordship, of authority. I believe that the end in view is that Christ should be before us in a subjugating way, but still in His glory as well. In the tabernacle there are glories -- varied glories of Christ, and of God.
A.E.L. So that it is the death of the Lord we announce; the One they have refused as Lord, we recognise.
F.S. Are you specially referring to His glory as Mediator, or to all His glories?
J.T. All His glories. Of course, it is the Mediator here, we are dealing here with the type; but take the scriptures that have especially in mind the glories of Christ -- John's gospel, for instance; see the number of titles under which Christ is presented in the first chapter, and how He is apprehended and spoken of. "I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God", one says (verse 34); another says, "thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel" (verse 49). The epistle to the Hebrews is very striking, it is full of the thought of the glory of Christ; and Hebrews has the service of God in mind -- John has, too. These scriptures, or sections of scripture, have in view that the saints as loving Christ should be full of His glory -- full of the greatness of the Person -- and in His supper these things should come into
{199}
view. The same thing is seen in the book of Revelation -- the ascriptions of praise to the Lord under varied titles.
F.I. Will you help us a little as to the expression of this. You have said that these things must be in view in relation to the service of God. Well now, in our service to God is it that we have in our minds these glories, and are able to give expression to them in relation to God, or is it that we give expression to them to Christ Himself?
J.T. First, to Himself.
F.I. What part of the service in relation to the Lord's supper is this connected with?
J.T. We begin with the Lord as He is above. We begin with Him there. And what should come before us, whether we speak of it or not, is the manner of His reception up there. Of course, the position is that He has been rejected *here*. There is no place for Him in the world, but He is accepted up there, "... received up in glory", Scripture says. "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory", @1 Timothy 3: 16. The Scriptures enlarge on His place above. We ought to begin with that; if we love Him we ought to begin with the thought of heaven's honour, the honour lavished upon Him above. Raised from the dead by the glory of the Father and received up in glory; glorified by the Father; all these things are facts as over against His rejection down here.
Well now, we are proceeding into assembly service and it is the Lord's supper. It is a public matter, it is a dominical matter, too, and the Lord comes into view in these varied aspects. As He has been received above, so He is to be received below. We should not be behind the angels in our reception of Christ. We have in mind that He is to come in,
{200}
and so we speak to Him accordingly. And then we look at the bread -- it alludes to His love for the assembly. He did the will of God in His body, but He also devoted Himself unto death in love to the assembly. And it seems that we should keep in mind that the glory shone in circumstances that were its very opposite. It shone out in His service here, and as entering into death. And then He is Head of the body, the assembly, and He is Priest. He is to be apprehended in all these lights. And then as we come to the cup, He is Mediator of the new covenant, and He is Son of God -- Hebrews stresses that, that the Son of God is the Priest; and then He is Minister of the sanctuary.
So that we are led on in that way, we move on in the service of God into the area known as the sanctuary, and the idea of going up appears. Moses led the people (chapter 19: 17), out of the camp to meet with God. They had encamped before the mountain, that was proper, but then there was a leading out of that. They are not led into another camp, but "to meet with God", and the upward movement of @Exodus 24 shows that.
F.I. If, as we have been helped in regard to the Supper, the first thing that is before us is the breaking of bread -- we should start with it -- should the place that Christ has in heaven be before us before the breaking of bread, should it be in our minds?
J.T. Yes, in our minds. It is in contrast with all around. He has been rejected here, ignominiously; it is not only that He has not His place as Lord, as Head, but He has been ignominiously rejected -- the cross and the grave were in hatred accorded to Him. Well, we accept that position. We move towards the Lord's supper in the acceptance of that solemn position, and it ought to solemnise us. The anointing enables us to be dignified in the recognition of that state of things. But then the rejected One
{201}
here is accepted above. He is exalted. He was carried up into heaven, and received in glory there. He is by the right hand of God exalted, being made Lord and Christ! All these statements of Scripture so rich and full and varied, should be always in our minds, but particularly as in assembly; we should be full of these things. If we were to go up into heaven literally, we should find that it is full of them, all intelligences there are full of them! The Spirit enables us to have them in our minds.
Now, such an One comes in. It says in the Psalms, "Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in", @Psalm 24: 7. I suppose that is in Jerusalem, and in a way it is in the assembly. It is the greatness of the Person who comes in. I do not think that the place He comes into there is heaven, it is rather Jerusalem itself -- how He should be received in the coming day. But now He says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". He comes in. Canticles shows that the assembly would be full of admiration of Christ, and able to describe Him. Well, that is the One who is coming in. "Let my beloved come into his garden ...", @Song of Songs 4: 16. That is the One -- and if anyone asks about Him, one who is of the assembly can describe Him.
We have in mind that He is coming in, in all these glories. Love attaches all these glories to Him. Heaven does, and the assembly should do so, too. So that as He is apprehended, as come in in a spiritual way, we must give scope for the movement of assembly affections towards Him, and for His affections for us too. Of course, it is the service of God we have in mind, and He has it in mind, but still He has *His* place. His supper is first -- it is the Lord's; it is not God's nor the Father's, it is the Lord's supper. So that it is the time for reciprocal affections between Christ and the assembly.
{202}
A.F.L. You are speaking of the effect of the breaking of bread especially.
J.T. Yes, and then the cup brings in the thought of the new covenant of which He is Mediator, and in connection with that we have not only that He is Mediator of it, but He is the Spirit of it; "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty". All that comes out in relation to the cup. It is by Him, "even as by the Lord the Spirit", @2 Corinthians 3: 18.
It gives a wide range for the Lord's services towards the assembly, and the assembly's response to Him, before we proceed to what is in mind, namely, the service of God as such.
J.F.C. The service of God is not immediately in connection with the cup?
J.T. As scope is given for Christ and the assembly, it follows on. It is the Lord's cup. The references to the Lord in @1 Corinthians 10 and 11 are very striking. Why should we ever connect the name of the Father with the cup? Scripture does not. The covenant is God's covenant with His people, not the Father's covenant.
P.T.W. I suppose what we have in the cup is "the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord", @Romans 8: 39.
H.S. To whom do we give thanks for the cup?
J.T. To the Lord. Although if one gave thanks to God for His love as seen in it, I should say, Amen, but it is peculiarly connected with the Lord.
Then there is another thing -- Christ's God, what He is to Christ. That is not the God of the covenant. There is no covenant between Christ and God. So that we are on a higher level when we speak of, "my Father and your Father", and "my God and your God". The covenant is, "I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for people", @Hebrews 8: 10. It is not made with us directly, but with Israel and Judah, though of course we are brought into it.
{203}
In the epistle to the Corinthians the new covenant is connected with gentile believers, with the assembly. Christ is seen as the Spirit of it. It is seen on a higher plane than in Hebrews, which contemplates believers among the Jews. Those *called* would be those called amongst the Jews, and the word *eternal* would be in contrast to the temporal inheritance that they had come into. Whatever the inheritance, it is of an eternal nature. Hebrews stresses that. @Hebrews 9 goes beyond the thought of the covenant to the fulness of Christ's death, His sacrificial death, and all that flows from it in the gospel. The new covenant is in @Hebrews 8. Chapter 9 gives enlargement and goes wider, speaking of the whole bearing of the death of Christ. Chapter 10 continues this, returning to the new covenant -- all to the end that the saints should be free to draw near to God.
A.E.L. "Now to appear in the presence of God for us"; is that the termination?
J.T. Yes.
W.H.R. When the Lord says, "I am coming to you", is it general when we are taking the Supper, or is it after we have taken the Supper?
J.T. It would be through the memorial -- the calling of Him to mind in the bread and the cup. John brings it in, none of the other evangelists do. "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", @John 14: 18. It comes in after He mentions the Comforter; He says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", verses 15 - 18. I think John gives us that to show what we may count on in the last days. The Lord comes in in relation to the Comforter.
{204}
John is the only one who calls the Spirit the Comforter, and it is very comforting for us in these last days that He continues with us. He will be with you for ever, the Lord says; and it is in that way that He comes in. He does not come in corporeally as He did in the early days of christianity, as in @1 Corinthians 15. John does not contemplate that. He contemplates Him coming in in a spiritual way in virtue of the Comforter being here; but nevertheless *He* comes, and I am sure we have realised it. As spiritual, we discern Him.
W.H.R. Is that to be realised when we are together in assembly?
J.T. Yes. When David inaugurated the service of God he put several psalms together; he made selections from them, making one suitable for the occasion (@1 Chronicles 16). It is a question of spiritual understanding, so as to put things together. The Lord says in relation to the Supper, "This do for a remembrance of me". The original word for remembrance is used four times, @Luke 22, @1 Corinthians 11, and @Hebrews 10. It is a peculiar form, see note on @1 Corinthians 11: 24 (New Trans.). Why should it be that? Obviously, spiritual understanding would say, The Lord must mean more than that I should remember Him as I remember any other person. He means that there is an active power in the mind to call Him in in relation to the memorial He left with His disciples. Spiritual understanding would further say, Then the Lord's supper is just when He would come in. We should expect Him to come in. We have that in mind, and He has it in mind.
W.H.R. We are calling Him into presence in our spiritual apprehension.
J.T. There is power in the renewed mind, the Spirit helping. It is not a great mental effort. You might be able to recall a dead relative or friend, or a living one, but he is not conscious of this; but Christ's
{205}
relations with the assembly are of a vital, organic character, the Spirit being the active medium, and the Lord can thus become present as opportunity on our side offers. People speak of remembering the Lord *in His death*, but that is not the thought in the Lord's supper; there is no such phrase in the Scriptures. It is a living glorious Person, viewed as absent from us, that we remember. Through the Spirit He can come to us, as He promised, making His presence very real. It is Himself, not a representative, an angel, as in Old Testament times.
H.S. Do we bring Him in in contrast to the action of those who cast Him out?
J.T. Quite so, from our side; He *comes* in also.
A.W.R. It is where true affections are in flow. He says, "If any one love me ...", @John 14: 23.
J.T. Yes. The Spirit is given on that ground -- "if ye love me", the Lord says. It is a question of the *state* of the saints. If the state be right there is power in the mind to bring Christ in. He is livingly in the mind by its own action, but, as already said, He also *comes*.
G.E. Would not the Spirit occupy us with the varied glories of Christ on different occasions? We would start with the greatness of His personal glory, but we could not take them all up; there is a great variety.
J.T. See what is opened up to us! Heaven is opened up to us in the assembly. The Lord begins the subject by saying, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter ...". A real Person, even as the Lord was -- a wonderful thing. The idea in the word "Comforter" is one alongside of us, looking after our affairs; if we are defective in our minds, He will help us. He is ever on our side. If things are to be adjusted, He will do that. By Him we say, "Lord Jesus" in the assembly, and by Him
{206}
we say, "Abba, Father". He is also the Father's Spirit, by whom we are strengthened inwardly. And it is by Him that the Lord is the Spirit of the new covenant *actively*, as seen in @2 Corinthians 3: 17, 18.
J.R.W. "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" -- is that to be realised by us now?
J.T. That is what we had this morning. What did we see of His glories today? What was impressed on your mind as in the assembly? You cannot expect to see *all* His glories at a given time; we are not great enough, but He would always present Himself in a distinctive way. In @John 17 He speaks of our being with Him to behold His glory.
J.M. Do you think the Lord would engage us with this immediately after the Supper?
J.T. I think there should be scope for it, but sometimes a hymn is *immediately* given out to the Father. We should be richer and fuller in our service if we had more scope for the Lord, so that He is seen gradually as the Minister of the sanctuary.
J.F.C. The psalm you mention speaks of David giving thanks through Asaph and his brethren.
J.T. Quite so. Christ praises God now in and through the assembly.
Rem. The writer to the Hebrews pieces a number of scriptures together.
J.T. Yes; the whole of the first chapter is taken from the Psalms, showing what is in mind; it is the service of God.
A.W.R. At the end of the psalm in @1 Chronicles 16, all the people say "Amen".
J.T. Yes, *all* the people.
J.M. After the Supper we have been in the habit of giving out a hymn to God in relation to the covenant. Do you think more room should be made for the Lord Himself?
J.T. That is what we have been saying. Exodus shows how the Mediator becomes magnified. This
{207}
chapter, @Exodus 24, calls attention to him in a striking way: Verse 1 says, "Go up", omitting to mention the word "mountain" as the place they were going to. They were just to "go up", which in the antitype is a moral thought which should be always present with us. The Lord's supper is in the court of the tabernacle; the testimony of it can be seen by others but going up is a spiritual matter. The position thus ceases to be local, it becomes universal.
P.T.W. @Matthew 26: 30 says, "having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives".
J.T. Yes. That is elevation, and it is departure -- they went *out* from the external position in which the Supper is celebrated.
W.H.R. Would that hymn be to God or to the Lord?
J.T. Well, as it was then, even the giving of thanks by the Lord would be to God, or the Father, possibly to Jehovah -- the Lord would not give thanks to Himself. But it is the *teaching* governing the Lord's supper that we are now considering. This is in the epistles. We can never understand the gospels till we understand the epistles, and in the teaching as to the Supper, it is called the Lord's supper. That is what we must go by. In celebrating the Lord's supper His absence is contemplated, but it being His supper, we speak to Him.
J.M. One is sure that, the Lord having come in (if we are conscious of it) we should be engaged with Himself, His glories included.
J.T. The book of Canticles is intended to help us, and it shows how love in us takes account of His varied glories. The feminine speaker does not speak to the Lord directly, but the assembly can speak directly to Him. He speaks to her in the Canticles, but she does not speak to Him -- it is more of Him, as the dispensation is different, and she has not full liberty. But now we speak to Him.
{208}
F.I. When does the Supper end?
J.T. Well, we should not cut it off immediately after the cup. The collection is in keeping with it, and there is no reason that I see why we should not go on to speak to the Lord, so as to get all that we are capable of at the moment, so as to be enriched for the great final thought -- glory to God in the assembly in Christ Jesus; and the suggestion there is praise *in power*. I believe the preposition "in" implies this. We move on with Him amongst us, so that His power is effective. "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".
J.R.W. There is no place too high for Him in heaven.
J.T. He has gone beyond all the heavens. That agrees with what we are saying: in @Exodus 24 Moses goes away beyond the others, and you have the place; "Come up", says Jehovah, "into the mountain, and be there". That points to the Lord's personal distinction.
S.M.W. You were speaking of subjection as a very important thing.
J.T. It is concurrent with the glory of the Mediator in this book; there is gradual subjugation. In the last chapter everyone, typically, is in his place functioning, so that there is no need now for Moses; that is, as exercising subjugating authority. He cannot enter; the glory fills the scene. Subjection is complete.
A.E.L. How do you use the word "subjugation"? Subjugation what to?
J.T. Well, when the Son has made all things subject, He Himself is subject (@1 Corinthians 15). That is one of the functions of the Mediator, to effect subjugation -- we are to be thoroughly subdued. So that every item of the tabernacle is functioning, it does what it should do. It is one of the most important
{209}
things to notice. It says, "Moses finished the work", and the glory comes in then (@Exodus 40: 33).
Rem. The antitype of Christ as Minister of the sanctuary is Moses, not Aaron.
J.T. No. Service in the tabernacle is hardly seen Exodus. It is the tabernacle set up by Moses. It Christ from the divine side, not from ours. Aaron is the minister of the sanctuary; he is seen in this way in chapters 28 and 29, but his service is properly seen in Leviticus.
A.E.L. Moses always had access, Aaron was limited.
J.T. Yes, so that Moses is Christ more than any other in the Old Testament. It says, "The form of Jehovah doth he behold", and of no one else is that said.
W.H.R. In giving praise to Christ would He be free to take His place and lead us?
J.T. Well, not only is there subjugation, but we are enriched. We are full of the thought of His glory, and He now has us in the scene of glory, and we ourselves are "all glorious", because we are "transformed according to the same image from glory to glory", @2 Corinthians 3: 18. That is what He is aiming at. "All glorious is the king's daughter within", @Psalm 45: 13. We are *absorbing* the glory as we are occupied with it.
W.H.R. He would take His place in the midst, in our expressions of praise to the Father.
J.T. Yes, He has a suitable company now in which to sing to God.
A.E.L. What does it mean when it says, "whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer". @Hebrews 8: 3?
J.T. Well, that is to some a difficult question. Hebrews has in mind christianity as the new heavenly order of things in which Christ is High Priest, as compared with the Jewish system and its high priests.
{210}
What Christ offers as High Priest *characteristically* is thus spoken of as Himself (chapter 7: 27 and chapter 9: 14). The truth seems to be that chapter 8: 3 takes up the subject of Christ's offering in its *fulness*, as developed in chapters 9 and 10. The new covenant is connected with it, having in mind that we should draw near to God.
A.E.L. In the last chapter we read "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise ...", chapter 13: 15.
J.T. It is "By him therefore let us offer ..." So Peter says, "... to offer spiritual sacrifices ... by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2: 5. Of course it is true that He takes what we have and presents it, but Hebrews in the main deals with what is initial and fundamental in christianity, and this particularly as to offerings, and hence the "somewhat" of chapter 8: 3 must, as a high priestly offering, be more than what can be obtained through the saints.
W.H.R. Does the Lord then lead on to the family thought?
J.T. He does. Sonship comes in. That links on with Solomon's part of the service, where sonship is in mind. Solomon is the son, Moses was never viewed in that way, nor Aaron either. When we come to the family side it is seen in David and Solomon.
But what is said in our chapter is very interesting, from verse 12 to the end. It says, "Jehovah said to Moses, Come up to me ..." He said at first (verse 1), "Go up to Jehovah"; and then (verse 9), "Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up". But in verse 12 Jehovah says, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there". You see the distinction, the personal distinction, there. "Come up ... and be there", the mountain being mentioned as the place.
A.E.L. He is there representatively.
{211}
J.T. Yes, the whole passage shows that he is; and Jehovah says, "I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction" (verse 12). All that is in it, but we are just touching now on the difference between the first going up where there is no mountain mentioned, and the second going up where the mountain is stressed; it is Christ's own place, and by personal right too. It involves the covenant and the fulness of the blood of the covenant.
P.T.W. This is all on the ground of the spiritual conditions being there with the company?
J.T. Yes, but we would not have time to go further into that. We are touching specially on one point, the place that should be given to Christ personally in the service of God, and how this chapter shows it.
F.I. "Moses went into the midst of the cloud", going where no one else could go.
J.T. Joshua, of course, went up, but he is only an "attendant"; he is not viewed here as representing the saints.
{212}
*Pages 212 - 488 -- "Notes of Readings in New York", 1938 (Volume 143)*.
SPOIL (1)
@1 Samuel 30: 1 - 31
J.T. The brethren will be aware that the subject of *spoil* has been proposed for the readings this season. It was thought that @1 Samuel 30 would be the most appropriate section of Scripture with which to begin -- the term, "David's spoil", being found there. It seems right that we should begin with that as typical of Christ's spoil. There are many other features of spiritual spoil that will doubtless come into view in the Lord's ordering, as found in the Scriptures, but this seems to be the most appropriate one with which to begin, as bringing the Lord before us as acquiring spoil, and that in relation to the great subject of general recovery. The chapter, which as a matter of history records a painful disaster for David, obviously has a wider significance, and points to the recovery in Christ of all that was lost through man's unfaithfulness. (David is to be viewed as an unfaithful man in the immediately preceding history, for he was actually with the enemies of God's people and ready to fight against Israel.) But as found on the spot where the disaster occurred, that is, Ziklag, he rises to a type of Christ as feeling things, weeping until he had no more power to weep, and also experiencing the immediate danger of being stoned. He went through the agony attached to the disaster, but found strength in God, so that the power of God enters into the position, and recovery is on that line. We have this remarkable statement in verse 20: "And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil". He singled out what he regarded as
{213}
distinctly his spoil. There were other cattle there, but he singled out what was to be regarded as his spoil; so that it is very distinctive in this way and stands out for our faith to learn what is peculiarly Christ's spoil.
C.A.M. Would we be warranted in speaking of David as a type of Christ on account of the agony through which he passed?
J.T. Yes. It was on the spot where the disaster occurred, that David was changed. One can understand what heart-searching would be gone through by David, on account of his unfaithfulness being the occasion of it. During his absence Ziklag, which was his own territory, was destroyed, but he had been on his way to fight against the people of God, a most sorrowful thing, and only through the overruling of God was he dissuaded from that course. Now he is back where he should be, and we can understand how the position changes; the real David comes to light.
A.F.M. Do you think that with other things the strengthening of himself in Jehovah his God was mainly the element of recovery to God?
J.T. Yes; and he has recourse to the ephod; he goes back to the divinely appointed way of having to say to God. God has to be approached in His own way. David has recourse to that, so we have David the man of faith here.
C.A.M. This is something like what Jonah went through, being a disobedient man going through the depths in his soul, but the Lord could speak of him as a type of Himself.
J.T. Quite so; that is another good example of a man changing over from the position of an unfaithful man, or sinner, to a type of the Lord Jesus; that there is that power of changing over, is the great triumph of God. It is a question of what God effects in a man; so that he can change over.
{214}
A.B.P. Would the expression, "strengthened himself", suggest something inherent?
J.T. That is right; it is not simply an external support that God afforded him, but he strengthened himself; the principle of it was there.
S.P. Was Jehovah preparing him, by weeping, to appreciate the spoil?
J.T. Spoil is the outcome of things being rightly felt. It says, "Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep" (verse 4). That is remarkable -- the *depth* of feeling.
J.H.E. It is striking that David, being such a mighty man, could be a weeper, too.
J.T. That is the secret of acquiring divine help; it is experienced as we feel things. "When I am weak", one of the greatest servants said, "then I am powerful".
A.N.W. Does not the calling for the ephod, too, indicate a very quick recovery of spiritual instinct?
J.T. I thought that; all these items enter into the Lord's position on the cross (we may view David as a type); how divine order comes into evidence there; how thoroughly the Lord was with God in every requirement in view of His vicarious service upon which He was entering. The thought had been expressed at the commencement of His service -- "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" (@Matthew 3: 15); and at no point is the priest more apparent than in Gethsemane and on the cross.
J.S. Would this be David as seen in feeling things *Godward*? He lifted up his voice and wept.
J.T. It would be that the depth of his feelings was heard. "God hath heard the voice of the lad", (@Genesis 21: 17). God hears those cries, and of the Lord it is said, "having been heard because of his piety".
Ques. Would you say more in detail as to what surrounds the Ziklag position and what the Lord
{215}
faced in the anti-typical position; what does it represent?
J.T. I think humanity is typified in the captives. You will observe it says, "and had taken the women captives that were in it; both great and small: they had put none to death, but had carried them off, and went on their way" (verse 2). And then it says, "And David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were taken captives" (verse 3); the men representing intelligence and power are not there. I think, therefore, it is a question of humanity; that is, from the standpoint of corruptibility. Humanity is exposed to being corrupted by the enemy, and so I think @Romans 1 enters into this; in fact, Romans is the amplification of this chapter. Romans does not contemplate us as dead in trespasses and sins, but as alive and corrupted.
Ques. Does the early part of Genesis enter into this, too; the woman is in the transgression? Is that what comes out of it?
J.T. Yes; that is the side that has to be kept in mind. It is the subjective side of humanity. The responsible, intelligent side is represented in the man. Paul says expressly, Adam was not in the transgression. The way the captives are mentioned is to bring out the subjective side; what is corruptible, and that which Satan *has* corrupted. @Romans 1 brings out the terribleness of corruption that Satan effected in humanity.
C.A.M. Romans contemplates that all is secured on the basis of sacrifice and offering; even the nations are offered up.
J.T. Quite so; that is spoil -- the offering up of the nations ... sanctified by the Holy Spirit. And then you see how, in @Romans 1, humanity as a whole is in mind, the terrible corruption that men fell into; then in chapter 2 you have the man's side,
{216}
so to speak; it is, "O man" (verse 1), as if the Spirit of God takes on the thought of man from the Greek point of view. Why did he boast? Why did he formulate codes of ethics when he was practising the things he condemned? And then the Jew -- "But if *thou* art named a Jew". These are the two sides of the human race. They represent the authoritative, intelligent side, but both have come under the power of evil; whereas humanity, viewed here in the women and children, gives us the subjective side. They are not slain; but taken just as they were; and, as is obvious, exposed to corruption.
Ques. Is the Jew, as refusing Christ, typified in verse 6, where it is said the people spoke of stoning David?
J.T. I think so.
J.H.E. David's followers were embittered for the sons and daughters; whereas David thought of the wives, involving the assembly typically: "the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it". @Ephesians 5: 25.
W.F.K. The Amalekite attacked while David was away. Is there not something in that?
J.T. It was when he was unfaithful. No doubt the pending battle between the Philistines and Israel would be known to the Amalekites and they took advantage of it, but then, too, it was during David's absence. Why should he leave unprotected what was of such value and for which he was responsible? Why was he away? He represented an element that was of God, but evidently wanting; and this appears from the outset until Christ came. He took on the whole great matter and recovered all that had been lost through human unfaithfulness. Only one Man stands out as entirely in the mind of God, and who through redemption secured all for Him.
{217}
A.F.M. Do you think with regard to Ziklag that the reason it was taken and destroyed was because it was not fought for and conquered, but was rather received as a gift from Achish to David? It was fortified and made proof against attack.
J.T. Quite; David had not taken care of it, although later it is said that it belonged to the kings of Judah from the time he received it. It was his property, but not properly cared for. Think of the holdings he had there! Typically what was there is what God has in humanity, but held loosely through the unfaithfulness of those responsible, and so was lost.
A.R. Do you mean that the whole race up to the death of Christ was held under the power of Satan in captivity?
J.T. Yes. The general thought, I think, is @Romans 1. Then there was the Greek in chapter 2, and the Jew also. These had certain light. Chapter 3 shows what the Jew possessed. He had the oracles of God and should know, but then who was there to look after things? What was of God was allowed to go on loosely; the enemy was allowed to take it; that was the position until Christ came.
R.W.S. It says Ziklag was burnt with fire, but neighbouring cities were just raided; why is that?
J.T. I suppose Ziklag represents the particular point of attack, as belonging to David. It would refer to the particular territory that Satan was after and the treasure that was in it; the Amalekites being a type of Satan took what really belonged to God. Think of the value of these women, the wives of David's men, with no one to protect them! Ziklag, I believe, represents humanity involving divine rights, but without protection.
J.T.Jr. Adam was away when Eve was tempted.
J.T. Exactly; why was he not looking after his wife?
{218}
A.R. Do you mean that Christ having come. He was the only Man thinking for God?
J.T. That is right; the facts bring that out.
Ques. The Lord said to His mother, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?", @Luke 2: 49. Would that not indicate His readiness to stand for God entirely?
J.T. It came out in Him there. He was taking up things for God even at the age of twelve.
A.N.W. He gave Himself a ransom for *all*; for every man, as well as for the glory of God; He can recover on that ground.
J.T. That is it; it is humanity viewed from the standpoint of Luke's gospel. Paul's ministry comes in there, too, especially Romans, which takes up humanity; but then it takes up all that belonged to God too. So you get terms that are remarkable: "God's glad tidings (which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings), concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead)". @Romans 1: 3, 4. He brings out the Lord's relations to what preceded. Then the chapter goes on to show that humanity possessed the knowledge of God, but had given it up, and hence corruption followed. Man was left unprotected; that is the real truth. Chapter 2 of Romans shows that the Greeks and the Jews did no better than any other. The Jews had the oracles of God, but what use did they make of them?
A.F.M. Did not folly mark the human race early? It says, "professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man ...", @Romans 1: 22, 23. That would be after the flood, would it not?
{219}
J.T. Well, it was the character of the thing right along. There was no idolatry before the flood, as far as the Scripture shows. Idolatry came in after; so that the post-diluvian world is in mind there.
A.N.W. The characteristic term in chapter 1 of Romans is, "gave them up". He gave them up and they became captives to these corrupting elements.
J.T. Quite so. But there was no man. The prophets bewailed that there was no man; no one to take care of things. God gave them up, but it was because they gave Him up. This passage as a type shows that the men that ought to have been there to protect Ziklag and what was in it were not there. They were elsewhere. They were not serving God then; they were with the Philistines.
Ques. Satan assumed to have possession of all the kingdoms of the earth when he offered to give them to the Lord in the temptation, which would show how dreadful the state of things must have been, would you not say?
J.T. Quite so, showing how the matter then stood.
A.B.P. Would you say that the destruction of Ziklag would suggest the breakdown of man's administration? Scripture says the kings of the earth were assembled against Christ (@Psalm 2).
J.T. Quite so; those that should have been protecting the interests of God were not here on God's behalf; were indeed against Him, so that justice miscarried. Pilate was not biased, but he delivered Christ to be put to death, although he knew He was innocent; that is, what was of God was unprotected.
A.F.M. Would @Psalm 40 offset all this of which we are speaking? The Lord in coming into manhood says, "Behold, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me -- to do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight, and thy law is within my heart" (verses 7, 8).
{220}
J.T. I think David answers somewhat to that here. First it says he strengthened himself in Jehovah his God. He evidently took full account of the disaster and felt it, and now having risen to the type, he says to Abiathar, the priest, "Bring near to me, I pray thee, the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod near to David. And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he said to him, Pursue; for thou shalt assuredly overtake them and shalt certainly recover. So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him". I think he is now definitely seen as a type of Christ moving in the power of God and according to the order of God; he is getting the mind of God in the appointed way; not as Saul sought it earlier from the witch of Endor or from such an oracle as men have had recourse to. David seeks the mind of God in the appointed way and gets it.
J.S. It would show his complete recovery in that way. You see here the direct communications he had with God; not only does he enquire, but he is answered.
J.T. That is what is so very fine; there are direct relations re-established between God and a man here, and now the recovery is on that line.
Ques. Is the ephod here on moral lines, hence the recovery is in connection with the priesthood?
J.T. Yes, that is the idea. The priesthood really means sympathy, but sympathy in intelligence, that while feeling things you are enabled to get the mind of God. It is not mere sentimentality, but sympathy with God and with men, as was perfectly seen in Christ. To know what to do in the crisis you must learn from God, and God has appointed a way, so that Abiathar may be taken here to represent the high priesthood of Christ; the Lord Himself calls Abiathar "the high priest". He comes to light as
{221}
having fled from Nob to David with the ephod; he is called a high priest by the Lord Himself; so that we may consider him as representing the whole priestly system as set up in Christ. There is feeling, but there is also intelligence; a knowing how to get the mind of God, so that we are assured of what we are doing.
G.MacP. Does this correspond to the Lord's word, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"?
J.T. That enters into it, for He felt for humanity.
C.A.M. I suppose in that way humanity and the cross are especially seen in the gospel of Luke. The priestly bearing of the death of Christ is prominent, and humanity is represented in the malefactor. He says, "But this man has done nothing amiss", @Luke 23: 41.
J.T. I think that is right. Luke brings out the righteousness of Christ upon which priesthood is based. The malefactor and the centurion say, He is righteous; the facts also come out that He is a priest, too, because He speaks to His Father, according to Luke, and asks Him to forgive them, and then gives His reason: Because they know not what they do. That is priestly sympathy; it is compassion upon the ignorant and the erring. So that Abiathar here, I think, is illustrative of that element of the high priesthood of Christ; His feelings as a priest never shone more than when on the cross.
J.T.Jr. Would you say the Lord did not need to say of the ephod, "Bring it near", because it was always there?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord Himself calls Abiathar the high priest, in @Mark 2, but the truth was verified in Himself on the cross: as all was being recovered, the priesthood came to light.
A.F.M. What about the two hundred men who were too exhausted to go over the torrent Besor?
{222}
Was priestly consideration shown by David in their being allowed to stay by the baggage?
J.T. It shows that David himself was a priest. All that follows brings out David's sympathies, and how he established a statute and an ordinance, that those who abide with the stuff were to share alike with those who go to the battle.
R.W.S. Whom do these six hundred men represent?
J.T. Well they represent what was there pre-eminently of God as attached to Christ. He would dispose of His forces in Gethsemane, you remember; they failed Him, but still they were there. He says of the disciples, "The spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh weak". As to the two hundred men of David, it was only exhaustion that kept them back. David's statute is to bring out that side, in type, the priestly consideration that there is in the heart of Christ for those in conflict with Him. How every right thought is present and operative! What recourse there had been in the history of humanity to familiar spirits, learning, science and so on; whereas the point here is the divinely appointed way of getting light and understanding, by means of the ephod, which was the way the Lord Jesus took.
T.W.H. I would like to ask in connection with Christ's conflict in the garden: it says an angel appeared to Him from heaven strengthening Him. How does the agony passed through accord with the weeping of David?
J.T. It is all there, but, of course, this is only the shadow of that. That was the real thing. The fact that the angel strengthened Him and that He received such service was to bring out the reality of His humanity; in such circumstances He accepted what was provided by God and overcame in all those circumstances.
{223}
A.R. In conflict, one of the most difficult things is to know what to do. Do you think we lack in having the ephod and inquiring of God?
J.T. I think that is the lesson to be learned here. It is the divinely appointed way of getting the mind of God, so it is part of the priesthood; without the ephod, the priest cannot function.
G.MacP. So that all the mind of God was present in the Person of Christ on the cross.
J.T. That is right; the mind of God was there, and man was exposed. The "place of a skull" means that all man's way of finding out things has come to nothing. God's way through the priest is the appointed way.
Rem. The Jew took horizontal counsel; whereas priestly counsel is vertical. We get into trouble if God is left out of our reckonings.
A.R. In a crisis we should consider for God and the saints, and have in view the undoing of the work of the enemy.
J.H.E. Speaking of horizontal counsel. Joseph's brethren were looking one upon another.
J.T. Quite so. We do not take on divine traits if we are looking on one another in that way. We are to look on Christ, not to "lift up mine eyes unto the mountains" for "my help cometh from Jehovah".
S.P. Jehovah's word to David's enquiry concerning the troop was, "Thou shalt assuredly overtake them and shalt certainly recover" (verse 8). Then they come to the torrent, which would be something in the way, would it not?
J.T. The torrent would allude to some barrier, something impassable to persons wanting in strength, but nevertheless right with God at heart. Going on to a later part of this chapter, we find Egyptian, a man that actually belonged to the camp of the enemy, becomes a means of the enemy's undoing. That is a remarkable thing, which Romans
{224}
brings out; how that man is taken up. Man had been under the power of the enemy and in his service; but man -- as in Christ -- becomes the means of the overthrow of the enemy.
J.S. You see that in Saul of Tarsus, do you not. He was distinctly in the enemy's hand, yet through grace becomes a wonderful vessel.
A.N.W. What are you referring to in Romans?
J.T. The second half of chapter 5: sin having come in through one man, was set aside in Another, in and through whom grace abounded. And elsewhere we have, "For since by man came death, by man also resurrection of those that are dead", @1 Corinthians 15: 21. It is a principle entering into the overthrow of the enemy as seen in many instances. Here it is seen in this Egyptian, one who had been a servant of the Amalekites is used to overthrow them.
F.N.W. So that bondmen of sin become bondmen to God.
J.T. That is right. That is just how it works out. We had been bondmen of sin but are now bondmen of God, and our members instruments of righteousness. The man, you will notice, was not dead, although he was very near death. It is the Roman point of view. It is not dead in trespasses and sins; it is like the man that fell among thieves; half dead. He is still capable of resuscitation on the line of responsibility.
J.T.Jr. "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly".
J.T. Quite so; there is life as in responsibility, but without strength.
Rem. David's men gave the Egyptian the means of recovery and sustenance; they seem to take on David's sympathies in this chapter.
J.T. Quite so. It says, "they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David". That is the point. *He* is the point of recovery in every instance.
{225}
"And gave him bread". They knew what to do. It does not say David did it. They brought him to David and they gave him bread. "And he ate". He was ready for the resuscitating means. "And they gave him water to drink, and gave him a piece of fig-cake and two raisin-cakes, and he ate, and his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, for three days and three nights" (verses 11, 12). It would look as if that experience had to be gone through, but now they had means of resuscitation. He is alive enough to take in what is there.
J.H.E. Would they become intelligent as to this in crossing the torrent Besor? It states in John that the Lord crossed the torrent Kidron. Would crossing the torrent here be an appreciation of the death of Christ?
J.T. I think so. You are struck with the intelligence that enters into all this and what David's men could do for this man. They were not acting independently, not one saying, I know what to do for such a case; and another saying, I have had a little experience in medicine and can help him, as in the case of the woman who had "suffered much under many physicians" (@Mark 5: 26). Here they brought him to David, and, as David's men, they know what to do, and the Egyptian is amenable to their treatment.
Rem. This bringing to David fits in with Chronicles where Saul's brethren went to David at Ziklag.
J.T. That is a point of importance. Ziklag was a place of recovery spiritually; it is our starting point spiritually. Then we come to Hebron and Jerusalem. Ziklag was a place of great importance in view of *spoil*, the subject which is before us now. David's men knew what to do for this man, and when he was resuscitated, he showed remarkable intelligence. He
{226}
was no ordinary man, although a slave. He could give all the information needed. First of all he gives an account of himself. He was servant of an Amalekite. "I fell sick", he said; and further, "We made a raid against the south". The word "south" in the text has a technical meaning, and he used that word. "The south of the Cherethites, and against what belongs to Judah, and against the south of Caleb". You see what an intelligent man he was. This characteristic always marks the work of God in men, as in @John 9, for example.
A.C. Is it not remarkable that all this light is brought out through an Egyptian?
J.T. It is remarkable as from an Egyptian of this kind, but he is not an ordinary Egyptian.
A.C. I was wondering whether it did not correspond with what Moses wrote earlier in @Deuteronomy 23. "Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a sojourner in his land" (verse 7).
J.T. Yes; quite so; he says, "I am a young man of Egypt".
J.S. "We burned Ziklag with fire" (verse 14); as if he was fully in that thing, too.
J.T. Quite so; he was fully conversant with the object of the raid and the accomplishment of it. Then David says, "Canst thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou wilt neither put me to death nor deliver me up into the hand of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop" (verse 15). Think of the intelligence he had! He knew the Amalekites haunts, no doubt, and their ways.
A.Macd. Would he suggest one whom God had in ambush, such as you have suggested in the cases of Rahab and others?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. One could cite several instances to illustrate this principle on which God acts, using agents in the enemy's camp; they
{227}
become the means of its moral overthrow. For example: Pilate's wife; the centurion; the thief on the cross; and Rahab, to whom you referred, and the man that told the dream in the Midianitish camp. All of these are illustrative of what we see here, that if we let God have His way, He will overthrow the enemy.
S.P. Does the food the Egyptian received contribute to his intelligence? It apparently was the food that David's men ate.
J.T. No doubt. If we analyse the food: typically, the bread they gave him is Christ the Bread of life; and water, the type of the Spirit. And then they gave him a piece of a fig-cake, which alludes to the figs as they are *together*. Figs have the power of stimulation, and raisins have that, too. It is the stimulating power that comes in in spiritual unity.
W.F.K. These foods would be found in the assembly.
J.T. Quite so; David's men had them.
A.F.M. These servants of David were intelligent; they knew how far to go with the man: they brought him to David, and then resuscitated him, as you stated; henceforth it is what he is to David, and what use David makes of him. Is that not an important point for us who seek to serve?
J.T. Quite so. He says to David, "I will bring thee down to this troop" (verse 15); and verse 16 says, "he brought him down, and behold, they were spread over the whole land". He knew where they were.
G.M.W. What is the divinely appointed way that we may proceed with intelligence?
J.T. Just as here; it is the recognition of the priest, he who has the ephod. You have recourse to the priest in self-judgment to bring you into accord with what is seen here in David; thus you will really get the mind of God; no one need be in the dark.
{228}
G.MacP. The Egyptian besought that he should not be delivered to his master. Typically he had judged evil in his own heart and would not come under its power again.
J.T. You know where the evil is. The enemy, too, is dealt with where he is. It says "he brought him down, and behold, they were spread over the whole land, eating and drinking, and dancing" (verse 16). That is the situation now. It is a worldly position, and this young man knows it and brings David there.
A.R. In the conflict, there is nothing said about the four hundred men. David is doing everything. Do you think that in matters of difficulty, while certain brethren may do things, it is really a matter of what Christ is doing?
J.T. Yes; and hence the spoil, as we have said, is *David's*.
F.H.L. Is it not worthy of notice that the whole position is recovered before the thought of spoil comes in? In verse 19 we have, "David brought all back"; we get then the reference to "David's spoil".
J.T. Exactly. "And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken: and David recovered his two wives. And there was nothing missed by them neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil nor anything that they had taken: David brought all back" (verses 18, 19). That is the great general position. And then we have this remarkable statement: "And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil" (verse 20). -- He is singling out what he wants to be understood as *his* spoil.
J.H.E. Would that be something similar to: "And I have other sheep which are not of this fold", @John 10: 16.
J.T. Somewhat. The Lord would have us to understand what is His spoil; what He has achieved through the great conflict.
{229}
G.MacP. Meaning the saints?
J.T. It is just a question of our understanding what David's spoil is. Here it is, "And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle". The other cattle are distinguished; they have their place, too, but it is these particular ones. They are under control; they drove them before the other cattle. They are outstanding, and David says, "This is David's spoil".
J.S. Do you think David had in mind what there might be as sacrifice for God?
J.T. Quite so; there is variety here: "all the flocks the herds", which could be used for that. They were movable, a portable sort of spoil. They are on their own hoofs, so to say; and so we have in verse 26, "And David came to Ziklag, and he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah: to those in Bethel, and to those in south Ramoth ...". He is dealing now with persons who were his *friends*. The cattle would be ready to send on to the elders of Judah, but they are sent from Ziklag, not from the battlefield. They are sent from where the disaster took place. David is setting things up again. It is a recovered position, and henceforth would be peculiarly David's. Later we see that from this point he rose and rose in eminence until he got to Jerusalem.
S.P. Is Ziklag the administration scene now?
J.T. Yes. It is David now on the ground of victorious recovery, which is the place of the distribution of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah, to his friends. The places mentioned show where he had been: "all the places where David himself and his men went about". A peculiar kind of affection is expressed in this "present" or "blessing". It points what came out in Christ, after He is risen and
{230}
glorified in heaven, thinking of those who had shown Him affection while He was down here.
Rem. So that John the evangelist is given a very special portion, as we see in @John 21. The book of Revelation was also given to him (@Revelation 1: 1, 2).
J.T. I think it is to bring out that where there is affection and loyalty to Christ, you come in for your reward in this way. We come in for our share of the spoil.
A.F.M. These elders of Judah would specially appreciate the recovery that David had brought about. They were his confidants, and knew his mind regarding the kingdom in view of which he had suffered.
E.E.H. Do you regard Paul as presented to the assembly through Ananias as an answer to this as a type? The Lord had said, "this man is an elect vessel to me". @Acts 9: 15.
J.T. Quite so. What a present he was!
A.B.P. On the same line would you say that Levi was peculiarly Jehovah's spoil as having come out into the lead from the conflict because of the golden calf? These cattle were the ones that were in the lead in this situation. Levi came out definitely on Jehovah's side as peculiarly the Lord's spoil.
J.T. That is right; they are driven before the others.
Rem. When the Lord ascended up on high He gave gifts unto men, and these were a present to the saints.
J.T. Quite so. The twelve represented this immediately, and others followed. There were prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers (@Ephesians 4); and other gifts, as we see in @1 Corinthians 12.
Rem. The tenor of 2 Corinthians would seem to include the thought of spoil. It was written under different conditions to those of the first epistle. Paul
{231}
had something definite to present to them in the way of ministry that would build them up.
J.T. It is more positive -- the new covenant, reconciliation, and new creation.
A.N.W. Would not spoil go beyond what was lost? Spoil is something more than you lose.
J.T. I should think so. It was David's spoil first -- to call attention typically to Christ's great victory, for what he secured is far more than what was lost. It all takes character from Himself. Then it is also God's spoil.
G.MacP. The apostle brings out the fulness of the blessing which came in through Christ.
J.T. That is the idea. How varied it is! The Lord's affections are seen in it -- how David remembered the places! Take all these names, each would recall something: Bethel, Ramoth, Jattir, Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, Rachal, and "all the places where David himself and his men went about". He evidently did not omit any. The whole area that he had been accustomed to visit in his rejection was thought of. We are reminded of @Acts 1: 21 -- "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us".
W.F.K. Is David's spoil something that the Lord gets for Himself from the Supper?
J.T. That may enter into it, but I think it is more general, what He secured from the enemy; His great triumph, and what He has brought out of death.
J.W. Do the names in the end of Romans indicate spoil?
J.T. There is a connection in that. The two hundred left at the torrent would correspond with them in that David *saluted* them. "And David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and whom they had left behind at the torrent Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and
{232}
David drew near to the people and saluted them". Affectionate respect for the brethren is important. The many salutations of @Romans 16 are peculiarly in keeping with that epistle. There are twenty or more specific salutations there, besides general ones as from "all the assemblies of Christ"; and we are enjoined to salute one another with a holy kiss.
V.C. The distribution of the spoil was to the friends of the Lord; He did not seem to forget anybody. But the passage does not mention any part going to the young Egyptian. Would it tend to show that the young man was merely showing the way to the camp out of a spirit of vengeance rather than out of the spirit of loyalty to David?
J.T. He had just come into touch with David, whereas the others had supported him in his long rejection. It seems to me that if you take him as a type, he would henceforth be attached to David, who would be enough for him. If you consider yourself, for instance, secured out of the world, resuscitated and brought back to life, and let into the Lord's service well that is enough, is it not?
A.R.S. He got his life; he got food, and sustainment.
J.T. If you regard it spiritually, think of the honour of leading David to the enemies camp! Take a man like Paul; he was not looking for any spoil. Christ was all he needed. He said later, "No longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me", @Galatians 2: 20. "Thine are we, David", was Amasai's response to David's challenge, and that of his fellow captains (@1 Chronicles 12: 18). Wherever one is attached to David in his service, David becomes everything to him. It seems that Paul progressed more in this line than any.
A.R. Do you think that if we are basically right, even though we do not take active part in the conflict, the Lord will minister something to us from the spoil of the conflict?
{233}
J.T. Paul got more than any, I suppose, even though he was not one of the twelve. There are those who are not mentioned as receiving anything, but you know from the way they are presented that they are satisfied in their portion in Christ. The more you know Him the less you are thinking of reward. Jehovah said to Abraham, "I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward".
C.A.M. This Egyptian has a most remarkable write-up in this book. That he should be spoken of extensively here tonight is not to be overlooked.
J.T. Quite so. The account of him given here has been read by myriads and blessed to many undoubtedly. The Lord said of the woman who anointed Him for His burial that "wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, what this woman has done shall be also spoken of for a memorial of her", @Mark 14: 9.
S.P. Would you say something about verse 21: "they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him"? Would that suggest unity and fellowship?
J.T. I think so, the spirit of love is there. There are those who profess to make much of Christ, but disregard the brethren. But these two hundred men went out to meet the people as well as David.
J.T.Jr. David drawing near the people (verse 21), is suggestive. It is a word that is used twice in the chapter, both in relation to the ephod which Abiathar brought near to David, and would suggest bringing God in; then David drawing near the brethren would suggest love, that typically there might be no distance between Christ and us.
G.M.W. What would you say about the spirit of Belial in those that were ostensibly David's?
J.T. That is a most sorrowful side of the picture, that there should be such persons as these in David's
{234}
army, but it might be a reflection upon David's recent association, in being with the Philistines.
A.F.M. But the ordinance made was right: David made it a statute and an ordinance in Israel that everyone should have an equal share, whether abiding by the baggage or going down to the battle; and it went through, and those wicked men of Belial were silenced.
J.T. David says, "Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah has given us, who has preserved us, and given the troop that came against us into our hand. And who will hearken to you in this matter?" (verses 23, 24). That brings out the wisdom of the ruler -- a man of moral weight; he knew what to say.
{235}
SPOIL (2)
@Hebrews 7: 4; @Genesis 14: 13 - 24; @Exodus 12: 35, 36
J.T. As most are aware, our subject for these readings is *spoil*. At the first meeting we spoke of what is called David's spoil, in @1 Samuel 30. We now propose to look at *Abram's spoils*, as they are called in @Hebrews 7, referring to @Genesis 14; then to look at how the Egyptians were despoiled by Israel in leaving Egypt.
It was remarked last time that @1 Samuel 30 furnishes the most concrete example of our subject, in that a certain number of the cattle secured by David were formally called "David's spoil". The Spirit of God, in that way, furnishes us with the divine thought in our subject; David being typical of Christ. Then David sent presents or gifts from Ziklag, where the disaster had occurred, to his friends in the places in which he and his men had gone about. So that those who afford Christ shelter, accommodation, and friendliness generally, in the time of His rejection, come in for their share, as He apportions His spoil. The verse read in @Hebrews 7, in speaking of Melchisedec, to bring out his greatness, says: "Consider how great this personage was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils". It is the kind of spoil that is linked up with tithing -- tithing to the Great Priest; so that His greatness comes before us. The epistle to the Hebrews is to bring forward the greatness of the High Priest. It does not stress the priesthood of the saints. In order to understand our own priesthood, we must understand the office of Christ personally -- the kind of priesthood that is exclusive to Himself, for Melchisedec is not spoken of as having sons, as Aaron had. It is the priesthood in an exclusive way as applied to Christ, in which no one else shares. We
{236}
should be impressed with His personal greatness, which is deserving of our recognition whoever we may be. Even a great man like Abram is presented as giving to Melchisedec tithes of all.
J.C-S. In speaking of the distinction that marks Abram, were you thinking of the fact that he was said to be the "father of the faithful", and that the idea of spoil comes in under that heading?
J.T. That is right; the word "patriarch" being used, is to call attention to him in that way. All that attaches to him in the book of Genesis would enter into this. The greater Abram is, the greater Melchisedec becomes to faith, in that he tithed him. And therefore the inquiry comes up, What are these spoils, a tenth of which is given to the priest?
J.C-S. Viewing the priesthood of Melchisedec as being Christ's exclusively, as bringing out His own greatness, is very important.
J.T. Yes; God foresaw the need of that; that we should not allow our own association with Him to minimise the greatness of His Person. I think that is one of the thoughts presented in Melchisedec.
W.R. Would you say in @John 12 that Mary comes into the sense of the greatness of the Lord's Person, when she anointed Him?
J.T. Yes; she would not associate any one with Him in her mind. He would be exclusively there. If we link that scene with @Mark 14, the house of Simon the leper, it stands out all the more. There, the woman anointed His *head*. His official dignity is contemplated in Mark, I think. In John, Mary anointed His *feet*.
A.N.W. Is the link between the Lord and His people seen, as well as the distinction between them, in @Hebrews 2, as the Sanctifier and the sanctified?
J.T. Just so; the Sanctifier is not quite so great a thought as the Priest. Of course, it is the same Person,
{237}
but the Sanctifier is just the One that sanctifies; it is not a title. Melchisedec is distinctly and formally brought into this epistle as representing the exclusive greatness of Christ, leaving out all others for the moment. Abram is brought in as rendering him tithes of his spoils, to show how great Melchisedec was.
J.C-S. Thus even the Aaronic priesthood, which had an important place in the old economy and carried over into the new in a way, is overshadowed by the greatness of this Person seen in the Melchisedec order.
J.T. Yes; "consider how great this personage was". The Spirit is formally calling attention to it -- "without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually".
Ques. Is it because of what Abram represented typically that Melchisedec comes in at this point rather than in connection with Jacob or other types?
J.T. Well, I think Abram is seen in moral greatness here as one who put everything on the altar of love to rescue his brother. I suppose this is one of the most beautiful touches in Abraham's history; that he lays himself out to sacrifice everything, to contend with a great combination -- including four victorious kings; they had not only overcome the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, but a wide range of territory with its kings had previously been conquered by them. And then there were five kings in the Sodom and Gomorrah alliance which they had overcome; so that Abram was facing mighty foes. Naturally speaking, the risk was great, but he laid everything on the altar of self-sacrifice to rescue his brother, for that is the point that is made. "Abram heard that his other was taken captive" -- his *brother*, not his *nephew* here. Lot has the rank of a *brother* in the
{238}
mind of the Spirit, as reflecting what was in Abram's mind.
A.R.S. Would you connect these three hundred and eighteen men that Abram had, with Gideon's three hundred men?
J.T. Well, Abram had eighteen more, which is recorded to bring out the detail. Scripture does not deal with round numbers. Gideon's three hundred were tested to emphasise the value of negativing nature. This was to shine out in them; they thought only of the testimony. Gideon is not credited with that; it was not his own thought but Jehovah's. God knew that there were three hundred in that large number of thirty-two thousand that would shine in this way, and desired to display what *He* had. Typically they were spiritual men. It is always to be remembered that however many we may have, God knows how many there are that can be trusted, and has pleasure in bringing them out. He had also in Midian's camp two men that could convey His mind. In the midst of that numerous host there were two men who knew His mind. But here the credit belongs to Abram. The three hundred and eighteen were *trained*, born in his house; and he led them out for the conflict. All this points to the preparedness of love.
A.R.S. God brought the spiritual element to light.
J.T. Here particularly, the *trained* element comes to light. The word "trained" is connected with the word "Enoch"; an element in Genesis that runs through, marking those in the school of God.
Ques. Would it compare with the three score mighty men about the couch of Solomon -- all expert in war, fitting in with men like Titus and Timothy? They seem to be trained men.
J.T. They are experts in war. The credit is due to each of them. Here, the credit is due to Abram.
{239}
These three hundred and eighteen men were not only born in his house, but they were trained men; Abram saw to that.
J.C-S. In regard to Abram's willingness to put everything on the altar in order to recover his brother, he had prepared these men for such a service; his assurance of their ability to cope with the situation would be in the training he had given them.
J.T. Quite so; he has ready men that can help; it is always needful to have love, but then you want to *add* love to many things; so that having love you might be able to do something to make your love effectual, and I think that is what is brought out. Abram is morally great, not only as loving his brother, but also because he has what is needed for the emergency and is prepared to use it.
J.C-S. You are suggesting that that is the divine way to the acquiring of spoil?
J.T. Yes. It is to bring out love, and that it has the means of meeting the emergency. It is not beating the air; having just what is needed, you are efficient in the undertaking in hand.
A.N.W. Would you mind explaining why the patriarch, a father, is ready to fight?
T.T. I think that is because of the family link there. Lot was not Abram's son, but he was very near it. And I think the Spirit of God in using the, word "patriarch" in Hebrews clothes Abram with the glory that attaches to him in Genesis. Although much of it came in later, it is, I think, all attached to him. The word is used of David, too. It covers a peculiar glory; John, in his first epistle, presents it in himself for he speaks to the saints as his children.
A.F.M. Would you speak of skill in Abram in leading out these three hundred and eighteen men? It says "he divided himself against them by night,
{240}
he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them as far as Hobah". Would that not also add to what you were saying, that not only was there love and power in this small army, but there was military skill in Abram so that victory was obtained?
J.T. Quite so; showing that he had ability to lead. Really, skill has its root in love in the things of God. Abram is not simply a man trained in a military way, but he has love; that is really the secret. "Jehovah is a man of war" is a great thought, but the secret of it is love. Love *never* fails.
A.R.S. He smote them by night. I suppose he was in the light himself, but they were in the dark.
J.T. Quite so. He had that advantage. I think we should pursue the subject as indicating love; that Abraham is a patriarch and that the root of love is there. In the divine sense love toward the family is implied in the word; in the true sense it extends back to God. Christ says, "I am the root and off-spring of David". Genesis brings out patriarchal qualities that are of God, seen especially in Abraham.
A.R. Do "Abram's allies" support what you are saying about love? The footnote says they were "masters of covenant"; they were linked by a covenant.
J.T. They may be regarded in a typical way, I suppose. It was a fellowship. We know what they were personally, but we have this shadow of a bond of fellowship. They were masters of covenant with Abram and fought with him, and we see in the end of the chapter that he makes provision for them -- Aner, Eschol, and Mamre.
C.A.M. I think the fact that the trained servants were born in Abram's house would give a significance to the christian household; that while there is love, there is also preparedness for conflict. It might come at any time.
{241}
J.T. Yes; @Psalm 127 says, "As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth ... They shall not be ashamed when they speak with enemies in the gate". Those that are in the family relationship are trained militarily; for while we are here; we may expect opposition and conflict. All these qualities that develop in us spring out of love. Military tactics, unless they spring out of love, are merely destructive; but love will not destroy unnecessarily. All these things really spring out from God. He is a Man of war, and this is seen here in Abram.
Rem. In connection with the disposition of God in the covenant, we are told that He proclaimed, "Jehovah God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation", @Exodus 34: 6, 7. Both sides of the covenant spring from the same disposition, is that right?
J.T. Yes, you must go back to God for everything.
A.F.M. Was Peter's action in cutting off the ear of the high priest's servant the fruit of love?
J.T. It was misguided. It was not controlled by wisdom, and the Lord had to repair Peter's error. Evidently he did not understand the Lord's earlier remarks as to swords. Very often with honest intent we make mistakes and give the enemy a handle. The Lord told him to put his sword into the sheath.
Ques. Was it not just as much love on the part Paul in speaking about delivering the man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, as it was to enjoin them in the second epistle to receive him back?
{242}
J.T. Quite so; it was love in both cases.
W.F.K. Should we look at Lot as a brother in the religious organisations around, and does this instruct us how to save such?
J.T. Just so; he is called here, "Abram's brother". "Abram heard that his brother" -- that is how we must look at them. A true believer is our brother, whatever his associations; and like Abram, our efforts should be to rescue him.
E.E.H. Lot had previously separated from Abram; his love was all the more emphasised on that account.
J.T. He did not deserve it, as we might say, but love does not speak that way at all; you want to save your brother.
Rem. Abram was not governed by resentful feelings arising from the separation.
J.T. From Abram's side it was a separation to avoid a quarrel. He left the choice of position to Lot, saying to him, "We are brethren". To remain together in a state of strife would be dishonouring to them both; but Lot went beyond that: he lifted up his eyes and saw the well-watered plains of Sodom, and moved in that direction, finally reaching it, showing that the quarrel of the herdsmen really had a root in Lot. He wanted to get away from Abram; thus he became identified with Sodom, and would be so regarded in the sight of these kings; a very disgraceful thing, and that was his status in a way.
J.C.S. Love would make us free from self-consideration in such a crisis as this. Very often we take up a militant attitude in difficulties because of some personal interest. Love would free us from all that, would it not?
J.T. Abram had no personal interest in the matter. It was self-sacrifice. I think that is one of
{243}
the greatest things running through Scripture; that is, the sacrificial thought. If Christ dwells in me sacrificially, I shall be sacrificing myself; and that is the principle of Abram, he sacrificed everything, you might say. He was laying down his life for the brethren.
J.S. These servants that were born in his house and trained would know his will. How different that would be from conscription!
J.T. They would have a link with him. Every one of them would have a personal link with his master; we are taught in 2 Timothy to please Him who has called us to be soldiers -- to *please Him*. That principle would no doubt be in Abram's house.
J.C-S. They would be prepared to jeopardise their lives.
J.T. This was a very big undertaking, to pursue these five victorious kings with such a small army. It was an act of faith, but it was sacrificial. That is the point to get at; he was morally great here in laying down his life for his brother.
A.C. Do you not think that this instance was allowed that Lot might see the moral greatness of Abram; that his heart was for him notwithstanding the earlier painful experience of Lot's departure?
J.T. Quite so; he would possibly see in Abram a reflection of Christ that he had not seen before. Now he is laying down his life for him; Abram comes into the position as a type of Christ in the highest aspect. "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us", @1 John 3: 16. Perhaps Lot never understood love, nor does it seem that he was affected at this time. He evidently went back to his old setting in the world -- a very distressing thought.
J.T.Jr. Does the fact that one escapes show God's mercy in moving to rescue Lot?
{244}
J.T. I think that is right -- "one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew". Notice that it is "Abram the Hebrew"; he is not one of the ordinary people. I think the word here occurs in a distinctive sense; he is a stranger in a strange land, and yet with great power in spite of the strangership, the non-politics, the avoidance of society, and all that. He had these confederates; that is, persons who evidently valued him. We have to regard these men mentioned by name as different morally from the inhabitants of the land. They are men who are linked up in covenant with this spiritually great man. Why do they value him?
J.H.E. The man who escaped knew where to go.
J.T. Exactly. "One who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew". This is the first mention of the designation "Hebrew" in Scripture, and no doubt the meaning of the word is here. It is a spiritual allusion to Abram in this setting. It is like any one of us if we are true to our calling; we do not belong to this world. We are strangers, having left it.
J.T.Jr. The footnote says the name might be derived from Eber.
J.T. Yes; it is much debated, but I believe @Hebrews 11: 13 - 16 gives the explanation spiritually: Abram had answered to the divine call and was a stranger and sojourner on the earth. The position is amplified in Balaam's prophecy: "Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations", @Numbers 23: 9. And in all the subsequent prophecies, we have the reference to Israel's power. "There cometh a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and he shall cut in pieces the corners of Moab, and destroy all the sons of tumult" (chapter 24: 17). It is the military principle allied with separation from the world in which we have no part.
{245}
C.A.M. That is a very interesting thing; so that this power is set against all this combination of the kings of the world.
J.T. Quite so; the victorious kings were four in number, and they did great exploits before the battle of the Vale of Siddim. They conquered several nations; that is, they are in a general way world conquerors; and over against them is Abram -- one man, but having trusted allies and trained servants born in his house. The opposition seems very great, as it is today against the saints of God who are separate, but "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world". The ultimate result is complete triumph.
R.W.S. Would it be like Paul's securing spoil in Onesimus at Rome, so that he goes back to the brethren at Colosse?
J.T. Quite so. Caesar with all his legions could not make Onesimus what he was as sent back by Paul, who calls him a "beloved brother". What spoil is such a product of the gospel! A runaway slave is sent back a beloved brother, a product of heaven *via* Rome!
J.H.E. Ananias came to value Saul. He could say, "Saul, brother".
J.T. Quite so -- as rescued from the enemy's power.
J.C-S. Referring to the freedom of Abram from worldly association, do you not think that is often where we are hampered as seeking the recovery of our brother? We are often so involved in our spirits in what is earthly and worldly that we cannot rise to the occasion.
J.T. I am sure that is right. A true witness delivers souls, and that involves separation from the world, particularly from the circumstances in which the person may be, who is to be delivered.
{246}
A.F.M. Is that why Melchisedec comes out to sustain Abram returning with the spoils after the battle?
J.T. Yes; that is the thing to see, so that he should be kept on the spiritual level on which he had delivered his brother. Notice that he brought back all the property. One might ask, Why is the property before the persons? "He brought back all the property, and brought again his brother Lot and his property, and the women also, and the people". The idea of "property" here is striking; the word occurs five times in the chapter.
A.N.W. It seems to be out of the property that the spoils are forthcoming, is it not?
J.T. That is what I thought; Melchisedec brought out bread and wine to Abram and blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth. And blessed be the Most High God, who has delivered thine enemies into thine hand. And he gave him the tenth of all". He is the representative of the great divine Property-owner, the Possessor of the heavens and the earth; and yet he is ready to receive what Abram gives -- this kind of property rescued out of the enemy's hand on this principle of love. It is the *kind* of spoil that accrues to God through the self-sacrificing atoning love of Christ. It is secured by the love of Christ in that way; and the great divine Owner of everything is ready to receive that, however small.
J.C-S. Conflict in the testimony now would be productive to that end; we should really have true assembly property in that way?
J.T. Yes. Think of the water brought to David from the well at the gate of Bethlehem -- what property that was! It is that sort of thing; literally, it was water, but it was from that well, brought at such cost.
{247}
A.R. If we go through assembly conflicts with God, do we acquire such property?
J.T. That is the idea in this passage. It is spoil coming in in this way. It might be the same kind of property that ungodly people have, but it is coming this way, and God looks at it from this point of view, and accepts it.
A.N.W. Will you say a little more as to why the brother sought is not secured for God, but the property is?
J.T. I think it is a sorrowful reflection upon Lot. There is no indication that he rightly appreciated the great service rendered to him; still he was a brother for whom Christ died. We have to follow the testimony in the New Testament as to how Lot was regarded in heaven. He is called "righteous Lot". Although in Sodom, he was not a Sodomite; on the contrary, the abandoned conversation of the godless distressed him daily. Thus as recovered by Abram he must not be undervalued. But our chapter furnishes no indication that he truly valued what was done for him or that he joined with Abram in paying tithes to the Priest of the Most High God.
Rem. Verse 16 makes much of the property; first, "all the property", then Lot, and then his property; as if the property was of more value than the brother.
J.T. The light governing this, I think, is in the use of the word. It is substance, gathered or acquired. God is the Possessor of heaven and earth; these are the property of the Creator; but property secured this way, that is, through redemption and self-sacrificing love, is what is so valuable, and that is what is given to the great Priest.
Ques. Is there any point in the fact that the place whence this property was obtained is in the Canaan area? "Abram ... pursued them as far as Dan".
{248}
J.T. The pursuit and conflict have, I suppose, the character of heavenly warfare. The scenes of the victory are a very long distance from Hebron, which was the starting point -- another important point. The starting point would allude to another world, and the idea is in securing property in that connection -- love's triumphs. This section of the chapter is full of rich spiritual thoughts.
A.R. So that as having gone through a conflict, we should be different from what we were before?
J.T. I think that is the idea here. Those sharing in the victory are enhanced. Abram himself is enhanced, also Melchisedec; and the three hundred and eighteen men, and Lot, too, that is, at least, the abstract position. But what God gets from all this transaction has to be wrought out. He is to have a greater Abram as a result, and a greater Lot. I think it is taken account of in that way -- what is brought in on those lines, that is, love's sacrifice. The cross of Christ is the full thought of it, and the result of it is what is in mind here.
J.H.E. In gathering for the temple, David could give to Solomon what he had acquired in his *affliction*.
J.T. That is just the thought, and then he speaks later of his "own property". "In my affection", he says, "for the house of my God I have given of my own property". Not only did he provide in his office as king, and he provided immensely; but personal affection for "the house of my God" prompted gifts, though not so large: "three thousand talents of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver".
R.A.L. Is Abram enhanced by the fact that Melchisedec who met him was king of Salem?
J.T. The Spirit of God in Hebrews called Abraham a patriarch, as the Lord called Abiathar a high priest when he was only a young man fleeing
{249}
for his life. It is potential. Abraham is clothed in @Hebrews 7 with the fatherly glory of Genesis; and this is one of the items of it, for Lot was one of his family.
F.N.W. You were speaking recently about what is seen in these patriarchs in Genesis being recorded later by Jehovah, in the law. This thought of the tithes is later taken up in the law.
J.T. It is important to get that thought -- how the patriarchs in Genesis were honoured in that things that came out through them were incorporated in the law. The names Adam called the lower creatures God accepted; He honours man in that way. And so what these men of faith did in this sense was accepted. Jacob also proposed tithing, and, as remarked, it was made part of the law in the later books.
A.F.M. Would you regard these matters of spoil as devotional, such as Abram gave to Melchisedec, and also such as others gave? David has been brought before us, but there are others, such as Samuel, Saul, Abner, and Joab. Certain things dedicated were employed for the maintenance of the house of Jehovah. Do you regard Abram here as a pattern of the rest?
J.T. Yes. And certain Levites took care of them (@1 Chronicles 26: 26 - 28). From the wars and out of the spoils had they dedicated them; all were put in careful hands to be kept as treasures. Later, Timothy was enjoined to "keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted", @2 Timothy 1: 14. What accrues in this way is all for the house, but not to be held loosely; they are kept as treasures for the maintenance of the house of God. So I think these evidences of love that come out in Genesis correspond with and culminate in Christ; what He was on the cross. The full thought was there, but it took time to come out in detail;
{250}
in due time each feature developed and was placed in its own position; we have them set out in the ministry of the apostles. The ministry of the apostles is like the ministerial books -- Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers particularly, to segregate and put in its own setting every gem of Genesis -- and more, too, of course: but the great divine principles thus brought out are the outcome of the work of God in Genesis, brought into the ministerial books, each feature shining in its own place. So that christianity is the development of what came out in Christ: His body, the assembly, is the fulness of Christ.
A.R. And what you are saying is very interesting in that the persons with whom Abram was dealing were kings; and over against that, this great person comes before him as king of Salem?
J.T. He represents what there is on God's side. This great personage is to take on all these things, as it were -- the idea of kingship coming in on God's side, the great Creator God that possesses heaven and earth has a man like this. We get his titles; typically he is king of righteousness. Morally that is the man that is needed. Of these nine kings -- there were four and five -- not one of them was marked by righteousness; but this man is king of righteousness, and he was in their midst; also designated king of Salem, which is king of peace. But he is *first* by interpretation "king of righteousness". How essential that is to kingship!
C.A.M. Referring to what you said about the first five books of the Bible, did you say there was development afterwards in what was brought out?
J.T. That is right. Genesis bears to the ministerial books the same relation as the gospels bear to the Acts and the epistles. The Acts and the epistles take up what came out in Christ as here, including it in what He is now in heavenly glory. The Lord empowered the apostles and others for this purpose.
{251}
Having ascended up on high. He has given gifts to men.
C.A.M. Are the five books of the Psalms connected with the five books of the Pentateuch?
J.T. Yes; I think there is a link in the numeral *five*.
C.A.M. Well, I wondered whether the psalms would not be the *emotional* outcome of what we have in the early books of the Bible.
J.T. Yes, and what is experimental. @Psalm 105 is remarkable in that way. The Lord would help us on this line to see what came out in Himself. "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory", @1 Timothy 3: 16. That is the whole matter; it is the mystery of piety. That is what came out in Christ set out in detail, so as to become effective in the working out of the house of God.
J.S. So that features seen in Christ in the four gospels are set out in the apostles and their ministries.
J.T. The gospels were written comparatively late, when many of the epistles had already been written, and the work of the twelve and Paul had gone on and had been effective; the gospels were confirmatory, showing how in keeping all was with the original. But it is to be kept in mind that the testimony of the twelve did not begin properly until Christ was glorified and the Spirit was here; and Paul's testimony is the setting out of what *He is up there*, and the assembly derived from Him.
C.A.M. One thing that would be indicated in the gospels is that things are arrived at by way of conflict; I mean, connecting the line of thought we have here, we see what an immense place conflict has in securing possession of all this.
{252}
J.T. Quite so; hence the Lord says of Paul, "*I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name", @Acts 9: 16.
Rem. The Lord's statement, "I am not of the world", fits in with Abram's position here.
J.T. Quite so; the Lord tells His Father that the disciples are not of the world even as He is not of the world.
A.N.W. What the apostle Paul received from the Lord of glory, then, was not different from what the twelve ministered.
J.T. No; I think the *principle* of everything was in Christ's ministry here on earth. The principle was there and required only to be enlarged upon and to be worked out, Paul ever representing the heavenly aspect of the truth.
J.T.Jr. "All the words of this life" (@Acts 5: 20) would include everything.
J.C-S. Referring again to David and what he provided as king officially and also of his own property, would you say that the first idea would work out in the twelve, and the private property would be developed more fully in the assembly in relation to Paul's teaching?
J.T. One great principle in the twelve is authority -- to effect *subjection*. They continued stedfastly in the *apostles teaching*. It is that kind of teaching -- it is authoritative, but when we come to Paul, we are told that he remained eighteen months at Corinth teaching the *word of God*. It was not simply authoritative but the *mind of God* brought in. The idea of teaching is subservient to the thought of the word of God made effective in the saints, so that we normally come under headship.
J.S. In Corinth, things are set forth in law and order.
J.T. Well, he stressed that idea -- the idea of commandment: "Let him recognise", he says, "the
{253}
things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14: 37.
C.A.M. Do I understand that personal property such as David speaks of refers distinctively to the assembly, I mean to the ministry of Paul in connection with the assembly?
J.T. That is what seems to be the truth. Allusion was made to @1 Chronicles 29. David says, "I have prepared according to all my power for the house of my God gold for things of gold, and silver for things of silver, and brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and white marble in abundance. And moreover, in my affection for the house of my God I have given of my own property of gold and silver, for the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the house of the sanctuary: three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses; gold for things of gold, and silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work by the hands of artificers. And who is willing to offer to Jehovah this day?" (verses 2 - 5). That is a very fine statement.
W.F.K. Abram refused to take spoil from the king of Sodom. Was that wrong property?
J.T. Well, now it is segregated. The first thought is property, without saying what it was. The light is in the word, I think, and how Abram regarded it. @Hebrews 7 says he gave to Melchisedec one-tenth of the spoils, quoting what we have here: "he gave him the tenth of all". And the subsequent reference to property that he refused to take, of course, would be what belonged to the king of Sodom: but all the spoil was evidently included in what was tithed. This refusal to accept anything from the king of Sodom
{254}
is in keeping with Abram's name, "the Hebrew"; he lives with God, and derives all his resources in that way. He is a great man entirely separate from this world.
Rem. There are really two battles that Abraham fought: one against the four kings, and the other against the king of Sodom.
J.T. This was a moral victory, refusing worldly influence. He says to the king of Sodom, "That thou mayest not say, I have made Abram rich" (verse 23). He mentions his own name, Abram.
J.S. He is moving and acting true to his name.
J.T. I think so -- "great father". In view of the great parental place he was to have, this is an important victory. "For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children", @2 Corinthians 12: 14. He is true to his designation as the "Hebrew", but he is true to his own personal name, Abram. He is not going to be made rich by the king of Sodom. And another thing that comes out is what God was here. Melchisedec is said to be king of Salem, and he was priest of the Most High God; and he blessed Abram: "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth. And blessed be the Most High God, who has delivered thine enemies into thy hand" (verses 19, 20); the service of God enters into this. Exodus opens up this great subject, only in connection with Aaron; Melchisedec's priesthood is millennial, "Blessed be the Most High God", he says, "who has delivered thine enemies into thy hand".
A.R.S. What do you make of the bread and the wine that Melchisedec brought out?
J.T. I think it would be *what is needed*. I suppose taken together they represent the whole idea of meat and drink according to God. @Psalm 104 helps us as to bread that strengthens man's heart,
{255}
and wine that makes his heart glad. The heavenly man is thus maintained in independency of the world and its resources -- even though offered by one whom he has befriended.
A.R.S. The king of Sodom did not want the property; he wanted the persons. He got what he wanted, did he not?
J.T. He got Lot, alas! But nothing is said here of this. The idea of property is stressed, for it was Abram's. God's part in it is secured by Abram, and the young men's food, as was also the portion of Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. For himself, Abram would take nothing.
J.S. I think that is good, because in the profession, we see Rome in possession of a great amount of property, but nothing *real*.
J.T. Is it not characteristic of them that they want this worldly property? Whereas what Abram spoke of and what the Spirit of God refers to is property that can be tithed, that God can accept; and that must be property that we have on the principle of love's sacrifice.
Ques. Will you help us in connection with the spoils of Exodus?
J.T. Well, the thought was to show the spoliation of the world; the release of what the world has that belongs to God. God makes it a point in Exodus, that through His people this may be acquired; He went so far as to give them favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, that special spoil might be acquired; that is, we are able to take away from the world what belongs to God and put it in its own setting: for that is what is in mind in the ministerial books -- to take what is of God out of the false setting. Take the Lord's supper; it had been captivated in the world, but it has been brought back. It is one of the greatest of the spoils. We have spoiled the world in maintaining the true
{256}
thought of the Lord's supper and matters of the testimony associated with it until He come.
J.H.E. When the bread and the wine were brought forward by Melchisedec, the true priest, Abram had overcome the world and in giving His supper to the disciples, Christ says, "I have overcome the world".
J.T. Just so. The Lord's supper, I think, is one of the spoils that recovery has brought about in the last days. It is taken out of its false setting and put in the assembly, to which it rightly belongs.
C.A.M. You might take it for granted that God would take everything belonging to Himself out of the world. That must be so in an abstract way, but the remarkable thing is the way He acquires it.
J.T. Quite so; what pains He went to, the great God doing wonders for His people, that He gave them favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, by whom they were captivated, so that they might give them these things. It is not made a matter of conflict; the Israelites did not have to *fight* for these things. Notice the three things specified: utensils of silver, utensils of gold, and clothing. There is no conflict, for Israel at that stage was not ready for war.
J.C-S. But what thy obtain from Egypt really becomes assembly property.
J.T. That is right. It is taken away from the Egyptians and entrusted with the Israelites.
Rem. The gospel preaching would depend upon favour given of God.
J.T. If God will not give you favour in men's eyes, they will not listen to you.
A.N.W. Does this material finally find its place in the tabernacle system?
J.T. That is right. As you follow the line of the truth that is given it will be seen that God had that in mind. It says, "And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they
{257}
had asked of the Egyptians utensils of silver, and utensils of gold, and clothing" (verse 35). Notice the word "utensils" in the New Translation. It is not merely silver and gold, but in *usable* form; in other words, it would be persons who are the subjects of the work of God, taken over in usable form.
J.S. As we see in Saul. He is a "chosen vessel unto me". And the fact that utensils of silver are mentioned first, would suggest that the spoil is recovered on the ground of redemption?
J.T. Just so.
C.A.M. That is a very noticeable thing -- Saul's being given as a vessel to the saints at Damascus.
J.T. So all converts, you might say, in the gospels or the Acts are utensils; they are for use, it is not simply that they are saved.
A.N.W. Cornelius would look well as transferred from where he was, into the assembly!
J.T. The Holy Spirit takes him on. As they were listening, He fell upon Cornelius and those with him. They were thus ready for use.
J.H.E. Could we not apply this to our children as coming into fellowship?
J.T. Yes; in the sense that they are utensils; not simply raw material, but already usable. Take the jailer at Philippi, he was ready to serve immediately. He laid the table and entertained the Lord's servants at once.
W.B-w. I was wondering whether the property that Barnabas sold, the proceeds of which he laid at the apostles feet, would link on with this. The money was in usable form.
J.T. Quite so; he receives honourable mention on account of it. He was a "son of consolation", a man that could be utilised. He knew the kind of service that was needed at the moment. And the fact that he laid it at the apostles feet shows that
{258}
it was a love matter -- now at the disposal of those who represented Christ.
A.R. Would you think that all of us here this afternoon represent the spoiling of the Egyptians?
J.T. I think so. I think every one of us represents spoil carried over.
C.A.M. The world would gladly retain us.
J.T. They would be glad to *have* you if you would stay on *their* terms.
W.B-w. Referring to our previous reading, @1 Samuel 30, what is meant by some cattle driven before others as "David's spoil"? I was wondering whether they might refer to the assembly's coming in before Israel.
J.T. That is a good suggestion; evidently they were distinctive. David's stamp, as it were, was on them.
A.R. Does this idea of utensils of silver, as applying to one leaving the world, suggest that I recognise the rights of Christ over me?
J.T. That would be the thought -- redemptive rights.
A.R. And what is the gold?
J.T. I think it would be any Christian, as representative of what is of God, material for "the assembly of God". One has seen men held in business associations having manifest qualifications for the assembly and has wished to see them completely delivered. As we pray for such, God gives them to us.
R.A.L. What about the clothing?
J.T. It is dress or covering, marking external characteristics. Features of Christ in this sense may be seen in persons linked with the world. They adorn the world, but belong to the assembly. It is the idea of clothing in a wrong setting; it should not be there. You want it to be where it
{259}
should be. In this way, when the assembly is taken away, the world will be greatly impoverished.
W.R. Would you say the secret of the development of all this was attending to the things spoken by Moses as in @Exodus 12: 35?
J.T. It is the moral element of obedience here. The children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses.
A.R. The world really little understands how wealthy it is in having Christians in it.
J.T. It values them, if it can get them on its own terms, but God says, They are mine, and He makes it easier, so to speak, for us to obtain the utensils from the Egyptians, by giving us favour in their eyes.
W.B-w. It says in verse 39 that the children of Israel "were driven out of Egypt".
J.T. You do not want to leave anything of God *there*.
{260}
SPOIL (3)
@Numbers 31: 1 - 12, 21 - 30, 48 - 54
J.T. We began the consideration of our subject, which is "Spoil", by reading @1 Samuel 30, which represents in a general way the subject before us, that is, David's, or Christ's, spoil; some of it being shared with those who had befriended David in his rejection and sufferings. And then we looked at Abraham's spoil, as alluded to in @Hebrews 7, but in greater detail in @Genesis 14. There we saw that the spoil was contributory to the priest, that is, Melchisedec; not now shared with those who are friendly to Christ in His rejection, but one-tenth offered to Him as Priest, involving His Person -- who He is; and allied with that, we read from Exodus about the spoil that Israel obtained from the Egyptians, demanding it from them as they went out of Egypt, which later became contributory to the tabernacle. All these were preliminary features belonging typically to the early history of the assembly.
Now we have come to a chapter that treats of spoil obtained by conflict arising through evil alliances formed by the people of God; that is, Israel coming under the pernicious influence of the teaching of Balaam, who for reward, and at the request of the king of Moab, sought to curse Israel, but God turned it into blessing. Then Balaam taught Israel through Balak to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication, that is, by forming evil alliances with the world (see @Revelation 2). So, as we have read, the conflict between Israel and Midian arose at the direction of Jehovah. God would avenge Himself and would have the children of Israel avenge themselves, upon the Midianites. Now it is for us to arrive at an understanding of what
{261}
the spoil referred to here means, what its antitype is; and in doing so we should be governed in our thoughts by the preceding chapters; that is, the effort of Balaam, which is brought forward into the New Testament and seen as developed in a certain system of great antiquity in the history of Christianity; and through it real Christians have been drawn under the influence of the world. As the Lord forewarned: "Woe to the world because of offences!" @Matthew 18: 7. This system has been an offence; that is, in influencing the people of God to stumble and to affiliate themselves with the world. After chapter 25, where this evil was dealt with by Phinehas and by the destruction of many Israelites, God opens up the great truth of the inheritance and those who should inherit; and then the sacrifices are outlined in chapters 28 and 29, and the vow in chapter 30; and then this chapter, which is very significant as contemplating the end of the journey through the wilderness. At the end of this conflict Moses is about to die. The chapter, therefore, is to be understood in the light of the culminating history of the assembly and its results in spoil for God, for the Levites, and for the sanctuary.
C.A.M. Does this section allude to the latter part of church history?
J.T. That is what I thought.
C.A.M. Would it be right in that connection to look at such chapters as 28 and 29, where it speaks of all the offerings, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly, as the divine thought that these offerings should be observed all down the present era?
J.T. I think the richness of the chapters that intervene between chapter 25 and this one, brings out what has been recovered in the revival of the last days; that is, the thought of the inheritance in chapter 26; the daughters of Zelophehad claiming it as those who value it in chapter 27, and then in
{262}
chapters 28 and 29, as you say, the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly offerings; so that God is fully responded to. Then in chapter 30 we have the principle of the vow -- that whatever one commits oneself to, as subject to the Lord, He does not forbid; hence it stands; this would enter into the conditions surrounding the Lord's supper. The relation of the assembly to Christ is fixed as the Lord's supper is taken up and understood. Then this chapter brings out the conflict against this awful influence of worldly associations, corrupting the whole system -- the whole body -- the deliverance from that, and the spoils that result.
Ques. Where does chapter 19 come in -- the red heifer and the water of purification -- does it connect with this spoil?
J.T. That belongs to another section, which would embrace the red heifer in chapter 19, the smiting of the rock in chapter 20, and the brazen serpent in chapter 21. The teaching of those chapters completes that section. Balaam's attack begins a new section which finishes in this chapter, but of course the whole teaching of the book is constructive and enters into what we are now considering.
Ques. The reason I raised the question is, that in this chapter there is a reference to anyone who had touched a dead person. Does the application of the ashes and the water of purification have any reference to spoil in this setting?
J.T. The teaching of chapter 19 would apply in that sense, of course. It is well, however, to see that the attack of Balaam is a new movement, and it finishes in this chapter; so that we have a new generation in chapter 26. The old is terminated in chapter 21; the Spirit succeeds the flesh, and we have a new generation; all of the old had died away except Caleb and Joshua. Israel is now on the banks of the Jordan at Jericho, and the wilderness
{263}
is ended. Moses is about to die also, after this conflict has taken place; hence they are seen as ready to enter Canaan.
R.W.S. Peter, in his second epistle, speaks of the *path* of Balaam; Jude speaks of his *error*; and John in the word to Pergamos, speaks of his *doctrine*. Would that fit in particularly at the end of the dispensation?
J.T. I think it does.
A.R.S. Would Balaam being slain here be an example of: "If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy", @1 Corinthians 3: 17?
J.T. That is, a good reference. Balaam was a corruptor; it is a very solemn word.
A.B.P. Would you say that Jude's reference to the *way* of Cain, the *error* of Balaam, and the *gainsaying* of Core, would represent the whole moral history of the rival system?
J.T. I think that is right. All these references help as to the evil that enters into these chapters, the kind of thing that results from affiliating with the world and refusing to break with it. It is the evil we are liable to get into and the influence we come under.
A.N.W. Is that coupled also with the reason why the method of Balaam's slaying is given here? There are many slayings found in Scripture, but it does not always say how they are effected, but here it is definitely stated that Balaam was slain by the *sword*. Is there a reason for that?
J.T. The Lord says to Pergamos, where the doctrine of Balaam was held by some, "I will make war with them with the sword of my mouth", @Revelation 2: 16. Then to Thyatira: "These things says the Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass", (chapter 2: 18). It is also said earlier, "out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth", (chapter 1: 16). The
{264}
Son of God is jealous over the house of God. He is over that house as Son, and the teaching of Balaam, working up to the teaching of Jezebel, disputes the rights of the Lord in the house of God; what is needed to deal with them is the sword -- the word of God which is sharper than any two-edged sword. That would perhaps help as to the use of the sword against Balaam. What do you say?
A.N.W. Yes; I have noticed recently the power with which matters are dealt with as the word is used by the Spirit. To bring in divine principles according to the word has a wonderful effect in dealing with matters in our care meetings.
J.T. You feel it is the only weapon with which to deal with the sort of opposition presented here, because Balaam's opposition is akin to what is said in Ephesians: "... principalities ... authorities ... spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies" (chapter 6: 12); that is, Balaam's doctrine was a secret thing at first. And then it goes on to speak of the "sword of the Spirit, which is God's word", (chapter 6: 17). That is what is needed against these dark influences.
W.R. Paul says: "Take heed therefore to yourselves ... For *I* know this, that there will come in amongst you after my departure grievous wolves, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves shall rise up men speaking perverted things ... And now I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and give to you an inheritance among all the sanctified", @Acts 20: 28 - 33. Does that not help us?
J.T. It helps us in a positive way. It is able to build us up, but the side we are at is negative, dealing with evil. The character of evil is what is hidden at first. It is remarkably characterised by being concealed; it was Balaam's pretension to be entirely on Jehovah's side, when, in truth, he was
{265}
looking to be paid by the enemy as the reward of secret unrighteousness.
J.T.Jr. Was it the power of the word that brought Ananias to death? "And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired", @Acts 5: 5.
J.T. I think that is the idea. It reminds us of the resources that we have in adhering to, and employing, the word.
A.F.M. As you were saying, this movement of Balaam's was secret; Israel were entirely ignorant of the tremendous forces of evil that were against them, as set forth in Balaam and Balak. Is that what is in your mind?
J.T. Yes; Israel were not aware of what was current on high between these persons of the "upper world" as you might call it; but now they are aware, and they are dealing with Balaam hand to hand.
J.S. Is it like the leaven the woman placed in the three measures of meal until the whole was leavened?
J.T. Quite so; it is most difficult when we have hidden feelings with which to deal.
E.P. Would it correspond with "overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ", @2 Corinthians 10: 5?
J.T. I think that is what is meant, having in readiness to avenge all disobedience. The apostle had the means of immediately dealing with all disobedience.
E.P. Avenging Israel upon the Midianites was the last service Moses rendered. Afterwards he was to be gathered unto his people (verse 2). Would the element of authority remain in force here?
J.T. Yes; I think it shows what the Lord has been doing in relation to recovery, so that we
{266}
recognise the *Lord's* day and the *Lord's* supper, which stand together. John says in @Revelation 1: 10, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day"; indicating the right of way, the Lord had, and has, in dealing with these matters. Moses death, being foretold here, by Jehovah as soon as this matter of the Midianites was settled, makes way for another ministry -- a spiritual order of things in Joshua.
A.R. In His word to Pergamos, the Lord says, "where the throne of Satan is"; and later He says, "where Satan dwells", @Revelation 2: 13. Is Jehovah, in the chapter we read, about to break up Satan's power and release the saints to go into purpose?
J.T. I think that would point to the hierarchical system, which is marked by regal splendour, Satan having his part in it. There is the idea of a throne, a crown, royal splendour, and the like, attaching to the hierarchical system alluded to in Pergamos; that is the beginning of it. Satan's throne was there.
A.R.S. I notice there is no direct leader in this conflict. Jehovah tells Moses to avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites, and then Moses tells the people to take twelve thousand men out of the tribes of Israel; in other words, this victory seems to be the result of the word of Jehovah.
J.T. That is right. It is not to *select* soldiers, but *arm* them. Moses spoke to the people saying, "Arm from amongst you men for military service" (verse 3). That is, strength lies in the armour, or the military equipment. Christians are to be armed, as we have been saying, with the sword of the Spirit, as a weapon of offence and of defence, but with the armour, too. "Arm yourselves" would mean full military equipment and training; so that success lies in each soldier being himself armed, as seen in Ephesians, rather than in military leadership: The leadership was really in Phinehas; that is, it was
{267}
a priestly matter, as you will observe; hence, "Moses spoke to the people saying. Arm from amongst you men for military service, that they go against Midian to execute Jehovah's vengeance upon Midian. Of every tribe a thousand, of all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. And there were levied out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand by tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand by the tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, and the holy instruments, even the alarm-trumpets in his hand" (verses 3 - 6). That is the spiritual combination that met this situation. It was not simply great military leadership, but each person armed; because it was a personal matter waged between persons.
A.F.M. Phinehas was he who smote the man and the woman with the javelin in holy zeal for Jehovah; on account of this he was qualified to go forth as a priest with these holy instruments, giving character to the whole war, would you say?
J.T. Quite so; it was a divine matter. In these last days we have come back, through grace, to Ephesian days, in principle; the saints, learning warfare and moving together, each equipped in a military sense, they recognise *the whole nation*; that it is not a party matter. The denominations, so called, are partisan in principle, whereas it is the whole nation that is in mind here -- one thousand out of each tribe. That means the whole nation -- "one body and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all", @Ephesians 4: 4 - 6. What a conflict! It is in Ephesian character, and is in perfect unity.
A.R. In chapter 25 where the breakdown occurred, Phinehas appeared to be the only person that was armed; whereas, here, every man was to be armed.
{268}
J.T. That is the point that Moses makes: "Arm from amongst you men"; that is, one thousand men from each tribe were armed.
Ques. Is that not on the principle of selection -- one thousand from each tribe, as to whether those thousands would be able to meet the Midianites?
J.T. Well, each tribe would be, as it were, under obligation to produce this thousand; because the word is, "Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm from amongst you men". It is not volunteers. Each tribe is to look after this matter, so that the whole body is brought into it; as we might say, the whole assembly.
J.S. Twelve thousand was not much of an army, but they are very effective here.
J.T. That is the idea. It was the *quality*; they were well armed.
J.T.Jr. Is there a present answer in the thought of the tribes today -- each locality working this matter out in warfare, producing its thousand?
J.T. That is right; normally we would act in relation to the whole twelve tribes; not in any partisan way.
A.R.S. Does this correspond with Ephesians: "Take to you the panoply of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having accomplished all things, to stand" (chapter 6: 13)?
J.T. Yes, that is right.
A.B.P. If conflict should arise in New Zealand or in England, should there be the "thousand" in each company there, and in America, too?
J.T. I think so in principle. The matter is ours, and that saves us from sectional feeling. Other principles would help us to leave with those near by the immediate settlement and judgment, but the exercise belongs to us as well as to them. I think that is important.
{269}
Ques. It is clearly a priestly matter, is it not, inasmuch as Phinehas uses the holy instruments?
J.T. Well, it rose to that; first, it is one thousand out of each tribe, and then, "them and Phinehas". He gives character to the war, because he had the holy instruments, meaning that he was to sound them when they went forth to war. They were for the purpose of sounding an alarm, and he did it with "holy instruments ... in his hand" (verse 6); that is, the priestly element, in the war, sounds out the alarm; it indicates where the attack is. It is a question of the priestly element discerning where the real attack is.
E.P. Would a meeting for prophetic ministry come in in this connection? I was thinking of @1 Corinthians 14; how Paul would urge them with regard to a prophetic word in their own midst.
J.T. That is really what such meetings are intended to be; to call attention to what is current in a prophetic way, and what is needed in matters of emergency -- how we are to meet things.
C.A.M. The allusion to Ephesians seems to be a wonderful thing. We might have thought from @Acts 20 that the great truth of all God's thoughts might have faded or become dim, but to link the wonderful meaning of that epistle with the position here, shows that all the blessed truth of the beginning is known and confirmed at the end, do you not think?
J.T. I think it will help us if we see this: that it is at the end of Moses ministry that the spoil is brought, as it says in verses 11 and 12: "And they took all the booty, and all the prey, of man and of cattle; and they brought to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the children of Israel, the captives and the prey and the booty, to the camp in the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan of Jericho", @Numbers 31: 12.
{270}
That is the end of the wilderness, and I think it is well to notice that position. The spoil at this point is all brought in full recognition of the authority of Christ and His priesthood, and also of the assembly.
C.A.M. So we should really awaken to the greatness of it all now. Those alarm trumpets were like the word in Ephesians exhorting us to awake.
J.T. That is right -- *awake*. The allusion there is to @Isaiah 60: "Arise, shine! for thy light is come"; it is really like an alarm-blast. Similar expressions are found much in Isaiah, and it is a very important thing as applied to what is current; because so many of our brethren -- no doubt all of us -- are inclined to be sleepy about these matters. We should be awake to the apprehension that there is such a thing as the assembly, that we can move in the light of it, enjoy it, and reap the spoils of conflict for it as they did at the beginning.
A.F.M. What is the character of this spoil? It appears that the men of Midian were all slain and that the spoil was made up of women and children.
J.T. The slaying of the males, and the names of the kings being given would be, I think, the destruction and overthrow, in principle -- not, of course, literally in the antitype -- of the intellectual side that has been used to bring about all this corruption. That is what is meant, I think; first, the kings and Balaam -- the great corrupter. As has been remarked, "If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy". Let us not forget that. There are five kings mentioned by name who are destroyed; and the women are segregated by priestly discrimination -- some are to be destroyed but those that are uncontaminated are to be preserved; alluding, I think, to what is subjectively of God. That is what is meant. That which caused the corruption is destroyed, but the uncontaminated are
{271}
preserved. That would mean the work of God, however obscurely it may appear. They represent the subjective thing -- what is living and pure, as it were, the work of God, and of these there were a goodly number, some thirty-two thousand. Jehovah got some as His offering and some went to the Levites, too; so that there is a disposition of these "human persons", which is very striking. They are referred to along with the live-stock; the sheep, the oxen, and the asses are referred to, and then it says "human persons". They are all included in the spoil.
J.S. Does that show how discriminating God is in His judgment?
J.T. I think that has a bearing on our care meetings and what flows out from them -- the need of priestly discernment as to what is of real value in the spoil, as to whether it is really characteristically immune and free from contamination.
J.S. And then bringing all the spoil to the Jordan at Jericho is a remarkable expression. Would that be in view of preparation for the advance on Jericho?
J.T. Quite so; you feel you are ready to go into Canaan after that battle, because there is nothing but what is of God left. All is purified, as in verse 21, where Eleazar speaks directly to the people saying, "This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses. Only the gold, and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin, and the lead, everything that passeth through the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean; only it shall be purified with the water of separation; and everything that cannot pass through the fire ye shall make go through the water. And ye shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterwards ye may come into the camp" (verses 21 - 24). That is the purifying process. It refers to the death of Christ; all is brought through
{272}
in that way -- all the inanimate things such as materials and metals, but the living things -- the live stock and the persons -- are viewed differently, as representing the work of God; their selection is carefully made. All that had to do with corruption is destroyed; and only what is pure is left.
A.R. Does this correspond with the burning bush that Moses saw? It burned, but was not consumed. The people are about to go into the land as going through the fire.
J.T. That is the principle. The Old Testament closes with that thought; what comes through to this dispensation. The Lord sits as a refiner; the thing goes through fire. He does not bring into the new dispensation anything but what is suitable.
A.F.M. What about the garments and skins? It was necessary that they should be purified by the water of separation.
J.T. It is really the same as the fire in principle. They cannot go through fire, but the death of Christ is applied either way, whether it, be the fire or the water.
Ques. Is the apostle's ministry to the saints at Corinth analogous to bringing Israel to Jericho?
J.T. That is the principle of the two epistles. Everything must be dealt with. If there are things amongst us that may not have been dealt with as yet, we are to have a readiness to deal with them. Paul was going to the full limit in dealing with evil at Corinth. That is the word in this chapter.
Ques. Would it link on with the apostle's ministry in chapter 5, where the instruction he gives them is that they should act for themselves? Moses got divine instructions, but Eleazar speaks to the people. They are acting from what is within themselves. Is that right?
J.T. That is the idea -- "put away from among yourselves". The authoritative side is stressed in
{273}
1 Corinthians @5: "(ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ) ... to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan" (verses 4, 5). That is authoritative, but at the end of the chapter, he says, "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves" (verse 13). He would say, *You* do that *yourselves*; you must not allow wickedness amongst you. And so here, Eleazar of himself says in verse 21: "This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses". He puts responsibility on them to cause them to pass the things through the fire and the water.
R.W.S. How is this sinister thing to be recognised?
J.T. It is a question of priestly discernment. It says, "And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the assembly went forth to meet them outside the camp. And Moses was wroth with the officers of the army" (verses 13, 14). He was wroth because they had not discerned this defiling element. They had saved it alive; the leaders of the army were not true, and it needed the priestly element in Eleazar to deal with the situation.
A.F.M. Phinehas does not seem to come into this particular part of the exercise, although he led in the battle in a spiritual sense; but Eleazar seems to feel the thing and speak of it for God.
J.T. Yes, and the captains of the thousands, and the captains of the hundreds, in verse 14, have come under Moses severe disapproval because they were not discriminative.
A.B.P. Do you think the number of difficulties that have arisen in the past few years in divers localities have been the means in the Lord's hand of bringing about this purifying?
J.T. That is what it is; Eleazar is bringing things through the fire; and any resistance to that is interference with this process which is so essential in
{274}
order that the fellowship should be free from what defiles.
A.R. Does it show that as military men, we are to be prepared to slay, and that by the exercise of priestly discernment we discriminate? Is there not a danger in conflict, if we are not priestly in it, to show grace and save persons without regard to the contamination, whereas principles must govern us?
J.T. That is what Moses insists on; so only those that were immune from the contamination were preserved. Persons linked on with worldly associations are not admissible into the fellowship; that is what is meant. All evil is to be unsparingly judged. I believe the women that were saved represent the element of the work of God, the subjective side, so that what was in themselves in principle was to be pure. What is of God must be true and pure.
A.F.M. The necessity for door-keeping is emphasised. There may be those who have come in with whom there is what is questionable, and we are to be on our guard so as to exclude the elements of the world.
J.T. That is what is meant in verses 21 to 24; and then we have the counting up of the spoil, enormous spoil, in verses 25 to 47. The spoil is segregated, and counted, and divided. The military have half and the people have half -- that is, all the saints are brought into it -- those that remain at home as well as those that go to war. David made this a statute later on. It is inaugurated here by Moses, under God. Then the people furnish a tithe to the Levites -- one out of fifty; whereas the military furnish a tithe to Jehovah directly -- one out of five hundred. Our minds have to come into all this thing spiritually, for we cannot be unintelligent spiritually if we are to understand this chapter. The application of it antitypically discloses what
{275}
God is doing today; what He is securing as salvage out of the ruin of christendom, and how carefully He is counting it and requiring His own portion out of it; and then the levites -- those who serve Him -- have their portion, too. Then finally, the officers come forward voluntarily and offer for the sanctuary. We cannot be indifferent or apathetic if we are to understand this matter, for we have to learn to count; to become mathematical so as to recognise what belongs to God, to the servants, and to the sanctuary from all this spoil.
Rem. It is on a percentage basis. There is no more required from one than one has. It is about one-fifth of one per cent.
J.T. That is right. As his portion, Jehovah gets one-fifth of one per cent, whereas the Levites get two per cent.
C.A.M. The military men would seem to be at an advantage. They are the nearest to God in connection with the results.
J.T. They get half of the spoil -- having been to the war -- and the people get the other half.
C.A.M. So it is of great advantage and benefit to suffer for the things of God; it is thus a privilege to be military. Is that not it?
J.T. Indeed. How important to be on the alert in dealing with the things of God; these things should not pass through as if they are nothing to us, but it should come into our hearts and minds as to what all this means mathematically. God's portion enters into it, and the portion of the levites also, as well as the assembly, for the assembly gets half. We want to understand this great result and see that we come into it.
F.H.L. What the captains offered is excess. They had learned righteousness, had they not?
J.T. You will notice it says in verse 53: "The men of war had taken spoil each one for himself".
{276}
This is an inside matter and seems to be an additional feature. Each man had taken for himself jewellery, because ornamentation is a great feature with Midian; that is, they have taken on the things of God. Rome has taken on, as ornaments, almost every spiritual term belonging to the assembly. It arrogates to itself and claims almost everything; and so does the Anglican Church, and the denominations, more or less. They ornament themselves with what is of God. I think that is the thing the captains have in mind. Each one has taken for himself, and now they give of their own volition and offer an atonement for their souls. They are therefore concerned about their souls, for Jehovah had preserved them in the conflict.
A.F.M. How does jewellery enter into the thought of offering of this spoil "to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah"?
J.T. Let us read what was said of it: "And the officers who were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses, and they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who were under our hand, and there is not one man of us lacking. So we present the offering of Jehovah, that which each one hath found, jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, all manner of wrought jewels. And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered to Jehovah was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds. (The men of war had taken spoil each one for himself.) And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the
{277}
children of Israel before Jehovah" (verses 48 - 54). That is for the sanctuary; that is, for Jehovah Himself. He gets from the military, as we heard, one-fifth of one per cent of their share of the spoil. The Levites get from the assembly two per cent of the other half. The captains offer what they obtained, each one, in the way of jewellery, to atone for his soul. These men want to be right. They are not living in their military achievements; they want to be right with God, and so offer to make atonement for their souls.
C.A.M. I can understand Paul speaking to Timothy in this way: "Give heed to thyself and to the teaching; continue in them; for, doing this, thou shalt save ... thyself", @1 Timothy 4: 16. Your soul is actually involved in the thing -- the whole person.
J.T. That is important; especially among leading brethren who have done something, lest they might be living in what they are doing, or in what they have done. The *soul* is to be looked after, and these men are concerned about that.
J.T.Jr. Was Luther's recovery of the truth of justification like some of this jewellery?
J.T. I think so; the jewellery would suggest ornamentation in assembly features. Ornamentation according to God is connected with Jerusalem and with the assembly.
A.F.M. Do you not think there has been a great lack amongst us, that in conflicts through which we have passed, we have failed to consider for God? We should have it on our consciences to see that God gets His part in the spoil. That would be very pleasing to Him to see the result in praise of what He had started Himself. Is not that what we should be exercised about today?
J.T. I think so. I think the Lord is helping us on those lines; first, to make provision for God,
{278}
then for the levites, and then this voluntary provision -- the ornamentation, as the gold and the jewellery; and the soul brought into it; so that our souls are right with God.
A.N.W. "For our souls before Jehovah", is a remarkable statement.
J.T. Many of us may be serving and doing things, and the brethren are talking about us. You may be sure those military men would be talked about in Israel; they would be the subject of conversation, but they are concerned about their own souls. We are not to be living in what we are doing -- preaching, converts, and the like -- but to get right in our souls. "Give heed to thyself" (@1 Timothy 4: 16), says the apostle, as has already been referred to.
A.R. Taking the ornaments as spoil refers to what is external; whereas keeping the soul right with God is an internal matter.
J.T. Quite so; what you are before God -- "for our souls before Jehovah".
Ques. Paul wrote to Timothy, "Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No one going as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who has enlisted him as a soldier", @2 Timothy 2: 3, 4. Do you think that it was on this line that Paul sent Timothy to Corinth?
J.T. I think so. He was a trustworthy man. He was pleasing to the Lord; here it is being right before God in our souls in all this, however great our exploits.
J.S. In @Luke 10, the seventy returned with great joy that the demons were subject to them through the Lord's name. But He said, "in this rejoice not, ... but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens". I suppose it would really be something for their souls.
{279}
A.N.W. The voluntary spoil is brought into the tent of meeting as a memorial before Jehovah.
J.T. And it is a memorial for the children of Israel. It is for their benefit -- a memorial for them.
A.B.P. In each of the three parables in @Luke 15 the one who enters into the blessing has been in nominal relationship, but has been conscious of being lost. Does that link on with this matter of concern about the soul?
J.T. Just so. No one ever really enjoys salvation who has not accepted the fact that he was lost and is found. The sense of having been lost and found is enjoyment -- "my son ... was lost and has been found" (@Luke 15: 24); that is the son's enjoyment. The father can speak of him in that way. The son was dead and is alive, and he was lost and is found. It is a question of the state of the person.
J.S. Angels will never be able to enter into that.
R.W.S. Gideon, who speaks of being the least of his father's house, overthrew Midian, killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took great spoil in earrings, garments, and ornaments. Would that be parallel with the scripture we are considering?
J.T. Yes; only think of the miserable use Gideon made of them! That is the sorrowful side, that he made an ephod out of them and it incited idolatry in Israel. It was also a snare to Gideon and to his house. It gives us a clue to what Midian was. Gideon took the moons from their camels necks. They had a showy religion allied with the world. All the world's distinctions are matched in the so-called public body.
E.P. Do you think these military men of our chapter had shepherds hearts? They had regard for the men that were under their hand, saying, "there is not one man of us lacking".
J.T. I was thinking of that. It was a great matter, that there were no losses or casualties.
{280}
Ques. The men had taken spoil, each one for himself. Not one was lacking, and all had spoil. In every conflict, is it not really what God finally gets out of it that counts?
J.T. That is important. I think those military men are outstanding as being right with God. Achan also took spoil for himself, but hid it. He would use it for his own ends at Jericho. These men took spoil each one for himself; it was an individual matter. Any combatant might have kept it; it was his own affair; but these men were upright, transparent men, and wanted to enrich the assembly, and to be right in their own souls before God.
J.S. Does the end of the chapter show how the whole assembly was greatly enriched by what the captains took?
J.T. Yes. It is one of the best things we can get hold of today; because God is helping in service, and many are coming forward to share in these exploits; so that you get individual things in result. But what are we doing with them? Are we making them a common matter with the brethren, in the enlargement of things amongst us?
A.F.M. An example of this was seen in these men; the gold, as part of the spoil taken and presented to Jehovah, became a memorial for the children of Israel before Him.
J.T. I think what should be stressed, is the need for transparency and openness, especially in those who serve, that they are really set for the enlargement and prosperity of the assembly. What I have is not for myself alone; it becomes a question of what accrues to the assembly out of what we get in the way of spoil.
E.P. Paul says, "Wherefore I beseech you not to faint through my tribulations for you, which is your glory", @Ephesians 3: 13. The apostle's tribulation became their glory.
{281}
J.T. Quite so. He said "all things are for your sakes". The greatest servant was thinking of the brethren -- "death works in us, but life in you". @2 Corinthians 4: 12.
J.T.Jr. These captains made a mistake in the beginning in not going the whole way, and now they are settling the matter by making atonement for their souls publicly.
J.T. Quite so; they made a mistake in saving so many alive who would bring in corruption. Now they are specially concerned to be right in their souls before Jehovah.
W.F.K. Each captain is offering what he has found himself. Would that mean he would not interfere in another's service? He offers what he finds himself.
J.T. I think it is the individual side here -- what the man is; open, honest, and transparent, thinking of the welfare of the whole. They are not acting in a body; but each for himself, and yet they are acting together. Each had spoil for himself, and is bringing it out, not concealing it like Achan had done.
J.S. Jehovah was justified in His selection of the thousand from each tribe.
A.R. When Paul says, "all are yours", does he mean to convey that the gift was for everybody, not for him?
J.T. Quite so; he gladly shared with the saints what was common to him and them; whilst many may make mistakes, as these captains did, adjustment went on. If we are honest and open, everything will be adjusted, and our souls will be cared for.
F.N.W. Would you say these men were prepared not to settle back on the abstract work of God following on the conflict?
J.T. Quite so. They were actively in exercise, and furthermore, they had shepherd feelings; they
{282}
said "there is not one man of us lacking". They had care for one another, but each had taken spoil. They had their share in the *general* spoil, but there was also what was over and above that. The whole twelve thousand had their share, too, but these were *leaders*. They had something special, and they brought it forward, and put themselves right with God, and the assembly gained through it.
A.B.P. Does the footnote on the word "corban" in relation to the offering (verse 50), suggest that it is something on which there is no *legal* requirement, but it is a freewill offering on the basis of gift?
J.T. That is good. It is voluntary -- the result of spiritual sensitiveness as to what is due to God.
A.N.W. Would you say a word or two more about the thought of ornamentation in this offering? Where does that come in in relation to the tent of meeting?
J.T. Well, ornaments are for beauty and display, but when the thought of offering is introduced, it becomes a question of the weight of gold employed. They are golden jewels. It says: "And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, all manner of wrought jewels. And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered to Jehovah was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds" (verses 51, 52). That is, they did not take the ornaments as they were and use them. It was a question of what they were essentially; because they were to be made adaptable to the divine system, and set up in the assembly as enriching the service of God.
A.F.M. Would you say a hymn composed by a Christian in system, if corrected appropriately, could be used for the service of the assembly?
J.T. That is a good illustration. There might be something in the hymn that would make it unfit for spiritual service in the assembly, and yet there
{283}
is essential merit in it, which when adapted becomes serviceable.
J.S. Would you say that ornaments rightly belong to the assembly?
J.T. That is what I believe is meant by this passage. These Midianites refer to the public body allied with the world. They have taken on the beautiful terms of Christianity; whereas they do not belong there at all. Their setting is the assembly proper, and I think the gifts of these captains would mean that typically. They recover what can be used in the assembly.
Ques. Would you liken this section to the end of Exodus? It develops out of the ministry; that is, of the Levites -- something entirely for God.
J.T. In Exodus, we have spoil taken out of Egypt -- the spoiling of the Egyptians. That represents the world in its primary state, but Midian is the christianised world, so that we recover what belongs to God in it. I mean, the spiritual do that by bringing out the right thought which attaches each one of these things.
G.L. Was the assembly at Philippi marked by what is ornamental: "whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are noble, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are amiable, whatsoever things are of good report", @Philippians 4: 8? They had seen, heard, and learned these things from the apostle.
J.T. Quite so; and then there are many beautiful ecclesiastical terms as they are called; spiritual assembly terms that have been taken over by the christianised world. They are simply stolen, but the spiritual take them all back, in principle, they are brought back and set up where they belong, that is, in the assembly. The Lord's supper, perhaps, is the best illustration of it. It had been captivated and found in false hands, but the Lord
{284}
has taken it out of such hands and put it in its own setting. Some call it the sacrament, but it is rightly the Lord's supper.
E.P. Would this closing service of Moses, up to @Numbers 32, fill out the expression in Hebrews -- "And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant", chapter 3: 5?
J.T. Exactly so.
A.N.W. I suppose we get the advantage today of the spoil secured by men used in the recovery. It did not attach to them personally, but was placed in the tent of meeting, as a memorial, and we are getting the good of it today.
J.T. Quite so; that is how we are able to appropriate it now and perhaps make more use of it than they did.
C.A.M. Does Luke's gospel pursue this line more than others -- the ornateness and preciousness of the thing? He makes a lot of the memorial at the end. Would you say that Luke's gospel would run on the line of securing what was ornamental all the way through?
J.T. I am sure that is right. We have the ornaments restored in Luke. The question is whether we have the recovered light of that.
F.H.L. Is it right that the spoil is all a result of assembly conflict though represented by individual exercise?
J.T. The whole assembly actually is in the conflict; it is not a partisan matter, but an assembly one.
Ques. Would the shepherdly spirit referred to, resulting in all this, be seen in @Ephesians 4? "With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in love; using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace", (verses 2, 3). Is that necessary for entering into what we have been speaking of?
{285}
J.T. I think it keeps the unity; the idea of the twelve thousand who went to the war, as representing the whole, keeps it concretely before us.
Ques. At the end of 2 Corinthians, the apostle closes with, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all" (chapter 13: 14). Is it not a final touch given by Paul, and bears on what we have been having; so that divine Persons were getting spoil at Corinth?
J.T. Quite so: the three Persons are involved there.
R.W.S. Does the gold of the heave-offering we have considered, suggest what will be recovered from the public position and deposited in the assembly before the rapture?
J.T. Quite so; it will all be taken up.
{286}
SPOIL (4)
@2 Chronicles 14: 1 - 15; @2 Chronicles 15: 1 - 19
A.F.M. I suppose we all know that the subject in hand for these readings is "Spoil" and that we have already been present for three readings on this subject, beginning with David's spoil in @1 Samuel 30. That spoil was distributed amongst his sympathisers, who were in suffering with him during his rejection. And then at the second reading, we took up Abraham and referred to the spoils that he took in connection with the battle with the kings in @Genesis 14, connecting the circumstance with @Hebrews 7, where one-tenth of the spoils are recorded as being given to Melchisedec; emphasizing the greatness of the Son of God typically. We also considered the Israelites asking utensils of silver, gold, and clothing from the Egyptians, by which they spoiled them. This spoil was later used for the building of the tabernacle. And then the last time we were together, we read from @Numbers 31, and considered the warfare with the Midianites, and the taking of much spoil from them, which was distributed amongst the people, and out of which God got His portion. All these thoughts we found most instructive and helpful with regard to this great subject in hand. It is proposed that this afternoon we take up the reign of Asa, as given in @2 Chronicles 14 to 16.
This reign of Asa is, I believe, the most encouraging and pointed of the kings in power at that time. There is no doubt that the reason why Asa reigned longer than Rehoboam or Abijah was because his piety was pleasing to God, doing what was "good and right in the sight of Jehovah his God". When he began to reign, he exterminated idolatry in all its forms and customs, so as to clear
{287}
the land of what was dishonouring to God. It would seem that idolatry had swept the land, for repeatedly a successive godly king was obliged to combat and root it out of the land. It was like a noxious weed that seemed to spring up as an easy crop and to work so destructively against God and His honour. So that this is the first and most commendable accomplishment in his reign. What marked Asa's early reign was rest from war; peace generally was enjoyed, and the kingdom was established. Under these favourable conditions Asa built and fortified cities in Judah; it says of Judah, "they built and prospered". He also had a very great army out of Judah and Benjamin, so from a military viewpoint everything looked to be prosperous and proof against attack. In all this, God was with Asa, helping and encouraging him, for he was greatly exposed to enemies, not only to the kings of Israel, but also to outside enemies. All were ready to attack him.
C.A.M. This matter of dealing with idolatry is one of the first things we have to consider with regard to state.
A.F.M. I think so. If we may use the children of Israel as examples, they were constantly overcome by idolatry in varied forms.
C.A.M. Yes; it would seem that whatever is coming in later, the matter of riddance of idolatry is of vital importance at the outset. As Jacob starts to go up to the house of God, the disposing of idols must first receive his attention.
A.F.M. Quite so: he had to bury them. The great opposite to that was in David, the man after God's own heart, and Asa was said to be a son of David. He was more true to God in this feature than Solomon, Rehoboam, or Abijah had been. It says "Asa's heart was perfect all his days", @2 Chronicles 15: 17.
{288}
W.R. Such an one having soul history was pleasing in the sight of God, apart from what he was in the sight of man.
A.F.M. Quite so; that is what Scripture cites about Asa; he was one who did things in the sight of God, and who proved to have God's support so long as he kept with God.
A.R.S. I suppose from the days of Solomon, the nation had been on the down grade. Solomon introduced idolatry, but this man was raised up of God to put it out. I suppose idolatry is anything that comes in between our souls and the Lord, no matter what it may be.
A.F.M. Very true, and necessary for us to be reminded of in these days: because idolatry will spring up and intrude itself on every possible occasion and on every hand. The word of John in addressing all his family was: "Children, keep yourselves from idols". It is remarkable that in @2 Chronicles 14 we see that Asa was in such an impregnable position as to be able to withstand any enemy. I do not think he expected to meet such an opponent as he did in Zerah, who was active in Egypt at this time. That is the next point of importance; in verse 9, Zerah the Ethiopian came out against him. We may be sure that as we seek to go on with God, and seek to encourage others to go on, there will be opposition. But this is extraordinary, in that he comes over against Asa with one million men.
J.H.E. Earlier, although the land had rest, they built fortified cities. What would be the significance of that? "And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years" (verse 6).
A.F.M. Building was very important work on Asa's part: he was on the look-out and so was
{289}
prepared. I suppose in times of peace we should do as Asa did. We should not wait until war comes before we get ready for an attack, but be ready in view of it. The testimony is to march on in triumph. God is pleased to give ministry in view of building us up and strengthening us, so that we should be prepared for any emergency.
Ques. So in construction work Asa said to Judah, "Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars, while the land is yet before us" (verse 7). Would you not say that the construction of these cities in times of rest and peace, and those different features being built into the city and around it, would represent the results obtained from the removal of idolatry being established in the city; because principles being recovered are now established in a fortified way; so that the saints will not be defeated in the next battle?
A.F.M. Yes; the cities were complete, like earlier cities of which we read in Scripture, where the walls, the gates, and the bars are all necessary to make it capable of resistance. And these were built in that way; they were proof to being overcome because of the thoroughness with which they were built and finished off. I suppose this should apply to ourselves today: we should be as those who are entire and wanting nothing -- our readings and meetings for ministry and all that we are spiritually engaged in, in times of peace have that in view. We are to be morally fortified to withstand the enemy.
Ques. What would the walls, the towers, the gates and bars represent?
A.F.M. Well, I think a city thus built is in every way complete, because the wall might be good and strong, but there might be a weak point in a gate or a bar. A bar might be so weak in structure
{290}
that the enemy might get through and effect an entrance; but no part was left defective or uncared for.
Ques. It was said recently in an address, that our difficulties come oft-times through persons creeping in amongst us not having the Spirit. Would not the bars and the gates, operating properly, prevent that, and also the watchman on the watch being there is view of spying and bringing down the enemy?
A.F.M. Quite so. We need to be "strong in the Lord, and in the might of his strength", @Ephesians 6: 10. That would enable us to be proof to all attacks, subjectively. One might have a great knowledge and ability in the things of God, but if the Spirit is not free with us and moving in us powerfully, we will be bound to meet with failure.
A.N.W. The fortifications were to be around the cities. It says, "Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars" (verse 7). That is a fine resolution. In speaking of doing what is good or right in the sight of Jehovah, it is not merely destruction of what is idolatrous, but constructive in what is to stand for God.
A.F.M. The removal of idolatry would be more a negative work; whereas the city-building and fortifying is positive, to withstand the enemy.
Ques. In the end of @Revelation 21, that which maketh an abomination or a lie should not enter into the city, because the city which comes down from God represents the true idea of a city. It has walls and gates that are perfect; they will operate in accord with the will of God in that day, and we should antedate that time in our cities, should we not?
{291}
A.F.M. I think so. Morally we should go out as ready and in a defensive attitude, too, to meet any attack against God and the truth; so that we do not witness to defeat, but to victory.
J.H.E. It says in the last part of verse 7: "while the land is yet before us". I suppose if we do not build and act for God we shall not prosper.
A.F.M. Quite so. All of these soldiers out of Judah and Benjamin were well equipped. They were mighty men of valour, and able to resist all attacks.
J.T.Jr. Would you say that what came out in chapter 14 follows the judicial dealings of God with Jeroboam through Abijah?
A.F.M. Yes. You refer to Abijah's courage, and his faithful address to Jeroboam and all Israel on the top of mount Zemaraim?
J.T.Jr. Yes, in chapter 13 Abijah fought against Jeroboam and overcame him. At the end of that chapter we see that Jehovah smote him, and he died. In that way God dealt with that which lifted up its head against Him, and Abijah won a great victory and took cities from Jeroboam.
A.F.M. Quite so. The way that Abijah relied upon God is encouraging. Judah also depended upon God, and God came in for them, and finally God took Jeroboam in hand Himself governmentally by removing him.
Rem. The truth of what Abijah said in chapter 13, in speaking to Jeroboam and to all Israel, was verified and fulfilled in Asa now in the breakdown, in part, of the idolatry introduced through Jeroboam.
A.F.M. Quite so. The reigns of Abijah, Asa, and Jehoshaphat were good and were pleasing to God, as dealing with the fruits of Jeroboam's sin.
C.A.M. That seems to be a very important thing, and impressive, too, because this book of 2 Chronicles seems to make a great deal of the priestly
{292}
elements and prayer. Abijah is presented in this character. You would not know it from reading Kings, but this priestly element seems to be a progressive thing all through, does it not?
A.F.M. Quite so. This was in contrast to what Azariah said to Asa, that for many days Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law, reminding Asa of the barrenness Godward of that which had been established under God by David and Solomon. Now the breakdown had come through the lack of faithfulness on Solomon's part to Jehovah, so that He had to rend the kingdom.
F.C. Why does Azariah refer to the condition of *Israel* when speaking to Asa in @2 Chronicles 15: 3?
A.F.M. It was a word of warning mingled with the encouragement of victory. It was addressed to Asa upon returning to Jerusalem after the overthrow of Zerah and his host.
F.C. The word refers back to the division of the tribes under Jeroboam and the establishment of idolatry by him.
A.F.M. That is right. God came in by discipline, for He could not support among His people that which was so dishonouring to Himself.
R.W.S. Concerning the reign of Abijah, which was so short, as contrasted with Asa's, it says in chapter 13: "And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his sayings, are written in the treatise of the prophet Iddo" (verse 22). I wondered whether there might be a link with the remarkable address on that mountain as preparing the way for Asa, even as the testimony of Stephen prepared the way for the great spoil that came in through Paul's ministry and the building of the assembly.
A.F.M. That is a good suggestion, and shows that God uses one event to bring out and enlarge
{293}
another; it is clear from the history of these kings who reigned in succession that God blessed and honoured them because of their faithfulness; so the testimony and sufferings of Stephen paved the way for the bringing in of the assembly through Paul.
Ques. Though Asa is a commended king, yet he is not free from attack on the part of these Ethiopians. Would you make clear why this people came out against him at this time?
A.F.M. I think in the case of Zerah, the head of this massive army, there was doubtless a desire on his part to renew Shishak's earlier attack and to invade the land. Shishak had come up against Jerusalem with his great army and allies in Rehoboam's reign, because he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him. But Zerah was seeking in this instance to attack Asa and to establish himself in a new position. What the direct object of it was we are not told, but no doubt he challenged Asa with a view to seizing God's territory, having Jerusalem as his objective. God's great centre, where the temple and light of God were. You may be sure that in each of these instances God is ordering them and turning them to account. He will consider for His own glory and carry all His designs through.
A.N.W. I was thinking of that. One thing is certain; it has furnished a great part of the subject of our reading. If Zerah had not attacked, there would have been no spoil. The spoil is brought and large quantities of it devoted to God.
A.F.M. Quite so. That is encouraging and helpful; the occasion of the attack does bring forth the faith, communion, and power of Asa. I believe in the presence of all this he was standing for God, and here were one million men coming against him. On his side he had far short of that number, but
{294}
he resorts to God, and in faith he rises up to God's viewpoint of what these Cushites were. There is one word here that yields much as supporting the faith of Asa. It says in chapter 14, "And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, it maketh no difference to thee to help, whether there be much or no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for we rely on thee, and in thy name have we come against this multitude. Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee". The word "man" there is rendered "Enosh" in the footnote of our chapter, which, as we know from @Genesis 4, is the name by which Seth called his son; it means "man" as weak, mortal. It is wonderful that Asa should rise up in faith to God in his prayer and regard these numerous men as weak mortals; whatever their chariots, whatever their power and prowess might be. Asa relied entirely upon God. I believe all that comes out in spoil at the end.
Rem. In chapter 12, the previous coming up of this kind of enemy is God's answer to Israel's disobedience; "And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, because they had transgressed against Jehovah, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen; and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: Libyans, Sukkites, and Ethiopians" (verses 2, 3). Discipline is intended for our good, and if accepted will be turned into blessing.
A.N.W. I thought that this attack was striking, following the surrounding of the cities with walls and towers; there is this protection which gives strength to Asa's army, but when this massive opposing army came against him, he turns the whole matter back upon God, rather than depending upon his defences, and is helped in such a wonderful way.
{295}
C.A.M. Is it not important also to see the changes which occur in the march of the testimony? For a certain time God might be stressing the state of the saints, strengthening them; but we may be sure that the period will change and we may have some external enemy such as this to cope with, so that we do well to be prepared. It raises the question as to what is the next thing to be brought up against the saints.
J.T.Jr. It says, "Zerah ... came out". Would it refer to the way the flesh comes out in us? It is a very real matter, showing that the inward state needs to be dealt with.
A.F.M. Quite so. Asa went out against Zerah. He was equal to doing it, and so it proved, but then his ability lay in his state of soul, in his great dependence upon God, so he really put the whole battle into God's hands. He says, "Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee".
J.T.Jr. Every one of the Ethiopians was dealt with -- "none of them was left alive" (verse 13). Would it refer to the work of God in us that would deal with every feature of the flesh?
A.F.M. Quite so. It says they were *crushed*. A similar word used of the seed of the woman, and of Satan. "He shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel", @Genesis 3: 15. As crushed it shows how complete the destruction was.
A.N.W. It is a remarkable statement. It says "they were crushed before Jehovah and before his army" (verse 13).
A.F.M. Indeed, they were utterly defeated.
Rem. Apparently this war related to some issue that has a history amongst the people of God, and possibly dates back to Solomon, who bartered for horses out of Egypt, Ethiopia, and other lands. That element which God allowed to assert itself
{296}
against Rehoboam is now coming up again in Zerah and his host.
C.A.M. Do you not think in that connection that issues have to be traced to their source? You alluded to the name of Enosh. Asa in speaking to God looked upon the frailty of man in that way. It would seem that our weakness or strength is governed largely by the measure in which we know the ways of God from the beginning. When ministry, such as *Generations in the Book of Genesis* is brought before the saints, we shall be tested by such light.
A.F.M. Yes, quite. Over against the frailty and mortal condition of man in Enosh, men began to call upon Jehovah's name, and that is exactly where Asa was. He cried unto Jehovah, and Jehovah prevailed against the Ethiopians. It is a very important lesson for us to learn in view of being led on to victory.
N.MacC. Would you say something more about the fortifications? John exhorts: "Children, keep yourselves from idols". It infers that they were not actually bowing down to idols, but there was a danger of being turned aside to them. The warning would fortify them.
A.F.M. Exactly. The word "keep" as addressed by John to his family shows us the constant watchful care he had for the saints.
A.B.P. Mere man, multiplied a million times, is still *mere man*!
A.N.W. We are reminded of David, having Goliath's measure before God. So here, though a million of men, they are just mortal dying men.
J.T.Jr. And yet men that needed to be dealt with; for though dying, they must be crushed, so that none of them is left alive, for if these features remain active in our cities and localities, they will hinder the work of God.
{297}
A.F.M. We are inclined to be lenient with the enemy, but God would brook no leniency on our part. We must be *valiant*. Israel had for many days been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law, God having granted a great victory; but there would be no spoil for Him unless this crushing was accomplished; "Jehovah is with you while ye are with him". Asa's army was in fighting order, but what was that against so mighty a company except God be with him!
C.A.M. Great a man as Asa was, he was able to combat the enemy only as having had to say to God about it. Hence prayer has a very great place in this book, for what a man says to God is an index as to his spiritual condition and capability; so what Asa said is all recorded.
A.F.M. Yes, that is encouraging; so that while Asa had merely the army of Benjamin and Judah at this time, Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before him.
A.N.W. Had Asa's plea been, Let not man prevail against *us*, there may have been utter defeat, but he does not say that, but "let not man prevail against thee", and victory was secured.
R.W.S. This pursuit seems to be directed toward the Philistine cities in which the spoil is taken. Would that be an added thought? Not only are the Ethiopians crushed, but there is something in regard to the Philistines, too, which yields spoil. "And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar; and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that none of them was left alive; for they were crushed before Jehovah and before his army. And they carried away very much spoil. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar, for the terror of Jehovah came upon them; and they spoiled all the cities, for there was very much spoil in them. They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away
{298}
sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem" (verses 13 - 15). If that was Philistine area, it would seem to be an added feature as being more than crushing and spoiling the Egyptians.
A.F.M. Yes, quite so. They do not appear to have attacked Gerar, but got so far as that city.
Ques. What difference do you make between the cities as spoil and the cattle and the sheep and the camels?
A.F.M. Well, I suppose the spoil here would be what is general as accruing from the battlefield; the cattle and sheep would be devoted to sacrifice and the camels for the carrying of merchandise. I suppose the spoil in that way would be differentiated.
Ques. Would you say that in overcoming a city, there may be a question of the truth, and principles at stake, in order to preserve the city intact; but that in a sense is not altogether positive spoil, as there is in that which is offered to God? The securing of the city and holding it, only lays a basis for securing further spoil for God, such as these living creatures.
A.F.M. Quite so. It is to be noticed in verse 11 that they sacrificed seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. So that the spoil was great and was freely presented to God in sacrifice; it does not say they offered *all* the spoil, but sacrificed to Jehovah *in that day of the spoil* they had brought; so that God got His portion. I believe it is a great point in Asa's history, that God was given this great place in their hearts. God was pleased with it and was glorified in it.
A.N.W. It says, "And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities that he had taken" (verse 8). Does that not
{299}
indicate that the territory recovered was now to yield to the rights of God?
Rem. Then it also says that Asa "renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah", @2 Chronicles 15: 8. This is one of the most interesting allusions to the altar and porch of Jehovah that was made since the days of Solomon.
A.F.M. I think that is helpful and encouraging. This new movement results from Azariah's coming forward to encourage Asa. He puts him on his responsibility. It says, "Jehovah is with you while ye are with him" (chapter 15: 2). Azariah spoke to Asa and Judah in the Spirit stating that if they transgressed they would have to pay the penalty of not being true to Jehovah. But his word encouraged Asa and the tribe of Judah much, and brought about a more diligent putting away of what was idolatrous. "He took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin". It was more general and thorough than in his earlier uprooting movements. The terrible things that had remained, which had been overlooked, were now cleared away. We may have little idea of what is represented by that word *abomination*. The queen, Asa's mother, had made an idol (meaning "horror") for the Asherah; showing how terrible these abominations were. The covenant made at Jerusalem caused Asa to be more diligent, and brought about greater results.
Ques. Do you think Azariah's word, "Hear ye me", would apply at the present time? During the last one hundred years many battles have been fought. Would they fit in possibly with what Asa had been doing up to this point? Then Azariah coming forward suggesting the Spirit speaking with a view to clearing away the abominations in a detailed way. Might there not be a suggestion of our ministry meetings in Azariah's word? Through the
{300}
meeting for prophetic ministry, God is now free to speak to His people in this remarkable way.
A.F.M. Yes, I think that is suggestive, and as the passage shows, the exercise was taken on by Asa and those with him. So that these great results were found. The verses show that the search was general and the altar was renewed. It leads on to that. It was situated before the porch, so that the climax reached was evidently there. It led up to what was due to God, so that the altar as renewed, was acceptable to God; and as devoted, all the spoil was offered upon it.
C.A.M. It seems to be another of the many evidences of the value of prophecy. In the flush of victory Asa might have felt self-confident. One value of prophetic ministry seems to be to look forward to what we may have to pass through. Azariah evidently foresaw what Asa was about to encounter. Is it not interesting in that way to note that the effect of the prophetic word was to give him a deeper apprehension of the death of Christ in this renewal of the altar?
A.F.M. Quite so. It would be his great preservative at this time of victory.
A.N.W. It is far better to be moved and encouraged by a prophetic word than by the encouragement given in the flush of victory. Asa took courage from the prophetic word; that was what led him forward to the clearance of cities.
Rem. In this case, Asa heeded it. We are at a favourable time, when the people of God are in a position to have God speak to them through the ministry meeting. The next thing I suppose is to hearken to it, as Asa did.
A.F.M. Quite so. And then see what follows in that connection. It says of Asa, "He assembled all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon;
{301}
for they fell away to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him", (verse 9). That is very beautiful, I think, showing that God honoured his servant the king in all of his movements, that the people of neighbouring tribes were affected; they fell away to Asa when they saw his God was with him. Very often there is an effort to be friendly with people with whom we cannot really be friendly. There was no suggestion on Asa's part to go and bring those tribes over, no overtures in that way on his part; they came of their own volition as affected by the testimony; they were not sought after. It was right that they should do the seeking themselves. We have to distinguish between those whom we should seek and show encouragement to and those with whom there should first be an exercise to return.
C.A.M. I am sure that is an important matter. As the presence of God is known, if people are coming, it should be because God is with us.
A.N.W. That is what the passage says: "when they saw that Jehovah ... was with him". That is the test, and the value of the first prophetic word seems to be that "Jehovah is with you while ye are with him".
Rem. Those who were coming back would be from among the people who rebelled against David and against his house, and to whom Abijah had spoken saying that they had made themselves priests after the manner of the nations.
A.F.M. That is right. We see in the history of Hezekiah in a later day that he *sent an invitation* to all Israel and Judah (@2 Chronicles 30). The passover feast was in view, and many responded to that, and were there in self-judgment. But this was not of that character; it was their return in thanksgiving to God of their own volition as seeing that God was supporting Asa.
{302}
J.T.Jr. They assembled themselves at Jerusalem.
F.C. It says in 1 Kings, "But for David's sake Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem", @1 Kings 15: 4.
A.F.M. Yes. God will always stand by His word to David. He will always be true to Himself, but then if we are going to be true, we must abide by God's will. God does not support our going out to those who are unjudged and unsympathetic. It would be to take us back to unjudged associations.
Ques. Is it not true that as we gain strength spiritually, we have greater influence? The influence should come as the result of spirituality.
A.F.M. That is right. The example of Asa and of Judah attracted these who returned.
C.A.M. It is marvellous how the prophetic word works in that way throughout the Scriptures, producing a searching of heart.
A.F.M. Very good.
A.B.P. Are three phases of the prophetic word seen in these chapters? Verse 22 of chapter 13 refers to a prophetic treatise, which undoubtedly would be known to Asa and would be an encouragement to him; then in verse 2 of chapter 15 Azariah comes forward and gives Asa a direct prophetic word; then in verse 7 of chapter 16 Hanani the *seer* came and spoke to him.
A.F.M. I think that is good, because Iddo's treatise would be educational. Oded's word confirmatory, and Hanani's prophecy in the nature of conviction. Conviction is one feature of prophecy in itself; the faithful word which Hanani gave involved his being put in the stocks. He had to suffer for it.
A.B.P. The character of Hanani's word seems to be the exercise of one who sees things with God. He refers to the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro,
{303}
which would take account of the declension among the saints, of which Hanani spoke.
A.N.W. What light could we get as to the character of the word in chapter 15: 8? It says, "And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet". It seems to be jointly with Azariah's word.
A.F.M. The passage becomes clear as we regard both Azariah and Oded as prophets; Azariah's words and the prophecy of Oded alike imparted courage.
C.A.M. The father and the son were united in this service.
W.R. Is that not how you get a direct word? It says the Spirit of God came upon Azariah, the son of Oded.
A.F.M. Quite so.
R.W.S. The word of Hanani, the seer, tests Asa, and seems to suggest that the prophetic word will sooner or later uncover my state if I am not right.
C.A.M. Hanani, the seer, gives a word which shows that he was with God and so observes things. He is something like a watchman.
Rem. Azariah's word was constructive; coming in as it did after the battle, it was a question of consolidating the position gained and giving God His place in the midst of the people at Jerusalem. But then, as in that position, we may become unfaithful again, as Asa became, so that Hanani came along with his word which disclosed the sin that actually existed. As already stated, he is called a *seer*.
A.N.W. What had you in mind at the beginning when you referred to chapter 15?
A.F.M. Speaking generally, what was in my mind was the word the Spirit of God gave to Azariah, and its fruitful effects, so that "they assembled themselves at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. And they sacrificed
{304}
to Jehovah in that day, of the spoil that they had brought" (verses 10, 11). Then they entered into a covenant, "to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul, and that whoever would not seek Jehovah the God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. And they swore to Jehovah with a loud voice". It was a very great occasion, because it was "with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they took the oath with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them". The result was complete, for Jehovah gave them rest round about, and then Asa removed his mother from being queen; cut down her idol, stamped and burned it in the valley of Kidron; and then we have a wonderful tribute paid to Asa that his heart was perfect all his days, although the high places were not removed. Then we have the dedication of his father's and his own dedicated things to Jehovah. It was a wonderful climax reached by Asa.
A.N.W. The man in @1 Corinthians 14 who enters is convicted, falls down, and does homage to God and confesses -- suggesting the great result of the prophetic word.
Rem. So these people that come out from the other tribes were like the man of @1 Corinthians 14. They acknowledge the presence of God.
A.F.M. Exactly.
Rem. Asa became like Levi, for he destroyed the idol his mother had made for the Asherah and stamped it.
A.F.M. It was a determined act of destruction on Asa's part: and in courage he exterminated the idol, otherwise she would be one of those who would be put to death (verse 13).
{305}
A.N.W. Asa removed her, queen mother though she was, for she was leading in idolatry.
C.A.M. Does not God emphasise that as being a very important thing with Him? We need to have special power in connection with relatives or friends, and if we have it, we too will have mention in the divine record. Otherwise, such links would mean our ruin.
Rem. It is a question of whether we are levitical in these matters of our relatives. It says, "If any man come to me, and shall not hate his own father and mother ... he cannot be my disciple", @Luke 14: 26. It was Levi who "said to his father and to his mother, I see him not", @Deuteronomy 33: 9.
T.N.W. Will you say why Asa did not recognise that Ben-hadad of Syria was a mere man?
A.F.M. Well, I think that is another exercise. You will notice that in this fresh movement of sending to Ben-hadad, he really reversed all that he had done before. He overlooked, strangely enough, all the victories that God had previously given him.
C.A.M. I think that is important. When Seth named his son Enosh, *then men* began to call on the name of the Lord, but Asa reversed the whole thing here. Instead of calling on God, he called on one of these mere men, and he became a mere man himself.
A.F.M. Just so, that is very important. There was God's proven way of getting out of this difficulty if he had only resorted to God about it. In sending to Ben-hadad, he avoided trouble for the moment, but not for the future. He really employed an idolatrous king to remove the obstacle that stood in his way. No doubt it enabled him to destroy Ramah, but had he been faithful and courageous, God would have delivered him from Baasha as He had delivered him before. What were the king of Israel's armies as compared with one million men of a few years earlier? He evidently failed to recognise
{306}
God and dropped down to the level of mere man.
A.N.W. He brought out the dedicated things from the temple which, when he was in spiritual power, he had taken in.
C.A.M. He really spoiled what he had already done. That is the serious part of the end of our lives, we are apt to spoil everything we had done that has gone before. He had taken the dedicated things in, but then he took them out and gave them to this heathen destroyer.
A.F.M. Is it not a great test with ourselves; it is not so much how we begin, but how we go on, and how we finish? I think Mr. Stoney said it is the last six months of a saint's life that determines his place in the kingdom. Now it was not much longer after his league with Ben-hadad that Asa died, exhibiting a sorrowful failure on his part.
Rem. Paul says in Colossians, "if indeed ye abide in the faith founded and firm, and not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings" (chapter 1: 23). Asa moved away from the real foundation of things in making a league. Trouble comes in amongst us when a league is made with that from which we righteously were separated.
A.B.P. When Asa overthrew his mother's idol and stamped it, he manifested personal power. He *stamped* the thing. Later, when he failed, these very feet that stamped the idol became diseased!
A.F.M. I think this is a very sad conclusion to arrive at; Asa's feet, through insubjection to God, no longer supported him to please God: his disease increased, and he suffered as one whose movements God had governmentally curtailed.
R.W.S. I suppose his disease became chronic.
A.F.M. I think his name means "physician". He resorted to physicians, but he did not call on God. After all, God is our best Physician, and as
{307}
obedient to Him none of the complaints are put upon us that were put upon the Egyptians, as @Exodus 15: 26 shows.
R.W.S. Apparently Asa died in that condition, and it is sad in view of all that preceded.
A.N.W. It is better to start as Mephibosheth: lame on both feet, than to end like Asa with both feet diseased.
A.F.M. Yes. However, the great burning of spices for Asa, and his burial in his own sepulchre, excavated by himself, may indicate God's merciful recovery of Asa to Himself, consistent with so remarkable a man in whom grace had wrought.
{308}
SPOIL (5)
@Proverbs 31: 10 - 12; @Acts 2: 42 - 47; @Acts 4: 23 - 37
J.T. We have in mind to see how the assembly has part in spoil. The woman of worth in @Proverbs 31 is a very fitting type of the assembly. The statement that her husband shall have no lack of spoil indicates that there would be abundance of spoil for Christ in the assembly. It is thought that we should consider the assembly's service in this connection, in the light of what we have read in Acts. There are many other examples which we may look into later, but these two show what the Lord *had* as from the assembly. He had that to which He could add certain ones who were in the purpose of God for salvation: and then *that to which His servants could come* as in conflict and service. "They came to their own company", where they found what they needed in the way of mutual support and sympathy, an important matter as related to the testimony; Barnabas, for example, representing the manner of the extension of this as a son of consolation. Accordingly, the assembly is seen as a place of sympathy for the servants who are in toil and conflict, and where its prayers are available. Later, we have examples of discipline, resulting in the securing of spoil; and the ears of the assembly also being instrumental in the provision of further spoil. The book, indeed, furnishes much that should be helpful to us. The Lord has His part in securing spoil, as we have already had before us, but now may see the *assembly's* part in it.
P.L. Is the settlement of moral questions in @Proverbs 30 a prelude to the assurance of spoil for Christ? I was thinking of how Peter took up the matter of Judas in @Acts 1, and how that would compare with @Proverbs 30, where spiritual discernment
{309}
has a great place. The settlement of every issue in holy discernment seems to open the door to the assurance of this spoil for Christ from the assembly.
J.T. Also in the beginning of chapter 31 -- the king, alluding to authority as developed under the influence of the mother, is essential to what is before us -- the authority of Christ worked out amongst the saints under the influence of the mother. As it is said, "his mother taught him". The authority, on the masculine side, as seen in the apostles, precedes the working out of these beautiful feminine features. Peter peculiarly asserts the authority of Christ in his address; this is coupled with the Spirit coming from Christ in heaven, so that the idea of authority is worked out among the saints as under the influence of the mother, that is, the assembly being there. They were all together in one place as the Spirit came, and the authority of Christ is now interwoven in the texture of the assembly, which must precede the working out of the feminine side of spoil.
Ques. Does the evil in verse 3 of @Proverbs 31 work against the oneness of which you are speaking which existed at the beginning of Christianity? Would Solomon's foreign wives and concubines show that, resulting from the loose way in which authority has been taken up, there has been the development of the divisions of Christendom, the "systems" as seen at Corinth, for instance?
J.T. That is the way the truth of this matter stands, the darkening influence that is suggested in @Proverbs 31: 4, and how it is worked out in the history of Christendom. Authority is now official -- man-made officialism, and has been corrupted, so that such conditions preclude the authority that is needed. In verse 4 it is said: "It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for
{310}
rulers to say, Where is the strong drink?" Rule is to be free of all such inflating or dulling influences as are indicated in those verses.
C.A.M. So Peter is able to contradict any such suggestion in the beginning of the Acts; that what animated them then was due to this kind of stimulation.
J.T. Yes. It was early in the day when Peter preached; the saints were not drunk with wine as the mockers stated. Had they been drunk, christianity had been early corrupted, but it was preserved. The power operating was that of the Spirit of God, not the results of human opiates or stimulation.
Rem. So that judging without partiality would be a feature of a king, not of one under the influence of strong drink; the latter would be partial and unbalanced.
J.T. "Lest they drink and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the children of affliction" (verse 5).
P.L. The man who buffets his body as Paul did in 1 Corinthians does not forget the law; he is marked by a nazarite's devotion, abstaining in that way from wine as in contrast to the Corinthian leaders whose judgment was partisan.
J.T. This is an important point before proceeding to the virtuous woman, who is, as you might say, the wife. Of course it might be thought that Lemuel is Christ figuratively, but it is rather, I think, as we have been pointing out, the authority of Christ as worked out under the influence of the Spirit in the assembly. In that way, the exhortation that we should be kept free from darkening influences is of great importance.
P.L. So that the shout of a king may be amongst us! Is that Lemuel?
J.T. That is the idea, I think. It is the power of the Spirit, and the authority of Christ worked out in that way. But alas! the thing that is to be
{311}
avoided here has been allowed in the history of the assembly, and hence the kind of rule we have today. It is not such as can be trusted.
C.A.M. These princely men of @Acts 3 can go up and open their mouth for the dumb.
J.T. That is the thought. We have the features of Christ now -- that which is in keeping with Him: "Open thy mouth for the dumb, for the cause of all those that are left desolate. Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and minister justice to the afflicted and needy" (verses 8 and 9). That all enters into the government of the assembly.
Ques. Jehovah said to Solomon in @1 Kings 3: "And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will prolong thy days" (verse 14). Then it says of Solomon: "And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. Then came two women, harlots, to the king, and stood before him", (verses 15, 16). Then at the end of the paragraph, "And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice", (verse 28). Does that refer to what transpires in the assembly from this masculine point of view?
J.T. It marked the beginning; then you find later in Solomon, alas! that his wives turned away his heart and he lost his discernment and power, which of course is typically the history of the assembly.
P.L. Would Paul in saying, "Quit yourselves like men; be strong", (@1 Corinthians 16: 13), fear that this masculine feature would surrender to what is effeminate?
{312}
J.T. Quite so. "Let your women be silent in the assemblies", (@1 Corinthians 14: 34), is not a question of discrediting the sisters, but to bring out the two sides of the position, the masculine and the feminine. It is not simply what is abstractly in Christ -- that would hardly fit here; He was not exposed to these temptations. It is the rule of Christ mediately in the assembly through elders and others, as the apostle says to the elders of Ephesus: "The Holy Spirit has set you as overseers ..." (@Acts 20: 28), and then he says, "and from among your own selves shall rise" (verse 30). These are the things to be watched, the influences that are spoken of here, lest we become besotted and unable to judge righteous judgment.
You can see in these early chapters in Acts how Lemuel, under the right influence, is doing his work. The judgment rendered as to Ananias and Sapphira was faithful according to God. Peter is rewarded immediately, for the succeeding part of the chapter greatly stresses Peter, his very shadow being of importance. God was honouring that feature in the assembly.
A.F.M. Would the exhortation of Paul to the Ephesians fit in here? "And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit" (chapter 5: 18). No doubt that had application in Ephesus, and in the early history of the assembly.
J.T. "Be filled with the Spirit". The mockers said that the saints were affected by wine, but it was the Spirit they were affected by. Peter's address was to make that clear, that it was the Spirit of God. "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, ... he has poured out this" (that is the point, it is authority come down from Christ) "which *ye* behold and hear" (verse 33).
A.B.P. What is the thought in *finding* the woman?
{313}
J.T. It was the need that existed in the Old Testament. Solomon said, "One man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all those have I not found", @Ecclesiastes 7: 28. But still, the concept of the woman is here, as though she is to be found. There is no doubt about her being found. She is accurately described, and by means of an acrostic, too, for it is an acrostic part of Scripture. The language is so employed to emphasise accuracy, I think. She is the product of real exercise. There was great need of her, and she is spoken of as one about to appear. It alludes prophetically to the assembly.
P.L. After kingly authority is established at Corinth, would the Lord's supper suggest the woman coming to light and spoil for Christ?
J.T. I think that is the way it is worked out. The meaning of the Lord's supper is made clear in 1 Corinthians, and the new covenant in the second epistle; filling out what is meant in response to God from the assembly. So that in 2 Corinthians the apostle says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" (chapter 11: 2). That is the Man that is to be known in the gates; not those rivals of Paul. They are not to be known in the gates. The assembly characteristically would make no room for *them*. It makes room for Christ; He is to be known in the gates; not the rivals of Paul who were aspiring for place.
J.S. Do you regard the three thousand recovered from judaism in @Acts 2 as spoil for the assembly?
J.T. I think that is the way it stands; that is the great result, and then they came under rule. They came under what was there, the kingly thought, I think; they persevered "in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles"; that is, the apostles representing Lemuel -- the authority of Christ worked out in the assembly. They came under that and
{314}
immediately recognised it and persevered in it. Then the Spirit of God goes on to describe not only what marked the three thousand, but all. As it says, "And all that believed were together, and had all things common, and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as any one might have need" (verses 44, 45). And then we have the thought that the Lord added. There was something there that He could add to. So I think in order to get this clearly, we must see what king Lemuel represents, and the coming under the influence of his mother. It was a prophecy that she taught him. It was God brought in, in that way, prophetically; and then all who were added afterwards came under that. They persevered in that as represented in the apostles teaching.
Ques. In @Matthew 13, would the virtuous woman be suggested in the kingdom of the heavens being likened to a pearl of great price; and in @Matthew 16, authority is brought in under Peter?
J.T. Quite so. The pearl of great price would allude to the assembly according to what she is in intrinsic value in the Lord's eye, for which He gave everything He had.
C.A.M. I would like to ask about this "prophecy that his mother taught him", and also the prophecy of Agur.
J.T. The latter is *by a man*. Undoubtedly Agur and Lemuel would be symbolical names of Solomon, and therefore of Christ, but viewed as being worked out in the assembly authoritatively. So chapter 30 deals with moral questions; works out the answers to questions. It is a matter of dealing with these questions in wisdom by a very humble man, because he says, "uttered by the man unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal: Truly *I* am more stupid than any one; and I have not a man's intelligence. I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge
{315}
of the Holy" (verse 3). And then he begins to ask questions. He asks questions as to the Deity. Then he goes on to say in verse 5: "Every word of God is pure". That is the kind of man to settle moral questions. In chapter 31 you have another symbolical name -- Lemuel -- alluding doubtless to Solomon or Christ, but alluding, as already said, to what is in the assembly, known and worked out there, and hence the thought of the mother, and all who come in are affected. They continue and persevere in that: in the teaching of the apostles. The point is the teaching of the *apostles*. It is *authoritative* teaching.
A.R. Is that why it says, "Those then who had accepted his word" (verse 41)? The three thousand, it says, accepted his word and were baptised.
J.T. That is the idea. "What shall we do, brethren?" they said to Peter and the other *apostles*. Peter had stood up with the eleven because that is the point, to bring out that side, this apostolic testimony and power, so the affected ones asked Peter and the others. *They recognised the eleven as well as Peter*. The point is to bring that out, the authority that is there, and then how they persevered. They said, "What shall we do, brethren?" Peter told them what to do, and there were added that day three thousand, and they *persevered* in the apostles teaching. That is the thing to notice.
F.H.L. The fourth chapter shows that the three thousand became five thousand men.
J.T. You mean they are *men now*. That is what is needed in the assembly.
A.N.W. Would you mind saying a word as to the teaching of the prophecy? The prophetic word has its own point, but the mother teaches it.
J.T. I thought, as already intimated, that the mother is the assembly; for authority is vested there. "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of
{316}
God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear ... Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (verses 33, 36). It was authoritative, and I believe that is what is alluded to here, that kind of authority, kept free from corrupting influences. Alas! it has not been kept free, and hence the hierarchical conditions around us that are utterly untrustworthy, and therefore we have to dismiss all these darkening things from our minds, and *judge righteous judgment*.
P.L. Does chapter 14 of 1 Corinthians link up with chapter 13 in that way; the authoritative prophetic word flows from the maternal influence of love in chapter 13?
J.T. Quite so; the way the assembly is brought in right through supports what we are saying; it is the mother's influence. The authority of chapter 5, for instance, in dealing with the incestuous person. And then "when ye come together in assembly", the apostle says, "it is not to eat the Lord's supper" (chapter 11: 18, 20). He also says, "do ye despise the assembly of God?" (verse 22). Earlier he had said that even the least in the assembly had sufficient ability to judge in matters financial or temporal; showing what the assembly is authoritatively. It is a question of what works out through the mother, and yet it works out in *men*. It is kingly.
Ques. The angel said to Hagar, "Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands", @Genesis 16: 9. Does not Sarai represent the mother side of the assembly, Jerusalem above?
J.T. Yes; she would honour Abram; yet it is Abram's authority working out through her. So, as has been pointed out in chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians, the mother side is in love, but then the man is stressed in chapter 14. "Brethren, be not children
{317}
in your minds, but in malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men" (verse 20). "If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and simple persons enter in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad?" (verse 23). The man side is gone! The *man* is balanced, and he represents the higher thought spiritually. For instance, the birth of a male in the types, causes less uncleanness than the birth of a female child, but all that is to show that what represents authority is more balanced; whether it be in man or woman as to actual fact; it is what these things mean spiritually, that the man side is the balanced governmental side, and in the assembly this is maintained. In chapter 14 the prophet brings God in; a man standing up in the assembly prophesying, and an unconverted man, or an exercised person that comes in falls down and worships; he is affected. But then the same chapter says, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" (verse 37); that is, it is the authority of Christ working out that way. He says, "Let your women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak" (verse 34). That has a wider bearing than simply the thought of women speaking. It is to bring out the masculine and feminine features of the truth.
C.A.M. Perhaps that is emphasised in Matthew's gospel, which has been referred to as the *assembly* gospel; the princely side and the authority side, and really the worship side are emphasised there.
J.T. Yes; it is that side in Matthew, the *man* side; Joseph is made more of in Matthew than Mary, and that supports what you say.
Ques. At the beginning of @Acts 2, the apostle Peter seems to fit in with the epistle to Corinthians, inasmuch as he confirms the prophetic word. Do you not think that has a bearing on the authoritative
{318}
side of the assembly? He begins by confirming the prophetic word in the prophet Joel.
J.T. Quite so; and David too. He also says in his opening words as he is standing up with the eleven (that is the authoritative position): "Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words" (verse 14). Give heed to *my words*. It is a man speaking with authority.
W.B-w. Would you say a little about the woman representing the feminine feature of the truth in @1 Corinthians 14?
J.T. Well, she is not permitted to speak. "Let your women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak". They have their place, of course, in spiritual contribution, but the speaking is to be by the men, to maintain the distinction between the masculine and feminine features of the truth. It is more that, than that we should be occupied with the individual speaking of women, although that is stated, but it brings out the masculine and feminine features of the truth.
P.L. So that the woman who is drunk with the blood of the martyrs sits as a queen and is no widow. The feminine idea is wrongly bound up with authority in Rome.
A.B.P. Would you link up the woman of @Luke 15 who sweeps the house? I was wondering whether you would speak of this as suggesting authority feminine-wise in the assembly?
J.T. Quite so; you have many illustrations of it throughout Scripture. She is sweeping the house; she is not under orders from anybody. She is looking for the lost piece of silver. You can see she expresses authority in what she is doing.
A.F.M. A great point in @Proverbs 31 is that the assembly expresses the man, Christ. It says in verse 23: "Her husband is known in the gates, when he
{319}
sitteth among the elders of the land". Is not that the great idea of the assembly, that the husband is known by her actions and by all that she does? He is known in the gates, the place of public authority. She makes way for the man.
J.T. I think that is the point. First in chapter 2 of the Acts, the converts are persevering in the teaching of the apostles, the representatives of Christ; chapter 2 is to bring that out. Christ is exalted on high, but they are representing Him here, so that Peter stood up with the eleven, and those affected by his address, address him and the others of the apostles, as if to make that plain. Then in chapter 4 the burden of the prayer of the assembly, the company, is Christ. The persons who are praying are speaking to One who is a Despot (the word used here for Lord). He is their Master and they are His bondmen. The assembly takes that attitude and makes everything of "thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed" (verse 27). How He was treated by those persons, Herod, Pontius Pilate, and the nations! They quote the second psalm, which gives a great place to God's King, that is, Christ the anointed; that is the burden of their prayer. The treatment Jesus was subjected to occurred "in this city", they say. "And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word, in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus" (verses 29, 30). That is the burden of their prayer. The *husband* is to be known in the gates. It is not like the drunken woman that has just been spoken of, who sits as a queen and is no widow. *She* is known in the gates.
J.S. There is no element of subjection seen in the one who sits as a queen, whereas the feature of subjection is seen in the woman of worth.
{320}
J.T. It is very striking. The prayer is not addressed to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; it is to One who is regarded as Master. Peter and John told them what the chief priests and elders had said to them, and then it says, "And they, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them; who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have the nations raged haughtily and the peoples meditated vain things? The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord [that is the ordinary word for Lord, which here would be Jehovah] and against his Christ. For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass. And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings and give to thy bondmen ..." (verses 24 - 29). I just wanted to point that out; they address Him as Despot, and refer to themselves as "thy bondmen". It is the lowliness of the assembly; its humility and subjection; the whole point of the prayer is to make much of "thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed".
J.S. They recognise the Lord as in supreme authority.
J.T. Things are to be done in His name, not in their names.
J.T.Jr. The prayer meeting, therefore, becomes a very feeling meeting. It reflects the true attitude of the assembly towards God and Christ.
J.T. It reflects, too, the place the servants have in the hearts of the brethren; here they came to their *own company*; although "company" is not in the original, the thought is there. The servants
{321}
have a circle to which they can come, where they are at home, and where they can unburden their hearts. And then this wonderful prayer on their behalf follows.
P.L. Is that enhanced by the fact that He who has secured that circle, came back to a sleeping company when He was in Gethsemane, and felt it? The Lord has suffered to furnish, among other things, such a company to His servants.
J.T. You mean that people sometimes go to sleep in the prayer meetings. Is that not so? Is not that just what they do? When the Lord asked the disciples to watch, they went to sleep.
A.N.W. The place shook here, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Heaven hears it and answers it in *power* -- power on their behalf is what is in mind, in referring to this passage; what the Lord had for His servants, these two men, Peter and John, who represented the company. They came to "their own", and told all that had happened to them and what was said to them. And now this prayer, all in relation to Christ, "thy holy servant Jesus", that healing signs and wonders should take place through His name.
C.A.M. The fact that it was in that city seems to be emphasized in this translation. Would you connect that in your mind with what had taken place there in the gate of that city, that it was in that place that the victory was to be?
J.T. That is another point of importance. The authorised version does not read "in this city", but it is evidently in the original; it is in the Revised Authorised and it is in the New Translation too. The point is, what is in any city. Take this city: in our prayer meetings our burden is largely this city -- what we have to contend with in it, and what the history of the testimony is in
{322}
it, because in our chapter they go back over the history of what had happened. Then they come in verse 29 to *now*: "And now, Lord". Can we go back in history to what has happened, as applying to "this city"? And what are we praying about? The point is, what is going to happen today and tomorrow. "And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings ...". It is that things are to be done through the name of "thy holy servant Jesus".
In chapter 2, the point is what Jesus could use as the nucleus to add to. Persons who were the subjects of divine counsel were to be saved; they were being brought to light. The spoil was coming in, but also, the Lord had that to which He could add them; but now in chapter 4 it is a place where His servants can find support and sympathy, and this leads to prayer; for after all, what can we do, or what can any assembly do for the servants? Their sympathy is valuable, but God alone can really help. And so they pray, but they pray in a proper seemly attitude and in seemly terms.
Ques. And also as understanding the enemy. Can we really pray intelligently about the enemy that is gathering, unless we know that he *is* gathering?
J.T. They knew exactly the position of what was in that city. That is an important thing in our prayers, that we know what means the enemy has of attacking.
Rem. In chapter 4 the enemy was attacking the outward testimony, but in chapter 5 he seems to be attacking inwardly.
J.T. You mean in Ananias and Sapphira.
R.W.S. Is a decline in power seen in @Acts 12, where they meet for prayer and pray unbelievingly?
J.T. Peter did not have so much in that company. The only one seemingly who understood him was Rhoda. It was nothing like this prayer
{323}
meeting -- there was no shaking from heaven in what happened in the prison, but there was something in answer to the prayers. But the facts given show that there was deterioration.
P.L. Would you say that the expression, "The kings of the earth were there ..." implies their exposure? Would it mean that there is kingship of another kind now, authority in the assembly and not in the kings of the earth?
J.T. Quite so. And such kingship can take a *low* place. We can call God, Master, taking the place of bondmen. How becoming that is under these circumstances! The need is so great that we do not use the terms of exalted relationship, but of humility. Heaven answers that; it is suitability of address in the prayer.
A.B.P. There seems to be perfect harmony between the state inside and the ministry outside. I was thinking particularly of verse 19: "But Peter and John answering said to them, If it be righteous before God to listen to you rather than to God, judge ye". Is not that the recognition of God's authority linking on with the idea of Despot?
J.T. Quite so. One is very much impressed with the humility that is expressed. We never use this title in speaking to God. I have never heard it used, but it is very striking and impressive to me that this is the title they use. They know they are speaking to God, because it says definitely, "And they, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord ..." That is, Thou art our Master; we are Thy slaves, and we are urgent about this.
A.N.W. The evidence of the divine pleasure is seen in the next verse, which precisely answers what they asked for, you will notice. "The place in which they were assembled shook, and they were
{324}
all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness" (verse 31).
J.T. They spoke the *word of God*, which carried with it the idea of *moral* authority.
W.B-w. Do you think this prayer was voiced by one brother in the company, or does it combine the exercises of all, but put together by the Spirit?
J.T. It would not matter whether it were the one or the other, so long as it was uttered. It is the way the Spirit of God records it, what *they* said: "And they, having heard it, lifted up their voice ..." or literally, "lifted up voice", but *they* did it. It was a collective thought, and I suppose any brother praying carries the amens of the brethren; it is a united thing.
Ques. Is there a recognition of the enemy in this prayer?
J.T. I think so, but it is the peculiar attitude of Master and slave that strikes me. How that suited heaven! It is not that they did not know God as Father, because they did, as we learn elsewhere, but the suitability of the address strikes you.
T.E.H. Would a good Roman saint be a bondman to God? "Having become bondmen to God", @Romans 6: 22. Would that suggest the idea of slave?
J.T. That is the thought exactly. And the Lord has led the way in that; He took a bondman's form, showing us the way of it.
W.S. If a brother in the meeting did not carry the amens of the brethren, what would you say in regard of that?
J.T. That is, of course, another matter. What I observe is that there are very few amens amongst us, except at the end of a prayer. We are told in the Scriptures, "Let all the people say. Amen!" @Psalm 106: 48. If the brethren do it generally, but at some particular time they do it not, then the
{325}
brother praying ought to question it -- why has he not the amens of the brethren?
Ques. In a practical way; what about sisters in connection with that -- "Let all the people say, Amen"?
J.T. I am glad to hear them say it at any time. Why should they not say it? The word that sisters should be silent, means that a sister is not to discourse or speak as a brother or as men would do; but she can sing and join in saying, Amen.
J.S. She voices her accord with what has been said.
J.T. "All the people" certainly includes the sisters.
Rem. Does verse 17 of @Proverbs 31 indicate the strength of prayer? "She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms". The strength of this prayer meeting is indicated in this woman who "girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms". The idea is of such arms being lifted up.
J.T. Quite so; the loins would be the seat of the lower affections; so that girding them with strength would mean that there is self-denial, fasting; and we shall see later in Antioch that they were fasting. I think that is the idea. "This kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting", @Matthew 17: 21.
F.H.L. Do you think the character of the attack is the same today against "thy holy servant Jesus" (verse 27)?
J.T. It is. The second psalm which they quote brings the position clearly into view -- "against the Lord and against his Christ. For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed" (verses 26, 27). That is where the attack always is, that is, against Jehovah and against His Christ.
{326}
A.B.P. Does that not show the utter breakdown of authority in the world as over against the authority that is set up in the assembly?
J.T. You can see here the world is represented in Jerusalem and it brings out what Jerusalem really is, and was capable of, and what any city in which we may be set is capable of. Some may say, Well, our city is not so bad. Sometimes even the Lord's people say "*our* city". I think it ought to be remembered where that is said, in chapter 16 of this book, that they were about to put Paul and Silas into prison: so it is better for us to say, This city. We are in the place, and it is well to see what its capabilities are, when it is put to the test in regard to God and His Christ.
Rem. They did not run away from the difficulty here; there was terrible influence at work, but they stood their ground.
J.T. They gauged the actual capabilities of Jerusalem. Now it was an historic fact as to what had happened there; and as you say, they did not run away from the opposition in it. They asked God to support them in the midst of it, which He did.
Rem. All conflict should be linked up with the cross, dating it back to the cross. I was thinking of the question of Pilate and all those gathered against the Lord at that time; so the apostle at Corinth links the thing up with "Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified".
J.T. Exactly; that is what every city is, whether it is big or little. If it is examined, and the spirit of it tested, it will be found to be what Jerusalem was: "spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified", @Revelation 11: 8.
Rem. Lot wanted to go to a little city. It would have the features of Sodom.
{327}
Ques. Is the result of this seen in spoil characteristically in Barnabas?
J.T. I think he comes in as showing the extension of what we are now speaking of. It is further spoil. He is in entire keeping with what is described in the chapter. He is not an extraneous element, and that is an important thing with persons coming in amongst us; that they are in keeping with what is there. The chapter describes what there was, what Christ had, the place where His servants could come to obtain sympathy and support and intelligent prayer, so that God might support them; and then there was *addition* which was quite in keeping with what was there. It is said, "neither was there any one in want among them; for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to each according as any one might have need", (verses 34, 35). The Lord had all this. It was spoil for Him -- the outcome of complete unselfishness. The enemy was robbed of men who were selfish; they were made unselfish, and the Lord has them for His service for the need among His people.
J.S. Barnabas was very appropriate spoil, a son of consolation.
J.T. That is the point; he comes in, in keeping with what is described. "And Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being interpreted, Son of consolation), a Levite, Cyprian by birth, being possessed of land, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles", (verses 36, 37). Now he is spoil in the most remarkable way, for he had been on wrong lines: as a Levite, he should not have had land; but now he sells the land and is in keeping with what God has.
P.L. So his name is Joseph -- "God will add".
{328}
Rem. The money was laid at the feet of the apostles; at the feet of those who know something about distribution.
J.T. And had authority, too; so that the thought of king Lemuel is running along here; whereas the virtuous woman is seen in all these qualities. The Lord had no lack of spoil; He had abundance of it through the assembly.
A.F.M. The virtuous woman thus seen in these qualities secures spoil for king Lemuel. The initial Hebrew letter of each verse (from verse 10) follows the alphabetical order, as taxing language in describing the virtuous woman's worth.
P.L. Would you say the enemy discerns, so to speak, the danger to his realm of this perfectly balanced character of things of the man and woman in the assembly, that he at once moves imitatively with a man and woman to corrupt this -- Ananias and Sapphira; it says she was privy to it.
J.T. I thought we might look at that and other features of discipline, if the Lord permit, in the following chapters, so that we may see how extensive this thought is -- that the Lord does not lack spoil; He has it through the assembly.
Ques. Is the thought of the heave-offering the negating of what is selfish in regard to us?
J.T. Quite. It is a spontaneous movement of the heart Godward. That is the idea of the heave-offering, and of course Joseph here, surnamed Barnabas, son of consolation, had that; but the fact that he had lands shows that *he is now spoil*. He is taken out of that setting. A Levite was not to have that; his portion was always in the city. Now he is coming into the city; he is spoil in a very striking way, *adding* to what was already there.
Ques. In the working out of this matter of actually having possessions today, what is your explanation of the position?
{329}
J.T. The point is unselfishness. When we come to Paul's ministry, provision is made for persons to have material things, that they use them under the Lord for the promotion of His interests. So that we should not trust in the uncertainty of riches, but should be liberal and give. One is really regarded as a steward, and we are to use what we have for the promotion of the Lord's interests. The point is unselfishness, that if a man is converted, comes in amongst us, and has some means, and holds them in relation to the Lord's interests, he is really doing the same thing, in principle, as Barnabas did. There are no apostles at whose feet we may lay these material things, but one is really responsible to the Lord to administer it himself. Of course, he can give through the assembly, too.
W.R. "Knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement", @2 Corinthians 1: 7.
J.T. Quite so. At Antioch the word was: "according as any one of the disciples was well off", @Acts 11: 29. They are contemplated as having means and they gave for the need in Jerusalem. They used what they had.
R.W.S. Why is the birthplace of Barnabas at Cyprus called attention to?
J.T. It is used rather sorrowfully later. He was a Cyprian by birth. He had difficulty later, as of course a man like this may have, even the most spiritual. It says, "and Barnabas taking Mark sailed away to Cyprus" (@Acts 15: 39), as if earlier links had been a snare. He and Mark went off for the moment on natural lines.
C.A.M. Perhaps as a Levite he had overreached himself in going so far afield as that originally.
J.T. Quite so. It was far away from where a Levite should be -- in the land, in relation to the
{330}
temple of God. I think that in our chapter he is showing that he is a true Levite, a man that is unselfish.
P.L. It says in regard of Cyprus: "and having sighted Cyprus, and left it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria", @Acts 21: 3. Then there was the brother Mnason, who had come from Cyprus. It seems that he had *left it*, and would now entertain Paul.
J.T. He had a setting in Jerusalem. He was to lodge Paul there.
{331}
BURYING OUR DEAD
@Genesis 47: 29 - 31; @Genesis 49: 28 - 32
I had in mind, dear brethren, to speak a little as to *faith*, for aside from it what we are about to do, in burying our dead, would only be on a common level; faith takes us out of that, and whilst we are engaged in this service of burying our dead, we are in spirit in the land of the living. Faith takes us there and the power of God through faith sustains us there. So that the Lord in speaking of the dead in Christ, said, "But concerning the dead that they rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses, in the section of the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, *I* am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living", @Mark 12: 26, 27. It is faith that brings us into that realm whilst outwardly having to do with one that has died.
That our sister is dead is a solemn fact. Of the one who wrote these pages it is said, "Moses my servant is dead", @Joshua 1: 2. Let there be no mistake about that! Having lived one hundred and twenty years he died, and Jehovah said of him, "Moses my servant is dead". Faith accepts that; and in this passage in @Genesis 47 it is said, "And the days of Israel approached that he should die" (verse 29). This not an allusion to an accident. The time drew nigh when Israel -- the spiritual designation of Jacob -- *must* die. So that the dates of the home-going of the saints are in the divine calendar, as it were, and each of those who are thus in it must die. The record is anticipatively kept. There are no accidents in the realm of faith. This solemn matter of death came into the world in the path of sin: "as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death and thus death passed upon
{332}
all men, for that all have sinned", @Romans 5: 12. That is a great generality.
But while some of the Lord's people die, all live to God; we are alive on the principle of faith, and as each one's day to fall asleep comes, it will not be a moment before or after in the divine account. It is a fixed matter with God. Death as an element has come in and is taken account of as assisting those who have faith, those who believe. The first one who died had faith, that is Abel. The first death was that of a believer; but faith takes us out of death, out of the penalty of death. What is so touching in regard to this line of thought is, that the beloved Son of God died -- the day came when He *must* die, not that he was not immune personally, for He was. Death had no claim over Him, but according to the appointment of the divine will He must die, and that fact changes the whole position, because if Jesus enters into death, He deals with it, abolishes it -- all of which He has done. So that we look at the one who dies as like Moses. "Moses my servant is dead", says Jehovah. Were He to speak now He would say that our sister is dead, as the Lord said, "Lazarus has died". We accept that; it is the will of God; it is no accident; it is according to the divine calendar.
The day arrived when Israel must die -- and he died; but not until everything was settled. Every matter was settled in the position of responsibility, so that chapter 49 tells us that in dying he *blessed*. The twelve tribes come into view; and so it is with a parent like our sister-she has died. The twelve tribes are not looked upon as dead, they are blessed -- every one of them (chapter 49: 28). That is to say, we are in the presence of the living in burying our dead out of our sight. We need not enlarge on how important it is, and how it changes the whole position. The unbelief that our hearts are prone to,
{333}
brings the burial of a saint down to the common level; whereas faith lifts us into the realm of the living. "Moses my servant is dead", but then the Lord Jesus says that he lives; and he came out on the mount of transfiguration to speak to Jesus. It was a matter of the power of God to do that, but it shows how God looks at things, and what His power means. Faith lays hold of this power, and thus we accept the fact of death according to divine appointment. The Son of God has died. It is an actual fact that He died. The day came when He must die. There was no obligation attaching to Him personally, as I said. It was vicarious. Nevertheless, in the divine appointment, He must die. He must die vicariously for the will of God and the blessing of man. No death was ever more real than that of the Son of God. He lay in the heart of the earth; "thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights", @Matthew 12: 40. He actually died, but He is risen, and that is the ground on which we are here today. We understand He is risen from among the dead, "who is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him", @1 Peter 3: 22. So that now it is a question of everything and everyone who is His; and for everyone who dies in faith the Lord Jesus will come, according to the sure word of the Spirit through the apostle Paul in @1 Thessalonians 4: 16, 17. For us it is only a matter of days or years, or perhaps hours. You see the position-how clear it is. How real death and resurrection are! There is nothing more real than the resurrection. There is a risen Man in heaven in whose hands everything and every person is. The matter is all settled; the day of the resurrection of the saints is on the calendar too. Faith lays hold of this, we christians are going on to that glorious end.
{334}
Now, I want to point out how particular Jacob was as to burial and as to where it was to be. He enjoined his son Joseph that he should be buried with his fathers. Joseph says, "I will do as thou hast said" (chapter 47: 30). That was not enough for Jacob, he says, "Swear unto me" (verse 31); not that he would doubt his beloved son, but the matter was so important that he required an oath. You might say, What does it matter where he is buried? but the Spirit of God recording it means that it really does matter. You say, What is the difference? The difference lies in the fact that at this time Jacob was speaking and thinking in faith. It is only as men and women think and speak in faith that their words have any value. The word *faith* is scarcely found in the Old Testament; but the *thing* is there, that is the point. When we understand the thing we can put a name on it. A writer in the New Testament said, "By faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped on the top of his staff", @Hebrews 11: 21. He did these things by faith. These verses are on that platform in the New Testament. Jacob is thinking and speaking in faith and he is saying, I am to be buried with those who are to live -- "in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is opposite to Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite along with the field for a possession of a sepulchre" (chapter 49: 30). Ordinary graveyards cannot be designated in that way; believers and unbelievers are buried side by side today, but it was not so then. This graveyard was not secured for unbelievers. When the Lord Jesus comes to this graveyard in the field of Machpelah, they will all come out, every one of them. It will not be so in any graveyard in this country at "the first resurrection", some will not come out and some
{335}
will, for the unbelieving dead will not be raised until a thousand years after the dead in Christ are raised (@Revelation 20). The principle of the cave of Machpelah is that it is the burying ground of those that believe. Jacob would ordinarily trust Joseph but here he makes him swear. It is so important that we should understand that as believers die they are buried in the light of the fact that they are to be raised; the Lord Jesus will come to where we are placed and we shall all come out.
In chapter 49, Jacob charged all his sons as to his burial: "he charged them and said to them, I am gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is opposite to Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite along with the field for a possession of a sepulchre" (verses 29, 30). The title-deeds of this burying place are marked out very clearly. This is a spiritual account of a graveyard. All the intelligences of heaven would understand what this means, that this graveyard is secured on the principle of redemption. From whom it is bought, who bought it, and finally the persons buried there, are plainly stated. Look at their names: "There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife; and there I buried Leah" (verse 31). It is all a spiritual matter, and intended by the Spirit of God for such an occasion as is before us today. It is a question of the living, that we bury in the light of the resurrection, knowing that for God all believers live. Where our sister has gone is as clearly marked out in heaven as the cave of Machpelah was; she is *with Christ*, until He comes to claim her in the body, taking her out of "Machpelah" to be with Himself in a body like His own, for ever. Her
{336}
death, too, is through His instrumentality; note that word; "those who have fallen asleep through Jesus". He has had to say as to the closing of her eyes, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints", @Psalm 116: 15. Whatever the infidel mind might think, God will mark the spot and will know where to come where our sister is buried -- she will be buried among the living, as I said. The Lord will know where to come, and will call each saint by name as He said, "Lazarus, come forth", @John 11: 43. "All who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth", @John 5: 28.
I hope these thoughts will be a comfort to our bereaved brother and his family, also to us all. We are bound in the strongest links, and share in united sympathy with them in this matter of burial and resurrection. It is a question of the divine calendar, so to speak, when we die and when we arise. As to our sister and all who have died in Christ, when the voice of the Son of God shall be heard they "shall go forth ... to resurrection of life", @John 5: 29.
{337}
SPOIL (6)
@Acts 5: 11 - 16; @Acts 6: 8 - 15
J.T. It will be remembered that we began the last reading with the passage in Proverbs speaking of the woman of worth whose husband would have no lack of spoil. It was seen that the allusion is to Christ, that is, to the husband, and the woman of worth is the assembly. So that the section of the subject before us was spoil that accrues to Christ from the assembly, as seen in the Acts particularly; spoil arising from various exigencies as in chapter 2; what accrued from the outset, the Spirit having come. Peter's first gospel address had great results, but particularly in the qualities that marked those who believed in Jerusalem, and the spirit of love governing them; subjection to the teaching of the apostles and persevering in it. So that a state of things was found at Jerusalem to which the Lord could add, and to which He did add "such as should be saved". Following on that we spoke of chapter 4, what marked the company in their prayer, what they said; then Barnabas coming in at the end, the son of consolation, one who was indeed spoil, in the sense of service, linking up the work of God subsequently.
The thought now is to see from chapter 5 the spoil that accrues from *discipline*; from needed discipline being enacted in the assembly, and then in chapter 6 the spoil flowing out of the means taken to meet murmuring; in meeting the murmuring amongst the saints seven deacons come into view, and particularly Stephen and Philip; there was remarkable spoil for Christ evident in these two men.
{338}
W.R. Would you say that they were all in accord with the disciplinary action that had taken place previously? "And they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch" (verse 12).
J.T. Yes. The paragraph read contemplates the effect of the discipline, that is, fear: "And great fear came upon all the assembly" (verse 11). Then God acted and the apostles, through Peter, are greatly signalised in this paragraph, as if God would extol what was of Himself in the way of moral authority as the outcome of such conditions.
C.A.M. Would you say that acquirement of spoil is the result of meeting some adverse thing? You mentioned discipline and also murmuring. These were things that looked like a great disadvantage, but they turned out to be for blessing.
J.T. That is what appears, that in these things being met in the assembly, typified in the woman of worth whose husband gets spoil, the Lord is increasing His wealth. It was accomplished through the exercises and conflicts that were going on in the assembly at that time, and correspondingly now. As we face exigencies of this kind with God there will be spoil, and God is thus seen in the three Persons of the Trinity in meeting this evil. Peter first alludes to the Holy Spirit, then to God, identifying Him as God, and then the Lord. The Godhead is brought into this matter of discipline.
A.F.M. Does that show how serious it is to transgress -- to act independently of God who now dwelt in the assembly?
J.T. That is what is intended to be brought out. The Deity was involved; God was there. First, Peter says to Ananias: "Why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?" (verse 3). Then later he says, "Thou hast not lied to men, but to God" (verse 4). And then he says to Sapphira,
{339}
"Why is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?" (verse 9). So that there is the thought of the Holy Spirit formally sinned against, and then God as such, and then the Spirit of the *Lord*. Each of these features of the Deity was trespassed against in this offence, for God was asserting Himself in His assembly.
J.S. Would great fear, spoken of in verse 11, make way for the authority of the Lord? "And believers were more than ever added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women" (verse 14).
J.T. That is what I thought we might see, in those who were "added to the Lord", and then the dignity attaching to the twelve apostles. The allusion to them is as in Solomon's porch, as if they are segregated in the thought of the Spirit so as to signalise them at this juncture as representative of divine authority.
A.N.W. 'No one daring to join them' goes along with 'the multitude that were added to the Lord'.
J.T. Yes. No one dared to move of himself. It was that sort of restraining power; such moral dignity attaching to the position. The apostles stand out in this way in Solomon's porch. The allusion is to them; no one dared to identify himself with them. They were dignified and yet to be seen publicly, for Solomon's porch was a public resort. Anyone could see these men there; God was calling attention to what they were.
Ques. In relation to our committal as at the end of Matthew, it is said that the disciples were to be baptized to the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; is it the divine thought that nothing less than the whole idea is to be answered to on our part in responsibility here?
J.T. That is right, it is one thought. The sin was against God.
{340}
Ques. Should we not realise that we must start with that?
J.T. Yes. Christianity is in that light, according to Matthew, baptised to the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It is really one name, embodying the three glorious Persons. We are baptised to that and in that light, but now the sin was against the assembly. Where God was to be honoured, where every whit was to say, "Glory", this terrible thing was introduced; two persons acted together to sin against God in His house, in His assembly.
R.W.S. Is this the first formal mention of the assembly in this book?
J.T. It is, if you omit chapter 2: "And the Lord added to the assembly" (verse 47). The words, "to the assembly", are said to be doubtful. This is therefore the first mention and use of the word "assembly", save in Matthew.
Ques. How would you describe this sin -- as religious or commercial, or of what kind?
J.T. I should say it was pride. It was the spirit of emulation to be equal with Barnabas. Rivalry takes various forms in us, perhaps. We might appear to give more than another and in doing so we act deceitfully, covering up something.
A.F.M. Does this deception go back to the garden of Eden, where the first lie was told by Satan? Is this sin of Ananias the devil's way of introducing something that he had introduced earlier in the garden of Eden, where he lied to Eve?
J.T. Quite so -- Here, as you say, Satan did it; he put it into their hearts -- a terrible thought! Peter says, "Why has Satan filled thy heart?" Satan had already acted against Christ in that way in entering into Judas heart; to betray the Lord.
{341}
He utilised as instruments these two persons to attack the assembly, and so to attack God.
A.N.W. Is there also a subtle danger of imitating what had just been done whole-heartedly by Barnabas?
J.T. That is the thing. It would have been acceptable if they had laid it all down, or if they had stated frankly that they were keeping back part. It was what is done by most of us in giving. We give according to Paul's instructions on the principle of equality; so that there was no need at all for this movement. It was Satan's work; he led them on to add selfishness to pride, by keeping back *part* of the price, but pretending to give *all*.
C.A.M. Do you connect this work of Satan with the fact that the gates of hades shall not prevail against the assembly?
J.T. I think this is an illustration of it, how there is power in the assembly to meet it. God set out at the beginning the fulness of the thought of the assembly. Later on, of course, things lapsed; but at the beginning He set out the intactness of it as He had furnished it. It acted fully in its function here, so that as viewed as the virtuous woman, the Lord, her Husband, is known in the gates. The authority of Christ is seen in Solomon's porch, because the point is the dignity of these men, the apostles; anyone could see them there and be affected by their presence. The Lord was known in the gates and was not lacking in spoil. The passage shows that great results accrued; what was of the Lord was added to.
J.S. Is Solomon's porch introduced to dignify the twelve?
J.T. It was a public place to which anybody could go. The Lord had been there Himself and suffered in it, and now His apostles are in the same position. It is Christ known where He suffered.
{342}
They are standing out in moral dignity, representing Christ in His authority.
W.R. Is it what they were personally? The apostle speaks of what he was personally in the glad tidings as writing to the Philippians, "in all the praetorium" (chapter 1: 13).
J.T. Quite so. His bonds in Christ were known in all the praetorium. Here it is a public place where the Lord Himself had been, and now these representatives of His are there. They acted for Him and are seen in their austerity against sin in the assembly, and there are additions to the Lord, not only men and women, but *believers*; no mere professors, but believers -- real spoil.
J.T.Jr. Does Peter represent spiritual discernment in recognising the action of Ananias here?
J.T. I think that is right. What is proper to the assembly is discernment, especially in the exercise of discipline. It is more the spiritual side of the position; "the Holy Spirit", and "the Spirit of the Lord".
J.S. Are the twelve seen as superseding the temple, and now God is speaking through them?
J.T. I think that is the point, to bring out the dignity of the twelve and what it was that gave them that dignity. They had it; "but of the rest durst no man join them". There was such a quality there that it was no light matter to be in such a position; for they stand out in their dignity. And then even the shadow of Peter, representing the twelve -- the best of them, so to speak -- evidently effected cures.
J.S. The shadow of Peter moving in the light of Christ risen, would involve blessing for those who came under it.
J.T. I think that is right; the shadow was beneficial; it was not a hiding of the glory of Christ. That is, what had marked the Lord here, cures
{343}
of all kinds of diseases, is now markedly evident through Peter. There was no opaqueness in Peter that hindered the shining out of the curative power of Christ.
C.A.M. The casting of Peter's shadow would show that he was a man of substance.
Ques. Would the Old Testament represent a shadow of the thing that was seen in Christ?
J.T. That is right; that is what is said in Hebrews. There are two words used; one is *type*, and the other is *shadow*. Shadow is the throwing forward of what was coming.
A.F.M. Was the shadow of Peter, which effected these cures in the nature of spoil, over against what had dishonoured God through Ananias and Sapphira?
J.T. I think so. The twelve were heaven's best. That is, I think, how they are regarded. Peter had already said, "Look on us". He said that of himself and John. Now the Spirit of God gives us this position after the remarkable demonstration of divine resentment of evil in the assembly; a remarkable thing, that two persons should fall down and die. It was not that Peter killed them, for that way would not do. It was simply that he spoke judicially in the power of the Spirit, and they fell down and died. They were cared for after death. They were respected in this sense and are viewed as believers.
A.F.M. You would not question the earlier sincerity of their faith on account of what they had done?
J.T. No; I should regard it as a sin unto death. But they had a burial; not like what is said in Ecclesiastes; "If a man ... have no burial, I say an untimely birth is better than he" (chapter 6: 3). I suppose they will share in the first resurrection.
{344}
E.E.H. Would Peter's history give a lustre to this matter? As a recovered man he speaks and gives a challenge to Satan, who desired to sift him as wheat earlier. Here now he is a recovered man as under the hand of Christ.
J.T. Quite so. I suppose Satan had desired to sift them all. The "you" is, of course, plural, but Peter is singled out in the Lord's mind. So it is all the apostles here; the product of Christ, what He had here; heaven's best, outstanding after this solemn discipline as if God were honouring them. Peter had vindicated His name in the assembly. It is just what should be done. God is honouring them now.
A.N.W. You think that this group in the porch are the apostles?
J.T. I think that is what is meant; they are in view. It says, "And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch ... )" (verse 12). I would say that they are to be regarded as the apostles.
C.A.M. In John's gospel the Son of God moved in that area, as in superiority to all the power of evil, so that nothing could prevail against Him.
J.T. Yes; they surrounded Him there, but He found an outlet and went back to the place where John baptised at first. He went back to first principles and carried on. I think now what is emphasised here is the apostles acting in such power in vindicating God in His house, that they are honoured, so that the work of God goes on. "And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people" (verse 12). They had exercised discipline, but they carry on the real work that is proper to the dispensation. They exercise curative power. Thus are they seen here. But the people magnified them; like Joshua,
{345}
God said He would magnify him. They are magnified in the eyes of the people and the work of God goes on in regard of the Lord. Believers -- multitudes of them -- were added to the Lord. I think that is a fine trophy, that is, spoil arising out of all this -- men and women, believers added to the Lord. We have had before us a man and woman acting together in unbelief and wickedness, but here they are believers added to the *Lord*.
A.F.M. That should encourage us locally to be faithful to the Lord and to one another, instead of being afraid to say something or do something for fear of losing one or another of our number. On the other hand, there should be addition instead of subtraction.
J.T. That is the divine way. "Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations. Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel?" @Numbers 23: 9, 10. There will be a large Israel, notwithstanding that they dwell alone.
F.H.L. Is it like the glory appearing in the wilderness after the judgment?
J.T. I think so; God coming in and honouring those who acted for Him.
Ques. Is it your thought that we should have additions when we have had subtractions? The assembly should be able to attract; instead of losing we gain by discipline exercised according to God.
J.T. Quite so. God adding -- God honours true discipline by adding to the Lord, because the point is to bring out that, the dignity of the apostles and the authority of the Lord.
A.B.P. Would the word of Peter, "Thou hast not lied to men, but to God" (verse 4), be like the underlying principle involved in this? In cases of difficulty, a definite principle or position is brought to light. Is that essential?
{346}
J.T. The state of the two persons is brought out, so that when the woman comes in, Peter says to her, "Tell me if ye gave the estate for so much?" He would bring the thing out, the real state of things. She said, "Yes, for so much" (verse 8). There was collusion in the sin. Peter said to her, "Why is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Lo, the feet of those that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out" (verse 9). He is recognising her dignity, who she was, but she has to suffer in the meantime; it is a sin unto death and there is no changing of that! John says, "There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request", @1 John 5: 16.
Ques. Peter uses the evidence of two separate confessions to charge her with being linked with another, as he says, "ye have agreed together ..." Is that like a party?
J.T. It is an act of collusion in evil. Of course we may agree together in good, too. As Matthew says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens", @Matthew 18: 19. That is the opposite of this. Matthew deals in two's; he speaks of two demoniacs, and conditions are so bad when you get evil of that kind banded, that nobody can pass that way. But also he says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" -- an immense thing in remnant times. But here are two of the assembly, alas! undoubtedly christians, but in the hands of the devil, brought so under his power as to enter into collusion in introducing deception into the assembly. It was a spiritual attack, and
{347}
hence the stress on the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of the Lord.
J.S. Peter is able to name what the sin is: "to tempt the Spirit of the Lord". That was very serious.
J.T. I think it is good to see that; Peter stresses how divine Persons were affected by this.
R.W.S. Is the reference to the feet of Peter at which Sapphira falls, and the hands of the apostles and the shadow of Peter to dignify the personnel of the assembly?
J.T. Just so. The personnel of the assembly is a point that Matthew makes. We ought to read these accounts as to the assembly in Acts with Matthew, because it is the vessel of the public testimony that is in mind. After the confession of Peter and the announcement of the assembly in @Matthew 16, then you get the personnel, that is, on the mount. What dignity attaches to those who form it! The mount of transfiguration is what Christ was, you might say, judicially. "His face shone as the sun". It is the thought of rule; and then as they were coming down from the mountain, the thought of sonship comes into evidence. The sons are free, the Lord says. The association with Christ is asserted when He says, "Take that and give it to them for me and thee", @Matthew 17: 27. The distinction attaching to the personnel of the assembly that is coming out here is in the act of holy government: how faithful Peter was, how spiritual he was, how he vindicated the holy, spiritual constitution of the assembly and God's presence there in a three-fold character.
J.S. Is this glory over against all the deadness and darkness which had befallen judaism?
J.T. Exactly. It was the public position in Solomon's porch as over against the whole paraphernalia of the temple, as indeed we have in the Beautiful gate in chapter 3. Everything now
{348}
attached to what God was doing through these men. "Look on us" -- attention was called to them.
J.S. Peter is consciously walking in the glory of the Lord, and hence his shadow was effective in a curative way.
Rem. It is not only the teaching, but also the fellowship of the apostles, fellowship in all they are doing, as in judgment here.
Ques. Does the testimony widen here from the porch to the whole city of Jerusalem, as mentioned in verse 16?
J.T. It widens out more than that; it widens out to the cities round about. "And the multitude also of the cities round about came together to Jerusalem, bringing sick persons and persons beset by unclean spirits, who were all healed". That is what was said about Christ in His ministering here. He healed them all. It is the virtuous woman, as it were, His wife, and she is maintaining all this and He is known in the gates. He is not here personally. He is known through her. It is an immense thing to see in our times, as walking in the light of the assembly, that we carry on in this way -- maintaining the thought of the virtuous woman -- that things are not allowed to go by the board. Things are dealt with, involving good housekeeping, involving needed discipline.
A.C. Is that why God honours Peter in such a remarkable way? In chapter 8 we would see his spiritual discernment in answering Simon Magus, whose evil state had evidently escaped Philip's notice.
J.T. Quite so; the apostles come into evidence there again; because it was the apostles that were at Jerusalem that sent them out. "And the apostles who were in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter
{349}
and John" (verse 14) -- their *best*, as it were. They were representative of the twelve.
J.S. The Lord had said that they should do greater works. I suppose verses 15 and 16 would show greater works as a result of His having gone on high and having sent the Spirit here.
J.T. Things are going on so the Husband is well known. They are not arrogating anything to themselves. It is in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, as Peter says. So that He is known in the gates. Solomon's porch is like the gate, a public place. The Lord had suffered there, but now He is known there as represented in these men.
J.T.Jr. Do you think the sick should be brought into the streets today?
J.T. I think so; if it is the street corresponding with Jerusalem. "Street" is used several times in Acts. Streets have a great place in a city. It is in Jerusalem, where God was still acting in mercy.
W.R. What about beds and couches? What would they suggest?
J.T. Well, the bed is a greater thought than the couch, but in any case the sick are laid out so that they get all the advantage that these comforts give, as awaiting Peter's shadow.
Rem. Beds and couches might indicate that they were helpless people.
J.T. Quite so. You get the idea of a couch throughout in this respect. In chapter 9 you get it; Aeneas was on a couch. It is a good thing to have a couch, a provision especially for one who is ill. The palsied man was borne by four. They bore the couch and let *it* down through the roof, showing that the couch has some meaning in itself. It alludes, I think, to the *circumstances* in which we are.
A.B.P. We noticed in the Old Testament that there were certain gradations of the spoil, as David's
{350}
spoil. Would you say those who are added to the Lord would be like David's spoil; whereas those who were cured would be of lesser importance?
J.T. I think that is a good way of putting it. David's spoil was certain cattle driven before others, as if there was something there outstanding that would indicate that they belonged to David, something there that connected them with David specially. Here there are those added to the Lord; they are subject people. These are not people that exercise their own wills in the assembly. There can be no unity aside from this subjection as added to the *Lord*.
Rem. Is the Spirit in chapter 5 greater than in chapter 2?
J.T. Chapter 2 presents the great primary Pentecostal thought, and we cannot very well allow anything to be greater in that way; because the Pentecostal thought is in the foundation of the city. It is the Pentecostal assembly that we see in Revelation. The foundations had the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and these are the men of whom we are reading here; that is, God signalises these men, and they will be signalised in the future, their names being in the foundations of the city. We shall all be signalised in having our names written in heaven, but the apostles are specially so as having their names in the foundations of the city. What men they were!
C.A.M. What a glorious thing it will be to see the shining of Christ in His assembly by-and-by! To see the features of Christ worked out in these conditions is most interesting.
J.T. Chapter 2 is characteristically the Pentecostal assembly in its foundations. How surely they were laid! -- that is to say, not only as to the truth, the teaching of the apostles, but the quality of the men and that of their converts, what the
{351}
Lord could add to. Peter says now, "Look on us". It is largely a question of quality when you come to the heavenly city. In @Revelation 5 we have the *judicial* thought. You do not get that stressed earlier in this book. We come now to the judicial side of the position, and the apostles are as true there as they were in preaching the gospel.
J.H.E. Was the superstructure being reared up at that time?
J.T. Yes, on the judicial side. How can you build up any community aside from the judicial department? It is one of the most important points to consider in the things of God; it is greatly stressed, especially in Matthew. That is what we are considering now and the fruit or spoil that accrues to Christ out of it. If you bring in extraneous matter as in Corinthians, then the fire has to be applied. Today much, alas! has to be left to run on until the coming of the Lord, but they are not left here; dealing with them is not left until the coming of the Lord. Paul says in writing to the Corinthians, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha", @1 Corinthians 16: 22. He is doing his best throughout the letter to bring about a judicial condition at Corinth, and he does it by bringing to their attention the worst kind of sin, but there were many other matters. The judicial department would need to be active for a good while, but he got them on to judicial lines. That is what God honours in our chapter, the judicial side of the assembly.
Ques. Will you say something about @Matthew 11 in relation to your remarks as to Matthew?
J.T. Well, the judicial side is stressed, but then it says, "Woe to thee. Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the works of power which have taken place in you, had taken place in Tyre and
{352}
Sidon, they had long ago repented in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in judgment-day than for you" (verses 21, 22). The Lord was not dealing actually with them now; He was dealing with them *morally*. It was only a matter of time until His judgment be executed. He says, "in judgment-day". It is comparative judgment, a very important thing, and so now it is carried on here to the assembly. They are dealing with some of their own. "For what have *I* to do with judging those outside also? *ye*, do not ye judge them that are within? But those without God judges", @1 Corinthians 5: 12, 13. But we must judge those that are within, and they were doing it here.
A.N.W. That throws light on those words: "More than ever added". That could not be but for the excellent foundation there.
J.T. Quite so. This foundation stood.
J.S. Solomon's porch coming into view -- and heaven honouring the twelve -- would lay the moral background for the address of Stephen.
J.T. Quite so. I thought that if we go on to chapter 6 we shall see how another phase -- another attack of the enemy -- is met. It was not so serious as the case of Ananias and Sapphira, and yet it might become serious because it was a sectional matter. "But in those days, the disciples multiplying in number, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews because their widows were overlooked in the daily ministration", @Acts 6: 1. This is because of increased numbers. The quality evidently was deteriorating and it had to be met. This attack of the enemy is through deterioration amongst the people of God because of the murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews. That would mean that those from a distance, the Grecian Jews who had believed, were affected against the poor Hebrews who were local in Jerusalem -- a very
{353}
subtle sort of thing and only because their widows were neglected. But there was a *murmuring*, that is the point.
Ques. So that multiplication in itself is not spirituality, is it?
J.T. It may be the very opposite; it may afford material for the enemy, as, alas! we have proved; persons who are allowed in and have never understood the principles that govern the saints.
J.T.Jr. So "added to the Lord" would be over against that.
J.T. The setting would show that. Chapter 11, as we shall see, carries that thought on; it alludes to the *kind* of material that is being added now -- believers added to *the Lord*.
A.F.M. Do you think the murmuring would have been prevented if the ministry of Paul had been introduced that the saints are one body? They would evidently regard themselves here as sectional.
J.T. The ministry of Paul helps, specially, but in spite of it, you get feelings of this kind. But our point now is to show how wisely it was met, and how we get these great products out of it, namely, Stephen and Philip, the best sort of material, or spoil. The Spirit of God calls attention to Stephen's face, what it was, reflective of heaven; and then in Philip we get one so likeable to the Spirit that He raptures him.
Ques. Do you think there was a drop in spiritual tone here with the apostles?
J.T. It seems so. The Spirit of God now proceeds with these two of the seven deacons, and the scattered ones later in chapter 8.
J.T.Jr. "But *we* will give ourselves up to prayer and the ministry of the word" (chapter 6: 4). That was a very high level, was it not?
J.T. Quite so. Still Stephen and Philip with the "scattered ones" are now more before the mind
{354}
of the Spirit, looking on to Paul. The tent of testimony is definitely moving.
C.A.M. Do I understand that what is in your mind is that where there is an increase of numbers, there might on the one hand be more opportunity for Satan, but on the other hand when the thing is met there is a glory that is very special?
J.T. That is the thing to see, the kind of spoil that the Lord gains out of this murmuring. It is really a question of the spirits of these two men, not simply what they had, but the spirit in which they acted -- what quality marked them -- beginning in a lowly way as deacons they obtained "for themselves a good degree, and much boldness in faith which is in Christ Jesus", @1 Timothy 3: 13. They shine for Christ. It seems to me that the Lord, through the writer here, puts them out in the front -- David's spoil again of another kind.
F.H.L. Those of the increase are now called disciples.
J.T. Yes, the first occurrence of the word in the book. We should note especially Stephen and Philip -- what God effected in them, using the language of David as to them, for they are as it were David's spoil. They are outstanding; they are before others. There were seven of them but two outstanding; that is the principle, a comparison. Peter and John are outstanding among the twelve apostles; but these two are the product of Christ through these exercises.
A.F.M. They were Hellenists.
J.T. Quite so. He met their murmuring by taking up two of their own kind. It shows the wisdom with which things are done. That is what we ought to see here.
J.T.Jr. Stephen was full of grace and power. He was courageous and yet of a gracious and humble spirit.
{355}
J.T. Quite so. We have power in discipline in chapter 5, but it is *wisdom* that meets this matter, so that wisdom is an immense thing in dealing with difficulties amongst the brethren.
A.B.P. Would the dignity seen in these judicial actions, first of all in Peter, and later in Stephen (because his action really was judicial with the nation), link on with @Psalm 122 -- the idea of the thrones for judgment?
J.T. That is very good. Stephen's speech is an indictment. He is judging them morally. "*Ye* do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers, *ye* also" (chapter 7: 51). That is a settled matter. The state of things in Jerusalem is exposed and morally settled by this wonderful address of Stephen, and you can understand how the Lord would point to him. And He does; He uses Luke to point us to this man, and later on Philip's labours occupy us as important spoil. The Lord has that spoil -- it is a product of the assembly.
C.A.M. Stephen's was a wonderful address; it cost him his life to make it.
Ques. Is the spoil here in Stephen seen in new covenant glories?
J.T. It is covenant glory, but it is more *heavenly* glory. It is no less than the shining of heaven in the countenance of this man. "And all who sat in the council, looking fixedly on him, saw his face as the face of an angel" (chapter 6: 15). The Lord is pointing to him. He is making these councillors look at him. They look fixedly on him and there it was, heavenly glory shining in his face.
J.S. I suppose we should see grace on the Lord's part in so enhancing Stephen that what he has to say might be received.
J.T. What a beautiful testimony it was! Stephen is the best sort of an example you can get of one taking on the glory of an environment; as has been
{356}
alluded to, taking on the covenant glory from the face of Jesus. But Stephen is going beyond that; it is not now the shining of grace, it is judicial. It is the shining of an angel -- "as the face of an angel". It is the principle of taking on the glory of an environment. Stephen took it on, but it was judicial glory. Moses face shone with the glory of the covenant, but now we have God coming in judicially after the shining of covenant glory. The time was up, God is calling a halt; the glory was mounting up and about to leave from the threshold of the house as in Ezekiel's day. Stephen's testimony brought that out, so that they send him after the Lord, and say, "We will not that this man should reign over us", @Luke 19: 14. That finishes the matter. It is now a question of God's coming in and dealing with this obdurate state of things.
Ques. "And behold, a throne stood in the heaven, and upon the throne one sitting, and he that was sitting like in appearance to a stone of jasper and a sardius, and a rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald", @Revelation 4: 2, 3. Did Stephen reflect that?
J.T. There was something of that to be seen, I am sure; but here is a man bringing in the mind of heaven. It is a judicial heaven now.
A.N.W. According to Luke, the angels in the tomb looked like men, but this man has the face of a heavenly being.
J.T. I think it is more like Matthew, the face of the angel who sat on the tomb. It says, "And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow", @Matthew 28: 2, 3. I think there is a link between that angel and Stephen. He dies praying for his murderers, but the whole address and the whole position
{357}
is judicial, and it is the Son of man he sees in heaven; not the Messiah, but the Son of man.
C.A.M. There is a remarkable link with Matthew. He alludes to the Lord's face shining as the sun. At the end he refers to another feature of the creation, saying the countenance of the angel was like lightning. It was evidently a judicial matter.
J.T. Quite so; a very solemn thing, and for faith, a very important thing, that God is going on, as we had it in Matthew: "At that time, Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent [that was judicial], and has revealed them to babes", @Matthew 11: 25. God is going on; Stephen sees the Son of man standing and the glory of God is there, but it is the Son of man now; that is, God is taking a new course now.
A.F.M. Does the "face of an angel" here refer to what is evangelic, or does it suggest what is judicial in character?
J.T. The angels are executors of grace, but they are executors of judgment, and I think that is the idea there, that it is the mind of heaven now because the position was changing. It is Son of man instead of Messiah, and that is what would be reflected in Stephen's face. Christ as presented in grace to Israel in the testimony of the twelve was refused.
A.F.M. Yes; the great grace that marked these men earlier is very significant, but now the scene has changed.
J.T. Stephen begins with glory, the God of glory; and he shows that the glory had shone in all the testimony, but had only met with resistance. I think Stephen's face would reflect what heaven thought of that.
Ques. Would the verse, "O stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, *ye* do always resist
{358}
the Holy Spirit" (verse 51), be like the lightning coming from the throne in @Revelation 4?
J.T. Quite so; it reflects the mind of heaven now. That is what Stephen's address leads up to; it is judicial, and yet he is praying for them. Personally he has no other thought than that.
Rem. They were being invited here to kiss the Son, but they did not answer to it.
W.B-w. Would this spirit of Stephen check the murmuring among the saints, the murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews?
J.T. Quite so. The angelic face is not seen there. It is seen in the *council*: it is for the councillors to see. Heaven's mind is changing, as it were, but as a deacon, one can understand what a soothing, pacifying and reconciling influence, he would exert.
J.S. In verse 8 he shines personally, does he not? It is a very short paragraph, but a remarkable one. "And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought wonders and great signs among the people".
J.T. I think that in speaking about him as passing on to his great service publicly and his appearance in the council, we should not forget the deacon's service and what marked him as in it, and how quickly he purchased to himself a good degree. He needed no one to confer anything on him. He was what he was. We do not need any friendships above us to bring us forward. He *purchased* to *himself* a good degree. That would refer to the character of his service.
W.B-w. He was full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and then it says he was also "full of grace". Would that not be a great contrast to Ananias and Sapphira? Satan filled their hearts.
J.T. Quite so; in him grace would be reigning. This is a great matter in these cases of discipline and murmuring and cleavages amongst us -- grace reigning, even in one who is serving the saints. It came
{359}
in in these seven men. I have no doubt that they were all more or less alike, but with Stephen, wherever he went around to the houses, grace would prevail. He was full of it; this was the result of his being full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. What binding influences he would exert as he filled his office as a deacon, and observing believers would say, That man is worthy of more distinction; and he purchased to himself a good degree in that way. That is the true way of promotion amongst the people of God. It is a question of what one *is*.
N.P. Does this signify a new departure in the ways of God -- passing on the service to non-commissioned men?
J.T. Yes. The subsequent promotion of Stephen and Philip is what they purchased themselves; they were equal to what promotion they got. Possibly Peter could not have done as well in the council as Stephen did. Stephen was the one suited for this great service.
W.B-w. The Judicial idea from the twelve is passed on to Stephen?
J.T. Yes; he is the man for this work; anybody could see it. They looked on him fixedly, and he reflected what was in heaven.
{360}
SPOIL (7)
@Acts 8: 1 - 8; @Acts 9: 15 - 20; @Acts 11: 19 - 26
J.T. It is well known that our subject is "Spoil", and the feature that is now before us is the spoil that accrues to Christ from the assembly, as is indicated in the virtuous woman in @Proverbs 31, of whose husband it is said that he is known in the gates and that he shall have no lack of spoil.
At our previous reading, the spoil that came before us was seen as the outcome of discipline in @Acts 5, and the outcome of murmuring being met in wisdom in chapter 6. Stephen and Philip stand out as "David's spoil", as was remarked. There were seven deacons, but these two were outstanding.
In the passages just read we shall see the further results of assembly conflict and exercise in the scattered ones, and Saul, who is presented in the record as the outcome of all this, is the most outstanding spoil that we have. It would be well to linger a little on Stephen and Philip, particularly on the judicial service of Stephen, which was in keeping with the appearance of his face as that of an angel, and represented the mind of heaven at that time. The testimony was moving, and at the turning, as it were, this judicial side appears, as in @Matthew 11 where God's dealings in the testimony judicially were stressed by the Lord Himself. Now in Stephen's address we have the same thing. There is a change over; there is a turn in the wall, as it were. The judicial side appears, so that the last word of Stephen's address is that they had killed the Just One; the murder of that Person who was characteristically *the* Just One was a crime inexcusable. The answer showed that the indictment was correct. It says: "And hearing these things they were cut to the heart, and gnashed their teeth against
{361}
him. But being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven ...". @Acts 7: 54, 55. That is the point now -- heaven. What he sees inside indicates a change. The mind of heaven is seen in that which came into his view. It is said that "he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God", and then his testimony to that is, "Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God" (verses 55, 56). The testimony is now turning towards the whole race of mankind, but we have this wonderful spoil in the testimony of Stephen. The accuracy of it spiritually and verbally, too, represented fully the judicial mind of heaven; and then finally we see the moral glory of the Lord Jesus shining in the vessel.
C.A.M. Stephen's countenance was like that of an angel. The countenance of the angel, at the close of Matthew's gospel, was like lightning, and it would seem to confirm what you say about the judicial matter. In @Matthew 24 it says, referring to lightning, "For as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man" (verse 27). Do you think that was one feature of the countenance of this man? It connects with the coming of the Son of man in Matthew.
J.T. Quite so. Now here the thought of the angel is dropped, and the moral glory of Jesus shines in Stephen, in priestly sympathy for his murderers; showing what a vessel he was, capable of representing the judicial side in the most accurate way. At the same time he represented the dispensation, for he was not losing sight of the fact that grace is still reigning, and that Jesus is still at the right hand of God and standing, ready to serve.
J.S. Seeing Jesus, as Son of man, would indicate a movement in the testimony toward the nations.
J.T. I think so; it is a wider glory. Nathanael said to the Lord, "Thou art the Son of God, thou
{362}
art the King of Israel" (@John 1: 49), connecting Jesus with Israel. In answer to that the Lord said, "Thou shalt see greater things than these. And he says to him, Verily, verily I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man" (verse 51). The wider glory is what is in mind now.
J.S. In connection with their refusal of Him, it says, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?" @John 6: 62.
A.N.W. Stephen would have all men in mind in making that reference to Jesus.
J.T. Yes. You will notice the Spirit of God gives an account of what he saw. "He saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God", but Stephen said, "Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God". The glory is where it can be diffused universally. He saw the glory of God -- but in heaven. The Shekinah had left Jerusalem and had gone up. In the gospel it is the glory of God in the face of Jesus. Paul says, "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", @2 Corinthians 4: 6. It is diffused from that point; hence Paul is the characteristic vessel of it, a competent minister of the new covenant. Stephen reflected judicial glory, but probably Paul the covenant glory. The glory that Stephen *sees* is undoubtedly covenant glory; a glory in which God is now ready to shine out universally. It had been shining wonderfully at Jerusalem, but now universally from that point -- the supreme point above.
W.R. Would you say that we are all allowed to look upon the glory of the Lord?
J.T. That is the thought. "But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face ...", @2 Corinthians 3: 18.
{363}
In the gospel it is the *glory of God* in the face of Jesus Christ, and this is shining in our hearts, for the shining forth (@2 Corinthians 4: 6).
C.N. Is there any significance in Stephen beginning his address with the God of glory appearing to Abraham?
J.T. There is; that would include all glory. As to Abraham and his family there was not only one covenant, but covenants, special glory attaching to each. Israel had utterly failed as to these glories; now all is secured above, as presented in what Stephen saw, and to be diffused through vessels here below, but seen finally in the heavenly city which descends from heaven having the glory of God. In this respect Paul was, as the Lord said, "an elect vessel unto me"; a further great trophy of spoil; a new title for one secured by the Lord, that is "an elect vessel unto me".
C.A.M. Stephen's attitude changed from the judicial aspect to one of service or priestly grace, and in that setting his spirit was actually received by the Lord Jesus. This seems to be more like the character of Luke's gospel -- grace.
J.T. I think the idea is the reflection of Christ in the vessel, in Stephen; not now an angel's face, but the reflection of Christ in His moral glory in suffering. How Stephen reminds us of Christ! Nothing is to be coveted more than that -- that one should remind the saints of Christ. He reminds us of Christ, not an angel, at the end of the chapter. You are struck with that. He acts like Christ and speaks like Him.
Ques. Is it still judicial?
J.T. I think it is more grace; he is praying for his murderers. He is a man able to execute judicial service, but not to lose sight of grace. In his own person, he is an exponent of both. His face shone as an angel, but now it is the moral glory of Jesus
{364}
in him; he is kneeling down, "praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (verse 59). You feel how strikingly he was like the Lord.
J.S. In his displaying such a spirit as he does here?
J.T. That is the idea, but he now reflects Christ above and that governs all that follows. Saul was there; we want to keep that in mind -- that Saul was there; he is to be the leading trophy in this section -- the spoil of David.
Ques. Do you think there will be a judicial message to the gentiles in the closing days of the assembly's history, somewhat akin to the message of Stephen to the Jews?
J.T. I think it is going on now. The ministry has taken on that character, the judicial character. If you read the *Collected Writings*, the prophetic side of matters, it will be seen how strongly the judicial side is in mind. We have, "God has judged your judgment upon her", @Revelation 18: 20. That is the judicial side, and no one is equal to the present position of the assembly who does not have that. In separating from evil, you *judge* what you leave; it is a judicial action. God says, You are judging it, but I will deal with it in time; your judgment will be executed. The judicial side is most important in every respect, because it clarifies the whole position and then we can go on with what is positive.
A.N.W. Would it be right to say they were cut to the heart by what Stephen said judicially, but what touched Saul was his prayer of grace?
J.T. I should think that was the beginning with Saul. The Lord had His eye on him; His eye rested on that young man as he stood there holding the clothes of the murderers. He alludes to it later, saying, "When the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of them who killed him" (chapter 22: 20).
{365}
He says, I was there, and the Lord intimates that something had taken place there when He said to him: "It is hard for thee to kick against goads" (chapter 26: 14). He evidently alluded to this. What a trophy of grace he was; the Lord secured him. Could anything be more appropriate than to say, This is David's spoil? He is outstanding ever after as answering to the mind of God here below.
A.B.P. Does Stephen exemplify how that in judicial matters we should be entirely impartial? He would bring upon their consciences with full force the sin against the Just One, but the sin against himself he would meet in pure grace.
J.T. Very good. The *Just One* is very significant there. James uses the term, "ye have condemned, ye have killed the just" (chapter 5: 6), and that is exactly what Saul was doing; he was condemning the just and ravaging them. I think the fact that the Lord alludes to Himself in speaking to Saul, "Why dost thou persecute me?" (chapter 9: 4), is to show that He is still "known in the gates". He is known there in those houses that Saul visited. Wherever he visited, he found Jesus formatively in the saints. He was known there.
A.R.S. Is it not significant that he refers to the Son of man, because when the Lord was before Pilate, He said, "Henceforth shall the Son of man be sitting on the right hand of the power of God", @Luke 22: 69? Then they crucified Him. That is the testimony on which they condemned Him, and when Stephen mentions the Son of man, they immediately rush upon him and stone him.
A.N.W. Was not the glory of God and Jesus for his own enjoyment; and the Son of man standing, the point of testimony?
J.T. Very good. It would greatly strengthen him to see that the glory was immutably secured above,
{366}
and Jesus had His own place there, whatever they thought of Him.
Ques. Is it your thought that the Lord in speaking to the Father as Lord of heaven and earth, has in mind the change in the economy from what is on earthly lines to what is heavenly, the heavens coming in first there?
J.T. That enters into what we have here. Stephen fixed his eyes on heaven.
J.S. Why do you think there is a direct refusal of the testimony of the Son of man?
J.T. It marked the Jews. When Paul, in speaking in his defence in Jerusalem, quoted the Lord's word to him, "Go, for *I* will send thee to the nations afar off" (@Acts 22: 21), they attacked him again. It is their jealousy against the gentiles and the grace of God; jealousy that God should visit them and take them in at all.
R.W.S. Does the plural of the word "heaven" indicate the fulness that marks the dispensation?
J.T. I suppose so; "I behold the heavens opened". The plural would indicate that the whole idea is there. Paul went up to the third; that was the complete thought. So the plural here would be the whole idea of heaven, I think.
J.S. Jesus passed through the heavens.
J.T. Yes; far above all heavens, but Paul went to the third, which is the full thought in experience. Here the plural would mean that the whole thought is in mind.
A.N.W. It says he fixed his eyes on *heaven*.
J.T. I suppose that was the immediate thought -- what was immediate to his eye. The plural, I think, in testimony, would mean the whole idea of the heavens. Heaven is now acting.
A.F.M. When the Lord spoke to His Father as the Lord of the heaven and of the earth, would that carry the full idea of heaven?
{367}
J.T. I think so. These expressions allude to the working out of God's ways, with His counsels in view.
W.S. "The heavens do rule", @Daniel 4: 26.
J.T. Quite so; the fact that there are more than one brings out also, that there is that which may be implied by the heavens, even in the way of judgment. We have the thought of the windows of heaven being opened in the way of judgment in the flood, and wrath being revealed from heaven, too, but heaven is also in view in the way of privilege and blessing, the special intervention of God. So it has a great place in the testimony in the Acts.
Now having said so much about Stephen, I think what we ought to have clearly in mind, is this most important matter in the turning of the wall in the testimony. What a man Stephen was; how fitted he was for the service, combining in himself the judicial service and the dispensational grace, in the presence of a man who was about to be taken up by the Lord as His greatest trophy or spoil. So that it is all working out on these lines, and hence we have the assembly immediately introduced again in chapter 8. Great persecution arose against the assembly, and then again it says Saul ravaged the assembly. Now we see the virtuous woman, as it were, and what is going to accrue from all this -- this new point of departure. "Those then that had been scattered went through the countries announcing the glad tidings of the word. And Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, preached the Christ to them" (chapter 8: 4, 5). Philip represents the second phase of the spoil here, a man that moves of himself, not judicially, but evangelically, carrying out and expanding the second part of Stephen's service.
Ques. The virtuous woman considered the field and purchased it. Does that fit in with this and with Antioch?
{368}
J.T. I think that is good. The field is something outside of what she already had; she acquired it.
Ques. Is the assembly assuming more importance now than the apostles in this part of the book?
J.T. That is it; she is coming more into view and acquiring a field. "And the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly", @Acts 11: 22.
J.S. There is a direct attack upon the assembly in the beginning of chapter 8.
J.T. That indicates what we are saying. The enemy sees it coming into view now. The apostles are undisturbed; they remain in Jerusalem; the attack is on the assembly, and in view, I believe, of the Lord's having to say something to Saul.
Rem. The word to Saul is also out of heaven, not from Jerusalem.
J.T. That is another thing to consider. The position of the assembly here is of great importance in our subject, because it is the virtuous woman we have to keep in mind -- her husband is known in the gates. That is what comes out. When the Lord speaks to Saul, He says, You are persecuting *Me*. He is known in those houses.
W.B-w. You were referring to the turning of the wall. Do you connect that with this scripture here, the Son of man?
J.T. That is what I understand, corresponding with Matthew. The Lord was turning over to the assembly, leaving Israel, and the position required strengthening. It was critical, and so, although it is critical, the assembly is equal to it.
W.B-w. Do you get the idea from Nehemiah where they turned the wall at the angle?
J.T. That is what I am alluding to. Here the testimony was moving round from Jerusalem. The Lord had said to the apostles, "Remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high", @Luke 24: 49. Then He goes on later to show that the
{369}
testimony should go out wider. He indicates that in @Acts 1 -- "but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (verse 8). Now it is *Son of man*; the testimony is going out to the nations. "That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations", @Luke 24: 47. He had said this before; now, it is about to take place, but not by the apostles. That is the thing to keep in mind; they remained at Jerusalem. They are, in a sense, in the shade. The course of the testimony now depends upon the assembly itself, its endurance, whether or not it could stand this attack.
J.S. The lines of the conflict are more clearly defined. The hostile religious leaders in Jerusalem took advantage of Saul's offer to make a direct attack on the assembly in Damascus.
J.T. That is important. Is the assembly capable of standing this turn of affairs? Well, she *is* capable. That is the thing to see. The scattered ones "went through the countries announcing the glad tidings of the word" (verse 4). A new theme, "the glad tidings of the word", a very remarkable thing; and then Philip went down to Samaria and preached *the Christ*; that is the Man who does things for God.
A.F.M. Does this represent an independent action of the Spirit moving outside the apostles?
J.T. I think so. It is what was in the assembly; it shows the resources of the assembly; its endurance, so that Christ is known in the gates, and He is not lacking of spoil in all this.
A.F.M. It says he went down, as if it were his own exercise, and "preached the Christ to them".
J.T. The suggestion, I think, is that our young men are not to wait to be invited to preach, but to seize opportunities, by making way for themselves.
{370}
The idea arising from these deacons is that they obtained "for themselves a good degree", @1 Timothy 3: 13. Some may ask, Why am I not asked to preach? Obtain for *yourself* a good degree, and you will be asked to preach. It is up to yourself.
C.A.M. You were emphasising the foundations previously. This great matter of Stephen seems to involve a *gate* issue; the husband being known in the gates would admit of all this coming out.
J.T. Quite so; He was known in the gates in Stephen's beautiful spirit. It was the reflection of Christ in the spirit he manifested, so that in chapter 8 we are in the field of operations again. The judicial side is over, but who is going to take up the work? Well, you may say, the apostles; but there is not a word about them. It is the scattered ones; it is a new development altogether. The Lord has the spoil, and these men go out by themselves and preach the glad tidings of *the word*, a very remarkable appellation of the gospel. I think it means they were sober men, and were more concerned about God's *mind* being known, than about exploits. The glad tidings of the word means the mind of God is in view; a very important thing in preaching the gospel, not simply to get souls and be able to count them, but to spread abroad the word of God.
A.F.M. Does not that expression occur in connection with Paul's ministry? Repeatedly we get that Paul and others spoke the word unto them.
J.T. Quite so; wherever the word is preached in that way, there is concern about the mind of God. It says, speaking of Corinth, "And he remained there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God", @Acts 18: 11.
A.B.P. Would the fact that Philip comes into view here link on with the previous crisis, and suggest
{371}
that the fruit of one crisis provides material that will stand in the next?
J.T. That is the idea; it is progressive. So now a new field has been sought. The virtuous woman sees the field, and she acquires it. That is the idea here, a wider scope. We are on that field now, so that it is new conquest. Philip goes down to Samaria and preaches the Christ. The scattered ones preach the glad tidings of the word; the mind of God is to be known, but Philip brings in One who can do exploits. It is Christ who can do exploits; He does everything.
J.S. Do you think the apostles were clinging too closely to Jerusalem, and then in the ways of the wisdom of God this scattering is allowed?
J.T. That is how the matter stands; they clung to Jerusalem when they might have gone into the field, "But when they persecute you in this city, flee to the other", @Matthew 10: 23. That was the principle, but the apostles did not act on it. Not that one would say much about them, but still the course of the testimony is to be noted, and it involved God taking up others.
J.S. Over against this beautiful spirit of the Lord Jesus as seen in Stephen, you have a murderous spirit brought to light in Saul.
J.T. He was diametrically opposed; "breathing out threatenings and slaughter" (chapter 9: 1); and then in chapter 8 it says, "But Saul ravaged the assembly" (verse 3). Note, that it is the *assembly* -- that which is so precious in the eye of Christ -- that Saul was attacking. Satan understands. The murmuring was pacified by the remarkable provision of seven men who had the Spirit, "full of faith and the Holy Spirit". That was the provision at that turning of the wall, and now the Lord is putting forth two of them; Stephen in chapter 7, and Philip in chapter 8, now in the sphere of operations.
{372}
Nobody sent him into the field, but he goes; not to do exploits, or to tell the number of converts, and that sort of thing, though he had them immediately. It is *the Christ* Philip preaches; *He* is the One who does exploits. Everything that God does is done by Jesus Christ, the anointed One. What spoil Philip is -- he is spoil out of the murmuring; he is the man for the moment, the man who preached Christ to the Samaritans.
W.B-w. Of the woman of worth, before it is recorded that she acquires the field, it says, "And she riseth while it is yet night and giveth ... the day's work to her maidens", @Proverbs 31: 15. That precedes the field. What does that refer to?
J.T. Well, she is a good housekeeper. "He maketh the barren woman to keep house", @Psalm 113: 9. That is one thought that marks the assembly -- good housekeeping. The word is: "Prepare thy work without, and put thy field in order, and afterwards build thy house", @Proverbs 24: 27. The field must be contributory to the house. The house is one idea, that you look for order and affection. The virtuous woman sees well to the ways of her house.
A.N.W. The virtues have come into play like the river in the garden of Eden; it was there to water the garden, but it flowed out from there in four streams.
J.T. It is a spontaneous movement here. The field that she acquires is now necessary, for it provides a wider scope of operations. She had been limited, but now it is wider, in keeping with the "Son of man" of @Acts 7: 56.
J.S. Do you regard the field as a productive sphere?
J.T. We get the thought from Jacob: "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed", @Genesis 27: 27. The field is
{373}
now the gentile world, which the Lord had blessed potentially. Philip is the man the Lord is using now, not Stephen. Stephen had his own part and work, and he did it well, but there is no lack of spoil. This is another piece of work and Philip is available for it. So that it is what the Christ will do now. He "preached the Christ to them", it says, "and the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he wrought. For from many who had unclean spirits they went out, crying with a loud voice; and many that were paralysed and lame were healed. And there was great joy in that city" (verses 6 - 8). That is the idea. What spoil is being secured now!
Ques. Would you link this with @John 4 in connection with Samaria? Philip seems to select territory that had previously yielded fruit to God. Israel being abandoned, he goes to Samaria again. The Lord, it is said, "must needs pass through Samaria", @John 4: 4.
J.T. It would seem that there is a link there. No doubt Philip knew what happened as recorded in @John 4. If you knew of some little spot where there was movement, and a person such as the woman, whom we call the woman of Sychar, you would be inclined to go there. I think that is the link. Philip makes his own selection.
A.B.P. The Lord had likened Samaria to fields white to harvest.
J.T. Yes; He also said, "Lift up your eyes and behold the fields". I suppose Philip lifted up his eyes and said, I will go there, and he did, and the Lord was with him and blessed his labours.
R.W.S. In @Acts 1, when they came together, they asked him saying, "Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?" He replied, "But ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come
{374}
upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (verses 6 - 8). This seems to be the order the testimony is taking as under His command.
J.T. Quite so; I think we ought to use care in making selections. The Lord lets you do that; He leaves it within your range to do that; so that if you hear of someone being in a certain place, who has received Christ and spoken well of Him, an evangelical instinct would lead you to say, I would like to go there. The woman had said, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" @John 4: 29. That was her point, *the Christ*, who was really *in* her formatively now. So that Philip has in mind the spiritual link. He begins at that point and preaches *the Christ*.
J.H.E. If you saw a movement of God in a certain territory, you would be concerned about the house.
J.T. Quite so. You would say, Why are there no meetings in that city? Well, why not? It is a question of what there is of God in a place, because, after all, everything is divinely caused. God says, "In all places where I shall make my name to be remembered, I will come unto thee, and bless thee", @Exodus 20: 24. God was behind Philip's labours; the cause was there. God had been there, and the blessing arises from that. It is the blessing of God, I believe.
G.M.W. Would the joy in this city of Samaria be over against the hatred in any city against Christ?
J.T. Just so; if the preaching is real, there is joy in the city. In Samaria there was great joy in *that city*.
E.E.H. Do you think this service and activity of Philip agree with the open heavens?
{375}
J.T. Quite so; the glory is at the apex, to be diffused. It has spread even to this country, and is still shining. It has shone into our hearts. Did it not shine into Philip's heart? -- not as Jesus, but *the Christ*? Later on, he announced the glad tidings of Jesus to the Ethiopian, but in Samaria he preached the Christ.
A.R.S. Why did Philip not discern Simon Magus? It was Peter who discovered and exposed him.
J.T. That is another point. The apostles are now brought in. They were not discarded. The old brothers are not put on the shelf, so to speak. Their service was invaluable to the assembly.
A.N.W. Paul himself went up to Jerusalem, did he not? To that extent he recognised the position of the apostles; he went up to see Peter.
J.T. Quite so; the apostles were there under the eye of heaven, ready for service. As has been observed with Samuel, when David comes on the field prophetically in @1 Samuel 13. Samuel leaves Saul, but he does not go far away. He rose up and went to Gibeah in Benjamin. He was within call. Let Saul work, let Jonathan work, and let David work when he comes. Samuel says, It is their matter now; God has a man. He has David, and Jonathan also, for he is working for God. Samuel, so to speak, says, I am near by. He does not turn his back on them, nor did the apostles disregard these scattered ones.
J.H. Would you say more in regard to Philip's selection? You mentioned that Samaria was the field he selected to labour in; now he leaves Samaria according to the word of the angel of the Lord.
J.T. It shows he was a true levite, although acting on his own initiative. We may be sure he had great exercise before God, but the Spirit does not tell us about that; He wants to show us that
{376}
one side of the levitical work in a young man is to find his sphere of employment -- find out what he is to do and do it. Instead of thinking I am going to do exploits, I say, Christ is the One who will do them. Not that Philip could not preach Jesus, for he did immediately he got into the chariot of the Ethiopian eunuch. He "announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him", @Acts 8: 35.
J.T.Jr. Would you say that what Peter did is now carried on in the assembly in the converts?
J.T. I think so, and I think the Spirit of God would keep the apostles before us in all this. We have alluded to them as perhaps being a little in the shade. "And the apostles who were in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John; who, having come down, prayed for them", chapter 8: 14, 15. They are right in the work now, thoroughly in it. It is not the assembly at Jerusalem, but the apostles, showing they are kept in view, but the main thought is the assembly here and what issued from it.
A.F.M. Is that the way God would have Samaria recognise that they were indebted to Jerusalem?
J.T. I think so. There was enmity between them, I suppose. God is represented now in Jerusalem by the apostles.
Ques. Would you say that the Holy Spirit would not be given until the apostles came down, so that the link might be established?
J.T. I think it is an administrative act. The apostles authority is still kept in mind. They are not lost sight of, and they link on with what God is doing authoritatively -- the apostles which were at Jerusalem -- but they do it in a comely way; they pray -- "who, having come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for he was not yet fallen upon any of them, only they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus. Then
{377}
they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit" (verses 15 - 17). It is an administrative act.
A.R.S. When Peter preached to Cornelius and his company, they received the Holy Spirit while Peter was yet speaking, but in the instance of Samaria, Philip's work waited on Jerusalem.
J.T. What is in mind throughout is the idea of the one tabernacle; a line that is well for us to observe. All these movements are one in the mind of heaven; Philip's work is linked on with Jerusalem administratively in this unification of the work of God. Samaria is brought into the anointing, being linked up with Jerusalem by the administrative act of the apostles. It is not the assembly here; we get the assembly setting in chapter 11. Here it is a question of keeping the apostles in mind, for God is not losing sight of them. They represent Him authoritatively in Jerusalem, and they link on the work at Samaria with that. Now in chapter 11 it says the *ears of the assembly* in Jerusalem hear about the work at Antioch, and they sent out Barnabas. That was an assembly matter.
J.T.Jr. Then was Peter's word to Simon Magus judicial?
J.T. I think so. No one but an apostle could speak like Peter spoke: "Thy money go with thee to destruction, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be obtained by money. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not upright before God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and supplicate the Lord, if indeed the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee; for I see thee to be in the gall of bitterness, and bond of unrighteousness. And Simon answering said, Supplicate *ye* for me to the Lord, so that nothing may come upon me of the things of which
{378}
ye have spoken", @Acts 8: 20 - 24. It does not say that Peter did it, but it was put upon Simon himself.
A.F.M. It says that they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus, as if that were the point in view. Receiving the Holy Spirit would be the next step after they answered to their baptism, which Simon Magus failed to get, on account of his unsuited state.
J.T. Quite so. Those in Cornelius's house received the Spirit before baptism -- a remarkable thing, but here the baptism must have its place. It was a sign of recognising the rights of the Lord Jesus.
W.B-w. Do we get light in this chapter on how to open up the work in other cities? Philip was not sent to Samaria. Evidently his desire and exercise was to go and preach the gospel there. Is that the way it should be carried on today?
J.T. I think so. What is said of the virtuous woman helps. She had her eye on the field. It is what the assembly is characteristically, and Philip is just moving on that way. Doubtless Philip had possession of the facts at Samaria; the Lord's service had borne fruit there, because that is another thing we should be acquainted with in the history of the assembly; the accumulation of knowledge and of facts concerning the field. Where am I to go in my service? The testimony came to the west; why did it travel westward from Jerusalem? It must have been on the principle that the mind of heaven was indicated and those who served moved accordingly. The field of the future will be the east, I think. The angel who flies in mid-heaven is evidently to carry the gospel to the east. While we have to wait for that, yet the assembly is in possession of the facts. It is cumulative, of what has come down from the service of Christ.
Ques. What do you refer to as the east?
{379}
J.T. Asia is the great sphere, as far as I see, for the future operations of God.
C.A.M. East from Palestine?
J.T. Palestine is spiritually the centre of the world.
C.A.M. It would really involve the glory at the end of Ezekiel.
J.T. Quite so; it is toward the sun-rising.
J.S. Would this section show how thoroughly Philip was in the mind of heaven, that he should go to Samaria?
J.T. I think so; it is put that way. He selected the field of his operations, but it was the mind of God; the assembly had possession of the facts.
J.S. It seems to be morally right that he should preach the Christ after the indictment of the nation by Stephen.
J.T. Yes; you feel that Philip is working out the testimony of grace displayed by Stephen at the *end* of his indictment to the nation. He was so like Jesus, and in accord with what he saw in heaven; the glory was there. It seemed to be just right that Philip should say, Let me preach that Man, but in the sense of being anointed; not as Jesus, but as *the Anointed*. The word Messiah has two meanings -- one, the Messiah of Israel, but then it has a wider meaning, too, for the Christ -- the anointed One -- is the One who is now doing things for God. He is anointed in regard to the nations, too. We learn that in @Luke 4; He was anointed to preach the gospel, and so Philip was preaching Christ to the Samaritans. The Jew might say, Christ belongs to us, but He belongs to Samaritans, too. The woman had already said that much.
F.N.W. Would that feature of the Christ, the anointing, come into Peter's confession of Christ in Mark's gospel -- "*Thou* art the Christ", @Mark 8: 29?
{380}
J.T. I think that is just the point that is emphasised in Mark's gospel.
F.N.W. The One who does things would be the theme of Mark's gospel.
J.T. That is what we need; those who can do things, but do them in the light of the opened heavens. Our scripture shows that there is a change of things in heaven now. The scattered ones knew what to do; Philip selected his field, and he knew what to say.
Rem. The end of Mark's gospel -- the levitical gospel -- indicates that the Lord is working with them.
J.T. He says, "Go into all the world", chapter 16: 15. The world is the place that is opposed to you. You will find plenty of opposition there -- "And preach the glad tidings to all the creation", (verse 15). And the Lord was with them.
Rem. It was a question of *those who believed* doing it. It was not so much the apostolic side.
Ques. Does chapter 9 show us that the Lord works by Himself?
J.T. Quite so. That is the next thing to remember; that He is working in relation to what we have in this chapter -- in view of the young man who held the clothes of those who stoned Stephen. It is all one thing. This young man is going to be a leading trophy as spoil for Christ. "For this man is an elect vessel to me", says the Lord to Ananias, @Acts 9: 15. You do not get such an expression about Peter, for Paul is an exceptional trophy as spoil for Christ.
J.S. He is introduced to Ananias as an elect vessel.
J.T. That is right. We must regard Ananias as representing the assembly in Damascus. The assembly is to understand that the Lord is going to have this trophy, as "an elect vessel to me".
{381}
A.F.M. Would you call him a 'let-out' man? In his baptism he was let out to the nations, to bear Christ's name before "both nations and kings and the sons of Israel" (chapter 9: 15).
J.T. Peter really opened the door to the nations, in chapter 10; so that Paul could go out *rightly*.
C.A.M. It is remarkable that Damascus was the first city to get the communication.
J.T. That develops another point: the beautiful thought of getting information from heaven. Damascus is the first to get this information. After Saul is reached, the Lord Himself goes into the city immediately. He had told Saul to go in, but He went in before him really, so as to make the way for him, and you might say, to inform the assembly there.
F.N.W. Would it be like the heart of her husband safely trusting in her?
J.T. That is it. The Lord was trusting in Damascus. He says to Saul, They will tell you what to do there. Indeed, the Lord went in so as to make sure that they should. The heart of the Husband safely trusted in that little gathering in Damascus.
C.A.M. Ananias was quite aware of the power that Satan had against them, through Saul. In a sort of way, they must have been in terror.
Rem. This house of Judas in Damascus must have been a very remarkable place. It was not afraid of Saul. The Lord knew He could safely trust those in it. There seemed to be some little defect in Ananias, but the Lord repaired that before Ananias saw Saul. The Lord saw to that.
J.T.Jr. He adjusted his "wife"; Ananias would represent the wife. She was adjusted first in relation to what was coming in.
J.T. All this, I am sure, strikingly illustrates what we have been saying -- the Lamb's wife is
{382}
the virtuous woman, how He safely trusts in her! One has often thought of the importance of being trustworthy. Can the Lord trust me with anything at all? How He would trust us collectively, even about matters connected with His interests. Getting information from *heaven*, in this connection, is one of the most important things.
C.A.M. Looking at this glorious vessel, coming in at the end of the Bible, and the setting there, helps us to understand, do you not think, all that we have been speaking about? The glory of the Lamb's wife is meant to have a definite meaning in our souls.
J.T. Quite so; it is intelligible to us who follow this thread of thought, what the assembly is to Christ, and what she yields to Him, and how He can trust her, and that He has no lack of spoil; she makes much of Him; in so doing *He* is known in the gates.
C.N. What was it that prompted Ananias to address Saul as brother? Was it some feature he saw in him?
J.T. I think the Lord impressed him with the idea that he was going to be that. If the Lord told you about a man like Saul, you would greet him as brother.
A.N.W. Is it like the gold rings that were receptacles for the bars in the tabernacle, @Exodus 26: 29?
J.T. That is very good. The Lord forged those rings; what He said to Ananias linked him on with this brother in his heart. It appears that Saul was praying when he found him.
C.A.M. In that way, the first intimation that Saul got of the heavenly city was in Damascus.
J.T. That would be the idea. The Lord says to Saul, "Why persecutest thou me?" These men are Christ in character; they are His body. From
{383}
this time onwards we are to be prepared for the truth that the body is of Christ -- the heavenly thing.
A.Macd. In view of what we have been saying of Stephen's witness to the Son of man, how would you link up Paul's ministry: "And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God" (chapter 9: 20)?
J.T. That is another thing. Stephen had his own line; Philip had his line -- which was the Christ. He was able to speak of Jesus, too, as we have said, but here is a man that can speak of the Son of God. You do not hear of Peter calling Him the Son of God, although he knew He was -- the Father told him He was the Son of God -- but we do not hear of Peter speaking of Him in this way in his ministry except once, in his last epistle, and that is to quote what was said from heaven, when he was about to put off his tabernacle. It was not his line; what we have to see is the levitical instinct in all these ministers; they know what to say, and what they say is in keeping with their own particular line. Here is a man, "an elect vessel unto me", he is first to start with this -- to preach Jesus that He is the Son of God.
Ques. Would the use of the name "Jesus" be suggestive of intimate acquaintance with Christ?
J.T. That is how the Lord introduced Himself to him. He says, "I am Jesus". We would think Saul would announce Jesus, but he went on to the Son of God. How did he come to that? Did he get it among the disciples? Was it part of the inheritance of the meeting in Damascus? Did they know? Or did he get it directly from the Lord? I would assume he heard it in Damascus. At any rate, he is able to preach it. It goes beyond the thought of the Son of man, because the Son
{384}
of God is the One who does things in the way of *building* up.
J.T.Jr. He was preached in a three-fold way at Corinth: "For the Son of God. Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)", @2 Corinthians 1: 19.
J.T. Laying the foundation of God amongst the gentiles really involved that He was to be presented as the Son of God.
A.N.W. Would you link it on with what Paul says in Galatians, "when God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", @Galatians 1: 15, 16?
J.T. I should, but I would connect that with a later transaction.
C.A.M. Is there not something unique about the truth of the Son of God, as to how or when you learn it? One thing is very certain, it cannot be learned by mere logic. Those who argue about it never learn it.
J.T. Paul speaks of it as revelation: "God was pleased to ... reveal his Son in me"; with Peter it was revelation, and with the man in @John 9 it was revelation, too, by the Lord Himself. These are important points as to the *knowledge of the Son of God*.
J.S. What did you have in mind in connection with chapter 11?
J.T. To bring out how the assembly appears there, having ears for the work of God in the wide field, as far as Antioch; not sending out one of the twelve, but Barnabas.
A.B.P. Paul develops the thought of faces in his ministry. He speaks of the unveiled face; having seen the face of Stephen reflecting the glory; and then, on the Damascus road, the glory in the face of Jesus, would probably form a basis for what comes out in the new covenant ministry.
{385}
J.T. Well, it does. He says so: "who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", @2 Corinthians 4: 6.
A.B.P. Would the face of Stephen be representative of the face of the wife, or virtuous woman?
J.T. Quite so. All that is said about Stephen and Philip has to be accredited to the assembly, because they began with deaconship, which is particularly assembly work.
A.N.W. It is striking that they are both the choice of the assembly. Though chosen with the other five, they are put first.
{386}
SPOIL (8)
@Acts 11: 19 - 30; @Acts 13: 1 - 4
J.T. It is understood that the section of our subject of "Spoil" which is now under review, is based on @Proverbs 31, the woman of worth, as typical of the assembly. On account of her industry and care, it is said that her husband is *known in the gates* when he sits among the elders of the land; and also, *he shall have no lack of spoil*. To see how this works out spiritually, we began with @Acts 2 and @Acts 4, and went on to chapters 7 and 8, when it became manifest that the type in Proverbs was exemplified in the early history of the assembly, in the sense of spoil accruing to Christ through assembly conditions and industry, involving discipline and gospel testimony. We reached chapter 8 in our last reading and also touched on Chapter 11. The thought now is to consider the section read, centring in Antioch. With the Lord's help we may see how spoil accrued to the Lord through the tribulation that began at the martyrdom of Stephen.
It is said in chapter 8 that Saul ravaged the assembly, and that those who were scattered on account of the ravaging went abroad and preached the glad tidings of *the word*. That is to be noticed. It is a remarkable designation of the gospel. "Those then that had been scattered went through the countries announcing the glad tidings of the word"; and in our chapter the link is in verse 19: "They then who had been scattered abroad through the tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen, passed through the country to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone". That verse links on with chapter 8, and the Lord may help us to see how the fruit that is so striking in these chapters was
{387}
directly the outcome of the scattering and tribulation that befell the assembly. Instead of being overwhelmed by the calamity, as it might be regarded, they are overcomers and pursue the testimony in the way that was needed, so that the mind of God should be known through the gospel.
A.F.M. Would the normal way of discovering the assembly in a place be by announcing the gospel in that place?
J.T. Yes; the gospel of *the word*. There are a great many designations of the gospel, as you know, and this is one of the most significant. It is a question of the word of God being made known, and what accrues from that in persons being formed to answer to His mind.
J.T.Jr. Is the thought of "speaking the word" conversational rather than preaching?
J.T. Yes; there was no effort to make any personal exploits. The idea of "the word" is that God speaks. It is in speaking that our minds are disclosed. If we have the mind of God, then we speak that; there is the idea of teaching the word of God, too, which took place at Corinth. Paul was there eighteen months *teaching* the word of God, which would be enforcing it; but *speaking* would be bringing out its beauty and attractiveness as the speaker has himself enjoyed it.
A.N.W. The believers who spoke to the Greeks announced the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus. Is that more the public character?
J.T. Announcing would be the public side. That is the word used in chapter 8 -- "announcing the glad tidings of the word".
A.R. Does announcing carry with it authority?
J.T. Well, it does. There is the idea of proclamation, and of preaching, and also of teaching. I think the word "announcing" is more that people should know certain facts. We use the word commonly.
{388}
A brother makes an announcement, for instance, but it is not teaching or merely speaking, it is explaining something clearly and simply; but here evidently it would be with feeling, particularly in chapter 11, where it is "the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus" -- a very beautiful appellation of the gospel.
J.A.T. Why does it say, "speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone"?
J.T. I think they were carrying on as had been the custom, confining the testimony to the Jews -- "to the Jews first". The others went beyond that. They are not presented as having a commission, but as prompted by their own intelligence, exercise, and feelings, and the result shows that they were justified. "And the Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord" (verse 21).
R.W.S. Is there some reason for Antioch being selected at this point for the special operations of the Spirit?
J.T. Well, evidently, it is representative of the gentile world. It was one of the capitals of the Alexandrian Empire and continued to be so for a long time. No doubt God takes account of these things.
S.McC. Would the title "Lord Jesus" be calculated to move the affections in a peculiar way? It is not the official title, Lord Jesus Christ, but the glad tidings of the *Lord Jesus*, a peculiarly endearing name attaching to the assembly's relations with Him.
J.T. Yes. It is the title selected as suggestive of the action of the Holy Spirit. No one can say "Lord Jesus" save by the Holy Spirit. That title is selected as suggestive of the action of the Spirit in the confession.
{389}
S.McC. I wondered if it would fit in with peculiar evangelical activity at the end of the dispensation, corresponding to the final word, "Come, Lord Jesus".
J.T. Yes; all that is in keeping with the title Lord Jesus. Stephen used it very befittingly: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit", @Acts 7: 59. Paul says, "remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive", @Acts 20: 35. Again he says, "and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12: 3. That would mean, I apprehend, not simply that peculiar address that resounds in the assembly, but Lord Jesus, pronounced by the Spirit of God.
A.N.W. The apostles in the jail used that term. According to the better translation, they said to the jailor, "Believe on the Lord Jesus". We get accustomed to say, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, but what has been said makes the title "Lord Jesus" more affecting.
J.T. It makes the Person of the Lord Jesus more pronounced or distinctive -- that is, what He is personally.
C.A.M. One is impressed with the unofficial way in which this wonderful movement is introduced. Would you think, in that way, that God may bring forward a most wonderful increase of light in an unostentatious way, and that is a test to our spiritual observation and senses?
J.T. I think the word *unofficial* is good, and certainly fits in with the last days, because it is a question of what heart we have for the Lord and for His things; if there is anything to be done, can we do it without being asked to, and without its giving us any official or distinctive status. They did it of themselves without any ostentation at all,
{390}
without any commission; but the hand of the Lord was with them. Their hand moved first, however.
W.R. Were they not sent, according to the closing chapter of Mark's gospel? It says, "the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it".
J.T. These were not sent; they were disciples, of course, even as those mentioned in Mark. The Lord having spoken to them -- to the twelve -- worked with them. But it is not that here. Missionaries might say, We can do this and that. Or any one of us might say it. But we have to go by the circumstances as Scripture presents them. These were not specially commissioned. They were scattered by tribulation, which is not what the Lord had in mind in the commission in the gospels.
W.R. Would you say John on the Isle of Patmos was one in whom tribulation worked out the idea of the brother?
J.T. Quite so; the idea, I think, is that however severe the circumstances on account of the testimony may be, we are not overwhelmed. We carry on what is of God.
Ques. Is there any thought of colonisation in this section? We were noticing at the last reading that the woman in the end of Proverbs considered a field and bought it.
J.T. I think that enters into it. Undoubtedly heaven was behind all this, and the instincts of the assembly lead to it. In chapter 8, they went through the countries, it says, announcing the glad tidings of the word; and then Philip went down to Samaria. That is one part. That is a field of itself. Here the field is much further off and varied. "They ... passed through the country to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone", and then others went to Antioch and spoke to the Greeks. So this would be a wider
{391}
thought than chapter 8, as to the idea of a field. It seems to be the assembly acquiring the field. She saw it and acquired it.
A.F.M. In chapter 8, the service of Philip is somewhat like that of these men in our chapter, only that they did not perform any miracles. Philip preached Christ to them, but there was apparently nothing left in Samaria at that time, such as an assembly like there was at Antioch. Would you think his field and movements were similar?
J.T. I think his great part has its own significance -- how Philip preached. The generally scattered ones "passed through the country to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone. But there were certain of them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who entering into Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, announcing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus". Philip preached the Christ at Samaria. That was part of the field, you might say, that the virtuous woman was acquiring. But then *how* was it being acquired? The field must be taken account of. It was a Samaritan field, over against Jerusalem, and if the work of God is to be carried on, the testimony must be suited to the conditions and in keeping with the soil. Then Philip goes down, under the direction of the angel, to the desert, and meets with another kind of soil, another field, you might say representatively; that was Ethiopia. What will he do there? The wonderful skill that is seen is to be accredited to the assembly, because these men are not like commissioned apostles, they are scattered ones of the assembly, suffering as of the assembly, overcoming the afflictions, and maintaining the testimony with great intelligence. They knew what to do. So that in dealing with the Ethiopian, Philip preached *Jesus*, and found a convenient text that the man himself had, as he was reading the Scriptures. It
{392}
was a southern field. The scattered ones in chapter 11 are in another position. They are in the north; you might say, in the very heart of the Alexandrian empire, where God is going to work.
J.S. Is this scattering allowed in the wisdom of God, so that the Lord may have spoil in this way even though apart from what is official?
J.T. I think so. These were characteristically assembly persons, though not seen as functioning in the assembly, but rather suffering as of it, yet doing what their hands found to do. The door is shut at Jerusalem, but it is not shut in this wide area. It is the assembly looking abroad and instinctively finding suitable fields for the testimony that heaven had in mind.
Ques. Do you think the movement of brethren to this country, for instance, under adverse circumstances, seeking employment, and others having gone to the islands and to Australasia, might be parallel with this idea today?
J.T. I think it would.
C.H. Would the fact that this report reached the ears of the assembly illustrate what you are saying in connection with Philip? He preached Christ and it reached the ears of the apostles. In verse 1 of this chapter it says, "And the apostles and the brethren who were in Judaea heard that the nations also had received the word of God"; and then for the first time, we get in verse 22 that the report reached the ears of the assembly.
J.T. That is what I thought we might see; the link with the *assembly* in this section, as distinct from Jerusalem, where the word had been hitherto applied. It is now applied for the first time in the gentile world, "they were gathered together in the assembly" (verse 26). It is a most significant fact, an epoch, as you might say. This wonderful and beautiful word, which has acquired such a place in these
{393}
last days, was first mentioned here, and under the most inauspicious circumstances. What can we say but that it is peculiar spoil for Christ, all arising out of the attack on the assembly, in which the apostle himself had led, before his conversion. *He* was secured as spoil, and now he is used to spoil the gentile world, that the assembly should be established in spite of the circumstances.
J.S. Instead of loss, as we might have supposed, on account of this scattering, there is really great gain, showing how those scattered were in touch with the Lord Jesus -- a great many were added.
Rem. It also says in verse 21 of chapter 11, "And the Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord", not to the brethren. That is like David's spoil.
J.T. Quite so; they turned to the Lord. That is a point that Barnabas took up: he exhorted them to abide with the Lord. I think we are getting to the most interesting part of our subject -- what arises from persecution of the assembly, implying that we are to be buoyant in the persecution, whatever it may be, and not to be under the circumstances that may arise. These scattered ones, perhaps driven from homes and families, some in most distressing circumstances, were so sustained by the Lord that they could present Him in a most attractive way, each in his own sphere, whether it be Philip at Samaria, or in the desert with the eunuch, or whether it be at Antioch, the testimony is rightly presented, and the Lord can identify Himself with it.
A.N.W. Are there not successive waves of spoil in that way? In chapter 8, the scattering is throughout all Judaea and Samaria. Spoil is gathered there, but there seems to be another wave here in the Antioch section, far removed from Judaea and Samaria.
{394}
J.T. Yes, here it is, as you say, far north -- Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch.
J.S. Is the height of buoyancy reached in chapter 16, where Paul and Silas prayed and sang in prison under most adverse circumstances?
J.T. That is a good illustration.
A.F.M. This work in the outlying regions was outside of Jerusalem and apart from the apostles. It appears that the interest went beyond them; they were active and interested in hearing of things, but not exactly participating in them. Would you mind saying something about that?
J.T. Well, their *position* is maintained. There are two lines running through -- the *apostolic position*, which has to be taken account of by itself; and then the movements of the assembly. The apostles are unique; they are direct representatives of Christ in authority, so they are the ones that are concerned about Samaria. It is a question of the authority of Christ. It is a dispensational matter, and that comes within the range of apostolic commission. So they sent out Peter and John to Samaria; but in chapter 11 it is not the apostles, but the *assembly* and the ears of the assembly. Chapter 10 intervenes, and the question might arise, Why not include Cornelius and his household and company, but it seems to be an apostolic matter. It is not something arising from the assembly as such; whereas our section is the direct result of assembly exercise -- assembly sorrow first, and what might have been overwhelming becomes the occasion of spoil for Christ in the most striking manner.
F.H.L. Had the great number that believed become the large crowd that were added as assembly material?
J.T. Yes. Barnabas and Paul taught a great crowd for a whole year in the assembly -- a most remarkable combination of words.
{395}
F.H.L. I was thinking of the position; first, they believed; then they were added to the Lord.
J.T. Quite so, and then they were *taught* in the assembly and are called a crowd, but a crowd that gradually becomes ordered and regulated and unified, so that the beautiful word "assembly" can be applied.
J.S. Then we see the assembly here in Jerusalem taking on the work, so that they sent Barnabas as far as to Antioch to consolidate and link on the work.
J.T. I think that is to show that the idea of the virtuous woman still holds at Jerusalem. In spite of the terrible withering attack, its enduring qualities sustain the attack and the scattered ones of the assembly carry on the testimony where it should be rendered. They clearly made the selection. The virtuous woman considered the field. Heaven was in the selection, and they are supported in it. The thing for us to see is, the spoil accruing to Christ as the outcome of the exercises of the "woman of worth"; how the assembly is to be maintained in the face of attack, whatever that attack may be; how it is maintained in its completeness -- in these features, and continues on according to the pattern set by the Lord Jesus. *He* went on; some of them doubted, we are told in @Matthew 28, but He went on. His word was, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations", @Matthew 28: 19. In spite of the doubtings and questions, and maybe opposition and hard tribulation, the assembly goes on, and spoil for Christ accrues from its activities.
J.S. Instead of being limited, it progresses, does it not?
J.T. That is the thing to see. We ought to make application to ourselves in our own days. We may be in the last days, things are small, but are we to allow any kind of circumstances that the enemy may bring about to prevent our going on positively?
{396}
Have we the instincts of the assembly enabling us to go on positively, so that there may be something for Christ out of all this?
S.McC. Is it not interesting in that light, to see that the saints in Jerusalem are referred to as an entity? -- "The assembly which was in Jerusalem".
J.T. It shows that formation was there. The building, as it were, is there. It is maintaining itself although so many have been scattered; the assembly still stands, and has assembly instincts and ears, and assembly industry; and so it sends out its best man, as you might say. Barnabas is to be viewed here as a product of the assembly. He was received into it as a son of consolation and he enriched it. Now he is being sent out by it.
J.T.Jr. There is no contention now. In verse 2 of chapter 11 there was contention among those of the circumcision, and Peter spoke of it, but now the assembly is in full sympathy with the work of God and sends out Barnabas.
J.T. That is very good and helps at this point. Peter set forth the matter in order, it says. That is important. Whatever the matter may be, it may be a collective matter, it helps to set it out in order intelligently and with patience so that God gets a result, as in the case of Cornelius. But now at Antioch, there is no contention at all. It is very beautiful to see that the field is all ready, and the servants are equal to the requirements.
A.T.D. Do we see the result in the fact that these disciples were called christians first at Antioch?
J.T. That is good. It fits in here. Evidently the quality is the grace of Christ. The characteristics of Christ are taking form now in the saints.
G.MacP. Does Barnabas suggest the quality of the work of God in the assembly in Jerusalem: "For
{397}
he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith" (verse 24)?
J.T. Yes; he becomes the link between Jerusalem and Antioch. He is like the golden taches in the tabernacle linking on two distant parts of the work of God, maintaining *one tabernacle*.
A.B.P. You were speaking of suffering and order and fruit. It seems to link on with the word in @Proverbs 31 -- "of the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard" (verse 16). The vineyard would be a smaller area than a field.
J.T. Just so. The field is a wider thought. The idea comes down from Isaac. "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed", @Genesis 27: 27. That is what is in view in the service of God, to acquire a field that the Lord has blessed and get the right seed. In Samaria, it is *the Christ*; that presentation was to break down the rivalry that was there. The apostles at Jerusalem were interested in it, because it was a question of *the Christ*; they represented Him. Then it is a question with the eunuch of a south land -- a southern field and the kind of seed that is needed. It is a question of the race there. It is not the authority of Christ so much as the race and the kind of man that is to dominate and give character to the race, that is in the mind of God -- the kind of humanity; so that Philip evangelises unto him Jesus. In @Isaiah 53 it is Jesus.
A.F.M. Do you think the different periods of time that the apostle spent amongst his converts had in view the ultimate results for God? I was thinking of the three weeks in Thessalonica, the twelve months here in this chapter with Barnabas, the eighteen months in Corinth, and the three years at Ephesus; all on the line of teaching. Is that the work of the wise architect having in view great results for God in the assembly?
{398}
J.T. Those long periods of service imply in each case some particular phase of the truth that has to be thoroughly worked out; and then finally the four years of imprisonment, implying what had to be worked out in Paul himself to bring the best out of him. He was a field that the Lord had blessed, and that field must come under the most extensive and careful tillage so that the best crop should accrue, and the crop is seen in the prison epistles -- Colossians, Ephesians, 2 Timothy, Philippians, and Philemon, a yield of the most wonderful teaching that has ever reached human ears, outside of the ministry of the Lord Himself.
R.W.S. "He goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for scattering; he cometh again with rejoicing, bearing his sheaves", @Psalm 126: 6.
J.T. Exactly; there was much more to be wrought in Paul than by him; that God would bring out such a crop of ministry from one man, and that man four years in prison -- two years in Caesarea and two in Rome -- is the greatest fruit.
Ques. What was in the Lord's mind in @John 4, "behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest" (verse 35)? Are these the fields He had in His mind?
J.T. Yes. That is a good reference. You stressed the plural. It is significant in that connection that the ministry began at Samaria. The Lord said to His disciples as they came to Him: "Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest. He that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together. For in this is verified the true saying, It is one who sows and another who reaps. I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others have laboured,
{399}
and ye have entered into their labours", @John 4: 35 - 38. That brings out our position today, but it is very remarkable that the first field actually is Samaria. Philip goes into that field, and the scattered ones go into other fields, but every field is blessed of the Lord. Now we see fruit; Christ is getting the fruit.
J.S. You see the results of the labours in Antioch. In the opening of the section read, we have the fact of the scattering, but in the close of the chapter, we see the gathering.
J.T. Quite so; what a result! You can understand that these scattered ones would be present in the meetings that were conducted by Barnabas and Saul for this whole year. Genesis describes the year. "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease" (chapter 8: 22). It is suggestive that the words *whole year* are used, as if to call our attention to that period, that God is working out some great result in Antioch, and He takes a whole year to do it.
A.N.W. The crowd is found in the assembly. It is being taught, and formed, and then, as you say, it can be termed "the assembly" in Antioch.
J.T. I think that is the way to picture what happened. This large crowd of people met together. Would they have a meeting, such as we have tonight? How would they carry on? Well, the word "assembly" is in mind and the Spirit of God, and Barnabas and Saul, you may be sure, have this word in mind, and the scattered ones have the word in their minds. They were part of it. They felt it. The Lord had alluded to these scattered ones when He spoke to Saul, "Why dost thou persecute me?" @Acts 9: 4. What feelings there would be in these
{400}
scattered ones and in Saul, who had been persecuting them! Barnabas would know, too. These men would all have the idea of the assembly in their minds, and the Greek crowd was attracted and added to the Lord; they were all subject. No doubt it was gradual, but they conceived the idea of the assembly -- the greatest conception in the universe, the mystery, the assembly; it would gradually appear as Paul and Barnabas worked together in this meeting for a whole year -- winter, summer, seed-time, and harvest.
C.A.M. That is very interesting, and particularly connecting it with what you have said about the last part of Paul's life and the wonderful fruit that came out of it. When we think of this initial setting of that remarkable servant and the intensity of feelings that must have been experienced by him at the end, how much there must have been for God in it all!
J.T. All arising from the tribulation in which Paul himself had such a part. How much would come into his mind! He would say, I persecuted the assembly, and yet God's hand was over it to bring the truth of the assembly into this gentile setting.
A.F.M. Do you not think the apostle had great joy in seeing the fruits of this in Antioch now that discipleship was there? They were disciples, but as christians they were members of one body. Is that the thought? They were not only disciples and expressive of Christ, but expressive characteristically of the body of Christ; for surely that would be included in the whole year's ministry.
J.T. I think so. The word would mean that they took on the graces of the anointing. They announced the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus. Philip announced Jesus to the eunuch. It is the idea of the race there, that God has the race in mind; He is to have a new
{401}
race. The personal name Jesus is connected with the race, and it seems as if the Spirit of God selected the eunuch with particular feeling to bring out the traits of the race. Though having become degenerated, it is now to be elevated to this wonderful character of *Jesus*, as in @Isaiah 53. Here at Antioch, in the realm of Alexander's kingdom, or empire, where rule is the prominent feature -- seen in one man -- we have the title "Lord Jesus" introduced. It conveys the beautiful thought of Jesus, but with authority. It is the authority of *that Man*.
S.McC. In @John 12, the Greeks came up and said, "We would see Jesus", but here it is *Lord* Jesus. *Lord* is added.
J.T. Yes; the eunuch heard about Jesus. Philip saw to that. It was on Jesus that he believed. There was not much in the Greeks coming up. Nothing accrued save that the Lord said, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit" (verses 23, 24). This means that Christ should be in control of the race, but instead of that He had to die to produce a race acceptable to God. Philip evangelised Jesus to the eunuch. It is a beautiful word, for He is presented in that character, and what is it save to meet the race as represented in that man? Whatever we may think about the white and other races, the race was represented in the eunuch, and God is going to bring it into blessing, by bringing about in it a condition like Jesus. In the north, we are in Alexander's kingdom, where empire prevailed. Really we are in the very centre of the Alexandrian empire, the greatest of empires, and so the *Lord Jesus* is presented. Those in Antioch are to know the *Lord* Jesus; that is, rule in that Person; a beautiful thought, preparing them for the assembly.
{402}
C.A.M. It would look, from what you say, as if God had selected the race at its greatest disadvantage, to change man altogether.
J.T. Quite so. He does not take up the race in connection with the distinguished features of it; although this man was a distinguished man, but he represented a part of the race that belonged to Africa rather than cultured Europe, for instance. God takes that up to represent the race; He is going to make that race like Jesus.
C.A.M. The prophet's question of old was, Could an Ethiopian's skin be changed? Well, it could be changed by the presentation of that Man -- Jesus.
J.T. I trust the brethren see the idea of the race being met in the Ethiopian, and then the idea of the proudest empire that ever existed, with Antioch one of its capitals -- the very centre -- being eclipsed by the presentation of the Lord Jesus. That is the thing that prevailed in the European world.
Rem. As the virtuous woman goes north, "She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet", @Proverbs 31: 21. There is a certain quality about those that were scattered abroad in that northern position.
J.T. Quite so; they are not afraid of snow.
G.MacP. Following that remark, the book of Job says, "and cold from the winds of the north" (chapter 37: 9).
J.T. Quite so; it is a question of what is of God coming out of the cold -- cold, as well as heat, has its place in the development of what God has in His mind.
W.R. Does all this help us to understand @Isaiah 53 -- "He shall see of the ... travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied" (verse 11)?
J.T. Quite so.
{403}
Ques. Do you think the thought of being dressed in scarlet would link on more with the title Lord? Is there the idea of royalty in it? Would they be dressed in scarlet as going north toward Antioch?
J.T. Scarlet is usually typical of earthly glory.
F.C. Does the Lord determine the material for the assembly?
J.T. I think that is the idea. They were added to the *Lord*. What has He in His mind for us? Being added to Him would mean that He has control of us. We are entirely at His disposal. He will make the very best out of us -- something answering to the mind of God collectively as there was in Antioch; the assembly is the great result. It was the outcome of all this; the great spoil that accrued to Christ as the outcome of all the suffering and scattering.
J.H.E. In @John 4 it was a question of seeking worshippers; David made instruments for the carrying on of worship. These would be the instruments that David made?
J.T. Yes; we hear of them as the assembly is described in chapter 13. We are told they were ministering to the Lord, and five names are mentioned which actively, under the Lord's hand, were as formed instruments of David.
Rem. Barnabas seems to do the right thing again, as he did in chapter 9, being used of the Lord to put Saul forward as the man the Lord was about to use. In chapter 9, he brought him up to Jerusalem, and now he goes to Tarsus to seek him out again. Evidently he was the right man for this work.
J.T. So that, if you see a man that can do the work better than you, you put him forward.
Rem. He was unselfish, too. He saw a great work going on in Antioch, and instead of doing it
{404}
all himself, he sought out someone else that could do it better.
J.T. Quite; they worked together; *they* taught. That is the idea of two going together, as if Barnabas discerned the need of that.
C.H. Barnabas was rejoicing as the result of the work in chapter 11. It says he rejoiced when he saw the work in the place, the work of others -- the sower and the reaper rejoicing together, as spoken of in @John 4.
J.T. Quite so.
A.R. He exhorted them "to abide with the Lord" (verse 23). It says, they *turned* to the Lord and were *added* to the Lord, and now Barnabas exhorts them to *abide* with the Lord.
J.T. Yes; the empire they were coming into was ruled by the "King of kings, and Lord of lords". It is the idea of empire that we need to have in our minds here. Barnabas had in mind, I think, that they were to stay there for something further; they were to be held there in subjection -- abiding with the Lord; awaiting the return of these great servants who understood His mind, to work out the assembly features in Antioch.
A.R. As being formed under Paul and Barnabas, room is made for Agabus, and the prophetic word coming in through the prophets from Jerusalem.
J.T. Yes; and it makes room for those who were well off to put their hands in their pockets, do you not think? Barnabas had done that; he gave up all that he received from the land that he sold.
G.M.W. Would the spirit of rivalry be offset in the determination to minister to the brethren in Judaea?
J.T. Quite so. Barnabas's influence undoubtedly had something to do with this. Those who were well off at Antioch, in response to the prophetic word, gave the money for the relief of the saints,
{405}
and Barnabas and Saul took it to Jerusalem. That is the link. Then another thing that comes in here is, where do I return to? Barnabas did not *return* to Jerusalem. That was not his thought. He went there to carry the bounty to the saints, but the idea of return is to Antioch. The mention of this is to show that God is changing the position, that Antioch now is the object in the return. That is where God's mind is being developed now.
F.H.L. Assembly service Godward was established before this service manward, was it not?
J.T. That is the next thing to notice. In chapter 13 we get something that is not opened up in regard of Jerusalem, not that it was not there, but the Spirit of God is bringing out the beauty and grace that were developed at Antioch -- the assembly features that were there. There were five distinguished men there, and they ministered to the Lord, it says, and fasted. The Lord was before them.
G.MacP. Would this be a counterpart of @John 4, where the Lord speaks of worshipping the Father in spirit and truth, not in Samaria or Jerusalem, but worship in spirit and truth?
J.T. Quite so. This public service of God is now set up amongst the gentiles. It was not taken away from Jerusalem, but it was begun here. Certainly this was of immense interest in the eye of heaven.
A.R. It says in chapter 11, "And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly" (verse 26). In the beginning of chapter 13 it says, "Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was there, prophets and teachers"; then it describes these five men as pleasurable, as if they are to be taken account of as trophies of the work of God.
J.T. Quite. The first is Barnabas, and the last is Saul. The other three have histories -- marks of
{406}
distinction that would tend to hinder the work of God in them. One is said to be Niger, and the second a Cyrenian, from North Africa, and the third, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch. What a triumph it is -- the product of the wonderful work of God, to take these men out of these settings and set them up in the service of God!
A.B.P. They were called christians in chapter 11. Does that link on?
J.T. I think it does. It would be the graces of Christ the anointed One -- the King of kings, and Lord of lords -- represented here in the Alexandrian empire, in christians.
A.R. Naturally they would be extremely adverse to one another, but they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, showing that the adverseness had been overcome.
A.F.M. How would you regard this matter of cities? Did Antioch supersede Jerusalem? What was Jerusalem's status while this work was going on at Antioch?
J.T. I think God was gradually, but surely and patiently, terminating the metropolitan idea. An earthly metropolitan centre is not proper to christianity. The metropolis of christianity is heaven -- "Jerusalem above". Antioch is not brought forward to supersede Jerusalem as a metropolis. God had no thought of doing that; but because of the power that had wrought there. He could employ it to gradually and patiently set aside what was becoming an encumbrance to the testimony. God is very gracious when removing encumbrances to the testimony, things which once had a place in it.
A.F.M. When Paul went to Jerusalem later, he evidently came under the metropolitan influence.
S.McC. Do you not think it is important for us to put ourselves into this scripture -- to challenge
{407}
ourselves as to whether these conditions obtain amongst us, so that God can set up His best?
J.T. That is good; ministering to the Lord is a positive thought, suggestive, I think, of the public service of God being inaugurated among the gentiles -- a great epoch in the ways of God, but then how is that to be maintained? We may minister to the Lord in liberty on the first day of the week, and the next first day of the week we may not be so free; the fasting is what maintains our freshness. Fasting is self-denial; it is unselfishness. The feast of unleavened bread intervenes, which suggests self-denial. It is non-inflating; it reduces.
R.W.S. Are these three men the product of gathering together in assembly a whole year under these conditions?
J.T. I think that is how the matter stands. Barnabas and Saul of course are the workmen. These other three are placed between the two great servants in chapter 13: 1. The circumstances whence they are drawn and the way they are mentioned, would serve to bring out the idea of the quality of the work in them. They can be placed between Barnabas and Saul, and they all minister to the Lord; doubtless the whole assembly did too. It is as they continued in that ministry to the Lord and fasted, that the Spirit speaks. So that the Lord has now in Antioch what He can use -- a vehicle for the Spirit. The Spirit undoubtedly spoke through one of them.
Ques. What is the difference between a prophet speaking the word of God, and the Holy Spirit speaking as presented here?
J.T. The point here is the Holy Spirit -- a divine Person -- is speaking.
Ques. Is that due to a right moral condition which is produced through fasting?
{408}
J.T. I think it is to show what had been produced there and how the service of ministering to the Lord and fasting is honoured.
Ques. Sometimes in ministry meetings we may say, That was the word of God tonight. Is there a time when we might speak of it as the Holy Spirit speaking?
J.T. This is more than that. It is to bring out that one of the divine Persons has scope in the gentile world, as God used to speak in the temple and in the tabernacle, so He can speak here. It is God by the Spirit, a very great matter that God can speak, and so Paul alludes to the matter later, that the "Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city", meaning that God had means in those cities which the Holy Spirit could use to speak.
Ques. Is it like the anointing of the position, the anointing of the tabernacle?
J.T. The anointing did not go so far as speaking. The anointing is public dignity, but the speaking took place inside.
A.N.W. Why are they designated as prophets and teachers, while their service is apparently Godward?
J.T. They were such as could take part in the service. I suppose the whole assembly would be included in this service. They are mentioned as the best -- peculiar spoil. It is a feature of the Acts that God puts forth His best, and they are mentioned in that way. Surely God is entitled to that: when He produces something prominent, He is entitled to call attention to it.
A.R. It says they were sent forth by the Holy Spirit. How would you explain that?
J.T. That is to show that the testimony was officially inaugurated by the Spirit of God. It was not like Philip. He was not sent in the same sense, nor were the scattered ones. We must arrive at
{409}
divine representation. Whether I preach or another preaches, in due course all must come under the anointing for divine representation, or it is nothing.
Rem. Sentimentality was excluded, too, in the selection of Saul and in separating him for the work.
J.T. Quite so; the selection of the brethren was right, and it is most important, however small or feeble we may be, to have before us that there is to be divine representation.
J.S. Do you regard Antioch as the position to be reached by us morally? We should be in self-abnegation if the Spirit of God is to be free.
J.T. That is a most important thing; so the position gradually becomes a divinely accredited one. God was putting His stamp of approval on the whole movement. It is His. It is what Christ had out of all this, and it is representative of Him.
A.B.P. Would you say the Godhead is represented at Antioch? They were called christians, representing *Christ*; Barnabas saw the grace of *God*, and now the *Spirit of God* is speaking personally.
J.T. Quite so.
{410}
SPOIL (9)
@1 Corinthians 5: 3 - 5; @2 Corinthians 2: 1 - 11; @Revelation 3: 7 - 12
J.T. Most of us know that, in considering the subject of "Spoil", we have looked at the virtuous woman, in @Proverbs 31, as a type of the assembly furnishing spoil for Christ; and pursuing the thought we looked at several passages in the book of Acts. It was thought that we might profitably pursue the same section of the subject tonight, and see how *discipline* occasions spoil for the Lord in those who, as disciplined, are restored to God. We had the thought of discipline before us in @Acts 5, but in that case those who were disciplined were not restored; the spoil came about through the *effect* produced on the saints and on the multitude. Now it is thought that we might get help through considering the spoil that accrues to the Lord *in* persons who have been restored through discipline.
The verses which we have read in 1 Corinthians furnish us with the best example that we have of assembly discipline. It included the spirit of the apostle and "the power of our Lord Jesus Christ", but the actual administration of discipline was in the hands of the assembly at Corinth. The person who was the subject of the discipline is clearly marked off as *wicked*, being called such by the apostle. In a sense it is not merely a local matter, for the apostle's spirit was bound up in it and also the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is distinctly an assembly matter, however, the saints being viewed as gathered together, as it says, "ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ", (verse 4). No such matter can be merely local; it carries with it in principle the assembly as a whole.
{411}
A.F.M. In what way does the spirit of the apostle Paul come into this action? Is it a special thing?
J.T. I think so. There is a purpose in its being mentioned; not merely because it is his spirit. I suppose it conveys the *kind* of spirit that runs through the two epistles; but then the idea of the body -- an organism -- would also enter into it, I think.
Ques. Would the spirit of the apostle be replaced today by the spirits of the saints who feel with God in a universal way in regard to matters that may be taking place in other localities?
J.T. I think that is how it would work out. Those who would act for Christ in a matter in their locality would have the universal thought in mind, too. We are to keep the unity of the Holy Spirit. The spirits of persons who would act against evil in their localities would be rightly in mind here, I think. We have come to "the spirits of just men made perfect", @Hebrews 12: 23. It is no matter of what men call spiritism, but the wonderful organism of the assembly, carrying all that is of God into a local action.
Ques. Does the word "spirits" in @Hebrews 12 involve the thought of intelligence? I was wondering, for instance, why our scripture does not say Paul would be present in *soul*.
J.T. I think the spirit is the most exalted part of man. It is first mentioned -- i.e., "spirit, and soul, and body". It would be that part of man by which he has a conscious link with God. I think the apostle's spirit would pervade both epistles -- the first epistle, particularly; it would be Paul's spirit in the sense of judging evil.
C.A.M. Would you say that the evil at Corinth was allowed to become universally reported, because God intended all saints to be affected by what He was doing in that local company?
{412}
J.T. It would so appear. We cannot always act on mere reports, but the way this is mentioned would indicate that the report had rightly been accepted as true, and would affect the spirits of all who would act for God; so surely the divine organism here implies that the spirits of the saints are to be carried. We have come to the spirits of *just men*; a most important thing in a world of evil. It is not spiritism, but an organism that is of God.
P.L. It says of Achan that "all Israel stoned him with stones", @Joshua 7: 25. Does that illustrate it?
J.T. I think it does.
P.L. When Joshua is selected to lead the people. Moses asks "the God of the spirits of all flesh" to "set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them", @Numbers 27: 16. The appointment of Joshua suggests, in a typical way, that the saints would now take on the features of a spiritual organism, do you not think?
J.T. Yes. These epistles bring that out particularly. The apostle says, "So that death works in us, but life in you" (@2 Corinthians 4: 12), and "if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it", @1 Corinthians 12: 26. It is a subtle thought, but nevertheless a reality, involving the organism of the one body.
A.N.W. Was the action of the assembly as together, and delivering the man to Satan, apart from the apostolic spirit?
J.T. I think the apostolic spirit entered into that, but the assembly had remarkable powers. Our Lord said, "If also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer", @Matthew 18: 17. It would show that the assembly's word was final as representative of Christ here.
A.R. What is done in a locality is sometimes questioned; whereas here, it is in the name of our
{413}
Lord Jesus Christ and with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. That would give it assembly status.
J.T. Quite so; and the apostolic spirit, whatever it might be today, would be authoritative in dealing with evil. The Lord says, "It is as a man gone out of the country, having ... given to his bondmen the authority", @Mark 13: 34. The bondman spirit enters into these matters so that there is authority here. In every righteous man there is moral authority to deal with evil.
Ques. In contradistinction to Corinth, is assembly conscience lacking in Pergamos, where the same evil was prevalent? It says, "I have a few things against thee: that thou hast there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel, to eat of idol sacrifices and commit fornication", @Revelation 2: 14.
J.T. I think that is good, and it brings up the question of the final part of our subject tonight, how the disciplinary or judicial attitude of Christ in the assembly as depicted in @Revelation 3 culminates in a result in the way of spoil in Philadelphia. What was lost in Pergamos and Thyatira has been reached in a moral way by the extrication of the saints, so that there is a judgment of evil.
P.L. What is done in government, one would trust, may finally, as in this case in Corinth, be used in grace as spoil.
J.T. That is what I think we may come to in the second letter. It is a beautiful thought. A man was in danger of being swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. The work of God in the man went faster than the sympathies of the saints. The saints had not kept pace with God in the matter, but they are helped by the epistle and the man is delivered.
P.L. Like the servants in @Luke 15, they were to follow hard after the heart of the father, who ran -- do you think?
{414}
J.T. I think that is what we might gather. The Corinthians were not travelling fast enough. They were not keeping pace with the work of God.
G.L. Is it right to pray collectively for a man who has been withdrawn from, during the time he is not in fellowship?
J.T. It is a question of spirituality. John says, "There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request", @1 John 5: 16. It is a question of spiritual discernment, whether the matter is judicial; not confined entirely to assembly discipline, but it may be discipline of the Lord directly. "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep", @1 Corinthians 11: 30. We have to be sure about that. It requires spiritual discernment, but generally speaking, I would say, that it is right to pray for those under discipline.
P.L. Do you not think Paul and Chloe would pray for this man?
J.T. I would think so. Paul in the first epistle was exercised about the man's spirit that it might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, but the recovery evidently took place before.
P.L. Had it awaited that day, would it be quite spoil? Is not the spoil connected with the harvest of recovering grace here, and therefore available in the assembly now to the praise and glory of God, and blessing for all concerned?
J.T. I think that is right. @Luke 15 represents christianity; I suppose the way we are actuated by grace. The father ran to meet the prodigal. The Corinthians were not moving with God in what He was doing in the man.
A.R. Do you think that we can truly pray for the recovery of any who are put away if our spirits are not in sympathy with God and His feelings towards the assembly?
{415}
J.T. That is good. We must travel that way with every right action. We are to travel with God.
Ques. Can our spirits really be in the action as the apostle's spirit was here, unless we apprehend the seriousness of the thing, and the judgment of God relating to it?
J.T. I think that is right. Paul travelled with God; He had a judgment of the matter before, we may be sure, but he went deeper than mere rumour; the report that went abroad was evidently accepted as true, and was taken up by those who were foremost in the spirit of judgment in the assembly. Paul travelled with it. It is a question of travelling in spirit in the way of righteousness.
A.F.M. Was the man's spirit saved before the day of the Lord Jesus through his recovery in the second epistle?
J.T. Manifestly. In the apostle's judgment, he was already saved. They were exhorted to receive him, and confirm their love to him.
A.F.M. His self-judgment had effected his salvation in that respect?
J.T. Quite so. Every provision of the divine system begins to operate as sin takes place. It is a most interesting matter to trace the working out of the *modus operandi* of recovery. We are told, in John's epistle, "if any one sin, we have a patron with the Father" @1 John 2: 1. We *have* Him; that is, the sinner has Him, and the saints have Him. All are affected by the sin. "We have a patron" up there in regard to this matter, but we must operate with Him here below.
J.S. Just how is spoil acquired as a result of this action at Corinth?
J.T. I thought we might profitably see the way spoil is reached through the *modus operandi* that God has provided, which implies that we are *all* brought into this. *We* have a Patron; not merely
{416}
does the man who sinned have one; it is an assembly sorrow, but the assembly has this wonderful provision above, with the Father; so that the dispensation is not permanently affected by the sin. The Patron above means One who takes care of the whole matter there. It does not say "with God", but "with the Father", and the Patron is "Jesus Christ the righteous". So it is a question of righteousness in the most absolute way. He is not going to pass over anything, but nevertheless he is on the side of the sinner and those who are with the sinner in responsibility, because it is *our* matter -- "we have a patron"; our prayers are based on that; there is also a provision down here; the Spirit is the Advocate here ("Comforter", in @John 14, is the same word), and He makes intercession for the saints also, according to God, showing that everything must move on those lines. The most righteous spirit on earth, I suppose, was Paul's. He was in this matter, and others, too. That is how we should move together. What an organism the assembly is! We are all brought into the matter in spirit. So we move with God, because God is the first to begin to move. It is a great thing, in all matters of discipline, that we move with God. We have a Patron, who is on our side, to look after the matter above, and the Spirit is here, and all righteous spirits are in the matter.
G.L. Was the weeping on the part of the tribes in the end of Judges connected with the restoration of Benjamin? They had no power to reach him until they wept.
J.T. That is very good; that is, all were brought into it. As has been remarked of Achan, all Israel stoned him with stones; all the righteous spirits would enter into that, which of course includes all the assembly.
{417}
A.B.P. Would the thing be seen set forth objectively in the Lord Jesus going into the waters of baptism at Jordan? "For thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness", @Matthew 3: 15.
J.T. I thought of that in connection with the expression that He is *the Righteous*; Jesus Christ, *the* Righteous. The article implies that the whole thought is there in that Person, so that nothing will be passed over. Some may think they are more gracious than others, but nothing will be passed over by *the* Righteous.
P.L. So that we have the foreshadowing in the baptismal scene referred to, and then the Lord in @John 2, as coming into the temple and making a scourge of cords, says, "Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise". He takes over the whole matter. "And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house devours me". Is not that seen in Paul? The zeal of God's house was there, so that what the Lord is now undertaking above, the disciples take on as under Him here below.
J.T. Very good. I think it is of great help if we get an apprehension in our souls of the workings of this organism. It acts through love, as at the Lord's supper, but in discipline it is a question of righteous spirits. Paul's spirit would be an authoritative and righteous spirit, and every such spirit is in an action like this. So we are to travel with God in the thing, but we must not travel too slowly nor too fast. The Corinthians were travelling too slowly to be with God in the matter. The apostle has to urge them to confirm their love to the man, for God had already wrought in him.
J.T.Jr. Would the leaven in chapter 5 indicate what hindered movement with God?
J.T. I think that is right. It would mean that there was something working in the company.
{418}
J.T.Jr. Would it not work both ways in their slowness in dealing with evil as well as in recognising the recovery of the man? There was evidently something there that hindered them from receiving him back. It would possibly be leaven of another kind.
J.T. Well, it would be slothfulness, which would be akin to will.
C.A.M. Would the nature of the sin be so very solemn because it involves the temple condition of things? God will not allow any corruption in that.
J.T. Yes. It would defile the temple, of course; the lower feelings and affections of the saints would be drawn into and affected by such a thing as this. It is an incestuous thing. The *corrupting* of the temple in chapter 3, however, would be more mental, such as bringing in bad doctrine.
C.A.M. So that this would involve the body idea, more so than the temple?
J.T. It would; so the word *lump* is used -- "that ye may be a new lump" @1 Corinthians 5: 7. It is not so much the temple idea, as lump. It contemplates us as together, but the leaven is nullified. "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump". That is, the saints are to be freed from the sins that would corrupt in their natural relations. It relates to the lower affections more than to the idea of bad doctrine; chapter 3: 17 is corruption, and the word there is, "If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy". But this is leaven of another kind that would damage us as a lump.
A.N.W. That is evidently why he says, "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves", (chapter 5: 13).
J.T. "From amongst yourselves". How that would affect every bit of table talk about this matter! Table talk is dangerous unless it is pure. The
{419}
lightest things are said sometimes, and this thing would possibly be bandied about among the saints at Corinth and be most destructive, in the way of leaven, for the lightest kind of feelings are often brought into our conversations.
Ques. Will you explain the use of the word "wickedness" in relation to discipline cases? Are there gradations of sin, or would you use the word "wickedness" in relation to every discipline case?
J.T. I think I should. The action of will, according to @1 Samuel 15: 23, is "as iniquity and idolatry". In the minds of many it would pass, perhaps, as *not so bad*, but it is evil. An action of will against God, or against the principles of the assembly, is repulsive to God and is wickedness.
R.W.S. Why does not Paul bring up this matter earlier in the epistle? He brings up the party spirit first.
J.T. I suppose the schisms that were there were more serious. The parties, no doubt, opened the door for this kind of thing. Where partisan conditions exist, it is next to impossible to deal with evil. A man is shielded because he is of a certain party. That, I am sure, hindered the spirit of discipline at Corinth.
A.B.P. Would you say that the apostle brings forward this relatively clear case to get the brethren in Corinth judicially minded, so that they might be able to take up matters that were more serious later on?
J.T. It was the kind of case that natural conscience would take notice of: "such fornication as is not even among the nations". It could be conveniently brought up to set the judicial minds of the saints in action. The spirits of all just men begin to move when something like this is brought to their attention.
{420}
Ques. Do you not think that if we were more often together in assembly, we should become more judicially minded?
J.T. I am sure that is so. Especially at the care meetings, where these matters are brought up, do we become judicially minded. It is most important to have a judicial mind in the things of God.
G.MacP. Have we the mind of Christ in the spirit of judgment in connection with assembly evil?
J.T. I think we should have, as partaking of the spirit of Christ.
A.R. You were speaking about moving with God in @Luke 15; when the prodigal said he had sinned against heaven and in his father's sight, the father tells his bondmen to bring out the best robe. I suppose in that way the apostle would bring all the saints at Corinth into the thing now.
J.T. That is the idea; bringing all the saints into it, so that they should be a new lump. The lump would refer to the aggregate of the saints in their social and everyday relation, when they would talk about matters together. They were leavened. This thing would defile the body of the saints, so the leaven would be actually working. Their conversations about it would create evil conditions rather than holiness. That is a great test as to our conversation.
Ques. What is meant by delivering one to Satan?
J.T. I suppose it would imply the removal of all that would be a protection to him as amongst the saints. We are protected from Satan in the kingdom. God has provided protection for His people in the circle of fellowship. This would be removed, I should say, so that he would be handed over to Satan. The Lord said to Simon, "Behold, Satan has demanded to have you, to sift you as wheat; but I have besought for thee that thy faith fail not". @Luke 22: 31, 32. It would look as if the way were
{421}
opened for Satan to get him, as we know he did, but the Lord prayed that his faith should not fail. I think Peter is an example of that.
P.L. Does this all emphasise the comprehensive character of these disciplinary operations which have their spring in the holy nature of God; the purity of His throne. Even such an one as Satan has to play his part as an instrument of God? Does that not emphasise the gravity of discipline in the mind of God and rebuke with us any indifference or insensibility to any case that may be on hand?
J.T. That God should employ Satan in discipline is very solemn; that one should be handed over to Satan -- being denied the ordinary protection that the kingdom affords -- is indeed solemn. It is only in a limited way, I apprehend, that Satan is allowed to act. The book of Job helps as to this. God limited him. At another time, Satan moved David to number the people. God ordered that -- a most solemn thing.
J.S. Have we not the responsibility of government in the assembly; whereas Satan would have a freer hand outside?
J.T. Quite so.
P.L. Would the apostle's fear of despair in the man, in the second epistle, suggest the enemy's attempt to go beyond what God allowed; the saints were in grace to nullify such an attempt?
J.T. The saints would rally round him. They would again afford protection for him, under God. So that salvation lies in the assembly in that sense. The Advocate would set in action on high what is needed, and of course what is of God here is to be in perfect consonance with that, inclusive of the assembly today, but the assembly at Corinth was lagging behind. It was not moving with God in the matter. They needed to be exhorted to come in
{422}
at once and stand between the enemy and this man, now that he has been restored.
Rem. Paul knew the thoughts with which Satan would occupy this man's mind. The enemy would be seeking to bring confusion into the assembly, so that the man should not be recovered.
J.T. So the apostle says, "For to this end also I have written, that I might know, by putting you to the test, if as to everything ye are obedient. But to whom ye forgive anything, *I* also", @2 Corinthians 2: 9, 10. In the forgiveness he is prepared to act with them, but he wants *them* to act. God had acted already. It is a very practical instruction for us as it was for the Corinthians; they were to be moving with God, and the apostle, as it were, says, I am in the movement with you. He is letting them do the forgiving, and whatever they forgive, he says, "I also", and then he goes on to say, "If I have forgiven anything, it is for your sakes in the person of Christ". The place of forgiveness is a very elevated position. It is in the Person of Christ. You may be sure Satan worked hard to rob Christ of this man. Satan would carry him off as spoil from Christ, but now he is coming back as assembly spoil in this remarkable way through this wonderful spiritual operation. It is not in any party way, but in the Person of Christ, that Satan might not get an advantage against us. Satan will contend for this man, and for anyone who sins, whereas the apostle discerns that he is to be recovered as spoil. The man is to be brought back on these lines. Heaven delights in this procedure and the saints are brought into it, so that they are working with God in the matter. This man is carried in triumph; rescued from Satan. The saints come round him and reinstate him in the assembly.
J.S. Do we see how the apostle is moving in accordance with the mind of heaven in his readiness to forgive?
{423}
J.T. What can be more assuring than forgiveness in the Person of Christ?
C.A.M. In meeting these thoughts of Satan, such a mighty being, the apostle does not act like a judge alone; he needed the assembly with him in it.
J.T. That is what I thought we might see in the second letter; how he labours to get them with him, and in that sense, to be with God in the matter.
J.S. Do we see certain restrictions put on Satan? He is to be used for destruction of the flesh in this man, but his spirit would be preserved.
J.T. That is what is stated in the first epistle; "that the spirit may be saved". The saints intervened under God. They really support the man's spirit, because it is apparent that he belongs to the righteous, but they want to get his spirit disentangled and free from Satan.
F.N.W. Would it be, "and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens", @Matthew 16: 19?
J.T. Well, that is a formal action. This is more practical; the saints are surrounding him, as it were, with their love; standing between him and Satan, because his spirit has been damaged under the influence of Satan.
P.L. Our prayers and attitude are to be governed by the movements of the Advocate, so that we are in keeping with the mind of heaven and promoting the divine objective. There is folly in lagging behind those movements in heaven, as well as presumption in going before.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Does it call for priestly discernment to detect when the sin is judged?
{424}
J.T. Quite so. If the brother is sitting down amongst us, happily, there is evidence that he is now for God, and for Christ, maybe more than ever he was before.
A.R. The apostle exhorts the Corinthians to "assure him of your love". He does not say *my* love; why is that?
J.T. They could not assure him of Paul's love, except by word of mouth, but this is more than that. They would, as it were, come in between him and Satan. He would be ready for the assembly now.
A.N.W. Does not the very idea of destruction of the flesh involve that the *man* is to be saved? This man is not to be destroyed, as in chapter 3, where the corrupter is destroyed. Here it is for the destruction of the flesh, because the man is to be saved.
J.T. That is a good distinction. "If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy" (@1 Corinthians 3: 17). The man is destroyed; terrible thought! But here the man is saved.
P.L. 2 Chronicles is distinguished from 2 Kings in regard to Manasseh's recovery in the features of which we are speaking. He was taken, bound with double chains of brass, and carried away to Babylon; "and when he was in affliction, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed to him. And he was intreated of him and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah, he was God. And after this he built the outer wall of the city of David", @2 Chronicles 33: 12 - 14. At Corinth the whole system of grace has operated and the man is now more energetic in the defence of Jerusalem than he ever could have been before. He, too, would build the outer wall.
J.T. He is thoroughly in fellowship now.
{425}
R.W.S. How would this man be greeted? Would the brethren shake hands with him while he was under discipline?
J.T. It is a question of discerning whether he is a *repenting* sinner. The advocacy of Christ is to bring about a state of repentance. The prodigal said, "I have sinned against heaven and before thee", @Luke 15: 21. There seems to be no ground for expressing affection or fellowship aside from a repenting condition. The fact that people who are under discipline come to the meeting does not in itself prove that there is a repentant state. It is not simply that I have repented at a particular time, but that the *repenting* attitude is maintained.
P.L. Would the discernment as to the cleansing or healing of the leper be left to the priestly lead in the assembly, and not to persons who assume to be kinder than the assembly at times, and seem anxious to show it?
J.T. Indeed; that brings up the question of the *modus operandi*. The first part is delivering such a one to Satan; Satan is called into service. What a terrible thing it is to be put into the hands of the devil by God and by the assembly; to be where protection is withdrawn from one, and Satan allowed to have his way. There are limitations, however, as the book of Job makes clear. But then, that part of the *modus operandi* is effective; for repentance comes in, and then the saints begin to act; they discern that God is getting His place again. "I have sinned against heaven and before thee", the prodigal said. A truly repentant soul today would say, Against the assembly and against Thee. The assembly must be brought into it.
So the second epistle to Corinth brings out the beautiful spirit thrown around the repentant sinner. He is sorrowful, and had not the saints come in. Satan would have swallowed him up with overmuch
{426}
sorrow. In the *modus operandi* Satan is now displaced by the saints. He had been used as an instrument for the destruction of the flesh, but when repentance has been effected the saints are called in to surround him with restoring love.
J.T.Jr. Is that why the thought of obedience is introduced in verse 9 -- the apostle says, "if as to everything ye are obedient", @2 Corinthians 2: 9?
J.T. The thing is, Are we ready to be part of the divine system, to step in where Satan has been operating? The saints are now brought in to surround the repentant one and shut out Satan's influence.
C.H. Do you get an example of this in Joshua in @Zechariah 3? He was attired in filthy garments, but then the angel spoke and said, "Take away the filthy garments from off him" (verse 4).
J.T. Very good; he was then attired in festival robes. The chapter goes on to show that he was to be given a place among those that stand by.
J.S. The fact that the Corinthians are exhorted to show their love to the man would indicate that they had been standing aloof, having no intercourse at all, until repentance had become manifest.
J.T. We are told in chapter 5: 11: "with such an one not even to eat". A list is given of persons that we are not to come near to at all, but the time comes when the priest sees that a change has come about, and they step in around the man to protect him from the attack of the devil, and so relieve the repenting sinner.
Ques. Would you say the normal working out of this should follow some indications in the person under discipline, that true repentance has been brought about?
J.T. The law governing it is @Leviticus 13 and 14; visiting him and seeing if there is any work of God going on in him. In that way we are to travel with
{427}
God in priestly discernment to recognise the work of God when it becomes manifest.
P.L. Did all this arise in an initial way, in what we may call the first case of discipline in Scripture? In God's own governmental dealings with our fallen parents, he alludes to the "enmity between ... thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel", @Genesis 3: 15. Is that set out in the Lord personally, but now in principle carried on, in another victory over Satan? Satan is seen under the feet of the saints at Corinth, who are now rescuing from the strong man, a bit of spoil for Christ.
J.T. I think that is good. It is a real rescue of the man from Satan. David said he had rescued the lamb from the lion's mouth. It was the triumph of a real exploit. That is how it works out, love comes in; "assure him of your love". It is Corinthian love. No doubt the man had known it before he came under the defilement of sin. Now the saints were to let that love be known in his soul again. It replaces the devil's influence, under which he had been disciplined.
Rem. The Lord's own words as to the strong man seem to fit here: "when the stronger than he coming upon him overcomes him, he takes away his panoply in which he trusted, and he will divide the spoil he has taken from him", @Luke 11: 22.
J.T. This man had been led captive by the devil; indeed, handed over to him, and now the saints are coming in to rescue him from that influence.
C.H. Paul embraced Eutychus, and in the same way the saints might act towards this man now.
J.T. Yes; it is the same principle, although Eutychus was not under discipline. The apostle embraced him, discerning that his life was in him. It was a priestly matter.
{428}
P.L. The apostle goes on to say in @2 Corinthians 2: 14, "Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ"; and then he speaks of the sweet odour. The scene is changed, now that the man is restored, and you get the sweet odour introduced.
J.T. What fragrance there would be as this matter was taken up in assembly! -- as the man was considered, and the character of his sin; how he was judicially given over to the devil; now he is reinstated amongst the saints and bearing every evidence that God has restored him. What a triumph it is! What an assembly meeting it would be; what a triumph in the rescue of the man! We read in Amos: "as the shepherd rescueth out of the jaw of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be rescued" (chapter 3: 12). Here we see the *whole* man brought back, spirit, soul, and body, and set up again in the assembly -- a very great triumph for Christ!
C.A.M. The assembly in its judicial character is greater than all Satan's might, so rightly he should be under the feet of the saints.
J.T. God is exposing him. Satan is not to have "an advantage against us, for we are not ignorant of *his* thoughts", @2 Corinthians 2: 11.
Rem. In the first epistle to the Corinthians, judicial action is necessary to maintain the holiness and righteousness of God's throne, whereas in the second epistle, the apostle seems to stress recovery as connected with the Father's love and grace.
J.T. Exactly; the minister is seeking in all this to carry the brethren along with him. The two epistles are to set the saints in movement, judicially first, and then in restoring love. Adjustment is brought in, and the exercise of love is the great triumph; the great spoil. Corinth would be greater spiritually after this experience than it was before.
{429}
W.E.K. Is the spoil you speak of seen in the second epistle?
J.T. I think that is the thought. The man is worthy of having the saints express their love to him, as it says, "assure him of your love" (chapter 2: 8).
W.B-w. The first thing the priest would look for in the man would be real sorrow. Would that be indicated in some movement toward the saints?
J.T. I think so. He is a *repentant* sinner; he would continue in that attitude.
C.H. The restoration of this man would seem to correspond with @Leviticus 14, where certain things had to be done to the leper that was cleansed. There would be a distinct change in the man, for in addition to other things, he was anointed on the head with oil.
J.T. That is educational as showing the process by which he is set up again among his brethren. It is a real triumph, for he is now an undefiled man, ready to be taken up again by God in His service.
J.S. Is judicial action necessary to make way for the operations of grace?
J.T. I think that is right. It is a most important thing. Speaking illustratively, the judicial department amongst us makes way for the action of the Spirit. The prophetic writings are full of it. It makes room for free action of the Spirit, and now, with this man set up in the love of the saints, what a triumphant meeting it would be! -- God was so leading them in triumph that Satan was defeated.
G.L. Could we pray for famine like Elijah, and still be in accordance with the dispensation of grace?
J.T. We must bear in mind the dispensation in which he lived. James tells us that he prayed again, and the "again" would suggest the grace side. The famine was intended to make room for grace, and
{430}
so discipline is needed to make room for grace to those who sin.
F.C. Would the renewed attitude of the brethren towards the one who had sinned make room for the spoil?
J.T. Quite so.
P.L. Would the fact that Titus (a man not given to human sentiment, but a ruler and prince in Israel) brought this report, give confidence to Paul as to the genuineness of the man's repentance? One feels the urgent call where repentance is said to be appearing, for the scrutiny of a Titus, a true prince.
J.T. It says in chapter 7, "But he who encourages those who are brought low, even God, encouraged us by the coming of Titus; and not by his coming only, but also through the encouragement with which he was encouraged as to you; relating to us your ardent desire, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I the more rejoiced" (verse 6); and also "I rejoice that in everything I am confident as to you" (verse 16). What spoil there is in that! What a time for heaven this was; not only in the man, but a wave of repentance pervaded the whole assembly, and heaven rejoiced, as it says, "There is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner", @Luke 5: 10.
R.W.S. Did the apostle postpone his visit in view of those mentioned in @2 Corinthians 12: 21, so that there might be more spoil for David by their repentance?
J.T. Exactly. There were those who had not been moved yet; but the emotions of the brethren generally had been affected, and there was a wave of repentance. The reflection of heaven has been seen in the joy of Titus. He is a prince; not only an elder, but one who can appoint elders. It requires a superior man to do that, and being such he is
{431}
affected by what is going on at Corinth, and reflects heaven's feelings in regard to it.
C.H. The apostle wrote to the assembly in Philemon's house as well as to Philemon himself, in connection with the recovery of Onesimus, saying, "He has been separated from thee for a time, that thou mightest possess him fully for ever", @Philippians 15. His restoration to Philemon would be assembly spoil, would it not?
J.T. That is a good illustration of what is before us.
W.B-w. Does the whole meeting take on the sin?
J.T. That is the point for us to see in all these matters; we are to travel with God in them. As feeling things and being truly repentant, love finds scope amongst us.
J.T.Jr. David's repentance in connection with his own individual sin, and then later in numbering the people, yielded great results in his apprehension of sonship and the house of God.
J.T. That is *apropos* to what we are saying. God accepted him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, where the sword was sheathed. David said, This is the house of God. He reached it through the exercise resulting from his failure and the grace of God which restored him. He did not say, This is the foundation of the house of God, but This *is* the house of God. It is where God is.
J.S. Is this spirit of repentance manifested in @2 Corinthians 7, set over against the inflation in the first epistle?
J.T. I think so. They have become a new lump now; not only was the man repentant, but the saints were too. If they talked about this matter, they would not corrupt one another now. They would be holy in their conversation.
A.R. Is that why the Lord has been calling our attention to the new covenant? Are we to be
{432}
drawn together in love, so that the love of God may permeate us?
J.T. I am sure there is no scope for love to operate amongst us except we are in self-judgment.
J.S. The spirit of self-judgment is very little understood and acted upon.
W.B-w. Will you tell us something about the joy of Titus referred to in chapter 7?
J.T. I think we should bear in mind who Titus was, for he was a man that appointed elders. He must have been a superior man, to be able to represent heaven in providing elders for the saints. The recovery at Corinth would be a real occasion for a man like that to be exuberant. There was cause for his joy. He was a well-balanced man with a judicial mind, and would not be exuberant without a cause for it.
C.H. It was after there were signs of healing in the leper that the priest was to take the sin-offering. Would that suggest that when there is movement in recovery there is more need than ever for the priestly eating of the sin-offering in the holy place?
J.T. Just so. And then the skilfulness of love is seen in all that follows; the washing of his garments, the shaving, the bathing; abiding outside of his tent for a given period, and, finally, the dignity of the anointing and the sacrifice. The hands of the priest are brought into it to show the spiritual detail involved in the recovery and the tender way in which the whole matter is done, so that the man is set up according to God, and ready for part in the testimony again.
A.R. Does the scripture we read in @Revelation 3, with respect to Philadelphia, fit in with what you are saying? It is the place of brotherly love.
J.T. It is a beautiful culmination of the Lord's judicial service as walking amongst the golden candlesticks. He goes down the line of testimony
{433}
from Ephesus to the end. In Philadelphia we see the assembly in a new phase. The Lord says to her, "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee", @Revelation 3: 9. It seems to be a beautiful phase of the assembly in the last days.
P.L. Has there not been assembly repentance, and therefore assembly forgiveness, and hence the spoil of Philadelphia?
J.T. I think so. It is like @John 20: 23, "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them". That is really what brings about Philadelphian conditions. It is the spirit of forgiveness. The saints take one another up abstractly according to the mind of God and love each other from that point of view as brethren. That is how the matter works out. Philadelphian conditions are reached on the lines of remitting sins. Heaven goes along with us on those lines.
Ques. Would it be right to say that in the address to Philadelphia, the Lord's paps are not girded? He says, "I have loved thee". He ungirds Himself, as it were.
J.T. That is the spirit of it; it is Christ, the Head of the assembly, talking to her.
W.B-w. Titus would be a good Philadelphian brother. The apostle wrote, "His affections are more abundantly towards you". He would be Philadelphian in principle.
J.T. Quite; the part he and Timothy played in Corinth opens up a very interesting subject. They were both men that appointed elders under Paul. They must have been well balanced, and they are both brought into the matter in Corinth. It is most interesting to compare them. Timothy was evidently a direct representative of Paul, for he says, "I have
{434}
sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ", @1 Corinthians 4: 17. He was a true child of Paul. Titus would be that too, but would represent the idea of balance, as being a man able to cope with the things which are brought into the second letter.
P.L. We have, "Whether as regards Titus, he is my companion and fellow-labourer in your behalf", @2 Corinthians 8: 23. Would that link up with Paul's spirit in the first epistle?
J.T. I think so. He is referred to in a very dignified way as Paul's companion and equal; labouring in the same way.
Ques. Is the kind of sin that is spoken of in @1 Corinthians 5 local in its bearing, speaking generally, whereas ecclesiastical sin would be a voice to the saints universally?
J.T. An ecclesiastical sin is apt to be more universal and more difficult to discern, too. The Galatian error, which was doctrinal, was called leaven, as was also the sin at Corinth.
P.L. Achan's sin involved a searching out of all the tribes of Israel. The sin at Baal-Peor was settled quickly with the javelin. A sin which offends the natural conscience is much sooner dealt with than the iniquity of 2 Timothy, which is really the introduction of human will into divine things.
J.T. Although Baal-Peor was settled immediately in principle by the act of Phinehas, all the tribes had had been involved in it. Twenty-four thousand died in the plague.
A.R. Do you mean that ecclesiastical error may spread further and be more difficult to deal with than the sin which was dealt with at Corinth?
J.T. It is more likely to; it is more difficult to judge. The apostle appears to be much more concerned about it.
{435}
Rem. John speaks about not receiving into the house certain ones, as if one who has false doctrine would be more likely to injure you than the man who sinned at Corinth.
J.T. "If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy", @1 Corinthians 3: 17. The *corrupter* is not delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; *he* is *destroyed*. He is definitely a wicked man.
{436}
SPOIL (10)
@Revelation 3: 7 - 13
A.F.M. The proposal for tonight's reading is @Revelation 3, the address to Philadelphia.
P.L. I gather that the thought is to dwell upon the peculiar spoil for Christ accruing from the revival of assembly affection for Him.
A.F.M. I think so; it is very interesting to observe in this section how much the thought of the assembly comes in, as introduced in a known and understood relationship, and also that the enemy, Satan, the adversary, is mentioned, and the hour of trial. The Lord who speaks has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars; all is indicative, I judge, of the character of the present moment, and what has marked the assembly; especially towards the end of its course here. Would you say that?
P.L. Quite so. The thought of "Philadelphia" meaning "brotherly love" would challenge our relations as brethren locally and generally in regard to the truth, so as to afford spoil for Christ of an assembly character. How long He has waited for this, bearing in patience all down the ages, with so much that has caused Him grief. His issue with the five earlier assemblies, but making the assembly revival of these last days the more grateful to His heart.
A.F.M. Would the key suggest that the power of entry was David's? There was no hindrance to his going anywhere in relation to God's will.
P.L. With it He opens up the divine treasures, securing also right of way in our hearts, in the moral solution of assembly issues as they arise.
C.A.M. That is very interesting. Would it be right to say that in Matthew's gospel, after the treasured remnant comes to light in chapter 11, the Lord
{437}
opens up things to them -- the next chapter bringing in judgment? The Pharisee and all related to him has to give way.
Ques. Is not the key of David used now in relation to the assembly? The Lord, addressing this assembly, says, "He who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open" (verse 7).
P.L. And how skilfully He uses it!
A.R. Does the reference to David fit in with the name of Philadelphia -- "brotherly love"? He is the beloved, the key is in the hand of such an one as Christ; would that give colour to this assembly He addresses?
F.N.W. Did the Lord use the key with Lydia?
P.L. Whose heart the Lord opened.
R.W.S. This door, specified in verse 8, is said to be opened, meaning that it had been closed. I wondered whether all David's spoil now goes through this opened door.
P.L. Quite so. His pledge as to the opened door has peculiar force amidst the universal political turmoil; and as having opened it, is it not to secure those spiritual activities which He so cherishes from a remnant in the light of the assembly?
J.T.Jr. Does not our brother's remark help in that Lydia really makes way for Paul's ministry, which comes out in this section, not denying His name, but keeping His word? Making way for Paul's ministry affords the great basis for the spoil that is recovered today.
A.F.M. We may notice that practically all through the Acts no one is able to shut the door which the Lord opens. There is great value in such a word, especially at the present time.
Ques. Is it not kept open in spite of the state of things seen in Jezebel which goes right on to the end?
{438}
P.L. This but emphasises the Lord's activities in love. There is no official assembly recognition by Him after the break with Thyatira.
Rem. To be in the state marking Philadelphia is all the more testing in view of the ecclesiastical opposition around.
P.L. Hence the need of the word of His patience. As the Holy and the True, did not Christ carry out all to divine completion? He was the true Light, the true Vine, and so on.
Rem. Would Obadiah in 1 Kings represent those whose works are not complete? He did not go the full way, whereas Elijah does. There is such a tendency with us not to go on to completion, to finish things in connection with the rights and interests of God.
P.L. There is Elijah's word, "make me a cake", suggesting completeness, every assembly activity bearing the features of one whole thought. All is to be rounded off in spiritual skill -- a good piece of workmanship which the enemy cannot overthrow.
A.R. In order that Philadelphia may go on to completion, the Lord presents Himself as superior to everything that may oppose. He says, "These things saith the holy, the true; ... he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open". That refers to His power, as against opposition generally. Then He says, "Behold, I have set before thee an opened door" (verse 8). That is specific, He has done it. The general thought is, He opens and no one shall shut, and we count upon that continually.
P.L. That but puts upon any who are thus available to the Lord, the greater obligation to bring every assembly exercise to spiritual completion and fruition.
A.F.M. To the other assemblies, especially Thyatira, mention is made of the works. Here the Lord says briefly, "I know thy works".
{439}
P.L. His lack of comment upon them in detail indicates His satisfaction in their pursuit to completeness. They would be all of a piece, so to speak, like the virtuous woman works in @Proverbs 31, bringing all to completeness, so that he for whom they are pursued is known in the gates.
A.N.W. It is sufficient for her that he knows them. She is content with that.
P. L. What a contrast to the spirit of self-advertisement!
Rem. Everything in the way of works is tested by His knowledge of them, so He appraises them in the different assemblies. Here He says, 'I know them'; they evidently pass His scrutiny.
C.A.M. Otherwise, I suppose, we could not have verse 9, the principle of this being seen in the opening of the Acts.
P.L. Whilst having also a future bearing, the Lord's delight in those who bear His reproach is testified to in this ninth verse. Paul's ministry is peculiarly linked up with the reproach of Christ. The feet of the saints here mentioned in verse 9 might not only allude to the completeness of the final victory, but to the way love for Christ in a remnant in assembly character has *stood* for His rights in the face of every challenge, and has also *gone forward* in the current of His mind.
A.R. We are not waiting for the millennium to find out that the Lord loves us. They "shall know that *I* have loved thee"; but we are not waiting for that.
P.L. The present comfort of such a word is to help us to be content with outward smallness, and yet to see that all that is done assembly-wise has a character proper to the whole.
J.S. Philadelphia is set over against the public profession, as seen in Sardis and Laodicea.
{440}
P.L. So that the very reproach inflicted by the great profession around makes for the protection of such a remnant in obscurity, making the Lord's present approbation and promise for the future but the more valued by such hearts.
A.N.W. What saints have done is simply to avail themselves of the opened door that He has set before them.
Rem. The end of verse 7 would make room for the preaching of the gospel in the rooms and other places, such as the street. The One who has led captivity captive is the One who keeps this door open. He keeps it open for those who keep His word and do not deny His name.
P.L. Quite so. The synagogue of Satan referred to here suggests the peculiar opposition of these last days: how the foe is entrenched in orthodoxy and generally accredited religion, using in terms truth that has been given in an earlier day to discredit that which is distinctive to the moment in the Spirit's present voice.
A.N.W. Paul proved the truth of the open door. He said, "A great door is opened to me and an effectual one, and the adversaries many", @1 Corinthians 16: 9. He is conscious of the open door, while the adversary is there.
P.L. What spoil is thus assured to Christ in assembly revival in remnant conditions, both in universal and local settings according to Paul's ministry, and all secured in that atmosphere of holy love which John proved, as in the bosom of Jesus!
A.F.M. So that in verse 10: "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, *I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth". They have been faithful to Him here, and He would be faithful to them when the trial comes upon the world.
{441}
P.L. So that at the rapture the *whole* assembly is taken according to the principles and features which have governed the remnant. As such they represent the assembly under the eye of the Lord, thus warranting His finally taking to Himself the assembly as a whole.
A.R. Samuel puts David's mighty men at the end of his history (@2 Samuel 23); but in Chronicles they are placed at the beginning. Does that correspond with Philadelphia coming in at the end?
P.L. Samuel bearing on the historical side would fit in with the scripture before us, the three "mighties", surpassing all others in their devotion to David in relation to the peculiar desire of his heart; this for Christ being the assembly.
J.T.Jr. They catch the spirit of David in breaking through the Philistines. He had himself introduced the great idea of breaking through.
Ques. What about the hour of trial? The brethren are suffering from the forerunner of this in the trade unions.
P.L. Such movements are at times marked by ruthless opposition to those who stand apart from them in the recognition of what is due to God. They are but the forerunner of the persecution awaiting the godly remnant in a coming day. How the Lord helps those who stand true! The opened door, promised of the Lord, assures the remnant a way through to the end of this dispensation for all that pertains to Christ and the assembly. This provision of grace, however, is bound up with the assembly features in a remnant which are pleasing to Christ; and which thus furnish Him with a moral warrant for the continuation of the opened door.
A.R. What you have said helps to explain many current happenings. The Lord will keep His promise to the end to those to whom it applies in this scripture.
{442}
Rem. The interests of the Lord's name are to be paramount. If we are not prepared to hold what is in keeping with that name, in our localities, though we may be nominally meeting together, the Lord may close that door to us at some time of testing.
P.L. As we survey the political horizon, we can see how easily but for the Lord the door might be shut as regards even our public gatherings. How intimately bound up in the mind of the Lord is the open door He furnishes, with the maintenance on the responsible side of all that is truly Philadelphian in character, in those available to Him.
A.F.M. The position of the saints is now in reproach and we are tested as to faithfulness to Him, which would result in the overcomer of the later verses.
P.L. "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name".
The expression "my God" coming in there indicates amongst other thoughts the ultimate end of this great assembly revival; all is to return to God. Himself the source of all that He has so blessedly revived. The Lord's allusion to "my God" testifies to His regard for this holy relationship into which He has entered as Man with His God, the precious light as to His sonship so recently recovered to the assembly after a lapse of many centuries bearing on the unique character of this relationship. How worthy He is of the richest spoil from those thus secured in divine mercy as in the light of the assembly. To such the light as to His sonship takes on ever-increasing lustre; all calculated of God to afford the best available to Christ here in view of God's
{443}
service and testimony. What stability will such take on as spiritually constituted pillars!
Ques. Do you think that the need today, in local assemblies, is for pillars of this kind? They seem to set out the whole position in Philadelphia.
P.L. Pillars in the *temple* of Christ's God, these thoughts finding in an anticipative way their expression in such as Simeon and Anna in the temple of old; still more with the apostles and those immediately after them; and the man of God in these last days. Is it not a question of standing thus for the truth of the assembly as a whole, thus embracing every feature of the truth, all being stood for definitely and devotedly by the overcomers in local and universal assembly settings? The overcoming is essentially bound up with the maintenance of what is heavenly.
C.A.M. Speaking about a pillar, it seems to be connected with standing, suggesting *men* who can stand; balanced and true, I suppose.
P.L. Yes. Whilst the public manifestation of such awaits a coming day, what gain is afforded to the saints where there is grace to recognise such and hold them in spiritual esteem as set there by the Lord Himself. To those who are spiritual, the ever fresh-recurring crises in the testimony will but confirm that the Lord has established such pillars. The day to come will afford occasion for the manifestation of what has morally come under the eye of Christ here, and has so proved His support, the Lord, we suppose, having in mind the two pillars in Solomon's temple, whose names mean "He will establish" and "In Him is strength". How the Lord would love to adorn such with His glorious writing! But it is *as pillars* that they afford Him the opportunity for such unique and precious writing.
{444}
Rem. God is not ashamed to identify His great name with these people because they are spiritually in keeping with it.
P.L. How delightful to the Lord must such a service be both to His God whom He so loves to serve and to those who as overcomes invite Him so to do.
E.E.H. It is not just the temple, but the temple of *my God* and the city of *my God*. Is that the spoil you have in mind?
P.L. Yes, the overcomer being thus spoil accruing to Christ, such as He delights to assure to God, both in His service and testimony, having His own part and joy in such spoil both as the Minister of the sanctuary and as the Defender of the testimony.
Ques. Is it your thought that this twelfth verse goes through into eternity?
P.L. The portion of the overcomer being characteristically heavenly, all surely goes through into the realm to which it belongs.
Rem. The final thought -- the great eternal end -- will be, God dwelling with men; and I was wondering whether that will be by way of the saints. Christ writing thus assuring that God will in a representative way be seen in the saints mediatorially throughout eternity.
P.L. The thought of God's tabernacle being with men would indicate the assembly's part in a mediatorial relation under Christ in the setting forth of God as He is to be known eternally among men.
Rem. The name would indicate that there is something peculiarly precious attaching to each position, that is the *name* of my God, the *name* of the city of my God, and my new name. It is for each to inquire as to what that means.
P.L. Quite so; and what grace and power attach to the expression "my God" as apprehended in the soul of the overcomer, so that as a pillar written thus upon by Christ we can maintain in assembly character
{445}
to the end these holy features. What stability would all this afford to the administrative side of things, for instance, as supported by pillars on whom Christ has written the name of the city of His God. Every feature of the service and testimony of God being entered upon from this elevated setting of "my God", the provisional side of things will be adorned and filled out by the light and love of the eternal.
C.A.M. Your reference to the eternal is impressive. We have but little said as to what will fill eternity, but the overcomer seems to be promised a great deal of the most wonderful things.
P.L. And how furthering would all this be to the completion of assembly exercises on hand, without undue delay.
J.T.Jr. So it is what *comes down* in the care meeting; it should not come up from the natural side, but down from heaven.
P.L. That is the only way; the heavenly city comes down having the glory of God; and those moving assembly-wise in that character afford a lead to their brethren in spiritual power and influence.
A.F.M. Would you say that verse 11 and the end of verse 12 are somewhat parallel?
P.L. The assembly's crown is Christ Himself in the way He is ever to be known and loved by the assembly. How graciously has the Lord recovered to us in this remnant day the light of His sonship -- lost to the assembly since the close of the apostolic era. What spoil could compare with this? All to the end that the service of God may be more intelligently entered upon under One so great as the Minister of the sanctuary, and the testimony taken on in ever-increasing devotedness in the appreciation of Him whose testimony it is, even the testimony of our Lord.
{446}
A.R. Does the writing of "the name of my God", "the name of the city of my God", and "my new name" suggest that the saints will be a full representation of these three features?
P.L. Yes, as overcoming. How precious is this word *new*, as a set-off against the boastful claims to antiquity in accredited religion, accompanied by such an absence of what is fresh and new. This new name would bring in the freshness in which we are to serve God, in a right understanding of the Lord's Person as in manhood. So that we move in the perennial freshness of all that He is to God, and thus in spirit already enter into what is eternal.
C.A.M. That is remarkable; we touch eternity, all things new and of God.
P.L. Yes. The peculiar testings in suffering, through which what is Philadelphian is reached and maintained in overcoming, have great place with the Lord, not only as affording present qualification for the testimony and service of God, but also for the coming day of glory; capacity and spiritual formation for what is eternal thus being also promoted and already entered upon in assembly privilege.
A.B.P. Do you connect "my God" of @Psalm 22 with this?
P.L. We see in that psalm how the whole system of divine praise is engaging the Lord in that dire hour of His abandonment. Israel's praises were there found with Him alone; but where would He not go to assure God a dwelling in the praises of His redeemed people? All this and more being already secured in that great vessel of praise, the assembly.
A.R. Does this suggest that even in the days of reproach the overcomer is representing Christ's God, then the new Jerusalem, and then Christ Himself in a new way -- my new name? All these things are represented among the saints.
{447}
P.L. The very best in the presence of the very worst.
W.B-w. What did you say the crown of the assembly was?
P.L. Would it not be Christ Himself as apprehended according to the truth of His Person in manhood?
A.B.P. Taking David as a type of Christ, would you say that Hushai, Zadok, and others such would represent Philadelphian characteristics and feelings in the absence of Christ, having Him personally before them in His glory?
P.L. As such they formed part of an invisible, subtle, spiritual organisation, all flowing from the appreciation of David. They were considering for him alone and thus contributing to the confusion of his foes and to the recovery of his people.
Ques. Is verse 13 the test as to who is really going to enter into what we are speaking of?
P.L. Yes. The Spirit, while ever moving in relation to what has been revealed, is Himself in possession of all the vast wealth that resides in Christ. Our Lord said of the Comforter that "he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you", @John 16: 14. The Spirit is thus ever opening up these great treasures. We have an allusion in @Acts 20 to the Lord's own words, which are not mentioned in the gospels: "The words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive". Does this not suggest that where Paul's distinctive ministry is maintained the Spirit will be free in the assembly to operate through vessels He has in hand in this great service? Everything that the Lord Jesus was as here, and ever will be in manhood, is surely part of the assembly's wealth, and the Spirit would love now through vessels corresponding to Christ to enlarge upon this in the assembly. How often has this been proved in this
{448}
remnant day! -- all of course being according to the law and the testimony. The Spirit loves to have vessels into whom He can pour the blessedness of Christ, as God would have the saints to know Him.
W.B-w. I was wondering whether spoil for the Lord was cumulative in the seven assemblies, inasmuch as there are overcomers in each one.
P.L. Hence the word "upon whom the ends of the ages are come", @1 Corinthians 10: 11. Such are to be possessed of the accumulated wealth of all the spoil, gathered for Christ throughout the dispensation; but one can see how Philadelphia stands for the unique and crowning spoil of Christ, in enabling Him in holy love to resume assembly relations with a remnant.
J.S. The latter glory will be greater than the former.
A.F.M. In the end of each assembly address it says, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies", as if all through the Spirit's speaking, as well as in the Lord's speaking, there would be results culminating positively in Philadelphia.
P.L. Everything is gathered up there. As valuing the love of Christ, we would not assume to be Philadelphia, but we are tested by these features and searched as to how far each of us answers to them. But this word of the Spirit suggests that He has great liberty as to Christ in an atmosphere where He is supremely loved.
J.S. The expression, "I come quickly", (verse 11), only appears in this assembly. What is the peculiar value of it to us?
P.L. The Lord knows what such a promise means to a Philadelphian overcomer, as the closing service of Christ in relation to the vessel He so loves.
{449}
SPOIL (11)
@Revelation 21: 1 - 17
J.T.Jr. At our last reading we considered the thought of "the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem", @Revelation 3: 12, which links on with our chapter tonight. In the scripture read we see the city "coming down out of the heaven from God". Earlier in the book there are suggestions of spoil which would no doubt culminate in the city as seen in our chapter; for example, in chapter 4 there is the thought of *experience* in the twenty-four elders, and *life* in the four living creatures; then *kingship* and *priesthood* in chapter 5, *bondmen* in chapter 7, and the *service of song* in chapter 14; so that all these features would enter into what the city contains, or represents, as seen in chapter 21. The great thought of enrichment through recovery is what is before us in the thought of spoil. God has in mind to bring about in this day the recovery, in some way, of everything that was set up in the beginning. The intervening chapters referred to would represent the features that have been recovered to us, and which are so needed in our meetings, if there is to be a concrete expression of the assembly in a city.
J.S. How are you viewing chapter 21?
J.T.Jr. That the spoil from the recovery is seen in the city as coming down, embodying the features of Christ, as set forth in Him here.
A.N.W. Does not the very breakdown disclosed in chapters 2 and 3 emphasise the spoil more gloriously in the end? Failure came in, but the city is seen coming down having the glory of God in spite of what failure had brought in.
Rem. There is spoil as the outcome of the ways of God here, but the city as seen in chapter 21 comes out of *heaven*, which is a further thought.
{450}
J.T.Jr. John sees it as "coming down", but it had previously gone up, and he had himself been called up to heaven, as it says, "Come up here", @Revelation 4: 1. He sees it from that view-point.
Rem. So that administrative actions in our economy are to emanate from the *heavenly* city.
C.A.M. The overcomer in Philadelphia is one who really knows something of the heavenly city and what is new, does he not?
J.T.Jr. The overcomer, in that way, would stand out in our day. Failure is acknowledged, which is important, but as we overcome, we are brought into the light of the assembly in this glorious character as coming down out of heaven from God. We have all had our part in the failure, but the great thought of God is that there should be spoil in recovery to His original thoughts.
W.R. You referred to chapter 5, which reads, "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God, by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, and made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall reign over the earth" (verses 9, 10). Do you see the thought of spoil there?
J.T.Jr. You get the thought of kings and priests *reigning*, introduced there. I suppose that as Christ becomes worthy to us we take on these features. They say, "Thou art worthy". One feature of the great recovery in our day is the truth of the greatness of the Lord's Person; the understanding, in our souls, of the Lord in His redemptive rights over us; He is worthy to us, and we value in our souls the greatness of His Person. In that way we become fitted to have part in the city in the features of kingship and priesthood.
A.B.P. Would that be worked out in experience down here? It was mentioned that the city comes
{451}
out in heavenly character, but what comes out must go in first, must it not?
J.T.Jr. Yes; I think that is the way it stands. What has been wrought out here; that has taken root downward, as it says, "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward" (@Isaiah 37: 31); that is, we have had part in the testimony as having taken root downward in self-judgment, and in recognition of the Spirit, so that what comes out in the second part of our subject in chapter 21 is movement in the Spirit's power. John is carried in spirit to a great and high mountain, which shows us how God brings us into the realm of His operations as we are available to Him. The living creatures and elders indicate how the truth is expressed in the assembly in a vital and experienced way. We are made to reign and to be priests to God as the fruit of the redemptive work of Christ, as seen in chapter 5. Then in chapter 7 the thought of bondmen is introduced; the bondmen are sealed, that is, they are marked off as bound over to Christ. That is another great feature that has been recovered in our day, so that we are not our own, we are bought with a price, we are bound over to Christ as His bondmen, and are sealed. Then in chapter 14 we have the service of song which really links on with David's ministry and would suggest the recovery of song to God in the assembly.
Rem. I suppose the living creatures in the midst of the throne would suggest that there is to be the expression of life in administration, and then the thought of experience would come into it also as indicated in the twenty-four elders. In that way, there is a link between what will come out in the city in its future administration and what has been committed to us in responsibility here. In the parables of the talents and the minas in @Matthew 25
{452}
and @Luke 19, the bondmen are given the Lord's substance, in responsibility, as if to see what they would do with it in adverse circumstances, to qualify them for city administration. As taking on local responsibility here we qualify for our place in the city.
A.N.W. The first reference to the city, in @Revelation 21, is in connection with God tabernacling with men, whereas the second is rather in relation to the kingdom; it is reigning, rather than dwelling.
Rem. In the first reference it is really seen as derived morally from Christ, not exactly as related to past history; it is *new* Jerusalem and is a greater thought than what follows.
A.R. In relation to a new heaven and a new earth. "And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new" (verse 5). The assembly is to be the companion of Christ in relation to an entirely new system which is eternal, not now in an administrative setting as in the latter part of the chapter, but what she is peculiarly for the eye of Christ. Is not that really the greatest spoil that we can think of -- what is for Christ Himself?
C.A.M. It throws lustre on the entire chapter. What is *new* is so strongly emphasised and is lit up with the light of eternity.
A.N.W. While less is said, far more is involved in the bride adorned for her husband, than in the administrative aspect of the city.
Rem. What is new, as developed in @Colossians 3: 10, should have its influence upon what is done in an administrative way in wilderness circumstances? It is noticeable, for instance, that the spies in responsibility, at the end of the wilderness journey, link on with Rahab, who is indigenous to the land. What is new is really controlling the movements of those taking up responsibility relative to the people of God, before they reach heaven actually.
{453}
The same is seen in the stones which were set up at the Jordan; there is a link between the twelve men and the stones which did not come out of the wilderness. Should there not be a link between what is *new*, as out of Christ, and our responsible position here in city character?
J.T.Jr. I think that corresponds with the early chapters of Revelation where the living creatures and the elders are referred to. There is a correspondence in them to the bride, for the Lord becomes worthy to them, as seen in chapters 4 and 5. He is worthy in chapter 4 as recognised in His creative rights; and in chapter 5 His redemptive rights are acknowledged, thus the Lord is acquiring a place in our hearts as worthy.
A.R. It is apparent that verse 2 suggests what the bride is as being peculiarly for her husband; what she is for the heart of Christ as spoil as the result of His death.
J.T.Jr. The features that come to light in the previous chapters bring that out. There is the thought of bondmen in chapter 7: 14; those who are subject, and to whom Christ can deliver of His substance as in @Matthew 25: 14, and the authority as in @Mark 13: 34, as here in wilderness conditions, so that we are to be the confidants of Christ. Then in chapter 14 the praise of God leads to a fuller response and greater understanding of God. The song of the harp-singers in heaven is *learned*. I think it all leads on to an understanding of the bride in her relation with Christ, for the thoughts of virginity and following the Lamb are introduced immediately (@Revelation 14: 2 - 4).
A.C. Attention has been drawn to the word *new*. Would the reference, in the first verse, to the first heaven and the first earth having passed away, suggest the great contrast between that which preceded and that which is brought into view now?
{454}
J.T.Jr. The sea exists today in the sense that death is on every hand, but in our chapter we are introduced into that in which there is no death. That is emphasised in verse 4, "And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall not exist any more, ... for the former things have passed away". We are to have a sense of that now. What the city represents is to be understood today, for it is being worked out experimentally, in the saints. She comes down out of heaven from God in relation to Christ as the Lamb's wife, and that is really the only relation in which we can rightly take on administration here.
Rem. The section from verse 9 on is an important part of the subject in connection with spoil, for the assembly is seen in its millennial glory. She is seen as coming down out of heaven from God, showing what *He* has effected.
A.R. The latter part of the chapter is in relation to time; the bearing is manward, administratively. The great crowning thought of spoil seems to be in what God will have eternally for His own heart. "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God" (verse 3). That is the great final thought of what God is working out in time; what He shall have eternally for Himself.
A.B.P. Wayward man went *out* from the presence of God and built the first city. Man, in Christ has been recovered to God to dwell with Him eternally, and the *holy* city comes down out of heaven from God, in its eternal setting. Is this not remarkable spoil?
J.S. Does not the first verse show a wonderful triumph for God? "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more", @Revelation 21: 1.
{455}
That, as standing out by itself, is a great moral triumph for God in the final disposition of every moral question caused through sin.
A.R. And then it says, "And he that sat on the throne said, Behold I make all things new. And he says to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. And he said to me, It is done". @Revelation 21: 5, 6. The matter is completed.
Rem. Is it not in the Spirit's mind in Paul's ministry that the eternal side of things as represented in these first eight verses of chapter 21 should be a present reality to the saints? If we were really to take in, by the Spirit's power, our position as it is stated in @Ephesians 1 and 2, and link that on with this chapter, we would find out how fully the matter works out from this point of view. In @Ephesians 1 and 2 we are brought to God according to the great thoughts that He had in His mind from eternity. It is as if the divine mind started with that idea. The twelve stones taken out of Jordan and set up in the land established a link with what had been wrought out by God in the wilderness, and the same principle is seen in the link between Rahab and the spies.
A.R. It is well to question how much we understand what it is to live in a realm outside of death.
J.T.Jr. The Supper introduces us into that sphere; so that we can know now what it is to be where death has no part or place, with our spirits set free to enjoy the great and eternal thoughts of God. I think that we can reach it in the assembly. It is in the assembly that we reach God -- "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the ages of ages. Amen", @Ephesians 3: 21.
W.F.K. "So that if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation", @2 Corinthians 5: 17. Would that be experienced in the assembly?
{456}
J.T.Jr. I suppose the teaching of new creation in its present application has reference to the new order of things, as over against what existed here before. It refers to man set up anew, "So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new", @2 Corinthians 5: 17. The eternal thoughts of God bring in the assembly in its relation to Himself in an entirely new setting.
A.C. There is great dignity in the way in which the holy city comes down.
J.T.Jr. It is a great thought; we should take on the greatness of it, so that we approach every matter in the assembly by coming down! It corresponds with what the Lord said in @John 6: "I am the bread which has come down out of heaven" (verse 41). This chapter refers to the assembly as reflecting the spirit of Christ in coming down to meet every situation.
C.A.M. The allusion to John's gospel helps. There is very little on record with regard to eternity, and I suppose we can hardly understand it unless we apprehend John's gospel in the aspect of what comes out from God and goes back to God. This first paragraph we have read seems to involve that wonderful cycle, so that "It is done" seems to be parallel with the Lord's expression in John's gospel, "It is finished", @John 19: 30.
J.T.Jr. I think that helps. John has eternity in view throughout, and the accomplishment of the purposes of God. It has been said, Paul takes us up to heaven and John brings us down.
A.R. "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us" (@John 1: 14), would touch what is eternal, linking on with the thought that "the tabernacle of God is with men", @Revelation 21: 3. One has thought that tabernacle conditions are really love
{457}
conditions, and that is what we get here. God tabernacling with men in conditions of love.
J.A.T. In verse 2 of this chapter the city is said to be "as a bride adorned for her husband", but in chapter 19, "the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready".
Rem. Historically, the marriage of the Lamb had taken place a thousand years before this first presentation in chapter 21, but the idea of the bride is preserved in the freshness of love for Christ.
A.R. Would the thought of the bride adorned for her husband be seen in Rebecca? The servant of Abraham gave her articles of silver and gold and clothing, which would have in view her presentation to Isaac, the heavenly man.
J.S. It is remarkable that at the end of the thousand years the assembly is still seen "as a bride adorned for her husband".
Rem. Rebecca is taken out of a typically heavenly condition of things. The idea of kindred and place enters into her selection. Entering into Sarah's tent would connect more with the ways of God here; the place Israel had.
J.T.Jr. It is well to distinguish, with regard to @Genesis 24, that the allusion is to the assembly filling out Israel's place, which would be seen in the early part of the Acts in the assembly's position in Jerusalem, whereas the setting at Antioch would be representative of the assembly as in *her own* place.
Rem. "Having the glory of God" would refer to the assembly in her own setting in the world to come. She *has* that glory; not as a glory transferred from Israel, but as her own.
J.T.Jr. It is helpful to see the assembly's own place as under Paul's ministry, which begins at Antioch and rises to God's greatest thoughts as set out in Ephesians.
{458}
A.R. The glory is seen as she comes out in display. Nothing is said about the glory of God in the first section of chapter 21; whereas, in the second, in the day of display, she has "the glory of God", and "Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone", (verse 11). First, the glory of God and then *her* shining, what radiates from *her* as associated with Christ in display; it is the radiation of the glory of God.
J.S. Her power of radiation is very remarkable; all the nations shall walk by her light, as she comes down from God, having the glory of God.
Rem. The Lord would, on His return, seek for spoil in the way of spiritual substance, too. It is a question of what He has gained through what He has committed to the saints in the way of authority and substance. How have these things been handled -- has there really been gain as a result of our use of what has been committed?
J.T.Jr. Does not this work out in a practical way in our care meetings? We approach matters there from the viewpoint of the first part of this chapter, as coming out from God. If we understood that more, our vision would be clearer and our judgments would be more quickly arrived at. It is the *new* Jerusalem in verse 2; not old Jerusalem. Judaism is set aside practically in our souls, and the idea of universal government comes before us as she is seen coming out from God. It should affect the whole meeting.
C.A.M. You are speaking now of the administrative side as governed by the opening of this chapter. I suppose, as has already been said, it would be like the blessedness of the gospel of John; it is the God who inhabits eternity and tabernacles amongst men; that is the setting there. But when we come to the administrative side in the end of our chapter, it really links on with the gospel of
{459}
Matthew. The number twelve, the points of the compass, and the city of the great king are common to both.
J.T.Jr. It is really impossible for any of us to take part in the latter unless we know something of the former. We should know how to speak to God in the assembly, if we are to take up administrative matters.
Rem. David would represent that kind of man in contrast to Saul. It was a long time after Saul was anointed that he built an altar; whereas it was customary with David when approaching conflict to go to God about it; he came out from God in that way. This has an important bearing on the way we approach the issues that come up among the people of God now in our various localities. David would represent one who came out from God in administration, because he really took the heavenly position, in taking Jerusalem, and refers to it in @Psalm 24.
F.C. It says it is the *holy* city.
J.T.Jr. I suppose David had that before him. He knew how to speak to God, and he introduced the service of song. Every one of us should have part in the great outburst of praise to God in the assembly. We would then be more capable of taking up administrative matters, as a glorious and rejoicing people.
Ques. In verse 10 John is taken to a great and high mountain, from which he sees the city coming down. Does that fit in with Matthew's gospel and show that we are still down here?
A.R. Matthew's gospel makes much of the thought of mountains; there are seven referred to in it. The holy city would be in contrast to what is unholy, so that every administrative matter in the assembly should be maintained on a high level in seeking to maintain holiness.
{460}
Ques. Is not the great and high mountain important, too, as suggesting that we are in a position where we can view things aright; still down here, but not on man's level.
Rem. When David fled from Jerusalem because of Absalom, he "went up by the ascent of the Olives, and wept as he went", @2 Samuel 15: 30. Then, when he reached the summit, he worshipped God, as if to indicate that the man was right with God; not only from God to him, but from himself to God. Nothing in relation to Jerusalem would be lost with that kind of man, even though the position amongst the people of God may be one of smallness and reproach.
A.R. Would it not challenge us as to how we come to our care meetings? It says the city is coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. If we came to our meetings in the light of that, matters would be adjusted according to God, and without unnecessary delay.
Rem. King Saul had opportunity to learn what could come down from God, but he moved of himself.
J.T.Jr. That was characteristic of the man who forced himself and disregarded the Spirit. Here, John is carried away in the Spirit. It is not only the thought of elevation as suggested in the mountain, but also a question of the power of the Spirit. These factors should affect the whole assembly in arriving at a judgment.
Rem. One of the seven angels having the seven bowls introduces John into this position, indicating that the matter relates to judgment. He is in the secret of what God is bringing in, in the way of judgment (chapter 21: 9).
A.C. Would the fact that John was invited by the angel to come and see the bride, the
{461}
Lamb's wife, suggest dignity? What is the present application?
J.T.Jr. The great value of this book of Revelation is in our getting its present bearing, and understanding the assembly in its relation to Christ. John is in the Spirit. It really corresponds with Luke's gospel when Simeon came into the temple in the Spirit. The great burden of John's ministry is to make us spiritual and to help us to understand the relation of the assembly to Christ.
A.R. It says, "Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone". The word "crystal" suggests transparency. If we are to radiate, we must first be transparent.
R.W.S. There is not only a great and high mountain, but a great and high wall.
A.N.W. I wondered whether that did not give character to all the things to be handled in relation to fellowship; they are great and high, not small, petty, and mean. Does it not suggest exclusiveness in a very great and dignified sense?
J.T.Jr. If we are in the gain of this the truth will govern us in every relation, for it involves the truth, which at times may seem very high and testing.
W.F.K. The foundations are visible. We are told, "the firm foundation of God stands", @2 Timothy 2: 19. Is this the public display to the world?
J.T.Jr. This describes what is coming out in display. The idea of substance is here. It is a cube; not an empty thing, but a solid, indicating real substance in the souls of the saints, built upon a foundation that cannot be moved.
Rem. Today it is a wholly spiritual matter; in that day it will be an official matter. The substance that has been committed to us now is to be taken up in the Spirit's power in relation to the city gates; that is, in administrative matters.
{462}
A.R. The idea of the city is being worked out amongst us in an administrative way, so that it becomes an exercise as to whether we can come up to the measurements of verse 15 today. We would find greater results among the saints if we laboured with this view of Jerusalem before us.
A.B.P. Is that not exemplified in the first epistle to the Corinthians? Paul lets us into the secret of this great principle when he tells us that fourteen years before he had been caught up into Paradise (@2 Corinthians 12). He saw everything from that view point.
A.R. He was an "assembly man". He worked out administrative matters from the divine side.
Rem. Most of Paul's public ministry was undertaken after he knew a man in Christ. He really knew what it was to come out of heaven in relation to his ministry.
J.S. It is noticeable that the Spirit seems to dwell on the details of the gates and the foundations, showing what God has in mind for us at the present moment.
A.R. One feels that the idea of measure should enter more into our local gatherings; the city is measured, and the wall is measured; we should discern if the idea of measure is with us in all our administrative matters; as to whether they correspond to the measurements of the city.
Rem. It really should enter into every christian's mind. We are responsible to walk in the light as God is in the light, and this measuring should be in mind, for it is done according to the divine standard, not man's standard. A *golden* reed is used for measuring.
J.T.Jr. So that everything that is brought into our meetings should reflect the truth as from God. There should be no room for mere opinions, but what the truth of God is about the matter.
{463}
A.R. Fellowship is based on the apostle's ministry; that which was set up at the beginning. No doubt the wall has fellowship in view.
Rem. It would keep out evil and enclose what is of God. Then there is the idea of the gates, too, which would denote care and watchfulness, for there is an angel at each gate.
A.R. If this city, in a coming day, will have influence in a mediatorial way to preserve what is of God on earth and give effect to it, we should be concerned as to how much influence the assembly has upon men today, for the gates and the city and the wall are all measured.
Rem. It says it is "a man's measure, that is, the angel's" (verse 17), as though intelligence enters into it; so that the saints should take this on as being set for the fulfilment of God's will.
Rem. There can be no lowering of God's standard. God will not permit of that. We may say that the idea of separation is becoming greater, and that the sieve is becoming finer and the wall higher, but really, *God's standard is always the same*. We must start with the standard and adhere to it.
J.S. The *twelve* gates would represent perfect administration.
A.N.W. Malachi closes with remembering the law of Moses given for all Israel (see @Malachi 4: 4); the divine standard is held to the end.
Rem. Everyone that comes into fellowship would enter through the *twelve* gates, in principle. There should be no different standard for fellowship from one city to another, nor should things be held more loosely in one place than in another. It is the idea that the requirements for entering at one gate are to be the same for all gates.
J.S. Some might seek to come in through the south gates. But what comes in through the south must correspond with the north.
{464}
A.R. At the gates there are twelve angels and names inscribed which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel; so that as coming in through one gate one comes to nothing less than the full thought; that is, one is in relation to the whole assembly.
Rem. This would be corrective of loose principles or local independence. The standard and bearing of christian fellowship is universal.
A.R. The tribal thought is introduced here. Each gate represents a tribe in relation to the other eleven tribes.
Rem. And all the gates are linked together by the one wall; linked together in the exercise of the same kind of government.
J.S. That is helpful; there were twelve angels at the twelve gates. It would help us to recognise that heaven is to be represented here, so that we might do things in the light of this.
Rem. The idea of the angels would be seen in those men that were faithful to David when he fled from Absalom. Zadok and Abiathar and Hushai would be like angels standing at the gates of Jerusalem; they really stood for the truth according to @Psalm 24, what Jerusalem is in an assembly setting.
A.R. There is also a link with the addresses to the seven assemblies in the opening of this book, where the "angel of the assembly" is addressed in each letter.
A.B.P. Would you say that the angel might suggest complete freedom from partisanship or personal feeling? An angel knows to do nothing but the will of God.
J.S. The fact that the four points of the compass are alluded to would bring in the universal aspect; we should always have that in mind.
Rem. The angel with the golden reed would bring in the responsible element. It is not official,
{465}
but one who carries out the thought of God. The *golden* reed would suggest that he does not have his own thoughts before him.
A.R. Reference has been made to each gate being one pearl. Each saint coming into fellowship should be impressed with the full idea of what he is coming into; the idea of the *one* pearl, held in the souls of the saints in each local gathering.
J.S. And he should be in the full light of the death of Christ. The pearl would suggest that which is out of death.
A.B.P. In @Acts 15, which gives us the great model for our care meetings, we are told that they arrived at a *common judgment*. Would that not suggest the oneness of the gates?
A.R. Paul's work was based on this "one" idea.
A.N.W. And should we not act in the light of accessibility, as suggested in the three gates on every side, making the city accessible to any that would approach?
Rem. And under whatever conditions they approach.
R.W.S. The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every precious stone, the product of pressure and suffering, which was exemplified in the apostles who suffered in a peculiar way. They led in suffering; they were like the cattle which were led ahead of others, spoken of as David's spoil, in @1 Samuel 30: 20; and are not the same features seen in @Revelation 11, where the bodies of the two witnesses will be on the street of the great city which is called, spiritually, Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified? Where the suffering feature is not maintained, there is no securing of spoil.
J.T.Jr. That is helpful. David's mighty men came to light at the end, as well as at the beginning of his reign. They represent the element that goes through.
{466}
This is seen in @1 Chronicles 11: 10 - 40, and in @2 Samuel 23: 8 - 39.
A.R. They are the twelve apostles of the *Lamb*. They have a special link with the One who suffered.
J.T.Jr. It is great spoil for Christ in that we can sit together as brethren today and enjoy the meaning of this number twelve!
Rem. The twelve oxen that supported the molten sea in Solomon's day faced the four points of the compass; they looked out; they did not look in on one another, and the idea of these twelve gates might suggest that we should be looking out, holding things locally in relation to the universal idea. It should help us not to become isolated in our thoughts.
A.R. The gates shall not be shut at all by day, and night shall not be there; evidently there will be no need for them to be shut at all.
A.B.P. The necessity for self-judgment was referred to earlier in the meeting. I suppose we should find it difficult to link the name of Peter, the first apostle, with the jasper stone transparency of the first foundation, were it not for @John 21.
A.R. His epistles would also show that he is worthy of being linked on with the first foundation.
A.B.P. But does not @John 21 bring out in detail how the thing works out; the heart-searching which resulted from the Lord's probing, and finally his words, "Thou knowest all things"? Would that not be, in principle, the jasper stone clear as crystal?
J.S. After such searching there would be no dark spot.
{467}
THE CONTINUANCE OF PROPHETIC MINISTRY
@Revelation 10: 1 - 11
I have in mind to call attention to the *continuance* of the prophetic word. Prophecy is not a new thing; indeed, it is one of the oldest things, for Enoch prophesied before the deluge, and Abraham is called a prophet, Jehovah saying in relation to him, "Do my prophets no harm", @Psalm 105: 15. But they were not only prophets, they were *praying* men; they depended upon God in their service. However much ability a servant may have, the *power* is from God. The excellency of the power is to be of God, which is not simply by the gift, although the gift has power, but by *dependence* upon God. So that Jehovah said to Abimelech, of Abraham, "He is a prophet, and will pray for thee" (@Genesis 20: 7); thus we see that prophecy and prayer go together. Abraham *did* pray for Abimelech and God answered his prayer.
Now, as I have said, the prophetic word is not new; brethren are having recourse to it in a little measure, but it is not new. It runs down through the Old Testament, also through the New, so that the assembly itself is said to be built upon the foundation of the apostles and *prophets*; hence the greatness of the service of prophecy, and the importance of its continuance. The idea of its continuance is set forth in this chapter; it was said to John, "Thou must prophesy again" (verse 11). This was contingent, evidently, on right feelings in him; he felt the bitterness of the little book.
I want to speak, just briefly, about the little opened book in the hands of the mighty angel, who undoubtedly is Christ Himself coming in at the
{468}
end of the dispensation, placing His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the earth. It is said that He was "clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow upon his head, and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire" (verse 1). It undoubtedly alludes to a testimony to be rendered by Christ at the end of a long period, and having in mind this matter of prophecy. It shows how important the matter is, that there should be such an intervention of Christ in this remarkable form, the idea of prophecy being the end in mind. Pains are divinely taken that the mind of God should come in and should be continued.
So the Lord is seen, as I said, at the end of a period, for long centuries have elapsed since the testimony began at Pentecost, and the nations have asserted themselves; being set up of God to carry on for Him provisionally, they have asserted themselves and laid claim to all the earth, having divided it among themselves, whether by mutual partition, or as the spoil of war, and gradually the rights of God are excluded, as indeed they are in international matters. God is not taken into account to any great extent in peace treaties. It is a question of the power of the sword behind the peace-makers; war-makers turned into peace-makers for convenience sake. In international councils, God is left out; we can see it is not a question of the rights of God, but the rights of those who are victorious. This has gone on for centuries, and not only has the idea invaded the territorial earth, but has asserted itself in religious matters as well; for religious matters come into these peace covenants, and commerce, too; indeed, all that enters into the make-up of the world enters into such conferences.
Now the Lord Jesus appears here in this symbolic way, calmly and yet most powerfully assuring us that in the midst of all these things, God's
{469}
rights stand; that all is in God's hands, asserted now through Christ, and that presently He will take possession of all in irresistible power. Not only that, but He is clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow on His head. He will not tear up divinely made covenants, but He will observe them fully. That is plainly intimated here. He is asserting divine rights and what goes with them morally, but engagements are being kept. There is the rainbow, which is the first sign God gave of a covenant, made with Noah. God will keep that covenant; whatever men may do, He is true to it. The rainbow is here seen on the head of Christ, the mighty Angel. What relief and assurance there is in that! And surely we should all be interested in matters which are transpiring today -- we may call them international matters, but the ownership of the earth and its government are divine matters. The present ruling powers are ordained of God and will continue as provisional "until he come whose right it is; and I will give it to him", God says (@Ezekiel 21: 27). The saints, too, will have part with Christ in the government of the world. The apostle Paul says, "Do ye not then know that the saints shall judge the world? ... Do ye not know that we shall judge angels?" @1 Corinthians 6: 2, 3. Such is the great place that is ours! But it is a solemn thought that suffering goes with this, for "if we endure, we shall also reign together", @2 Timothy 2: 12. The Lord would thus call us to His side; to be thoroughly with Him, in the fellowship expressed in His supper, and in the reproach and suffering involved in it: "if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him", @Romans 8: 17.
The position depicted here is in *testimony*; it is not literal. This testimony has already been rendered; the Lord has put in His claims through *ministry*; it has been asserted in this way during
{470}
many years. The apostle's ministry had the same testimony, but now it has been put in again. Whatever the nations may think or do, this stands; the testimony to it is seen here in this glorious Person with the rainbow on His head. He says, I am not going to trample on rights or engagements or covenants; I am here to establish the rights of God and men. That is Jesus! He died to do it! But this is not the side of His sacrificial death; it is His actual power to deal with the whole position; it is not arbitrary, but a question of right, and the rainbow means, as I said, that He recognises engagements entered into. Every engagement of God is yea and amen in Christ: the sense of that would come into our souls as we see Christ in this position. But it is a question of territory -- the sea and the earth -- and the Lord is putting Himself forward to assure us that He is in control, and would call us into this matter. And then our attention is called to "a little opened book". For years brethren have been used to a prophetic outline, a prophetic map; it has been published and read by many, so that the prophetic truth has become known, at least in terms. The light thus furnished and received has through grace been of general help and has given character to the testimony.
But these prophetic subjects have been discussed by persons who can hardly be said to be genuinely in the fellowship of God's Son; in this way the truth is apt to be brought down to the level of the human mind and thus its true spiritual and moral bearing becomes obscured. At the same time, the little book is "opened". We may thank God that it is open; that this prophetic matter is still open, so that anyone can see it and scan it. Discredit would not be placed on that, for it places all under responsibility as to it, but at the same time, it is
{471}
out of the scope of the human mind. The truth of God was never intended for the human mind by itself; "the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God", @1 Corinthians 2: 11.
So the Lord has the little open book in His hand; it is available for anyone to look at; it is not sealed like the one in chapter 5; it is open. There has been expository prophetic ministry, to open out the truth. But now the Lord is going to test everyone, and He takes up John, who is the most apt representative of the prophetic ministry; the disciple whom Jesus loved. He is called a bondman of God. That is one of the best titles we can get, in a moral sense. When people are asserting their titles, let them take account of this title, "bondman". The "revelation ... which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen ... sending by his angel, to his bondman John", @Revelation 1: 1. And John testified the word of God; the things which he saw.
John is thus a witness, a representative prophet, and he is taken up to show how prophetic ministry is to continue. It is not to continue in persons who take up the question of prophecy in a merely mental way, and make it a question of ordinary study. There are seminaries which use the publications of the ministry I have alluded to as textbooks, as other religious books are used for the instruction of students having clerical service in view. In this respect they are considered largely in a merely mental way, and the true moral and spiritual significance is lost, for it involves association with Christ, like the one hundred and forty-four thousand in @Revelation 14, and consequent separation from the world. But here the Lord is testing John as to reality respecting this open book. Is it like a text-book to us all? Are not these prophetic matters real things? Are they not at our very doors? But are we ready for them?
{472}
It is said, "having in his hand a little opened book. And he set his right foot on the sea, and the left upon the earth, and cried with a loud voice as a lion roars", @Revelation 10: 2, 3. It is the lion character which is now brought before us; it is not the presentation of the Lamb. It is a question of the Lord asserting His rights and possessing power to secure and establish them. And then we are told that "when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their own voices", referring to powers that He has in reserve, that He can call into action; overwhelming powers. Our David -- our Lord -- will presently come in and assert His rights with power that is irresistible. John says further, "And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Seal the things which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not" (verse 4). As much as to say, there is something to be known, but it is not to be published just now. What is known is represented by this opened book, but what use are we making of this book? Is it real to us? Is it a matter of faith? And then we learn "that there should be no longer delay", that a time is fixed for the accomplishment of divine purpose. So that if there is any unreality about us it is time to wake up, for the things in mind here are at our very doors; the very things that this little opened book contemplates have come nigh to us. Are we just regarding them as subjects for discussion, not involving conscience, not realising that suffering is entailed, if not in me, then in others? The Lord is looking for fuller response on our part to these things.
It says, "but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God also shall be completed, as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets" (verse 7). These are the things
{473}
that are known; anybody that is accustomed to read the prophetic books of ministry, circulated for the last hundred years or so, may be conversant with these matters; they have been declared to God's bondmen the prophets.
In verse 8 it says, "And the voice which I heard out of heaven was again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book which is opened in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth". Notice this reference; three times it is said of this mighty Angel, that His right foot is on the sea and His left upon the earth. This is a fixed matter; whatever men may do or say, the sea and the earth belong to Christ, but the word to John is, "Go, take the little book which is opened ... And I went to the angel, saying to him to give me the little book. And he says to me, Take and eat it up: and it shall make thy belly bitter (the Lord mentions the bitterness *first*), but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey" (verse 9). This is a bitter matter; it is no mere matter for discussion, as you might discuss geometry; it is prophecy. It is the mind of God as to the future; as if it were happening now, or will happen tomorrow, or the day after. It is a real thing; it is at our very doors, as I said. There is a bitterness in it, but, thank God, sweetness too. But in the real believer it will cause sorrow, and that is what I want to take to myself and desire that we all may face it.
John says, "And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth as honey, sweet"; the sweetness comes first here, because it is a question of the mind of God. The disclosure of the mind of God must cause enjoyment to a lover of God. And so John says, "it was in my mouth as honey, sweet; and when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter" (verse 10). The Lord spoke of the bitterness first, but
{474}
the bitterness came last, actually; nevertheless it came. Now the point I want to stress is, where are we as to these matters? Are we dealing with them mentally, or do they really involve suffering or joy, or both? The carrying out of the divine mind must mean judgment to some, because of current conditions, but to many it means enjoyment and blessing, also. The point thus is to get, in a *feeling* way, into the *current* of what God presents, and if that be so, then the continuance of the prophetic word is ensured. So the last verse says, "Thou must prophesy again as to peoples and nations and tongues and many kings"; as much as to say that John was the type of man who was needed for this ministry; a man who could feel with God as to what His testimony and holy government require; who could assimilate them into his very being.
That John *had been* used is implied in the word addressed to him; but the fact that I was used yesterday is not proof that I will be used today or tomorrow. Not that God is not infinitely fair with those whom He uses, and will, if possible, continue to use them; but that I have been used will not in itself suffice; continued suitable condition is needed. Thus the little book must affect me, causing sweetness and bitterness; if such is the case God will say, You are the man I will use again. Every true servant wants to be used again and again every moment of his life here. This is no light matter; it is serious, for the end has drawn nigh, and it is folly not to be feeling as to it. The apostolic writers all warn us as to it. Peter says, "What ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness ... ?" @2 Peter 3: 11. But, as I said, what I had in mind was that there should be such a condition among the saints as will ensure the continuance of the prophetic word.
{475}
SPOIL (12)
@Nehemiah 9: 5 - 8; @Deuteronomy 32: 39, 40; @Joshua 5: 13 - 15; @Psalm 102, 23 - 28
A.F.M. No doubt you have an exercise about our reading tonight, and we should be glad to hear what you have to suggest.
P.L. Could we not include in the thought of recently recovered spoil, along with the precious light as to Christ's sonship, a clearer apprehension by the Holy Spirit of the Lord's Godhead, glory, and majesty as underlying and giving character to all that He is and does in the sphere of revelation. With this in view might we trace, in at least three of the scriptures read, how He who is The Same, the I AM, which in effect is a name of God having its bearing toward the Absolute, affords in His own immutability, as thus apprehended by faith, the stability and strength needed in a recovered remnant to continue to the end in every feature and activity proper to the whole assembly. It is in John, the gospel bearing peculiarly on the last days, that the Lord, to the confusion of His foes, alludes to Himself as the "I am" (chapter 8: 24, 58; 18: 6).
Whilst recognising that the names, "The Same" and the "I am" differ in the original, their meaning generally is equivalent. In the apprehension of the glory and majesty of the great I AM a worshipful spirit is promoted which imparts its own impulse and lustre to every spiritual activity, thus assuring rich spoil to God in His service and testimony amongst His people. J.N.D. in the following lines pictures the celebration in heaven, by the unnumbered
{476}
hosts, of the One who is hailed as the great I AM.
<blockquote>These -- of Godhead's counsels deep <br>Him th Accomplisher proclaim; <br>These -- how Jesus self could weep -- <br>Of Godhead's love the witness came! <br>All, on love surpassing rest, <br>That clothed in flesh the great I AM</blockquote>
In @Nehemiah 9, God is acclaimed under this name in relation to His sovereign operations from the outset in regard to creation and the call of Abraham. How strength-imparting to the weak but faithful remnant would be this apprehension of His immutability; the praising Levites reviewing all the ways of God in this precious light! @Deuteronomy 32: 39, 40 would bear upon the levitical side, as we see how Moses, the pattern servant in his day, found, as reaching the climax of his great ministry, his strength and joy in the glory of the unchanging One, in contrast to Israel's fickleness as depicted by him in this chapter. @Psalm 102: 27 would rather stand connected with the service of God in the sanctuary; the Lord, as thus saluted of God, is to be apprehended as the One in whom that service is inaugurated and sustained through succeeding generations (verse 28). The quotation made from this psalm in Hebrews, an epistle largely devoted to the service of God, would furnish confirmation as to this thought. In @Joshua 5, whilst He is not so alluded to, yet stability both in leader and in those led depends upon an apprehension of Him as the unchanging One: He who is Captain of Jehovah's hosts.
A.F.M. Would the side of things contemplated in @Nehemiah 9 be a priestly one. The names of the priests or Levites are mentioned as giving the setting. The fruit is praise out-flowing to God.
P.L. Yes, and how all this praise contrasts with mere human creeds, which are the fruit of Babylonish influence on a captive people, but which are
{477}
so unsuited to a divinely recovered remnant with spiritual affections liberated Godward.
Rem. While the positional side had been recovered, is it not emphasised here that we must have substance to fill out the position.
P.L. Yes; "seeing your order" (@Colossians 2: 5), might suggest the positional side as seen in the first epistle to the Corinthians, but the truth of the Lord's Person as introduced in Colossians has particularly in view the formation of the assembly inwardly to correspond in love to her exalted Head.
A.R. Is the chapter in Nehemiah the climax of the result of spoil being distributed amongst the saints? The feast of booths being introduced by Ezra leads on to the glory position in the chapter we read.
P.L. Yes, the feast the tabernacles suggests our nearness to God and to Christ, and spiritual intimacy with one another, this is typified in the dwelling in booths. John not only tells us that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, but the atmosphere proper to the feast of tabernacles is set forth in @John 13 - 17. What intimacy and liberty marks the Lord's intercourse with His own, and finally with His Father! The Lord alludes in that gospel to who He is, as the I AM; the truth as to His Person being the crowning feature of remnant recovery in a broken day. Indeed John, writing for such a day as this, gives us in Revelation the Lord's word to Philadelphia, "that no man take thy crown", the assembly's crown being Christ Himself, as held in her affections in the full light of His glory. In @John 8: 58 He disposes of mere orthodox judaism in His majestic utterance, "Before Abraham was, I am", and later, when His foes came to take Him in the garden they fall backwards as He confronts them in His authority as the I AM.
{478}
C.A.M. The light and glory of this Person as known and held in the hearts of the saints is what is really going through. It should give everyone a great desire to be truly recovered.
P.L. Quite so. What spiritual stamina would the apprehension of Him as the I AM afford Nehemiah and those with him in those days and nights of vigilance in conflict and construction, with the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other! All this leads up to the supreme object for which God has wrought in assembly recovery, that He might have among His saints those to whom He can entrust the light and glory of the Person of Christ with a view to the service of God being rendered in greater fulness and intelligence.
C.A.M. Human innovations, such as creeds, could not change this glorious truth: He is "The Same".
P.L. Yes. All Nehemiah's toil has as its issue the remnant's recovery to Jehovah as "The Same", that One whose presence among them once filled the tabernacle in the wilderness with glory -- as also the house in the days of Solomon.
Ques. Is there in the background of this, what is furnished in the way of faithfulness on the part of the people?
P.L. Does that not take us back to the thought of the covenant, the unchanging engagements of divine love which call forth love's response without reserve in a people committed to the God of the covenant? In @Nehemiah 9: 38 we read, "Because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests are at the sealing". In these statements the recovered remnant are seen representatively at their best. Their hearts thus move in fresh committal to God in His unchanging and faithful love. The immutability of Him who, as the I AM, imparts such stability to His engagements, is disclosed in contrast to the fickleness of
{479}
Israel, to which their sorrowful history, as recited by the Levites in @Nehemiah 9, had borne such undeniable witness. The revival thus issued in the princes, Levites, and priests, being at the sealing. The analogy to the sealing would be found in the cup of the covenant which we bless, as in partaking of it we own the claims of divine love.
A.F.M. Would this sealing be in the nature of spoil for God on the part of Nehemiah and those with him?
P.L. Surely, in the securing of a people for God in the light of the covenant, and spoil for the Lord in this setting would lie in the espousal of the affections of the saints as a chaste virgin to Christ, as in the Lord's supper. What spoil that is, that holy love-feast, having, in these last days, been lifted out of the superstitious darkness in which Satan had for centuries enshrouded it by the Babylonish captivity of the public vessel!
Rem. I was thinking of what was said in prayer about what is vouchsafed to us in this day. It says in verse 2, "And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers". I was wondering whether that is not preliminary to what the Lord is now vouchsafing to us in the way of light as to His Person.
P.L. Quite so. How deep and searching is the moral history which underlies all this, both personal and collective. By this way alone can there be assured to God, from the assembly, that priestly atmosphere in which He would confide to us what is so infinitely precious to Him -- the truth relating to the Person of Christ. Those thus taught of God could, in spiritual fibre, survive every vicissitude of the responsible vessel, and go on together in love to the end. How many sorrowful defections in relation to the testimony could be traced to uncertainty as
{480}
to the truth of His Person, with all the attendant lack of committal in love which, alas, affords the foe his opportunity to cut off stragglers!
W.R. Does not the history of the assemblies in @Revelation 2 and 3 help us vitally?
P.L. Yes. Whatever the public break-up, the overcomer in Philadelphia abides a pillar as sustained in the apprehension of the Person of Christ.
A.N.W. And the great response of the Spirit and the bride, in the last chapter of Revelation, is in answer to the presentation, "I Jesus" -- who He is personally.
P.L. Yes, "The root and offspring of David". The root, of course, alluding to Deity.
J.T.Jr. How do you view the Levites here, in verse 4, as standing up?
P.L. They set forth what is comely before God on so great an occasion, and give a lead to the people in the praise of God, as verse 5 shows.
A.R. Four times up to verse 5 we have reference to standing up. Does it suggest spiritual dignity and power? The last one is, "Stand up, bless Jehovah your God from eternity to eternity".
P.L. Thus calling on us to bless God for what He is in Himself. What a priestly touch enters into all this, graced as it is with such depth of spiritual feeling, such as for instance, "Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them" (verse 20). How blest are such recitals as indicating what, from God's side, has led up to the recovery of the light and truth of the Lord's Person. Such a review is calculated to stimulate that service of praise to Him who, as "The Same", has ever been the strength of His people.
Rem. So that what the children of Israel refused in Caleb and Joshua in the wilderness, when they brought the heavenly ministry to the saints, was what was according to "thy good Spirit".
{481}
P.L. Thus testifying among other things to the tenderness of divine feelings. John, who presents Christ as the I AM, also records the tears of Jesus in chapter 11. How near He has come! John, who dwells so much on His infinite greatness and majesty, thus touches on His tender feelings as in holy manhood.
C.A.M. You can understand how that the glorious truth of the unchanging greatness of Christ would awaken ever fresh and distinctive response as time goes on.
P.L. Quite so; the reference in verse 8 to Abraham, "and foundest his heart faithful before thee", shows that the reviewers are in the understanding, that such movements of love and glory in Him who is "The Same", make their own searching but blessed claims upon us in regard to responsive committal.
A.B.P. They must have had some very remarkable, prophetic ministry in those days. Haggai speaks of "the latter glory of this house".
P.L. Prophetic ministry would largely involve the application by the Spirit of much that has been reserved by God to meet the unparalleled situations arising in these remnant days.
Rem. The prophetic ministry of Haggai and Zechariah precedes this.
P.L. It does, and Jeremiah's tears would water the early seed sown in his ministry which yielded so rich a crop many years later in the recovery under Ezra and Nehemiah. Christianity was sown in the tears of the Son of God, and remnant revival owes much to the priestly tears of God-given leaders and others who have wept through assembly sorrows to a divine issue. As the spiritual review of assembly history is made in the light of Him who is "The Same", our hearts become restful in the
{482}
sense that what is of God is going through to completion.
A.F.M. Do not these successive steps, these cumulative thoughts that are being presented, indicate an answer to that utterance of Moses in @Psalm 90, "Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy majesty unto their sons"? In these present days of recovery, has not God's work appeared to His servants and His majesty to their sons? Are we not to be encouraged by that kind of thing -- "thy majesty unto their sons"?
P.L. Yes, and what a heritage we have come into, lustred as it is with the majesty of His Person! "And let men bless the name of thy glory, which is exalted above all blessing and praise". In this chapter, as you say, everything is cumulative, and thus fresh strength is developed. "They go from strength to strength; each one will appear before God in Zion", @Psalm 84: 7.
A.R. How did they secure this knowledge? They say, "who hast made the heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all that is therein, the seas and all that is therein. And thou quickenest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee" (verse 6). They really bring in the whole heavenly realm and the earth, and they worship God.
P.L. Would you not say that in the sovereignty of divine mercy. Nehemiah's faithful maintenance of divine principles has been rewarded with light from God as to the house as the place of divine habitation? What a spiritual outburst we have here, begotten of priestly feelings, fruit of the light recovered in sovereign mercy! What cause we have for thanksgiving to God that He has graced these closing years of assembly revival with the true light as to Christ's sonship, so essential to a spiritual understanding of the Lord's Person.
{483}
In passing on to Moses in @Deuteronomy 32, we can see how he crowns his closing ministry with a song containing this ascription of praise to the great I AM.
<blockquote>"See now that I, I am HE. <br>And there is no god with me; <br>I kill, and I make alive; <br>I wound, and I heal" (verse 39). </blockquote>
He blesses Him who is without rival, supreme in His operations, in holy government as in all else, so searching in His movements, but ever ready to bless! Moses indicates that he had been true to his great mission as cherishing in his soul the I AM, the One who in that character had originally appeared to him and given him his commission (@Exodus 3: 6, 14) and in whose unchanging faithfulness he executed it and endured as seeing Him who is invisible. What energy, what endurance and definiteness in his ministerial service -- did Moses derive from his apprehension of God as the I AM! He is thus a suited model for us in service as we learn to go forward in it, through evil and good report, continuing to serve in that spiritual stability and authority which the vision of the I AM alone can impart.
In Joshua's vision the Lord does not allude to Himself as the I AM, yet He who bears that name declares that He is now leading the saints in victory in relation to the heavenly inheritance. How important it is that in all conflict we should neither go before the Lord nor lag behind Him!
Ques. Have you leadership in mind in this scripture, the need for waiting on the Lord before taking the road?
P.L. Yes. How establishing would this vision be to Joshua in his great commission! How conclusive is the Lord in His reply to Joshua's partisan inquiry: "Art thou for us, or for our enemies?" Leadership
{484}
as viewed in Joshua is to be reinforced by the apprehension of the Person who alone can lead His people in military triumph into their inheritance. The *No* of Jehovah's Captain must have sunk deeply into Joshua's mind and heart, as it may well sink into ours. Divinely accredited leadership is unmoved by all partisan appeals. How easily otherwise, alas, would the dignity of spiritual conflict be lost, its standard lowered, and its precious fruits forfeited!
A.R. Did he not recover quickly? As soon as he gets the rebuke he says, "What saith my lord unto his servant?"
P.L. Quite so. The footnote in the New Translation shows that the Lord's words have a double force; it reads, "For I, the captain (or prince) of the army of Jehovah, am now come". That is. He had *not* come into this before. The Lord chooses His own time to come into a matter, and if He has not come into it, do not let us presume, like Peter, to take the sword precipitately. When He comes into it, it is to unsheath the sword and deal with every element that is obstructing the entrance of His people upon their inheritance. How blessed, then, to fall upon our faces to the earth and worship, as did Joshua! The subduing sense of what the Lord is doing is the great adjusting feature in all leadership and conflict. If we do not go into battle with ever greater thoughts of who He is, we are sure to drop to the low level of a partisan cause, to our spiritual undoing.
Ques. Would you say that partisanship shuts out priesthood? In chapter 6 the place the priestly element has in the conflict comes to light at Jericho.
P.L. Yes, a party spirit would tend to shut out Jehovah and His priests: "For as captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come".
A.N.W. Is not Joshua allowed to ask that question purposely to emphasise the greatness of the
{485}
matter in hand, that is, conflict in relation to the inheritance?
P.L. Surely. How often have our mistakes, when we have judged them, but made room for spiritual adjustment in relation to that which, in divine instruction, is of the greatest moment!
A.F.M. Is not that the way in which Jehovah gains spoil from such as Joshua? As you were saying, he was in the place of subjection; he takes off his sandal from his foot; he deports himself suitably to the presence of God.
P.L. As thus adjusted he is found in worship.
C.A.M. I think that ought to help everyone. Anyone who wants to know the direction in which a conflict is going should see that it is moving in a course leading to an increased apprehension of Christ now in our hearts.
P.L. Would conflict have any spiritual value otherwise? In a crisis, the simple and uninstructed do well to follow those who are manifestly making much of Christ; but the full issue and fruits of the battle, ere it takes place, are anticipated in Joshua's soul as worshipping, for if the Lord has taken charge of the conflict at the outset there can, for faith, be but one issue to it!
A.B.P. Would Joshua being alone by Jericho mean that he was seeking the aid of God in regard of this great issue?
P.L. Yes. Joshua lifted up his eyes and looked (verse 13). The wilderness exercises had but sharpened his sight. His senses had not always been so trustworthy, his ear deceived him on that momentous occasion when he came down from the mount with Moses; but his sight here is not deceiving him. Forty years earlier he had looked upon that land in appreciation, and now his gaze rests upon Him whose land it is, and whose people Israel are!
{486}
A.R. If we truly understood that the Lord is the Captain of the host, whatever conflict we might go through, although persons may be employed in it, we would know that it is the Lord's battle. Hence the issue is clear.
P.L. Quite so. How urgent that the great truth of the Lord's Person should enter into all this with us! How can lost assembly territory be recovered otherwise or subsequently held? The truth of the Lord's Person is to be woven into the very fibre of our beings, thus enabling us to be warriors without partisanship in Jehovah's hosts. He will recognise no warriors save those who are doing battle under Christ for the whole assembly, and no true churchman would go into conflict for less than what pertains to Christ and to the whole assembly on earth.
R.W.S. The truth as to the Lord's Person is available by the Spirit for the whole assembly, not only for the few who may have entered into it.
P.L. Yes. The creeds at best bear Babylonish features. No doubt all ages have borne testimony to the presence of faithful souls who shrank from the system which held them captive, and such would not sing the songs of Zion in a strange land. Many in the Middle Ages died at the stake rather than join in the unholy revelry of Rome. How could there be light in Babylon as to Him who is "The Same", when the Romish system which in describing itself as 'Ever the same', arrogates that name to herself to her final overthrow? Whatever glimmerings of light faithful individuals may have had in earlier ages, it awaited this great closing era of assembly revival for God to recover to His people not only the truth as to the sonship of Christ, but greater and more worthy thoughts as to His Godhead glory as set forth in Scripture, all tending to enrich the service of God and add to the volume of praise among
{487}
the saints. May we be preserved to the end in divine mercy in the moral import of all that this involves!
In regard to @Psalm 102, this name "The Same" is also used by David when speaking to God in @2 Samuel 7: 28 and @1 Chronicles 17: 26 (see New Translation). How David in those chapters covers the various names of God, as known to Israel, all leading up to his addressing Him as "The Same"! David went in and sat before Jehovah (@1 Chronicles 17: 16). That is love's climax -- not standing but sitting! There were no seats in the tabernacle; the priests stood there, but the posture of sons is to sit. Sonship belongs to heaven, where we are made to sit down with Christ. And so David sat before the Lord, and then he began to address God in such choice spiritual feeling, crowning his utterance with this ascription of praise to God as "The Same", the self-existing One. What liberty he had in this holy service! In @1 Chronicles 17: 16 he alludes to Jehovah-Elohim, rising in that deep sense of mercy in verse 17, which is so becoming in us in response to those sovereign movements of God in love and mercy toward us. So David moves upward in love's holy ecstasy until he reaches the climax in verse 26 of that chapter; "And now, Jehovah, thou art that God"; that is, "The Same", the I AM. What spiritual tone in the service of God is thus assured, both in depth of feeling and elevation of intelligent utterance!
C.A.M. God addresses Christ in the beginning of Hebrews in a majestic way, quoting from @Psalm 102.
P.L. Yes. It is good to see that those addressed in that epistle are called to prove the purity of their genealogy in a remnant day by going forth to Him without the camp bearing His reproach, (@Hebrews 13: 13). @Psalm 102, which is quoted in @Hebrews 1: 10 - 12,
{488}
not only dwells on the majesty of the Lord in the divine greeting to Him, but dwells so touchingly upon Him who could liken Himself to a sparrow alone upon the house-top (verse 7). How enriching to our spiritual feelings is such an allusion to the depth of the Lord's stoop in love, enabling us, as entering into this spiritually, to rise to the majesty of the divine salutation at the end of the Psalms! In that psalm He is greeted of God under this name in contrast to being cut off as the Messiah; in @Hebrews 1 as the self-existent One in contrast to the transient character of the material creation.
C.A.M. That is very beautiful. It seems to link up the beginning of Hebrews and the close of it. The Lord is referred to as "the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come" at the end of Hebrews, and His sorrows are subsequently alluded to. The working of the thing out, I suppose, in the covenant is in the body of the epistle.
P.L. Truly. It is evident that the deep emotions to which the Psalms give expression are largely penned by one who among Old Testament saints came nearest to Christ in suffering, that is, David.
{489}
THE ECONOMY
@John 3: 35, 36; @John 4: 1 - 30, 39 - 42
W.W. What have you in mind in reading these scriptures?
J.T. I have in mind to call attention to the economy into which God has come, the economy of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Verse 35 of chapter 3 states that the Father loves the Son and has given all things to be in His hand. "He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life". The economy in that way requires faith and subjection. Persons come into it on the principle of faith and subjection, and they form part of the administrative system. They see how it is ministered in the hand of Christ. That is briefly what is in mind.
The woman became part of the administrative system. She left her water-pot, which in itself is not to be used in that system. She left that and went her way into the city and spoke to the men about Christ, meaning that she was the vessel. The administration of the economy requires all believers, and the epistle to the Romans teaches us how we come into this administration, how our members are yielded to God as instruments of righteousness unto holiness, and finally that our bodies are presented a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is our intelligent service. The woman represents this latter part, the intelligent service. She understood; she was not told to go into the city; the Lord gave her no direction, but what she did was right and intelligent, and effective too.
A.R. When you speak of the present economy do you speak of it in contrast to the old economy as under Moses?
{490}
J.T. That is right. That is a helpful suggestion. That was an economy; we constantly speak of it as the Mosaic economy.
A.R. That is what I thought.
J.T. One thing that is to be observed as fundamental is that the One in whose hand the administration is, is the Son of His love. It is an economy based on love.
W.W. It is love flowing from the Father here.
J.T. The principle of the economy is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; the Father is the source of all, the Son the executive, and the Spirit in that same relation, even Himself subject to the Son; so that it is a graded relation between divine Persons, not, obviously, the relation in which They stand in inscrutable existence, absolute existence, but what They have come into so as to reach us and be intelligible to us, all depending on the incarnation. Chapter 4 is evidently set to bring out the working of this great economy. The Lord is seen in the previous chapter as the Son and anyone believing on Him has life eternal, and anyone not subject to Him does not see life, and the wrath of God is upon him. Now we see Him in chapter 4 ministering the greatest possible gift -- ministered, but given on the principle of faith and understanding. So the Lord says, "If thou knewest ..." It is based not only on faith but understanding. Chapter 4 presents Him to us as moving on account of what He heard: "When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptises more disciples than John (however, Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples), he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee". What was circulated, that He made and baptised more disciples than John, did not fit in with what was in mind; it would be a natural sort of rumour that was circulated.
{491}
W.W. Do you think that the Lord's movements here indicate that He is moving in relation to the work of God in that city?
J.T. Yes. Well, He must needs pass through Samaria. "He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar". The 'therefores' in John are suggestive. Our attention is now directed to Him as the loved One of the Father in whose hand everything is. How is He to proceed in the execution of all that is in the divine mind? He is certainly not entering into any rivalry with anybody. Christianity is not sectarian.
J.A.G. What is the significance of that expression, "Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples"?
J.T. I think the time had not come; Pentecost had not come; His death and resurrection had not come. He was not gathering to Himself. His baptism was not like John's. John baptised; He did not. It was His disciples that did it. It is pointing to @Matthew 28: 19: "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". *They* do that. I suppose the natural mind at the time would make the Lord a rival of John. Indeed in the previous chapter we read of the reasoning of the disciples of John: they came to John and said, "Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, he baptises, and all come to him". There was that sort of thing mooted, rivalry. It was foreign to the Lord's mind; indeed it is foreign to christianity. Christendom is divided up into sects, more or less rivals, destructive to christianity. The Lord is moving on other lines. It is a matter of great importance that as moving with Him we are not sectarian. Our outlook is based on love. Divine administration is based on love; it is for the good of all. The men of the city come to the fact that He is the Saviour of the world.
{492}
G.P.W. Is it on account of rivalry that He left Judaea and came to Galilee?
J.T. It would seem so, when it was said that He was baptising more disciples than John.
G.H.C. Is there any significance, in relation to the divine economy, in the fact that He came near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph?
J.T. Joseph represents that typically. He represents the administrative side under Pharaoh. It was opportune that the Lord should bring this truth out here.
G.H.C. It speaks of the Father loving the Son.
J.T. Quite so. Jacob loved Joseph. He made him a vest of many colours and distinguished him. I think what we are saying is of importance to us all, that we are not sectarian. We are rivals of no one. It is not a question of having more disciples than others. It is a question of the administration of divine bounty, all the outcome of what God is. God is love. He is causing His bounty to reach man indiscriminately, whether Samaritan or Jew, whatever the nationality or colour.
A.R. Would you say that it shows a right spirit when John says, "I must decrease"?
J.T. Very beautiful! This thought of rivalry indeed brings out what was in John's heart. He was a true lover of Christ. Looking at Jesus as He walked he said, "Behold the Lamb of God", and his disciples left him. This discussion too about his baptism, "a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification", just shelved for a moment the great matter of what God is dispensing. Men turn aside to reason about purification and baptism and the like, and ignore the great question of what is in the mind of God in the Son; that is, the gift of living water. It is a poor thing if you meet a Christian and he says, 'What do you think about baptism?' It is a poor thing to raise the question of baptism
{493}
the first time you meet a christian. It is better to ask, 'What do you think of Christ?' The great point in this gospel is the greatness of Christ; and John is baptising; he is bearing witness to the greatness of Christ. He spoke of Him. He cried about His greatness saying, "He that comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me", @John 1: 15. There is no danger of John the baptist and Christ becoming rivals, nor is there a danger of young brothers who love the Lord becoming rivals.
D.I. The woman of Samaria could take account of Him.
J.T. That is what we shall see. The Lord makes that a point: He says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink". It embodies the two thoughts, the gift of God and the Person who is the Administrator. The Person is the Son; it really involves the Spirit; you might say that the three Persons in the Deity are involved in what comes out. The Father loves the Son, but the Spirit is involved.
W.W. So that what the Lord brings in here is greater than what is connected with Jacob's well.
J.T. Indeed; the Persons are greater too. Jacob was great and Joseph was great, but now we have the Father and the Son.
W.G. Do we have a little of the dignity of who He is in chapter l?
J.T. Chapter 1 is full of it. You will be struck with the number of titles the chapter contains, especially those given to Him by believers. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (verse 1). And then, "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated His glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father)" (verse 14). That is what they say. Then it is said, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of
{494}
the Father, *he* hath declared him" (verse 18). And then John the baptist sees Him coming to him and he said, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (verse 29). Then Philip says, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth" (verse 45). That is His title in humiliation, but it is nevertheless morally a great title. Then Nathanael says, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel" (verse 49). And the Lord Himself follows by saying, "Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man" (verse 51). So that chapter 1 is full of the glories of Christ, and the Lord embodies that in using the administrative service here, saying, "If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is". We are now in the presence of the greatest possible things that are ministered and the One who ministers is there in lowliness, outwardly weary with His journey. He raises the question of who He is. That is to be known. We are in the presence of the greatest possible gift, the greatest possible things; and as coming into that through faith we become part of the administration.
W.H. Is the administration manward in view of need, but ultimately with a view to the Father being the supreme object?
J.T. It is remarkable how that is introduced. The woman introduced the subject of worship, but the Lord proceeds to tell her about it; so that concurrently you have the two great thoughts, man's need met and God's need met. It suggests a need in His heart too.
Ques. Would it be possible to know the gift and not know the Person?
J.T. In measure. The Spirit would not be long in a believer without suggesting something of Christ,
{495}
because the gift is in relation to the greatness of Christ. The gospel announces Christ in His greatness, the gospel of God concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. So that it is difficult to see how the person having the gift would not also have some knowledge of the Person. It is not quite the forgiveness of sins here; the Lord spoke to the woman of the water; of course, she needed forgiveness, but that is not what is in view.
A.S. Why does the Lord speak of asking? "Thou wouldest have asked of him" (verse 10).
J.T. It is to bring out the state of the person ministered to. What is administered brings out what is on our side. God's gift does not go begging. It is ever indeed to all, but the person only receives it as he has a certain state. That is, new birth underlies the reception of the gift, and the remark of the Lord would bring out that she was really born again, because if she had known she would have asked. I think those who ask would indicate that God has wrought in them. The natural mind does not act in this way; it would profane the things of God. God confirms His work in our souls. As a matter of fact the woman did ask. She says to the Lord, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw". Well, you might say, 'Why did He not give it to her?' But he would probe her. He would bring out where she was. The moral history has to be gone into.
R.I. You see the receptive condition in @Acts 10: 44: while Peter was speaking the Holy Spirit fell on them.
J.T. That is good. God sees our hearts as we are listening to the gospel; if He gives the Spirit He gives it knowing the state of the person. He knows all things. He knows the state of our hearts. The Lord would bring out this woman's state and
{496}
her history too. That is why He says, "Go, call thy husband, and come here".
A.R. Would that be on the line of preparing the vessel to receive the living water?
J.T. The Lord says, "Thou wouldest have asked of him", and she did ask. But He goes further than that. Is there really a condition there? The history of the person must come out.
P.McG. Would it be right to say that the Lord is working on the secret workings of God in the woman?
J.T. He is acting on that. He is acting here in perfect divine knowledge of what was there; but He is bringing it out, and bringing before us how He would serve in the administration, to show how things are done, for we are to learn how things are done. There is not only new birth but the concrete evidence of it. The history of the person must come to light, for in truth He is thinking of her as a vessel. It is not only that we are to be saved for eternity, but we are to be vessels of administration here. Romans develops it, how each believer is taken on in the system of administration, and how his members are to be employed, and finally the vessel. David says, "The vessels of the young men are holy", @1 Samuel 21: 5. That implies that God is working in us, for we cannot be taken on in the administration save as holy vessels. The apostle Paul is taken on. He is the first one of whom the Lord speaks in that way. "This man is an elect vessel to me". @Acts 9: 15. In @Acts 10 it is a collective idea, the sheet bound by the four corners with all kinds of creatures in it. It is a question of whether each of us is cleansed; that process must be gone through if I am to have part in the administration.
G.H.C. So that when she goes into the city her word is attractive and in power.
{497}
J.T. She went to the men. That is a thing to notice. They have lost their power over her. She has moral power over them. That is all hidden in the fact that she left her water-pot. It is given up and she is now free for God's service. The old system has to be given up if I am to be effective in the new system of things.
R.L. Why does the Lord ask her for a drink?
J.T. He wanted to bring the whole matter up. He laid the foundation of her being usable later. She was usable then. "Thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". I hope the point of becoming part of the system has laid hold of us. I cannot belong to any other system. My vessel is to be holy, entirely devoted to God. The woman was entirely free; she left her water-pot. She understood that she was to be taken on in this way.
A.R. The Lord says to her that the water would be in her a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life. Would you say a word about the fountain of water?
J.T. It speaks of the action of the Spirit. A divine Person is involved in this, coming into the believer. The word 'fountain' would suggest automatic organs. The believer has organs that operate without his brain, without his head, and of course he has organs that operate under his direction. So that the Spirit's power operating in the christian develops power springing upward. The movements of the Spirit in a believer effect a condition having an upward power. His intelligence would be brought into it; that would be more in line with the breath of life, more for the upper organs. What the Lord is speaking of here is more the lower organs, and the Spirit takes them on and develops them.
{498}
A.R. I was wondering if having the fountain springing up would enable each one to leave the water-pot. They have no need for the water-pot.
J.T. You are rendered independent of what is natural. There are two things: there is not only the believing but the understanding: "If thou knewest". And she understands, because she goes to the men and says, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done". She knows what she is speaking about. She does not say anything to the men about the living water. She knew she should not do that; it was a levitical touch: she knew what to say.
J.W. "Come, see a man". It was a man God was looking for. "One man among a thousand have I found", @Ecclesiastes 7: 28.
J.T. Quite so, a man having prophetic ministry. What is so much needed in the preaching is prophetic power to convict. The secrets of the heart are made apparent by the prophetic word. That is what is needed. "By a prophet Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt", @Hosea 12: 13. What is needed in the initial overtures of God with us is the prophetic character of ministry in the preaching that would bring about conviction.
J.W. In chapter 5 the man said, "I have no man", but this woman has found a Man: "Come, see a man".
J.T. Quite so, a Man that can tell her what she had done. It is a Man that is needed to bring to light the secrets of the heart, because that is what men need: to be exposed to themselves. That is the point she emphasises: "Who told me all things I had ever done".
R.L. What is the thought of 'the Christ' in that connection?
J.T. It is a general thought. It covers everything really. It is the Anointed, meaning that He is the Man that does everything for God. He found David
{499}
a man after His own heart. The allusion is to Christ. That is what comes out: "is not he the Christ?" That is what she is looking for. What we need is the feature of ministry that exposes to ourselves what we are, what our history has been, and if we are to be brought into the system this must take place.
P.McG. The woman is able to say, "I see that thou art a prophet".
J.T. She saw what kind of Person He was. The fact is, she says, "Sir, I see that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain". She was equal to it. A person who is self-judged by a prophetic ministry can speak about the things of God. A person, according to @1 Corinthians 14, coming in in this way, the secrets of his heart are manifested; he is judged and he falls down and worships God. That shows something has been effected for God through the prophetic testimony, and this woman is a subject to be spoken to about the greatest things for she falls down to worship God, although it does not say that she did.
H.R. Does it not indicate that she was free of sectarian thoughts?
J.T. She certainly had thoughts of rivalry. She said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship". The Lord would dispel all that, and it is not merely a matter of winning a person over as a proselyte, but it is a question of the secrets of her heart being brought to light; she is brought to God.
H.R. Is that the effect of the prophetic word?
J.T. That is why the prophetic ministry is so important now. I ought to be able to bring people to God in the gospel preaching. It is God that brings the conviction and the secrets of one's heart are made manifest, and "thus, falling upon his face,
{500}
he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you".
R.L. The woman said, "I know that Messias is coming, who is called Christ; when *he* comes he will tell us all things". She had light.
J.T. Well, what she says is right. It is very remarkable.
J.N. How would the administrative service on the part of the saints work out at the present time?
J.T. In preaching the gospel, and in speaking to souls as the Lord speaks to this woman. How uplifting it is morally to feel that you belong to this great economy to which God has come -- a fellow-workman of God! Paul said that he was a fellow-workman of God. How great a thing it is to be brought into that system! It is delivering from every other system: I am usable in that system, as of it.
W.W. Do you think that there is not sufficient of the Spirit brought into the glad tidings?
J.T. Perhaps so. It would seem that you influence the person you speak to not simply by what you say but by what you are.
W.H. Would that be in keeping with what is seen in @Acts 1: 8 where the Lord, speaking of the descent of the Spirit, says, "Ye shall be my witnesses"?
J.T. Not simply witnesses of those things as in @Luke 24, but "my witnesses". How can I be a witness except in the way of likeness? Likeness and witness go together. If I am like Christ I represent Him.
P.McG. Two things come to light in the woman: one is the secrets of her heart, and the other the secret of the working of God in her. You would say that the ministry of the saints in the gospel would effect these things in people?
{501}
J.T. Well, that is the lesson if I am in the divine system, usable in this way. There is a prophetic touch: the person is searched; the secrets of his heart are exposed. The Lord put the woman right on the point of Jerusalem. I do not think she was much of a religionist. She knew those things, but I do not think they weighed very much with her. The Lord puts her right. "Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews". That was important. But the real difficulty with her was her past history, and the Lord was not content with her asking for the living water. Her past history must be brought to light, all things that ever she did.
G.H.C. Is that why the apostle speaks so much about prophecy in relation to Corinth, for he recognised how much would flow from the Lord having His place amongst them?
J.T. Quite so.
E.F. How would you distinguish between the work of God and the Lord working?
J.T. Well, the Lord says, "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him", @John 6: 44. That is the secret power working in a believer; it brings him to Christ. The Lord looks for it, and then He takes him on. "Him that comes to me I will not at all cast out", @John 6: 37. He looks at a person like this as a product of the Father's work. The Father has drawn him to Christ; He looks at him in that way. So that, as I said, it is administrative, the Father operating.
F.W.G. Does it agree with, "Every one that has heard from the Father himself, and has learned of him, comes to me", @John 6: 45?
J.T. It is intelligence. You know now what you are saying.
W.K. Does the Lord speak about finishing His work?
{502}
J.T. Quite so. It was His meat and drink. That is what the chapter is intended to teach. Of course, there are many things intended, but for those who serve God, and we all ought to, it is intended that we should see that it is everything to us; it is our meat and drink. It is not only to work but to be on the line of finishing, not leaving things undone, but finishing.
In verses 31 to 38 you have the remarks of the Lord to the disciples on the point of serving. He does not make that altogether a matter of sowing but stresses the reaping, and so this ministry fits in with the last days. We are not inaugurating; we are just coming into other men's labours, carrying on what others have started. "Others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours". He does not make much of them. They do not shine very much here. We all have to admit that we shine very poorly when it is a question of having part in what God is doing.
J.W. Is your thought that we should know more of this great system into which we are brought?
J.T. Yes. It is morally elevating. We cannot belong to any other organisation.
H.R. Is it as we are separate and clear in our thoughts from what is sectarian that we can be usable by God in relation to the work, the harvest?
J.T. That is very important. You look for the work of God in men and women and children. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are in this. We are brought into this. You take on the greatness of what you belong to.
G.H.C. In the last section you read it speaks of the word of the woman and His word.
J.T. That shows that she was not attracting them to herself. One knows of women, later on, teaching and preaching, especially in America. This woman had no thought of making herself a centre, any
{503}
more than John the baptist did. "Come, see a man", she says, as if she were standing alongside of Christ. "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done; is not he the Christ?" Any true servant would say, 'If you are depending on what you learn from me you will be poorly instructed'. Paul says, "*Ye* became our imitators, and of the Lord", @1 Thessalonians 1: 6.
W.W. She was calling attention to Christ: He "told me all things I had ever done".
J.T. She was full of it. She is an excellent example of, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness", @Romans 8: 10. She was wholly immune from other influences. She speaks to them about Christ, another Man. She had found another Man. Her body was dead; Christ was in her. Her body was dead because of sin. The Spirit is life because of righteousness.
A.R. It says in regard of the Samaritans who came to Him that they asked Him to wait with them and He tarried with them two days, and they heard His own word. Say a little in regard of that.
J.T. Does it not indicate that my converts make room for Christ? It is a tribute to the work that has been done. They wish Him to stay, and they ask Him to abide with them two days. "And more a great deal believed on account of his word; and they said to the woman, It is no longer on account of thy saying that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world". It is no discredit to her; it is really a credit to her because she attracted them to Christ, and they are making room for Him. I suppose it would work out now in converts becoming part of the assembly; they make much of Christ.
A.R. They would learn a good deal more from Him than from her. So that if souls are blessed
{504}
through the gospel, they need to be put into contact with Christ personally.
J.T. That is good, and you will observe that they could tell her not only that He is the Christ, but they say, "We know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world".
P.McG. The Queen of Sheba said, "It was a true report that I heard in mine own land ... but I gave no credit to the words, until I came and mine eyes had seen", @2 Chronicles 9: 5, 6.
W.W. What do you think is in the fact that the Lord abode two days?
J.T. I think it was long enough to testify who He was, long enough to be known, and He was known better than He had been by the testimony of the woman. He grants their wish. He grants any right wish that is with us. With Zacchaeus He went to his house that he might know Him.
R.L. The Lord's movements are in relation to the Father's will.
J.T. The whole section is to bring out this wonderful administration that is going on. The Father loves the Son, the Father as beholding the wonderful down-stooping of Christ; the Son would not say anything He did not hear from the Father. It is a wonderful combination of subjection with equality, divine equality in subjection. Chapter 5 is indeed for instruction here; but this chapter is to show the lowly grace in which the Lord works to gain souls. He says, "Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest", the fruit of God's work.
E.F. This all takes place as He passes through. Would that suggest that those taking part in the administration are in movement?
J.T. Quite so. He is gathering for another world. We saw recently how John calls Him "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world". He saw
{505}
Him coming to him. That was His sacrificial work, but the next day he saw Him walking: it was His attractiveness. He begins to gather. Two follow Him. He is gathering, taking away the sin of the world, gathering for another world, baptising with the Spirit and fire, as John says.
{506}
THE LORD KNOWN IN HIS SERVICE IN THE ASSEMBLY
@John 6: 67 - 69; @John 13: 8; @John 14: 5 - 10; @John 17: 6, 26
J.T. These scriptures indicate how as believers we come to know the Lord in His service in the assembly, in His relations with the Father. The first scripture points to His priesthood. In the types Israel had to come to a knowledge of Aaron as priest; holiness, at least typically, entered peculiarly into his office. So Peter in our scripture (@John 6) says, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". His disciples believed on Him, we are told, as He manifested His glory, and gradually they came to see Him in His varied glories and offices; so in saying that they had believed and known that He was the Holy One of God they had the knowledge of Him which we may call basic as regards the service of God. He was in them on this line. He had spoken in chapter 14 of their knowing Him when the Spirit should come, that He was in the Father and they were in Him and He in them. He becomes 'in us' on this line as we believe and know through experience. The gospels furnish examples of persons who know who He is in this sense, such as John the baptist and the woman of Samaria, and now Peter. John the baptist, as you might say, knew Him sacrificially as the Lamb of God; the woman of Samaria spoke of Him as the Christ; and here Peter says that they had believed and known that He was the Holy One of God. So that He acquires a place with the disciples in this way. Paul speaks of Christ being among us or in us, involving His place in the assembly as Minister of the sanctuary, and indeed as exercising other offices in it; as He is in it His varied glories shine, we know, and are responded to by the saints as He is known amongst us. And then in chapter 13 Peter
{507}
again speaks unadvisedly and the Lord reminds us in His answer to Peter that we can only have part with Him as He washes us, not simply as washed. That is, the matter must be His. Elsewhere we wash ourselves. He washes us from our sins too, but here it is not simply that we are washed, but that He does it, and unless He does it there is no possibility of having part with Him. This would remind us that in the assembly He must have to say to everything. And then Philip questions Him as to the Father, and He instructs us in His answer how we shall apprehend the Father. It is not that He is to be apprehended personally but as to His features; no one has seen Him as to His absolute Being, but He is to be apprehended in His features, so that it is what is in Christ: "He that has seen me has seen the Father". That is to bring to our minds what He is speaking of when He speaks of the Father, some concrete thought. He is invisible as God, but still there are the features in mind so that we know, when we are speaking to the Father, to whom we speak. And then finally in chapter 17 the Lord is seen as High Priest. Although John does not give us these official titles, yet we can see when the Lord is speaking to His Father how divine service is carried on, how the Minister of the sanctuary carries on the service and what place the saints have in it, carried along in the teaching of this book, to be alongside the Lord in His speaking to the Father, in which speaking, or you might say prayer. He calls them 'men'; He calls His disciples 'men' whom the Father gave Him, and He has manifested His name to them according to verse 6, and in verse 26, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". So that, on these lines, we come into possession of love in its greatest expression, that is, the love the Father has for the Son.
{508}
A.R. Would you say what is involved in the expression 'the Holy One of God' as in the first portion?
J.T. Well, I think it underlies the service of God in the sanctuary. It underlies the Lord's official place, as you might say, as Priest. The disciples came to apprehend Him in this light. It is remarkable that it comes out at that time when many were going away. It reminds us of the need of acquiring a knowledge of Christ, an experimental knowledge, otherwise we shall go away.
H.B. His being in us in this character would mean that we have seekings on sanctuary lines, seekings as to getting into a sphere that suits us and where we are in direct first-hand touch with Him.
J.T. And hence you are fixed. You are not going away. There is no one else to go to.
Rem. Does Peter get his first glimpse in his knowledge of the Lord in @Luke 5? He says, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord". Luke presents Him as "the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God". And immediately the Lord indicated service for him.
J.T. That is very good. Holiness was there. He felt the presence of holiness and he was sinful: he was not only a sinner, but sinful. As you say, Luke begins with the thought of holiness, essential holiness: "the holy thing", that is essential holiness; that could be said of no other babe. Even the demons recognised Him; but in Peter's answer here it is an experimental matter, not simply revelation as in @Matthew 16; it is experimental and therefore within the range of all of us.
T.T. Earlier in the chapter the Lord speaks about being taught of God and it says, "Every one that has heard from the Father himself, and has learned of him, comes to me". Is there a connection between the two?
{509}
J.T. I think there is. The chapter is profound in that way. It is a chapter that requires perhaps more attention than any for the understanding of it. The Lord says, for instance, "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom *he* has sent". He sent the Son in these varied glories. His varied glories shine throughout the gospel: we have them in chapter 1. They are recognisable, so that knowledge in the chapter becomes experimental in regard to the Lord; that is, He becomes in us, as it were. We are told in @Romans 8, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness", and in @Colossians 1: 27 we have, "Christ in you the hope of glory". I believe John brings in that line of truth. John the baptist recognises Him, and so right along we get the varied features of Christ's glory in the way He was apprehended, for the names He gets are nearly all from those who have apprehended Him, as, for instance, Nathanael.
G.H.C. Would the apprehension of Him in this way be in any way connected with the way He is presented in this chapter as the Bread of life?
J.T. Yes. Peter says, "Thou hast words of life eternal". This is the first thing he mentions, "words" meaning that the truth or the subject of eternal life is opened up to us, made intelligible; there is instruction as to it in detail, and that is very necessary too as regards our assembly position because life is essential. It is the living that praise God, as Hezekiah says. And then Peter adds here, "the holy one of God". The Holy One of God would imply the service of God in the sanctuary.
J.A.G. Do you suggest that @Matthew 16 is special to Peter and this chapter is normal?
J.T. This is normal. It is presented as normal, although the Lord addresses the twelve. It is presented as the normal outcome of what is experienced.
{510}
He does not ask them what men are saying about Him, but He challenges them as to whether they are going away, so that it becomes very practical. The knowledge of Christ as Peter speaks of it here is essential to our being held in the right position.
F.B.W. You spoke of the apprehension of Himself in the earlier chapters; do you think the character of the service here is more in relation to the assembly?
J.T. I think the basis is laid in Peter's soul for the service of God. From this point you might take up the whole typical teaching, for the types are full of remarkable teaching relative to the service of God. For example in Exodus, for the great bearing of Exodus is the service of God: "Let my son go, that he may serve me;" that is in chapter 4, and then from chapter 25 onwards we see how God is to dwell amongst His people and to be served by them in the tabernacle. So one can understand this instruction, and see how instruction laid in Peter's soul would fit him to take up the service of God, as we have seen it in type in the book of Exodus, and then priestly service as in the book of Leviticus. It is the great subject for the moment that the Lord is keeping before us, and we are challenged here as to whether we are going away. What is holding us? Is it a vital link with Christ, first as the One who has the words of eternal life and then as the holy One of God?
R.McA. Do you think that the Lord felt keenly that there were those that went away?
J.T. He did. "From that time many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him". And then He says to the twelve, "Will ye also go away?" Then Peter replied. These are the things, the initial features that would hold saints. Where can we go? Who will tell you about eternal
{511}
life? That is one of the greatest needs. As to what we are in the flesh and as regards God and His service, who can tell us anything about it? Where can you get it in all the systems that man has built up? They have not got the thought of the service of God. There must be the holy One of God for the service of God.
W.H. Does the Lord connect the thought of being in them as known with the idea of eating His flesh and drinking His blood? "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him".
J.T. That is good. It confirms what we are saying as to this chapter.
Rem. So that this would be a matter of what enters into the constitution of the individual.
J.T. That is right: 'constitution', that is the word, because this is not an immediate revelation. It is something we have known by experience: "We have believed and known". We believe much that we cannot say we have known, but when I say I have known, it means that I have had experience of the thing, I have proved it.
J.W. Was this a word of encouragement for the Lord's heart from Peter as well as a test of the Lord to the disciples?
J.T. That is right. I think it must have been very refreshing to Him to have an answer like this. And so always, the Lord loves to hear us tell what we think of Him; and what will hold us today save that we have vital knowledge of Christ in this sense? There is nowhere else to go. Who is there to go to? Take all the systems one by one, where else can you go? If you are a spiritual person, if you are a true believer in Christ, where can you go?
Ques. In chapter 17 the Lord says, "The words which thou hast given me I have given them": do you connect that with the words of eternal life?
{512}
J.T. Well, that goes beyond this. Peter says the Lord had them, but it does not imply that the disciples had them. They no doubt understood. This is their experience of the teaching; they were listening to what He was saying and they saw that He was speaking not simply as a teacher but as One who had them. "Thou hast words of life eternal", says Peter.
A.S. Is it this knowledge that distinguishes the other disciples from Judas? He was chosen as much as they were, was he not?
J.T. The Lord says so, a very solemn challenge, because if He is the Holy One of God we are searched out. Being in the outward position is not enough; but when He is confessed in this way, He cannot let Judas off: "and of you one is a devil". It is not simply that he had a demon, but he was a devil, showing what may be amongst the brethren, and the Lord graciously exposed it.
W.H. As eating His flesh you must be apart from all that the flesh would live in, and drinking His blood would bring you into all that God is. Love would be your portion.
J.T. I am sure of that. The chapter is very profound. The Son of God from heaven is life in the world. It is a question of life. I have no doubt Peter's remark referred to that. The teaching had been received by him and others. The disciples had reached something that holds them -- permanency. The Lord spoke of a person amongst them being a devil, and it can be dealt with without any damage to the others; there is something to hold them.
G.D. You are calling attention to the great feature of holiness.
J.T. That is what I was remarking. The underlying thought of what God is presently leading His people to is His service in the sanctuary. Holiness becomes it for ever, so that we have in Christ the
{513}
Holy One of God, not simply the Holy One, but the Holy One of God. He is the One capable of being the Minister of the sanctuary.
G.D. Is that in line with chapter 3 of Revelation where the Lord presents Himself as the Holy and the True?
J.T. Quite so. The Old Testament is full of the thought; it has much of the thought in it, the Holy One of Israel and of Jacob; but here it is the Holy One of God. That is, He is the One available for service and is qualified for all that relates to the sanctuary.
G.D. Is that what was lacking with the two sons of Aaron; they did not understand the holiness of the position in their service?
J.T. Quite so. They offered strange fire. Judas would do that.
H.B. Is there anything in our being indispensable to Him in filling out the service of God?
J.T. That is what comes out here. The Lord comes in amongst the twelve. It must be remembered that all that He unfolded while here below was in relation to the twelve, especially the Lord's supper; as far as the record goes only the twelve were present. What is in mind in that is that what the Lord intended to inaugurate was established on reliable testimony; the thought of the sanctuary comes in here, and the Lord must say that there is a devil. This is utterly incompatible with the sanctuary. It must be dealt with. Anything of that description must be dealt with. Of course, if you come to the types this is all opened up to us.
H.B. It says of Mary Magdalene that seven demons went out of her. Does that present the idea?
J.T. It would: she would be thus constituted material for the assembly.
{514}
G.H.C. Is this thought of the Minister of the sanctuary known in a peculiar way when the saints are together in assembly?
J.T. That is what I have been thinking of, first as to how each of us comes into the knowledge of Christ in this relation. Many of us may sit down in assembly and have no personal knowledge; we have to rely on brothers who have a personal knowledge of Christ, whereas the thought here is that the believer comes into a personal knowledge of Christ in this character. "We have believed and known", Peter says, so that we understand when we sit down in assembly that we are looking to Him to take charge.
G.H.C. Is this a side of His service that we have not paid sufficient attention to?
J.T. Yes, it is each person coming to know the Lord as Peter knew Him.
T.T. The Jews had said, "Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have known?" (@John 6: 42), but there was nothing in what they said of any value in relation to the service of God.
J.T. Quite so. That is a good contrast. They could never come into fellowship, as we say. It is this personal knowledge that qualifies for the assembly. Peter could have said many other things at this juncture, but then what he says here, you may be sure, is what is needed. It is what fits in with the instruction.
F.I. Does this personal -- knowledge of the Lord come to us before we come to the Supper or while we are at the Supper?
J.T. I think it is a question of experience that we ought to acquire when we are converted. It is the essence of the gospel that He is raised from the dead, that He is "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection
{515}
of the dead", @Romans 1: 4. It is something to be acquired by every person that is converted, to whom the gospel comes. The element of holiness comes with the gospel; it is presented definitely in the gospel. The Spirit works it in us. We come together, as I understand, and sit down in the assembly as knowing Christ in this way. He is my Saviour, of course, and many other things, the Mediator of the covenant, but He is the Holy One of God. That is basic, and then we get the glories of Christ.
F.I. You have in mind the thought of the service of God which is carried on as we are in assembly in relation to the Supper. You do not look at it as apart from that. Where do we gather up the thought of our being made suitable to take it on as being available to the Minister of the sanctuary?
J.T. I think the Supper is the occasion of all this, the introduction to all this, our introduction to the service of God as in assembly. What is remarked is that each believer is to acquire a knowledge of the Holy One of God, otherwise he cannot have part in this service. It is a basic thought really as to the service of God, and too may bring out the varied glories of Christ. He is the Holy One of God; that is, He is looked at as God's in this light. He will look after matters in the assembly for God, in the sanctuary, the One who is the Minister in it.
F.B.W. They do not answer each one for himself, but Peter answers for them all as though the assembly was involved in that matter.
J.T. Yes, and then the Lord remarking about Judas is a very solemn and searching matter, for in approaching assembly service there is the possibility of a person like this and the Lord could not let Judas off when He is confessed as the Holy One of God. He must expose him, for it is part of the service of the Minister of the sanctuary to expose any evil that may be. We must therefore see that there
{516}
is no possibility of escaping being exposed in the presence of the Holy One of God.
H.R. So that, after He is confessed as the Holy One of God, that makes room for His service as Minister of the sanctuary.
J.T. He is known to be that. He is known to God as that, but the point is He is known to us as the Holy One of God. Peter says, "We have believed and known". It was evidently known amongst them; it was common amongst them. You can understand the apostles talking to one another. They would say this and that, going over what the Lord had said, and the truth would develop in their minds in that way. He, Peter, must have been conversant with the others in saying, "We have believed and known".
H.R. In @John 21 Peter says, "Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee". It was both conscious knowledge and objective knowledge there. What would this knowledge be that you refer to now?
J.T. I cannot really tell you the original word, but I think it is conscious. Peter used the word for conscious in @John 21 until the last reference, meaning that the Lord could see in him some objective evidence that he loved Him.
H.R. One might have conscious knowledge and yet have a demon.
J.T. I do not think Judas is included in this at all. He was there, but he is not included in this. The Lord would not let him off. He might profess to know all these things, no doubt intellectually. He was unreal and if the Lord is acknowledged as the Holy One of God, Judas must be exposed. Now is the time to do it.
Rem. As to what we said earlier, it is not 'One of you has a devil', but, "One of you is a devil", it was a question of what the man was essentially.
{517}
J.T. Yes, what he was essentially.
A.S. He did not name him; but the disciples knew from what the Lord said.
J.T. "He spoke of Judas the son of Simon, Iscariote", the evangelist tells us, "for he it was who should deliver him up". It seems to be most important that as He is the Holy One of God there must be exposure if He is acknowledged.
Rem. I suppose when you come to chapter 17, Judas is not there. Here you have things operating in the sphere of holiness.
J.T. Well, in chapter 17 we come to the inside; He is speaking to His Father. What morally follows what we have in chapter 6 is Peter's comment as to the Lord's service, washing their feet. The Lord's answer to that is in keeping with Him as the Holy One of God, implying that He must have complete charge. It must be His matter. We are now proceeding on the line of the sanctuary, and the Lord must have the say as to the whole position. We may as well face that. This chapter expunges Judas; he is forced out. He is named as a devil in chapter 6, but he is forced out in chapter 13. The point is, "Unless I wash thee". The Lord must do it. He will see to it that what is suitable to Him is there.
A.M. Do you think that apart from this experimental knowledge of the Holy One of God our unreality would be exposed as we take part in the service of God?
J.T. It will be. As sure as anything our unreality will be exposed. The point is whether the Holy One of God is recognised.
J.D. Is His character as the Holy One of God set forth when He speaks in the midst of the golden candlesticks in chapter 1 of Revelation?
J.T. Well, it comes out: what He is as the Holy One of God is manifested, especially in dealing with Thyatira, which corresponds with Judas. His eyes
{518}
are as a flame of fire. In spite of the maze of ecclesiastical rites, the Lord discerns all that is there; "I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel". He tells the church what He has done with her, and spoke about the depths of Satan. He would speak about the depths of Satan that the remnant were to understand that the depths of Satan were there. You get no exposure of these things, the worst kind of things, in systems where the Holy One of God is not recognised. It is where the Holy One of God is recognised that the exposure is guaranteed.
T.T. Does the Lord still carry on this service of washing personally, or has it been delegated now?
J.T. It is delegated here in the passage we read, that we are to wash one another's feet, but in putting it into the hands of the brethren He does not specify that they must do it: He sets an example which they should carry on, but His first reference is, "Unless I wash thee". That is a great fact set out at the beginning of the subject. Let us allow the truth into our souls that the Lord must have the first and last word as to the service in the assembly, as to having part with Him.
H.B. Does this mean that we necessarily need our feet washed in view of taking part in the assembly?
J.T. Yes. We may think they are washed, but the Lord reminds us that if He does not do it, it is not done. "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". That is, you are drawn into the sense of responsibility of bringing the Lord into it. He must be recognised.
Ques. Does the thought of "part with me" relate to service?
J.T. It refers to what He is about to unfold in the following chapters, as in the sanctuary as with the Father. All these chapters lead us up to the
{519}
seventeenth in which we get a concrete example of His service inside. It is prayer, of course, but still you can see how the service is carried on. It is carried on by Him in our midst.
W.H. Would the feet-washing involve that the service that is under His hand as Minister of the sanctuary is to be carried on in freshness amongst the saints, in contrast to the formal thing that exists today in christendom?
J.T. I think so. Even if it be a saint that does it you discern that it is the Lord that does it. I may be qualified to wash the saints feet but the person whose feet are washed must see that it is the Lord. It must go past me. It is the Lord that does it.
T.T. The doing of the service, if rightly done, would leave that sense in the soul, that it was done by the Lord.
J.T. Yes. He is doing it.
F.M-n. Do you mean that in that connection the soul is to be definitely in contact with the Lord?
J.T. Yes, quite so. We are to be in definite touch with the Lord. Even if it is a brother that is doing it, I discern that it is the Lord that is doing it. After all, even the ministry is of the Lord or it is nothing. If I cannot discern that what is being ministered is from the Lord it is not His ministry.
Ques. Would you say that the service of feet-washing discovers Judas?
J.T. Well, he goes out in this chapter. He is forced out.
R.L. What is your thought in "part with me?"
J.T. That is what we have in the assembly. As we recognise the Lord in our midst as the Minister of the sanctuary we move with Him. That is what He has in mind. I think John does not use the word 'sanctuary', or 'assembly' either, but that is what is in mind, especially in the last days when you do not want to use ecclesiastical terms, but to have
{520}
the things. And so, if a brother is serving you want to discern that the Lord is in it. That is what makes it effectual.
G.H.C. In the verse you read it is a deliberate move of the Lord towards Peter: "He comes therefore". I was thinking of the Lord drawing attention to the service of God at the present moment: do you think it is deliberate in that way so that the saints may be helped to have part with Him in this great service?
J.T. It is important to get into the current of this gospel in view of the assembly. All this precedes. It is not simply what we find in the assembly when we get there, but it is what we take there, so that the Lord has us as suitable and can proceed in His service, which is included in the term "part with me". What can be greater or more blessed than having part with Jesus as He is carrying on this service before God?
T.T. Does this being accomplished open the way for the Father's name?
J.T. That is the next thing; chapter 14. Chapter 14 is to bring us into some little apprehension of the Father. We are addressing a person known in some sense in a concrete way. As the evangelist says, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". Well now, the voice from heaven primarily was to announce the Son. That was a voice, and we need more than a voice to grasp in our minds the idea of the Father. We see that He is the Father. The revelation of the Father does not depend on the death of Christ; He does not therefore enter into the covenant. Many have thought about that, as to whether the Father can be introduced in the new covenant, but the new covenant is a matter of the death of Christ, and the revelation of the Father does not depend on that. There is no
{521}
death in the revelation of the Father. The revelation of the Father refers to the relations of the Father with Christ as Man. The Lord's death was not necessary for that. His death was necessary for the covenant. The covenant is not between the Father and His children; it is between God and His people, and it is effected through death, not through an announcement from heaven.
Rem. So that, "He that has seen me has seen the Father", is prior to and independent of His death.
J.T. Quite so. What the Lord means here is not that He personally is one with the Father; it is that the Father is characteristically there. He was in Christ personally and He was there characteristically so as to be apprehended. "He that has seen me has seen the Father", so that there is a concrete apprehension of the Father in his characteristics.
W.H. The Lord refers to the works which He did and the words which He spoke as being the Father's works and the Father's words; would that be what you mean as being characteristic?
J.T. Quite so. Jesus is not the Father but He is a divine Person, and so great enough to personify the Father, to impersonate Him, as it were, as the Spirit may impersonate the Son now.
G.H.C. He speaks about departing out of the world and going to the Father and He speaks about coming out from God and going back to God. Would you help as to that?
J.T. These words would show what is in mind in these chapters. He is going to the Father; He is going to God. He puts the two relations together in chapter 20 when He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". The first is the relation that God would have with Him as Man, and into which He brings us and we are His brethren; and God comes in after, as mentioned by Him, after the Father which would, I
{522}
suppose, mean God as He was known by Jesus, not the covenant God, more than that, including that but more than that, God as He is known by Christ, Christ's God.
G.H.C. Is God a wider thought?
J.T. It is a wider thought than the name 'Father', and the scripture that supports that is, "Neither does the Father judge any one" (@John 5: 22); God must be the wider thought in that, sense. The Father is the name in family relationship, and is employed, I think, to indicate the character of our dispensation. God is known in that way, not as Judge but as God in grace, but then we have to come to the family thought as to ourselves. We are not called the sons of God in John at all. It is either 'His Father' or 'the Father' to us until chapter 20 when it is, "My Father and your Father, my God and your God". Then you say, What about the Father in Matthew? We have saints called the sons of their Father in Matthew; they are directed to speak to Him as their Father which is in heaven. It is simple, I think, if we see that the relationship of Father was brought in with Christ as Man, and the disciples are brought into that in @John 20; indeed, the term 'Father' is applied to Jehovah in the Old Testament. It has to be taken up as it is found in this book. The Son is said to be 'Father of Eternity' in Isaiah. All that is short of what we have in @John 20. @John 20 is what applies specially to the sons as forming the assembly.
W.H. How far do you carry the thought of Christ being the Minister of the sanctuary? Would that go as far as @John 20?
J.T. I think so. It gives the family thought, God as Father, the Son in the midst and we as sons. The sanctuary is a relative thought as shutting out what is unholy, but the service goes on according to @John 20. It is the Lord in the midst, Christ known in us
{523}
as it were. I think chapter 17 gives the clue, because the Lord having said these things lifts up His eyes to heaven and says, "Father ...". You hear Him speak to His Father. I think the chapter gives the understanding of what the sanctuary is in that sense, that the Son speaks to His Father, in the attitude, in the sense, of prayer and thanksgiving.
R.L. Would the Holy One have reference to where there is unholiness?
J.T. That is the thought. The sanctuary has the same force. If we can follow the Lord along these chapters we shall come to the thought of assembly service, where He is with us; He is on our side and carrying on towards the Father. In Matthew we have the words, "I praise thee, Father". We have in Luke the statement that the Lord at that time rejoiced in spirit, showing what may happen amongst us as in assembly; and in this chapter 17 we have extended prayer, as you might say, to the Father.
H.B. In the last clause of verse 6, "They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word" -- I was thinking of "thy word". Would that be the sonship as proper to us -- His word?
J.T. Well, the Father's word they had kept. The Lord gives them credit for keeping it. He calls them, 'men' here, which is to be noted, and which I think we should bear in mind: "The men whom thou gavest me out of the world. They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee". You can see how they are regarded on those lines as fit for the sanctuary; and then He demands, not prays, concerning them. He can speak to His Father familiarly and He says, "I am glorified in them". Then He says, "Holy Father, keep them in thy name" and He says, "Sanctify them by the truth" (verse 17). So that we can see how thus we are fitted to be His companions, not only
{524}
according to eternal counsels but according to actual formation.
H.B. That is what I had in mind in connection with the word being in the singular. It is the same in verse 18, "Thy word is truth".
J.T. But then sonship is a further thought than the word of the Father. He says in verse 22, "And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one". There you come to the idea of sonship. It is glory imparted. It is not simply the word of the Father.
T.T. Would keeping the word be a proof of affection?
J.T. Intelligent affection too, because the word implies the Father's mind. You cannot keep His word unless you understand it. A commandment is more authoritative, but a word is to be understood and so kept.
Ques. Is your thought that there would not only be the appropriation of Him in the light of the Minister of the sanctuary, but that there should be a suitability to Him as such?
J.T. That is what is here; it is that the Lord might have us with Him as suitable. He says, "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them". It implies that sonship is a glory attaching to men. And then finally, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known". Now that word compared with the word 'manifest' in chapter 6 is a deeper word, I think. The name is made known. It is effectively made known and it is through Him; "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". So that the Lord is amongst His own in this exalted way as loved by them as the Father loves Him. It is not covenant love; it is the Father's love in our hearts.
Ques. Is that the thought in the first epistle of John? "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath
{525}
bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God".
J.T. The word which you have quoted 'sons' is, 'children' of God. John never calls us the 'sons' of God except in the Book of Revelation. He calls us, 'children'. The word is 'children' in John's epistle, not 'sons'. 'Sons' is what we are towards God;, 'children' is what we are under His care here.
G.H.C. Would you help us as to not only the Father's love being in them but "I in them"?
J.T. Well, I think He is in us on that basis, not on the basis of covenant love. It is not that that would not give place to Him; it does, but it is a more exalted position, as in us having the Father's love in us. It is the question of the kind of love.
J.W. Am I right in thinking that the whole of chapter 17 of John views the cross of the Lord Jesus as past, and not as we would read it that it was on this side of the cross? It is in view of the Lord as Priest in the assembly as having gone on high for us; the Lord is the High Priest before His Father bearing up His people.
J.T. I think that is right. He is bearing up His people here. Our point now is to bring out what He is in the assembly, how He serves in the assembly, and how we have part with Him in the assembly. The most exalted thought is that we have the Father's love in our hearts, that is, the Father's love for the Son. We have that in our hearts. We know how to love the Son as the Father loves Him, so that we are on an exalted platform as associated with the Father's love -- that kind of love, resulting from His having made known to us the Father's name. It is not only 'manifested' but 'made known'. It is effective; the Father's name is known in our souls.
{526}
F.I. Does the Father's name being made known in our souls by the Minister of the sanctuary fit us to pass over into the presence of the Father?
J.T. I think so. We are now qualified. I suppose we are in the enjoyment of heaven; we love as the Father loves.
F.I. We would not view the Lord as we are associated with Him in the presence of the Father -- we do not view Him there as the Minister of the sanctuary?
J.T. He is the Son. He who is speaking is the Son. The official terms 'the sanctuary' and 'the Minister of the sanctuary' are relative because we have to do with evil here below, but they will be done away with in eternity when there is no more evil, so it is just 'Father' and 'Son' and 'sons'.
{527}
THE SERVICE OF THE SPIRIT IN DAYS OF APOSTASY
@2 Thessalonians 2: 13; @Jude 19 - 21; @2 Peter 1: 21; @2 Timothy 1: 14
J.T. Considering the mention of the Spirit in each of these epistles, which have the apostasy in mind, we are enabled to see what provision there is for us in having to do with the present apostate conditions in christendom. These, I believe, are the only times the Spirit is mentioned in these four epistles and a distinct feature of the truth applies as to each. If these four features are understood and carried out in our walk and ways we shall be preserved.
The first is the sanctification of the Spirit. The apostle refers in both epistles to these christians at Thessalonica as beloved, and they are regarded and addressed as in God the Father. Here they are "beloved of the Lord" and chosen of God, he says, "from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth". The apostasy is a denial of the truth and in consequence men may believe a lie, whereas if things are taken up in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth we are preserved. Chosen of God from the beginning, the stress is on 'chosen', not only that we are chosen but how; that is, in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. Then over against this we have in Jude the apostate imitation, men setting themselves apart, not indicative of sanctification, but false, as imitators. Of them it is said, "not having the Spirit". And we have there how believers are actively preserved by prayer in the Holy Spirit, keeping ourselves in the love of God. In 2 Peter we see how the ministry is always carried on, but particularly in view of the apostasy which is stressed here: "holy men of God spake under the power of
{528}
the Holy Spirit". Then finally, in Timothy we have the good deposit. What we have treasured is to be kept, not by creeds or by natural effort or memory, but by the Spirit. That is what was in mind. I hope the brethren will be able to follow and speak together of the scriptures that we may have mutual help.
A.N. Do you mean that these are the means by which we are preserved in days of apostasy?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. God sets us out as choosing us. He sets us out in this way, in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. The other scriptures we read fall in with that.
A.N. I had a thought that sometimes there is a difficulty in regard of salvation, connecting it more with what is to come and the final thing; but what would be in mind in these scriptures would be how we are preserved for the present.
J.T. Salvation except from wrath has generally a present bearing. It alludes to the different influences we were under and are exposed to still. So that there is really no salvation aside from the Spirit; it is not only by the possession of the Spirit, but in sanctification of the Spirit.
H.W. So that these things would be necessary as coupled together, salvation of the Spirit in view of the state of apostasy we have come into today.
J.T. That is what is in mind, apostasy. We are told in this chapter, verse 3, as to the day of the Lord: "Let not anyone deceive you in any manner, because it will not be unless the apostasy have first come, and the man of sin have been revealed". And then we are told that the mystery of lawlessness already works; it is already working and in an extensive way. Over against this we have here the choice of God: chosen of God in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. These are both subjective thoughts. God has chosen us in them.
{529}
C.E.W. Do you look upon sanctification of the Spirit as being practical sanctification?
J.T. That is what is in mind. We are chosen in that. We are chosen to salvation, we are told, in it, as if it were essential. Romans of course opens up the doctrine of the gospel. This feature of it is mentioned here. The Spirit is mentioned here only in this epistle, hence the importance of these two thoughts in view of practical salvation, namely, sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.
G.H.C. What would be the difference between 'in' sanctification and the verse in 1 Peter where it speaks about election 'by' sanctification of the Spirit?
J.T. You are referring to @1 Peter 1: 2, 'by' and 'in'. "Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ". There is not much difference; here the 'in' is also instrumental but involving power and state effected. You are 'in' the state in mind. It is "unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood" in Peter. Here it is "in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth". It really is a condition accompanying the call of God in the gospel which has to be maintained.
J.D. Does it mean that this salvation is not apart from sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth?
J.T. That is so. Without this salvation is impossible in a practical sense.
G.H.C. Would that be the instrumentality by which God preserves what is chosen and precious to Him? Would the Spirit be the means by which God preserves that which is precious to Him?
J.T. Quite so, as over against the apostasy that is around, which is marked by a lie. And then there
{530}
is the imitation, all those who set themselves apart: this monasticism which is a great feature of apostasy, so-called chastity, counterfeit sanctification on a fleshly principle. This epistle states that such have not the Spirit, so it is not of God at all. It is over against what is of God; whereas we are to be preserved by prayer in the Holy Spirit, not simply by reading prayers as they do. They spend much time going over certain exercises in a fleshly way which ends in nothing for God. It is an effort of the flesh; whereas believers pray in the Holy Spirit. That raises the whole question as to our prayers, how we pray, whether we simply repeat prayers or whether we pray in the Holy Spirit. Prayer meetings are not intended to be heavy, nor are our individual prayers intended to be a tax on us which we wish to get through. There is a certain joy attached to prayer. God says He will make us joyful in His house of prayer, and that would include the idea of praying in the Spirit. There is nothing onerous or burdensome about it; there is a certain joy in praying in the Holy Spirit. But then it says we are to keep ourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, over against the man of sin coming in; we are kept in holy buoyancy and liberty and power on these lines.
F.W.G. How can we understand "from the beginning" here? "God has chosen you from the beginning".
J.T. That was the beginning of their conversion, when they were converted. God gives us the facts. The facts of their conversion are given. Paul went in on three sabbaths we are told, opening and laying down the truth of Christ in the gospel. We have an account of it in @Acts 17: "They came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews. And according to Paul's custom he went in among them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them from the
{531}
scriptures, opening and laying down that the Christ must have suffered and risen up from among the dead, and that this is the Christ, Jesus whom *I* announce to you" (verses 1 - 3). These are the facts given by the Spirit as to this beginning at Thessalonica. It was a very auspicious beginning, because we are told that the apostle went in among them, and on three sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures, opening and laying down that Christ must have suffered and risen from among the dead. He opened up the truth and laid it down, meaning that it was presented authoritatively to them, in power. They were chosen in these practical forms in the gospel in these circumstances, and we are told, "Some of them believed, and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and of the Greeks who worshipped, a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few" (verse 4). So that it was a remarkable work and they had a good start, not simply light but this sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.
A.N. Would that not be in the epistle to the Romans? You get them beginning as having obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine that had been delivered to them, how they get their freedom from sin, and then in chapter 8 we get the Spirit coming in, the Spirit of life and peace; they began on these lines and that is how it is to be maintained here.
J.T. Romans gives us the doctrine, so that if we are to understand what is alluded to here, we must go to Romans; and I think in the way the apostle went in among them, not as a great authority, a person lording it over them, but amongst them, and then opening up the truth and laying it down, he himself would be an example of the effect of the truth. He had just come from Philippi where he had been terribly afflicted, but he was evidently superior to it. They would see the effect of the gospel supremely in him.
{532}
J.D. Does the truth stand in contrast to the enemy's lie or does it express a great deal more?
J.T. It does express a great deal more, but that is what is here, that it is a great preservative for us as over against the word spoken -- "because they have not received the love of the truth". It would imply apostasy. There is no love of the truth, and it has been given up everywhere in christendom.
F.B.W. Is building yourselves up on your most holy faith in advance of believing the truth?
J.T. Quite so. I was thinking there is a bit of progress in Jude, and it is over against those that separate themselves, the great monastic system which is active all over christendom one way and another. They have not the Spirit. It is a remarkable statement. You might say that they are not doing much harm if they are setting themselves apart, but the Spirit of God regards them as a part of the apostasy. Jude says in verse 17, "But *ye*, beloved, remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they said to you, that at the end of the time there should be mockers, walking after their own lusts of ungodlinesses. These are they who set themselves apart, natural men, not having the Spirit". It is a part of the apostasy and opposition to the truth of the gospel. The way that is overcome is evidently given in what follows: "But ye, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life". It is a positive exercise there, and that praying is not as is customary in the prayer book or prayers repeated, not mere prayer, but prayer in the Holy Spirit. It is prayer with intelligence and right feeling and with a purpose, so that we go on to the end, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
{533}
W.H. Do you think this monasticism might be a specious appeal on the part of the enemy that he might gain ground and accomplish much in the way of apostasy?
J.T. It is really what strengthens apostasy. It is very largely the power, the means in their hands of the power they wield, because these monasteries and so-called fathers and eunuchs are all, I believe, in mind here as maintaining the apostasy in the religious aspect of it.
J.G. Is it possible to be set apart and yet not have the Holy Spirit?
J.T. That is what is said here. Jude says, "These are they who set themselves apart, natural men, not having the Spirit". They do it themselves, "not having the Spirit". It is their own action instead of the action of the Spirit. It is just a fleshly effort intended to strengthen the great system which is corrupting Christendom. The only way to meet it is by sanctification of the Spirit and in praying in the Holy Spirit, keeping ourselves in the love of God. The love of God is in our hearts according to Romans, but here we have a further statement to keep ourselves in it. I think it will be helpful to us to think of our prayers, just how we pray, how one does pray, whether he just says his prayers or whether he prays. There is a very great difference. James says, "He prayed with prayer", and it was effective.
H.W.Jr. Would Corinthians help us? "I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding", @1 Corinthians 14: 15.
J.T. That would enter into this. It is in its own place; praying with the spirit is your own spirit, not the Holy Spirit. It is your own spirit, but one might be carried beyond his understanding and intelligence by allowing what is natural in his feelings or his spirit, and he must pray with his understanding. But here, it is praying in the Holy Spirit. The preposition
{534}
implies that it is in the power of the Spirit. It is a state, as it were, while you pray.
G.H.C. Your reference to James is very helpful. It says with regard to Elias that he prayed again and then we have fruitfulness and freshness coming out. Would that be the result of praying in the Holy Spirit? There would be a yield for God in freshness.
J.T. That is what is stated there: the prayer was effective; he prayed with prayer. For instance, in his last prayer when he prayed for rain, he puts his face between his knees. He had real exercise, purpose in his prayer; he wanted it and he got it.
G.H.C. I was thinking of the reference, "again he prayed".
J.T. Exactly, that is the last one. I think it is important to consider this matter of praying in the Holy Spirit as over against what the enemy is using or has used to overshadow and set aside the true service of the Spirit and preservation in the love of God, that our prayers should not be monotonous to ourselves or to others.
R.M. Does the Lord Jesus Christ give us an example: "Thus therefore pray *ye*", @Matthew 6: 9?
J.T. Quite so. I suppose if you saw Him pray you would be affected by His demeanour. In @John 17, you may hear Him pray, as it were, and what holy feelings you get there! One of His disciples said, "Lord, teach us to pray", and He says, "When ye pray, say, Father, thy name be hallowed; thy kingdom come", @Luke 11: 1, 2. It is not that we may not pray at length, for the Lord prayed the whole night; but in the assembly, or in the meeting for prayer, we ought to regard it as a feature in the house of God. God says, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the peoples", and, that He will "make them joyful in my house of prayer", @Isaiah 56: 7. It is not simply a place where prayer is wont to be made, but it is the house. There is affection in
{535}
it. There are those who think lightly of the meeting for prayer and stay at home, and go to other meetings, but God promises glory in that meeting, and I am sure it involves in His mind prayer in the Holy Spirit.
W.S. Would praying in the Holy Spirit be the result of being in the gain of sanctification of the Spirit?
J.T. I thought it followed: I thought Jude's line followed very well in the order of the truth. It is sanctification of the Spirit, praying in the Spirit, sanctification as set apart not simply outwardly but in power. You are not bound in separation, but you are at liberty in it. Praying in the Holy Spirit, we preserve ourselves in the love of God. It is a very wonderful thing to be kept in the love of God. We have a clear outlook -- the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Ques. Would the character of our prayers in the prayer meeting be different from individual prayers?
J.T. They are different in this sense that they ought to be shorter in the meeting for prayer; that is, you are regulated by understanding what is suitable. If brothers are to pray, room has to be made for them.
Rem. I am thinking of the matter that would engage us in prayer.
J.T. Do you mean that in individual prayer you have your own individual affairs?
Rem. Yes.
J.T. Quite so. But as you come on you widen out to the Lord's interests, and of course you touch the same subjects as you have in the meeting for prayer. Take Ezra's prayer, and Daniel's prayer, particularly Daniel's prayer; it was an individual matter. He prayed three times a day towards Jerusalem. We have his prayer in chapter 9 of the book of Daniel, and it is what I should call praying in the
{536}
Holy Spirit. He was concerned about the interests of God and the interests of God's people. He said he read Jeremiah; he understood by books; his prayer was founded on Scripture. If we expect salvation from God we ought to have a basis for it and Daniel has Jeremiah. When certain times elapsed he wanted to know about matters. He confessed his sin and the sins of the people, and Gabriel said, "At the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth, and I am come to declare it; for thou art one greatly beloved". @Daniel 9: 23. That shows what enters into our meetings for prayer, and our individual prayers too; that is, the interests of God. Our individual prayers are sometimes restricted to our own areas unduly. Daniel's prayer was very wide; it included all the interests of God and His people. Solomon's prayer also covered not only area but length of time and possible happenings to the people of God; really it was prophetic, and when he was finished the house was filled with glory, showing how God values prayer.
F.I. So being made joyful in the house of prayer would include our individual prayers as well as in assembly.
J.T. We ought not to rise from our knees before we are finished, for as you pray His love begins to fill your heart and He gives you to understand that He is listening and is pleased with what you say. You have had that experience?
F.I. Yes.
J.T. Quite so. Those people who have separated themselves -- it is all obnoxious to God.
Ques. What about household prayer? It would have a great bearing upon our outlook in the gospel. That would be a subject for household prayer.
J.T. Quite so. It is one of the most valuable practices for our children, even if we put it on that level, even for our children, to have household
{537}
prayer especially before the gospel meeting. You will observe in moving about that there is great effectiveness in household prayer in view of the gospel especially on Lord's day.
H.W.Jr. Do you think that the prayer meeting as sometimes held in the hall before the gospel is necessary, or do you suggest prayer in the house?
J.T. I think it is much more effective to have it in the house, and obviously much more extensive, because you have many more prayers than you have in the room. The time available between our meetings in the afternoon and the evening gospel service on Lord's day is very short and very few can attend a special meeting in the room. That is what one feels.
F.I. Was Daniel's prayer household prayer? Was it governed by his kneeling towards Jerusalem?
J.T. That is the idea; he prays towards Jerusalem. We sing in our hymn,
<blockquote>"Every interest precious to Thee <br>Finding in our hearts a place". (`305:2)</blockquote>
That has to be included in our meetings for prayer. I think Jerusalem stands for that. It stands for everything that is precious to heaven and Daniel had that in mind, and we have the actual prayer that he made and the answer to it. We are told that he is greatly beloved..
A.R. The apostle says, "I will therefore that the men pray in every place" (@1 Timothy 2: 8); would you say that that is connected with private prayer or with public prayer?
J.T. I should say, both; that is, wherever prayer is being made; if there are brothers and sisters, brothers should pray. The apostle refers to God's house: he says that one should know how to behave himself in the house of God.
A.R. I thought that 'in every place' would not apply to a company together, as in Corinthians, "All
{538}
that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ".
J.T. I think it does, but then 'every place' in Corinthians is every town, city, village, or hamlet, or whatever it may be. The one place in the opening chapter refers to the city or the town, that is, where people are who call on the name of the Lord; but I think Paul's reference to it is where prayer is wont to be made.
A.R. It would be wider.
J.T. I think so. It is praying, lifting up pious hands, without wrath or doubting. In the household one should be free from any feeling as to his household arrangements because he is not to have that on his soul in speaking to God. The women are mentioned afterwards. It is a question of what is suitable in the house of God.
Now we come on to Peter. What was in mind was that the ministry, whatever character it may take -- here it is prophetic ministry in view of the apostate conditions -- is to be in the Spirit, carried on in a spiritual way. "Holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit". It looks as if God is concerning us in the midst of darkness and apostasy with the means of resisting it and overcoming it. Even in our ministry, even in our service such as we are in now, the Spirit is to be observed: it is a question of the power of the Holy Spirit, and holy men of God, so that the flesh is shut out in all these phases of the truth.
F.B.W. Does this scripture suppose the consciousness of the power of the Spirit for speaking?
J.T. I think so. David was conscious: "The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me", he says. And, of course, you distinguish here, it is all in the power of the Spirit.
A.N. What you say is very important as to the truth, to go on with the truth, but the Spirit makes it
{539}
living, and it is only in living conditions that you can be preserved.
J.T. That is obvious. The shining out must be in the Spirit, as you will notice here -- "for prophecy was not ever uttered by the will of man", so that we might as well make up our minds that our wills are excluded.
G.H.C. In the uprising of Korah, Jehovah says to Moses, "Speak unto the assembly". Would that be how the company would be preserved, speaking as he did on that occasion in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so. Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in meeting that rebellion; they felt things.
G.H.C. And the glory of God came in in spite of it.
J.T. Quite.
A.H. It is a question of rallying to the standard.
J.T. Quite so. You might say that what we are speaking of now is just that. The enemy comes in like a flood, and he has come in like a flood now; christendom is just over-run with apostasy in various forms, but the Spirit of God has raised up a standard against it, and it is for us to gather loyally to it.
J.F. Would you say that Peter's object in the prophetic ministry is to keep the saints from falling in the last days -- "lest, being led away along with the error of the wicked, ye should fall from your own stedfastness" (@2 Peter 3: 17); and in Jude the same thought comes in: "But to him that is able to keep you without stumbling" (verse 24)? The ministry is intended to preserve the saints in that way.
J.T. Quite so. "Doing these things ye will never fall", @2 Peter 1: 10. The ministry is to be abundant; that is what you want. In spite of the dark cloud of apostasy we can look through to the end and have an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
{540}
Finally, we have in the epistle to Timothy, where we read, how spiritual things are kept. The creeds have proved futile in preserving the truth. In themselves they shut out the truth in a spiritual way. So that I think this verse is put over against that, that the good deposit is to be kept by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted. This brings up what each believer is intended to keep, as we might say, treasure in the house of God. He keeps the truth, and he has it as a deposit to be preserved, and it can only be preserved by the Spirit, but it is the Spirit that dwells in us. It is not simply the Spirit in an objective way, but the Spirit that dwells in us.
A.N. Do you think where it says, "The mystery of lawlessness already works; only there is he who restrains now until he be gone" (@2 Thessalonians 2: 7), we have the operations of the Spirit checking what is in the world? Is that through the saints?
J.T. We have often noticed that there are two things, one a Person and the other a thing: "And now ye know that which restrains, that he should be revealed in his own time. For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only there is he who restrains now until he be gone". There is that which restrains and there is He who restrains. Well now, the 'He' is the Spirit. It says so, of course. There are two things alluded to anyway; whether it be the government as ordained of God, or whether it be God's kingdom in power in the Spirit in the saints, or whether it be the Spirit Himself operating, there is what hinders, and that is the basis of our prayers in view of the apostasy that is coming; I mean, the man of sin. We are entitled to continue this while these elements are functioning, whether it be government, or the kingdom of God in exercise here or the Spirit Himself. In other words, the government as ordained of God remains with that function,
{541}
and we are entitled to continue as if restraint were still in force, and in our prayers we speak of the authorities and pray for them, knowing that still, no doubt, they are ordained of God. I think that they should enter into our meetings for prayer, because they are still functioning; they are ordained of God to function in the way of restraint so that the testimony should continue in the way God wishes it to continue.
J.D. Would you speak of this as the over-government of God?
J.T. It looks like that. There is something that is restraining and there is He who restrains. We can assume that they are functioning, and while they are functioning the man of sin will not appear. The man of sin will not appear while these elements are functioning and their functioning should be a basis for our prayers in respect of public matters that God might leave room for us so that the testimony might go on to the end.
Rem. If these powers are hostile and put restraint upon the saints do you continue to pray for them?
J.T. Yes, I think you should.
J.H. Would this be the most important aspect of the Spirit's presence here as dwelling in us?
J.T. What a blessed thing it is -- the Spirit dwelling in us! It challenges our hearts as to whether we have the Spirit, and we look for some evidence that we have. The Spirit dwelling in us is a great thought so that we are told that we shall be quickened in the future as having the Spirit of Him that has raised up Jesus from among the dead. "But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from among the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you", @Romans 8: 11. God takes account of us. God protects His assembly.
{542}
J.McF. Does that which restrains refer to the presence of the Spirit in the saints here?
J.T. I would not like to say. I would say that anything that restrains is over against the man of sin. God uses one thing and then another thing throughout the history of the testimony. In present conditions one might name many of them; there are many conditions that God uses to restrain other conditions that are themselves apostate; and the persons who are now figuring in the political world, instead of being of God, because the government of God enters into these risings, they come in raised up by mere natural men. It is for us to pray for them, to regard them as God's instruments; but when it goes beyond that, where government is going beyond their limits and interfering with God and His people. God resents that and will deal with it.
J.D. In the word to the assembly at Philadelphia we have, "These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open", @Revelation 3: 7. Does that enter into what is transpiring in the world today?
J.T. Anything that affects the saints and the testimony the Lord has to do with that; but then there is the Father, in whose hand the government of the world is, and that is more the providence of God.
A.N. There would be angelic intervention too, as in Daniel. The prince of Persia stood in the way against Daniel's prayer being answered, but Michael came in and helped.
J.T. The government of God is carried on with angelic help.
{543}
LOCAL ASSEMBLY CONDITIONS
@Luke 10: 1 - 12; @Luke 11: 1 - 4; @Luke 24: 36 - 44
J.T. Local assembly conditions are in view in these scriptures. No doubt we are all aware that the assembly ministers first Godward. And this works out in localities, but not in the way that is current in religious bodies generally. All administration according to God is seen in the assembly. So that the Lord is sending out His word here by the seventy, and the end of their mission was "every city and place where he himself was about to come". The seventy are not directed to form assemblies; the time for that had not yet come. As the Spirit comes down we have the ordering and formation of assemblies, but the seventy are not directed to form assemblies, although the formation of assemblies is in view. The sending forth of the seventy is additional to the twelve; "seventy others also" which He appointed to go before His face. Paul was in addition to the twelve. The point here by the Lord's direction is to go to "every city and place where he himself was about to come", that is, the Lord intended to come. The workmen had in mind that things should be right in view of His coming. Paul the wise architect says in Corinthians, "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ". The wise architect had laid it. He was aware that the Lord would test his work. What is particularly in mind here is "Into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace to this house. And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it". And then "Into whatsoever city ye may enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you, and heal the sick in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come nigh to you". So there is the idea of entering a house or a city. The
{544}
house has in view the local assembly, and the city a sphere of influence where the testimony is to be rendered. That is what is to be particularly observed, not so much the work and the workmen, but what he finds in the house; that is, the house is to have a son of peace; if not, they are not to stay there, nor are they to add anything to the house. The point of contact is the 'son of peace'.
A.C. What do you understand by a 'son of peace'?
J.T. Well, one would like to work that out for oneself. The word son has in mind maturity, in fact he is the product of it, he is characterised by it. He is in a position to promote peace. This is non-provocative. The epistle to the Romans helps us to that end; it gives direction how to overcome evil with good.
G.T. Is the son of peace material for the assembly?
J.T. Well, if he is not that, he is not material for the assembly. The assembly is to be the reflection of what is in heaven. So we get "on earth peace" at the beginning of this gospel (chapter 2: 14), but at the end we get "peace in heaven" (chapter 19: 38), and that peace goes back into this troubled world. The assembly is said to be "the pillar and the base of the truth". Peace is the mind of God. There will be peace on earth presently in the millennium, but there is peace in the assembly now.
A.C. Is it the head of the house that is to be a son of peace?
J.T. Any one in the house. In @Luke 10, Martha was not a son of peace, but Mary was. That is how it reads, it says, "If a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it". The presence of anyone there who has the character of a son of peace is peace to the house. This shows how God works in houses. He takes on what is there, any person. It
{545}
is characteristic of this house, a son of peace would ensure peace for it, it may be the husband is the only one, sometimes the wife is the only one, heaven takes account of such an one.
J.D.S. Is it the working out of what we get in the epistles?
J.T. That is it exactly. We have to understand the gospels by the epistles. Lydia represents a son of peace in her house.
Ques. Would there be a moral order in the house?
J.T. The household side of the truth is hardly seen in the ministry of the twelve. It comes out in connection with Paul; first there is Lydia's house, then there is the jailor's house. Paul preached to him, and he and his house were saved. Paul was impressed with Lydia's house. Certain brethren tend to disregard this side of the truth, but it is there. The position of the assembly is in the city, and the houses minister to it.
R.S. Is the house more what is inward, and the city more what is outward?
J.T. Exactly. The position of the city is a sphere of influence, but the house is inward, Martha's house, Simon's house.
Ques. Would a son of peace be on the line of sacrifice and surrender?
J.T. Tell us what you mean by sacrifice and surrender?
Rem. To be prepared like Mary to let everything go.
J.T. You mean she does not answer in defence of herself.
Rem. She is prepared to be misunderstood.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. The psalmist said, "I am for peace; but when I speak, *they* are for war", @Psalm 120: 7.
{546}
J.T. There we have the attitude of a son of peace. A son of peace comes to his house; he ministers peace to his house. He gets distinguished by that. There is a difference in him, and that very difference brings out persecution.
G.A. Is it on account of the son of peace being there that they are instructed not to move from house to house?
J.T. They get a good point of contact there, a centre of operation. The son of peace is the centre of operation; they are not to go from house to house. A centre of operation is established from which the testimony radiates.
C.L. Was Paul's letter to Philemon on that line?
J.T. Exactly. You mean that there should be peace in Philemon's house, that he would be restful in having his lodging there. How restful Paul must have been in Lydia's house. He went *to her*; that is, she was the centre of operation because she was a son of peace. A son of peace is an exemplification of what is presented in the testimony.
Then the same thing applies to the city; it says, "Into whatsoever city ye may have entered and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say, Even the dust of your city, which cleaves to us on the feet, do we shake off against you; but know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh. I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that city". These two rebukes are intended for those not regenerated, who are not affected by the work of God; otherwise they would only add to confusion.
A.I. Is this on the line of "Lay hands suddenly on no man"?
J.T. You are to be sure if he is worthy of it.
Rem. They are really rejecting the testimony.
J.T. Quite so. The testimony is, "The kingdom of God is come nigh". It does not say to that city,
{547}
It is come nigh to you. What a wonderful testimony has been brought to this city. If it is refused it shall be more tolerable for Sodom than for this city. So in preaching the gospel we go on quietly even if we do not get results; there is a testimony going out.
G.T. Is the eating and drinking here an expression of fellowship?
J.T. I do not think it goes so far as what we might call fellowship. There is some reference to it later in chapter 13 when the Lord shuts the door. "Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten in thy presence and drunk, and thou hast taught in our streets; and he shall say, I tell you, I do not know you". That is, the city remembers that.
W.A.S. Would the kingdom of God coming nigh to you mean response?
J.T. Quite so. The thing was there in power. Paul and Barnabas in @Acts 14 entered together into a place. I understand by that that they went together; there was something there to be seen; the kingdom of God was there: they represented it. Peter says, "Look on us", @Acts 3: 4.
A.C. Would it mean that there was something for God in the house or the city where the son of peace is?
J.T. Quite so; it would be in view of formation of assemblies.
Ques. Would the wise woman in @2 Samuel 20 be a son of peace?
J.T. She was a mother in Israel; she represents a son of peace; she saved the city by her wisdom.
F.I. Do these conditions depend on our households, all the households?
J.T. That is how it works out in Philippi. Lydia takes in the two labourers. She is a son of peace. She opens her house to them. Then the next house is the jailor's house, then he was to have another
{548}
house, and another. What a beautiful thing it is household-wise for every brother and sister to turn to the Lord!
F.I. I was thinking it would be the exercise of a son of peace that a testimony might go out from his house.
J.T. I have often thought of the Lord Himself. He lived in Nazareth, and then He dwelt in Capernaum. He dwelt in that place. It is alluded to both in this gospel and in Matthew. The cities round the lake came in for a greater testimony than the other cities: "The people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in the country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up", @Matthew 4: 16. They were sitting in darkness, but the Lord went there to dwell, and He had a house. They would see the Lord moving in and out every day. Every movement of Christ was testimony. He went to Simon's house. There was trouble there; his mother-in-law was taken with a great fever; the Lord stood over her and healed her. He promoted conditions of peace in that house. In Mark it says, "It was reported that he was at the house", @Mark 2: 1. If He lived in Capernaum He lived in a house. The man sick of the palsy was brought to the house. There was no complaint as to the freedom taken that the man might be healed.
G.A. Would you suggest that the houses of the saints have an influence in the city?
J.T. Certainly; the more houses the more testimony. Your neighbours see you. Elisha passed by the woman's door, and she said, "Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually", @2 Kings 4: 9.
A.I. Is there any particular service in view when it says, "Go: behold *I* send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither purse nor scrip nor sandals, and salute no one on the way"?
{549}
J.T. It was seventy that were sent two by two; thirty-five pairs of brothers; they are given the same instruction by the Lord. What is in mind is *peace*. We are not a trouble to our brethren. We are sons of peace. The Lord says, I am coming to that town; what shall I find there? Will He actually find sons of peace! I think that is what is in mind: the obligation of each to be a son of peace.
R.S. Is that what should characterise the local assembly?
J.T. If the Lord comes in, what is He looking for? We do not want the Lord to be disturbed. At the end of the chapter, Martha is distracted with much service: "Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?" She calls Him "Lord", yet she is criticising the Lord. We use the word "Lord" very freely, but we might be complaining against Him: "Dost thou not care?" That kind of thing comes in amongst us.
W.M. So the Lord's desire is to find sons of peace.
J.T. They are not plentiful.
R.S. Martha was not answering to His lordship.
J.T. She was inconsistent in her ways.
The next thing is He was praying in a certain place. The idea of the place is carried through. Morally, no doubt, this is in relation to the unnamed place Bethany. So He prayed in a certain place, and when He had ended one of His disciples says to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray". He had been impressed by the words the Lord used, and he wanted to learn to pray in a more seemly way. So the Lord tells them how to pray. "Father" is the first word. "Father, thy name be hallowed; thy kingdom come". That would be the way the Lord prayed.
Ques. Would that deliver us from selfishness? If we speak only of ourselves there is a lack. The order of the prayer would help us.
{550}
J.T. "Father. Thy name be hallowed" is the first thing mentioned in the prayer. It is a question of the Father. His name being hallowed; His kingdom to come; that implies a good deal, but it makes the Father prominent. I think that is how to meet the local conditions that are indicated in Martha's house; how we should turn to God. The more we pray for a person the more we have power with that person.
A.C. We need to be very careful when we say 'Father'.
J.T. It is a term of affection.
A.I. Is what you said about prayer more individual or in relation to the prayer meeting?
J.T. It has the prayer meeting in mind. The following verses open up this matter. The Spirit of God gives instruction. The Lord goes on to enlarge on the great results of prayer. The meeting for prayer has great results in view. According to @Isaiah 56: 7 the Lord will make His people joyful in His house of prayer; that is not only that He hears them pray, but He makes them joyful.
A.I. In regard to prayer for those who are not sons of peace, would you pray for such at the prayer meeting?
J.T. I should. Spirituality enters into this. There are those who are under divine government who are to be left alone; but I should pray for Martha; the sequel shows that she was worth praying for. The quarrelsome ones are to be special subjects of our prayers. In @Isaiah 11 a shoot comes out of the stock of Jesse -- of the stock of Jesse, not David -- the leading person comes on the line of the father. The wolf and the lamb shall lie down together; there is nothing to disturb the peace. "With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity the meek of the earth". Then it says, "A little child shall lead them" and later, "And in that day there
{551}
shall be a root of Jesse, standing as a banner of the peoples: the nations shall seek it; and his resting-place shall be glory". So that there is power to subdue the vilest temperament.
G.T. Would you pray for the gospel and the powers that be in the prayer meeting?
J.T. 'Every interest precious to Thee', Whatever affects the testimony of God.
G.T. Would you say something about the Father's kingdom?
J.T. The kingdom of the Father is peculiarly free of what is punitive: "The Father judges no one". The Father's kingdom is the kingdom on the line of grace.
A.I. What do you understand by "Give us day by day our daily bread"?
J.T. That would keep your mind from the desire to be rich. The desire to be rich is a most dangerous thing. So the missionaries are to go in dependence upon God. 'Give us today our daily bread' is piety; not that you do not work with your hands.
Now in @Luke 24 we find local conditions such as the Lord can have part in, something to eat. He "says to them, Peace be unto you. But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit. And he said to them, Why are ye troubled?" Often we are unbelieving as to the Lord's coming, and doubt.
R.S. He would not come unless there was peace.
J.T. Well, more than that, peace and something to eat.
A.I. Why should He say "Peace be unto you"?
J.T. He shows that it is in His mind that the assembly should enjoy peace.
A.I. It was not found with them; they were frightened.
J.T. That shows the need of this word. It is very humbling that the Lord in coming in should find
{552}
confusion. "Have ye anything here to eat?" -- anything *here*, that calls attention to the locality; the Lord Himself asks to have part in what we have.
F.I. If I am just looking for what I can get I can relapse into indifference, but if I am a son of peace, I shall be in exercise that the Lord is getting His portion.
J.T. The honeycomb is a mutual state of things. We have each to secure our part of it.
Rem. If I am distracted with much serving like Martha I am causing trouble, I am hindering this mutual state of things.
J.T. In John's presentation of Martha she is lovable; it would indicate that the Lord's prayers for her are answered. But here it is, "Have ye anything here to eat? And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb". The fish indicates the sovereignty of God.
G.A. Are mutual feelings seen in that meeting, conditions for the Lord to come in?
J.T. He knew it. The actual state was not in agreement with that. So He says, "It is *I* myself". My actual Person, and "he shewed them his hands and his feet ... he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat? And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb". *Part* of it, that means someone else has got the other part. He promotes peace in coming in, and more than that, He asks for something that He Himself can have part in.
G.A. So is this question continually asked by the Lord?
J.T. It is very touching that it may be so, that the Lord Himself desires to have part in what we give Him.
{553}
OPERATIONS OF THE SPIRIT IN LOCAL ASSEMBLIES
@Acts 13: 1 - 4; @Acts 21: 3 - 5, 8 - 11; @1 Corinthians 3: 16
In these scriptures the assembly is viewed in its local setting. It has service in mind. We have dwelt somewhat on this subject already today, and what is in view would be said in relation to this in continuation of the subject. This time it is to show how the local assembly at the beginning was the mediating sphere of the operations of the Spirit. The Spirit, it may well be remarked (for it is important to keep it in mind), did not become incarnate. He remains in the divine form and essence, but in service and activity moves in relation to the incarnation, maintaining His part even actively in the Deity, acting even as God Himself, but nevertheless as coming into the economy which has been formed by divine Persons. The Spirit has taken the place of service; sometimes going to the most abject measure, even striving with men; indwelling believers, suffering Himself to be grieved by them, but remaining with us all the time in keeping with the economy, being sent not only by the Father, but also by the Son; the Son Himself said, "But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you", @John 16: 7. The Spirit has taken on active operation in the lowest place; yet in abstract Deity He is God, on equality with the other divine Persons. We have to learn to regard them abstractly, lest we should become irreverent, but in doing so we may safely pursue the language of Scripture. So the order in the baptismal formula is the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. In truth it is one name. The three Persons are presented
{554}
objectively to us as Objects of reverence and worship. Note may be taken that the Spirit is mentioned last, that is, He is viewed there as the third Person of the Godhead, we may reverently say, viewed thus in the light of the incarnation. We read of the fellowship of the Father and of the Son, and of the communion of the Holy Spirit.
What is before us is the operation of the Spirit in the assembly, not as forming assemblies, but as having formed them; hence there is the great urgency for suitable conditions, and I have therefore selected these scriptures. We see in the assembly at Antioch what was in the beginning. In order to be found in suitable conditions we have to go back to the beginning of Christianity. The Lord says, "From the beginning it was not so". The law governing marriages had become widely defective, but the Lord tests it by what was in the beginning. So in relation to what is before us these scriptures in the Acts furnish us with examples of what was in the beginning. I am not overlooking what was produced in the service of the twelve prior to Paul's service; the service of the twelve was productive of assembly formation, but it awaited the apostle Paul's service to develop local assemblies. So we have the assembly at Antioch and how it was formed. Paul and Barnabas served in it, as we are told, and taught a large crowd (@Acts 11: 26).
The Spirit of God does not hesitate to use that word "crowd" with a view to showing that if the assembly is in view we need not fear any crowd. We have spoken today of the power of subjugation of every lawless element. There were lawless elements in this crowd. With true Christians they are held in check. So Romans, the great doctrinal epistle, has unfolded how these things are brought about. The believer in chapter 7 emerges from a most serious exercise: "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
{555}
me out of this body of death?" And triumphantly he says, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord". Jesus Christ our Lord, He is the Deliverer and the deliverance. The believer who has come through this exercise is going to stand by it; he is not going to pass through the agony of @Romans 7 again and again. "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law". I myself -- the believer has reached his own consciousness. Very few of us know ourselves. We speak of knowing ourselves and God, a very good way of putting the truth. We have to learn ourselves. "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord"; he has reached his own consciousness of himself, and what he does now is to "with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law". The lawless elements are there, he does not deny it: the fickleness of the flesh would do nothing else than serve the law of sin; but he comes to a true analysis to distinguish between the flesh and himself. The lawless elements are there, they show themselves at every opportunity. John says, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us", @1 John 1: 8. No one can be in the assembly maintaining conditions suitable unless we recognise the danger of the working of the flesh. It is terrible to see how it works in the very presence of God. You remember the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, offered strange fire before Jehovah.
Well, the crowd is mentioned, that is to say, that the assembly in all its resources implies that crowds can be faced and be brought into true subjection, brought into the assembly as suitable material. This is a very great exploit. Saul and Barnabas were no rivals. Barnabas was touchingly clear of all jealousy and envy. So that in that assembly, although there were lawless elements in the crowd, there was power to subdue them. As we heard today,
{556}
the testimony was, "The kingdom of God is come nigh". Perhaps this was never seen more truly than in these two men. There was power present in the kingdom, the Spirit of God being with them, the idea of a crowd gradually disappearing and merging into a normal state of things.
Now in chapter 13 there are several names mentioned, first Barnabas and last Saul. Some of us do not care to be mentioned last. We love the first seats in the synagogue, we love preference. But with Paul there was no feeling of resentment in being mentioned last in the service of God. It says, "Now there were in Antioch in the assembly". The word 'assembly' is one of the greatest words in the divine vocabulary. Our translators have hidden it in the word 'church'. The English word 'church' does not convey what the assembly is. In the assembly there were those who served, prophets and teachers, who knew how to fast and pray and to minister to the Lord. That is the secret of the conditions that were there. Why should it be mentioned with such care, save that we might desire humbly and prayerfully and with fasting to promote such conditions, so that the Spirit of God may have a sphere to lay hold of, so that He might dignify it? Indeed it is so dignified that it is called "the Christ" -- "so also is the Christ". The allusion is to how He was available and usable for the Spirit. Immediately after the temptation He was carried up by the Spirit into the wilderness, as if to show how He was usable. In another gospel He is led by the Spirit into the wilderness to meet every temptation of the devil. What a pattern! It is not right for anyone to meet the devil, only by the Spirit of God. It is not right to attack evil influences, unless the Spirit of God leads anyone. Mark says that He was *driven* by the Spirit of God, as if to say, He was recoiling from it. Why should we not recoil from
{557}
evil? "If *I* by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you", @Matthew 12: 28. At the very outset the anointed Vessel submits; He is carried or driven into the wilderness. What a pattern for us!
This assembly is usable by the Holy Spirit. I am not overlooking what had been effected by the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem, but this is equal certainly in power. I am not, as I am saying, passing over the work of the twelve, but it is Paul who received from the Lord the administration of the mystery; "This man is an elect vessel to me", @Acts 9: 15. Barnabas is beautifully associated with Paul. Barnabas is mentioned first and Saul is mentioned last. David was last; it was his glory. Let no one be afraid of being last; the last is first. So the best thing that can be said of this assembly is that it was usable for the Lord. There were these teachers, and as they ministered and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". There was no hesitation or doubt, the assembly is ready. It was the Spirit speaking: a divine Person speaking in divine authority. There is the expression of divine authority: "I have called them". "Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go". Why should they need to fast and pray? Dear brethren, we are all so awkward at fasting and praying. Fasting and praying maintain us in true spiritual power and singleness of heart. I do not know that we know much about this fasting. Praying and fasting means that the flesh is starved, it is not fed at all; it is really denying it, not simply starving it. Prayer brings in positive power. This is a remarkable matter, the Spirit of God operative in this assembly: "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul". How did the Spirit of God say that? Undoubtedly He used some brother or prophet at
{558}
Antioch. The word is "The Holy Spirit said", not this man said, so you see the speaking was of the Spirit; He spoke with divine authority. The assembly laid their hands on the brothers after they had fasted. If there were some there who were not as spiritual they might have thought there would be no need to fast and pray again, but you see it necessitated this complete denial of all fleshly deeds, and there was positive power in these very hands stretched out. It was a spiritual scene; a scene in which one would have loved to have joined and had part. It is the Spirit's demand, and the assembly is ready for it. The assembly lays their hands on them in a holy way, with holy feelings, then they let them go forth. Let nobody assume that the assembly nominates servants. Gifts are entirely under the control of Him who gave them. Sending out missionaries is not scriptural at all; it is *not* done in the assembly. The assembly lays its hands on the servants; its fellowship and its support are there, but the control of the servants belongs to the Lord. I say this, because it is important that all should understand how the minister is directed by the Holy Spirit, not by the assembly. So they went forth. This is the greatest missionary enterprise we have on record in Scripture.
Now to confirm this thought of the operation of the Spirit I have read the passage in @Acts 21, because it shows in detail how this operation is seen in connection with the apostle Paul. I am seeking to bring out how the assembly was available in these early days, how it was usable by the Spirit even in such things as Paul speaks of in chapter 20, "The Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and tribulations await me" (verse 23). How did the Spirit of God testify in each of these towns? In the first instance at Tyre it says, "And having found out the disciples, we remained there seven
{559}
days; who said to Paul by the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem". You see how simple this is. It was at Tyre, the great commercial city; it is no more viewed as that now, but it is viewed as God could use it. Paul tarried there seven days with them, an important period of time, for the assembly's history is made up in weeks. There are happy seasons in the assembly's life; normally it is a history of joy, although a history of suffering, of course. Take the two great servants at Philippi: "Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice" (@Philippians 4: 4) -- they were there in prison, they showed that they could do it in the most excruciating suffering at midnight. So at Tyre, as I said, the saints by the Spirit told Paul, Do not go up to Jerusalem. Paul did not say, The Spirit of God tells me that I should not go. "*I* am ready", he says, "not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus". Now they go on from Tyre down to Ptolemais; then they come to Caesarea.
I want now, dear brethren, to come to a household. Heaven was interested in the households in Caesarea; you remember how the Roman officer Cornelius was brought in there. There was a remarkable work of God in that assembly. The house of Philip the evangelist was there. Peter had been used in Caesarea. Philip did not live in one of the cities where he had preached; he lived where Peter had worked. I should like to have lived in Caesarea in those days. But now it is not in the assembly where the Spirit's activity is seen, but it is in a house, in the house of Philip the evangelist. And Philip had four daughters; there is nothing said about his wife. This is a word to the young sisters, the young women. They need watching. These daughters are in the household. The enemy has great means of attracting young women. Many of them are in business or schools where they are open
{560}
to evil influences, some of them have to teach evil doctrines at schools. They need watching. It is distressing beyond words to see the many who have gone off. The Lord would lay it on the hearts of the parents here to watch over the daughters and over the sons too, of course. Well, these four women are prophesying. They are doing it; they are characterised by this great service. I am not discussing the question of women speaking in the assembly; the epistle to the Corinthians settles that. The first epistle to the Corinthians is the law of the house. It says distinctly, "Let your women be silent in the assemblies", @1 Corinthians 14: 34. But here we have a prophetic ministry not related to the assembly. These four women prophesied. What a great testimony that was in that house. Paul and his company lodged there, and they were there many days. As to lodging servants, one knows it is not intended that it should be many days, but there is no difficulty here. Everyone would be found in precious conversation. What a lovely household! One would love to have been there and listened to this man Philip and these four women. Does it not suggest to us, dear brethren, the importance of holy conversation in our households? You may be sure if our households are not right the assembly will not be available. As they stayed there many days a visitor comes down to that house. Now we have a specific prophet. Agabus comes down and joins the household. A most interesting man, he is mentioned before in connection with Antioch, @Acts 11: 28. He takes Paul's girdle and binds his hands and feet: it alludes to Paul's imprisonment in this very place, that he would be there for two years, two years in Caesarea, two years in Rome; four years, if not more, this great servant was to be bound. "Remember my bonds" he used to say, how the saints forgot him! One man sought him out: "The
{561}
Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he has often refreshed me, and has not been ashamed of my chain; but being in Rome sought me out very diligently", @2 Timothy 1: 16. How Paul valued the believers households! That would imply that not one child should be lost. We need fasting and prayer so that all would be preserved. Here is this touching scene: Agabus takes the girdle of Paul, and having bound his own hands and feet said, "Thus saith the Holy Spirit"; in that household there were conditions that this could be said; "The man whose this girdle is shall the Jews thus bind in Jerusalem, and deliver him up into the hands of the Gentiles". This is all I want to say about the household. The enemy wants you, but the Lord is needing you, He is needing every one of us.
The passage in Corinthians refers to the temple. "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God?" That is what the assembly was. I want to point out that this has to be taken abstractly. It was not characteristic of them; they were divided. I want to use this manner of the Spirit of God in speaking in an abstract way. One can hardly say that any assembly is characterised by this, but abstractly the idea is accredited to them of being the temple of God, the Lord is giving us to understand this. Do not misunderstand me, I am not giving licence to any one, but I want to show that God in His mercy in spite of conditions is accrediting us with being the temple of God: "Ye are the temple of God", ye are that abstractly; God is graciously enabling us to hold temple light, granting us encouragement in our being together as temple of God. So we may hope for good readings and we may hope for ministry.
{562}
PRISONS
@Acts 5: 17 - 20; @Acts 12: 5 - 12; @Acts 16: 23 - 32
These scriptures all speak of prisons being divinely opened. The thought of prisons is old, much older than humanity, disobedient angels being consigned to such places of confinement and punishment. But in the history of humanity men have employed them, and they are still employed, nor would we wish them abolished. As knowing God, and knowing that the governance of this world is placed in the hands of other than believers in order to restrain evil and support good, we do not wish to see prisons abolished, nor any department of government weakened. Those in authority, whoever they may be, are God's ministers appointed to the christian for good, so that believers pray for authorities. The restraint of evil is one of the most important functions of government in view of present conditions. Indeed we see that the sword is needed; "it bears not the sword in vain", we are told (@Romans 13: 4). Without punitive means government cannot function successfully nor continue, so that we christians recognise the necessity for prisons.
But then these prisons may be used against good, as they are being used in some countries. Indeed it is said of our Lord Jesus Christ, "He was taken from prison and from judgment" (@Isaiah 53: 8); authority was turned against Him. He recognised however that it was from heaven. He was not released from prison; He was taken from prison to the cross. Judgment miscarried in the most glaring way; the Judge of Israel, the Judge of mankind indeed, was at the bar of the so-called rulers, and they smote Him on the cheek. He was suffering for righteousness sake; He did not suffer vicariously in the place of detention nor at the bar of the High Priest. All that was suffering for righteousness, and
{563}
the prison doors were not opened at all. He was taken to the cross and put upon it, dear brethren. He was heard however from the horns of the unicorns, that is to say, His voice reached heaven; and one of the most touching answers in Scripture is that He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. Not there the power, but the *glory*, meaning that the Father entered into the matter in all that He is; it was His matter. He was deprived of His beloved Son for three days and three nights; I mean deprived in the sense in which He was here in life. That does not interfere with the statement that He went to paradise; we have to leave these statements as inscrutable, while accepting them as facts. The Father's heart was deprived of the Object of His affections as His Son lay in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights, a prison indeed!
Now dear brethren, that shows that man's prisons, prisons rightly used up to a point, may be turned against God's people, God's testimony, and God's service. This is becoming increasingly possible, and may be nearer to us than we expect. At any rate the great trend is towards restriction, restriction applied to men and particularly to God's people. We have to accustom ourselves, dear brethren, to it, and to know how to behave in it, to learn from Him who was taken from prison and from judgment, who was apprehended as an ordinary malefactor and caused to carry His cross. We have to learn from Him the spirit, the demeanour, the attitude that is becoming to us as brought under human restriction. "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers, and he opened not his mouth", @Isaiah 53: 7. Again James says, "Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not resist you", @James 5: 6. The Lord Jesus is the Just One, but James is alluding to those who are
{564}
characteristically just, which ought to apply, and does, to every real christian. They had been haled to prison and before tribunals, and James says, "He does not resist you". It does not belong to us to take up the sword; those who do shall perish by it, we are told. In doing so indeed we may jeopardise the whole position, a very serious matter. The whole position covered in what we call the dispensation of God which is in faith may be jeopardised by the use of force, whether actual or in a moral sense, against those who persecute us. "He does not resist you". So the Lord Jesus in approaching one of the greatest agents in this nefarious work, Saul of Tarsus, says, "Why persecutest thou me?" Who was Paul persecuting? He was persecuting the saints that were like Jesus. They were haled away to prison and judgment, tribunals and sufferings, but the Lord implies that they are all like Himself: 'You can see it Saul, you have found in them My spirit; they do not resist you'.
Now in these three narratives I want to show the principle on which we may expect divine intervention. If we accept without question all that men may impose upon us, and fall in with their requirements, we may find ourselves in impossible positions. What is to be inquired into in these three cases is the ground of divine interpositions. Do these matters affect the testimony? Are they directed against the service of God? The Lord has the greatest concern about these moments in which we are; it is the time of the putting on of the top-stone, the headstone. Zerubbabel was to put it on with his very hands. Christ is working to bring about the very best; the completion of the structure is Christ, but it is Christ in the most ornamental way. The presentation of Him thus, by ministry or otherwise, has a binding influence. He is putting on the ornamentation as well -- saying, "Grace, grace unto it!" @Zechariah 4: 7.
{565}
The dispensation is one in which grace reigns. It was begun by Jesus; He was full of grace and truth. It was the outflow of grace, one wave after another. Grace and truth subsists through Him, a holy combination, and it inaugurated the dispensation. And at the finish we are saying, "Grace, grace unto it!", that is, unto the headstone. The dispensation is to be maintained throughout to the very last moment while the Lord Jesus sits on His Father's throne. It is to continue and to be expressed down here in the ministry and in the character the saints take on, the character of grace, grace reigning; it is the dominating principle in the dispensation and in every christian, so that he is able through it to overcome evil with good. It is in the possession of the good in a liberal manner that we are able to overcome evil, and it is rising higher and higher every day. And the Lord is putting it to us as to mounting up in a moral way in the spirit of grace, grace upon grace, putting on the headstone and saying "Grace, grace unto it!" Limitations seem to be getting more and more stringent, but in what spirit are we meeting the limitations, man-made impositions upon the people of God? To submit to a principle that obliges me to serve man rather than God is not meeting the principle rightly. If a man is persecuted for non-compliance with some human arrangement that has no authority whatever, how does he accept it? The Lord says, "Why persecutest thou me?" And again, when one smote Him on the cheek, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?". The question challenges the conscience, and men have consciences, you know. And some day or another a question like that will find some response, and that response will bring intervention; God will intervene and open the prison doors, relax the limitations.
{566}
I want to show in these three instances the end that is in view. The first is, that "all the words of this life" of Jesus are to be spoken. "Stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life". It is not here what He is up there, but it is Jesus in His words, in His life, His ways, what He was here below. As if God would say, Those words of this life are to be over against this Pharisaical, or Sadducean, attitude. At the present time it is a partisan world, governed by partisanship in a peculiar way, whether it be Pharisaical, or Sadducean, or Herodian, or Libertine, whatever name you give it, it is the same thing, it is a party spirit and power supporting those who rule. The Sadducean power here resists the apostles, and puts them in the common prison. There is no respect at all; prisoners are respected sometimes, but there is no respect for the apostles. As the Lord was treated so were they; as common malefactors they were put in the common prison. But they are not to stay there. Why not? Because they were suffering? That is not the reason. They are to be delivered because "this life", this other life over against the Pharisaic life, the Sadducean life, was to be spoken of. All these lives are not of God; they are not the kind of lives that God intends for the earth. That is the point today, that over against what we have to contend with is the reproduction of *that* life, the life of Jesus, so that we walk in His steps. Not only in the general thought of it, but in *all the words*. If John were here he would say, a great many books would need to be written to open up all the words of this life, a great many addresses would have to be given. Not only that, but what is to be the theme of table conversations, the ordinary conversations among the lovers of Christ? The words of this life. If these prisoners are to be released from the common prison, it is not simply because they are
{567}
such sufferers, but that their lips should be used to speak the words of this life. That is the first point, and one of the most important, that instead of the much talk that is of no value at all, or worse, there should be in our conversation, in our ministry, in our services, the unfolding of the life of Jesus. It is that kind of man that is over against the antichristian life that is being so developed now. Our minds are intended to be habituated to it, so that we can understand antichrist. We are given evidence of what he is to be; he is simply *anti-*, the very opposite of Jesus and against Christ. The best answer to that is set out in life, the moral superiority of it to anything that exists in the way of life in this world. You will observe that when released they went into the temple early in the morning and taught. The words of this life are to be set out in the power of the gift of teaching. How refreshing it would be to listen to these men, perhaps with little or nothing in their stomachs, cold it may be, as straight from the common prison, they go to the temple according to the word of the angel and teach all the words of this life.
I come on to chapter 12, having specially in mind verse 24: "The word of God grew and spread itself". The word of God brings God in, the true God, and that is over against idolatry. It brings God in in an intelligent, intelligible way. The word of God is, as it were, God Himself. "All things are naked and opened", we are told, "unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (@Hebrews 4: 13), and then follows the description of the word of God. This prison is opened just to let Peter out, none of the other prisoners. And why? That the word of God should spread itself. Not because Peter was a sufferer. James was not released, he was murdered, and Herod proceeded to take Peter also, no doubt thinking it an opportune time to ingratiate himself with
{568}
the Jews. Well dear brethren, God had something to say, something He was thinking about in all this. He felt for His servants of course in their sufferings, all heaven was sympathetic with these men; but God was thinking about His word. His word is more than Peter, more than James, more than all the apostles. And in any restrictions that we are suffering, if we are to have release it is as those who are ready to speak the word of God. What a need there is for the word of God! How much scope there is given to the word of man, what this man and that man has said -- but how rarely to the word of God! Sometimes a feeble voice is lifted in favour of Christ; there are many, even in worldly positions, who love Jesus in measure, we must not forget that. A Nicodemus can be used at any opportune time. We thank God for anything like that. But what is needed is not simply that; it is persons who are boldly speaking the word of God. How great the need for it! Presently the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. What a time that will be; one tries to anticipate it, how God will cause the knowledge of Himself to spread abroad through the earth as the waters cover the sea. The word of God is quick and powerful. We read of an angel flying in the midst of heaven (@Revelation 14: 6) and what is he doing? He is announcing the glad tidings of the everlasting gospel. It will be done quickly. Now in our dispensation what is needed in our preachings, our teachings, our conversations, is the word of God. It goes wider than the Scriptures, it is what comes out in the power of the Spirit of God, as He conveys, amplifies, and applies the word of God to the consciences and hearts of His people. And if I am to be released from any restrictions put upon me it must be that I may be of service to God in the proclamation in some measure of His word. And we are told that
{569}
it is living and operative, penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and that it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. It affects men's consciences and brings them morally under the rule of God. Well, the angel comes there, and locks and bars cannot interfere with him. If it be a question of limiting evil, the stronger the bars and the surer the locks the better; but God can come in at any time and break through what man does to limit His people. He has a definite end in view and that is to cause His word to spread abroad. There is power in it that it spreads itself through the preaching. There is one thing, however, that I would call attention to, and that is that the angel touched him on the side. That is to say, Peter, it is not simply your intellect I want, your mind, your hands, your feet, I want you to be affected by love. The allusion undoubtedly is spiritually to the side of Jesus, and Peter would understand it. All testimony flows from that; it is a question of love.
He says, Bind on thy sandals, put on thine upper garment, and follow me. Those of us who are in service are the subjects peculiarly of angelic ministry; "are they not all ministering spirits", @Hebrews 1: 14. Peter followed, passed through the first and second guard, and through the gate that led into the city (reminding us of what the Lord said, Go into the city); that gate opened of itself. There is an unseen hand guiding. And Peter followed and they went down one street, the right one. You may say, What does it matter about the street? But Scripture is strictly accurate, it says, "one street". Elsewhere it speaks of the street called Straight; it calls it by name. He came to himself; he is in the right way, under heaven's guidance. Under heaven's guidance we find ourselves where we should be, where heaven would have us to be. There is no mistake about it.
{570}
He comes to Mary's house. I am not going to say anything about the state inside that prayer meeting, but it was a prayer meeting, and one in which Peter was prayed for. When God intervenes in this way for the proclamation of His word He gives you the right street and the prayer meeting. That prayer meeting is morally the centre of everything; it is where God is, and where He makes His people joyful, as it says, in His house of prayer.
Now I come to chapter 16, to show that the opening of the next prison is in view of the word of the Lord. This brings many things into view. My associations, my marriage relationships, my engagements, a great many things relative to my position here in the wilderness come under this head. Deliverance from this prison had in view that the households of the Lord's people should have the word of the Lord spoken to them. How many of our young are turning away! There are so many mixed marriages amongst us, which are abominable to heaven, so many associations that are not "in the Lord", business associations, friendships, household orderings; all these things and many others come under this matter, the word of the Lord. The word of the Lord here bears on household matters, and if the household gives way the assembly gives way. One generation comes, Scripture says, and another passes away, but we must have our eye on the coming one as it comes, to see that it comes under the word of the Lord. I have no doubt that what comes out in the word to the jailer was the outcome of the apostle's feelings as to what he had experienced in the house of Lydia. Lydia is a model on household lines. You say, she did not have to contend with what some of us have to contend with. But she was a business woman, a seller of purple, and the Lord took up that woman and put it into her heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul. I want you to follow this because
{571}
Paul is the servant in the New Testament that opens up the truth of the household, the household of faith. He had the mystery of the assembly, and the household was to be auxiliary to that great thing that God had in mind in past eternity. The household is intended to be auxiliary to that, and Paul, I believe, had tasted it in a peculiar way in the house of Lydia. So that the next time he speaks to a person about Christ, he speaks to him also about his household. The Lord would say to every parent here, 'I want you, but I want your house'. Have you a house? It must be a baptized house. The parents are said to be, as Lydia was said to be, faithful to the Lord. "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there". Paul did so, and I have no doubt at all that the link is just there. He has to go through the prison, he has to suffer as he did, along with Silas, to secure the man that God intended to have to set out this principle. This prison may be compared with the one Peter was in; he was asleep, but they were wide awake. At midnight in the inner prison, with their feet fast in the stocks, they were, in praying, "praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them". The earthquake came, the prison foundations were shaken, and every bond loosed. All are released, but they do not go. God is aiming at that one man, the jailor who held them there. He was not a careless jailor; having received such a charge he had put them into the inner prison. I have no doubt that God pays attention to people who do things they ought to do and do them well. This jailor's occupation was not illegal nor immoral. He was carrying out governmental matters belonging to his department of government, and he did his work well. The Lord says, I am going to get that man. It belongs to christianity to do things well, whatever you are doing. So he felt the charge; he was a true jailor,
{572}
and he was greatly concerned that the prisoners had fled. That was a right thing, he was responsible for the prisoners. He was going to commit suicide, such was the fervour of his mind as regards his obligation to the government. All this is taken account of by heaven, and Paul from the inner prison cries with a loud voice. You may say, that is a mere incident, hardly to be mentioned. But it is to be mentioned. Why did he cry with a loud voice? He was as urgent in his occupation, in his obligation, to his Master as was the jailor to his master; just as obligated to heaven in regard of the jailor as the jailor was obligated to Rome in regard to Paul. He cried with a loud voice, "Do thyself no harm"; he would save that man. He was urgent about it, that is the point. A sense of obligation pervaded the whole place, but not more in the jailor than in Paul. Many of us in serving the Lord are just optional; the sense of obligation is very little felt. Whereas the prime thought in the service is that one is sent, and you are obligated to the One who has sent you, that is, to your Master. One of the best illustrations of that is in chapter 4 of this book, where the apostles address Jehovah, address the Father, no doubt, but they call Him "Master", the word meaning "despot". They are no optional servants. If I am subject to a despot I have to fear him and see to it that I carry out my mission, or something will happen. So that our services are not merely side lines with us. Paul would say, this man is within my reach, I am obligated in regard of him, and he cried with a loud voice, "Do thyself no harm". And he rushed in and said, "Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?" He respects the men now, what a change had come over him! The word "Sir" implies that; it was a change in the direction of obligation. The centurion said to the Lord, 'All You have to do is to say the word, and my servant shall be healed. I understand
{573}
that You are under authority'; it is not simply that the Lord had authority there. The centurion understood that the Lord was commissioned by heaven, and he said, 'I am under authority too. Lord; I say to this servant, Do this, and he does it. And You say, Let my servant be healed, and he will be healed'. So Paul was in that position, under authority, obligated to that authority, and that jailor was within his reach and he must get him, and he gets him. He speaks to him the word of the Lord; there was authority. He had been true to authority as a jailor, but he is now to be true to the Lord Jesus, not in the jail only but in his house. All that were in his house came under the power of the word of the Lord, parents and children and servants and all. They did not find it irksome; no, they rejoiced. The word of the Lord was received and enjoyed; it was a happy household, and a household that henceforth would be contributory to the assembly.
{574}
THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK
@Acts 20: 7 - 11
J.T. References to the first day of the week, outside of the gospels, are not many; this is perhaps the most significant of them, as grouping the breaking of bread and Paul's discourse in relation to it, in the presence of brethren of spiritual stature from other parts. Paul was about to depart; the allusion would be to the *finish* as regards that particular part, and that which he said would not only be applicable to the locality of Troas, but would have a universal bearing, because of the number of brethren there from other localities. So the spiritual thought seems to be prophetic, as connecting Paul's particular line of truth with the Lord's supper. The first day of the week is a day of liberty and privilege, rather than of authority. So that we do not get *order* here; it is no question of the order of the Lord's supper. When reference is made to the first day of the week in Corinthians the link is not with the Lord's supper, but with giving, the collection; so that it seems to suggest what is voluntary. The first day of the week, according to Luke and John, is a time of great activity, particularly on the Lord's part. We have early rising, running, and late at night, specially mentioned. So that the suggestion of instruction would call upon us to be active spiritually, not sluggish or lazy, not to have a holiday, or a sabbath, but great spiritual activity and alertness. So that I thought we might take it up in that suggestive way and seek to see the bearing of what Paul said, what is in mind for us. It is not a matter of specified order, for we are not told what Paul said; but we may be sure that in what he would say he would cover his doctrine.
A.N. Do I understand that when he speaks of the first day of the week, he does not use it synonymously
{575}
with the Lord's day? Is there a distinct object in each?
J.T. I think so. The Lord's day would denote authority. It is rightly brought in in connection with the Lord's supper. But the first day of the week presents rather the side of spiritual activity and spiritual sentiment, so as to bring out *what there is*.
A.N. Would what the apostle says here have a prophetic character on account of the circumstances?
J.T. Quite so. I think the whole chapter is prophetic. He was about to depart on the morrow, and at the end of the chapter he calls the elders of Ephesus and acts as if he were departing, saying they should see his face no more. He says, "I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God". The whole chapter seems to be Paul going out on the top note. His discourse is prolonged, and no doubt it would be to enforce the points of his ministry relative to the Lord's supper, before they actually partook of it. It cannot be the order of the Lord's supper, because order does not permit of a long discourse. It is rather the suggestion that he had a good deal in his mind, and would stress the main points. It was not anything new, or we should no doubt have had it recorded. More likely it would be the stressing of features of his ministry.
G.S. Would you connect the first day of the week more with the headship of Christ?
J.T. Well, I think that is right. The facts given in the gospels of course help. Luke enlarges on recovering and adjusting service on that day. John puts off the recovering service until the next first day of the week, when the disciples are again within. He confines his remarks entirely to the side of privilege.
F.I. You have in mind that in coming together on the first day of the week for the breaking of
{576}
bread we should be able to follow up the extent of Paul's ministry, right on to the Ephesian side?
J.T. That is what is suggested in this long discourse. The service of God is properly associated with Paul's ministry. There cannot be a doubt that he is the author of the book of Hebrews. He would touch on that in this long discourse. The chapter affords conditions for that, because it is a love chapter. It begins with love, and you have love right through. But order would be the first thing to be considered. He made much of the Lord's supper when he wrote to Corinth.
Ques. In what way do you suggest that this may be carried on today? You have said that order does not enter into the chapter.
J.T. The point of the discourse evidently would be that in view of the Lord's supper we should bear his doctrine in mind. If we look at it from the prophetic point of view and see what was to happen as regards the Lord's supper, we can see the force of bringing in Paul's doctrine. The Lord's supper has been enshrouded in the darkness of human invention, bringing it down to the level of judaism, even of heathen practices. But it has been taken out of these settings, and I believe that in view of where it has been we must stress Paul's doctrine. We must listen to Paul before we begin with the Supper.
F.I. Having taken the Supper according to 1 Corinthians, does that mean that we touch the thing on the public side, the side of order; but looked at here in connection with the first day of the week it is the inner or spiritual side?
J.T. That would be the bearing of it, I think. The public side is the dominical side; it is the *Lord's* supper. Therefore authority comes into view, and what the Lord is to the assembly comes into view. We rightly address the Lord in giving thanks for the emblems. He must have given thanks to His
{577}
Father; we are not told what He said, but He gave thanks for the bread and broke it. But inasmuch as the doctrine covering it calls it the *Lord's* supper, it is obvious that the Lord is to be before us in thanksgiving in relation to it.
A.N. Your point then is, that as the substance of this discourse is not given, it is more the inner side?
J.T. Yes. I thought we might perhaps consider Paul's doctrine. Inasmuch as he said so much, and speaking about the Lord's supper, he would not fail to bring in what was said to him about it, "*I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread". He says that also in regard to the appearings of the Lord in @1 Corinthians 15. The appearings to Cephas, to the twelve, to five hundred brethren, to all the apostles, and to himself, would be the spiritual side, whereas chapter 11 bears on public order, the order that belongs to the Lord's supper. I am taking what is said of the discourse here as representative of his ministry in regard to the Lord's supper; we must listen to Paul. Eutychus failed to listen and fell down, no doubt alluding to the history of the assembly, but in verse 11, having resuscitated Eutychus, he went up and talked again, having broken bread.
A.N. Would Eutychus answer to a condition of drowsiness where spiritual faculties are not in exercise?
J.T. Quite. We may theoretically acknowledge the Lord's right to our affections, and yet they may be very dormant. We may acknowledge the Lord's rights and sit there without much movement of affection and become drowsy spiritually. The bride in Canticles would not rise to let Him in, hence she missed much.
{578}
A.N. As it says in @Ephesians 5: 14, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee".
P.D. Do you think the ministry of Paul first of all suggests what is comely, as connected with order, and secondly the affectionate side, what would appeal to us in love?
J.T. I think that is right. We must listen to him. He says he had received of the Lord something about the Lord's supper, and he had received something about the forty days as well, the appearings of Christ. He says he had the mystery of the assembly, and the mystery of Colossians, which he calls "Christ in you". You can see that he is the authoritative one in regard of these matters, and we must listen to him carefully. The first thing would be the dominical side, because we come up out of the world, out of our houses, business, and the like under lawless conditions; I do not say that our houses are lawless but it is important that we should have the dominical side before us; that as we walk to the room and sit down, in whatever we do, in the way we think, the idea of authority is to settle down on our souls. This is a dominical matter; the Lord will not brook any rebellious or careless or insubordinate attitude. Chapter 11 shows that anything that happens in the assembly is peculiarly solemn; "on this account many among you are weak and infirm".
These appearings in @1 Corinthians 15 would help us to be engaged spiritually with what is not seen to the natural eye. The Lord's supper is seen to the natural eye, the bread and the cup and the box; all these things are outward and material and may be looked at, but in @1 Corinthians 15 it is spiritual. We do not look for these appearings now, but there are appearings nevertheless, or incomings: "I will manifest myself". "Manifest" is the word used by John
{579}
both in chapter 14 and chapter 21, and he alludes in chapter 20 to the Lord coming in to the assembly; he says He came in twice. So I think Paul is the one to keep before us, both as to the authority side and as to the spiritual, so that we learn to be spiritual, to discern when the Lord is there. It is not a theory, it is a reality.
A.N. Does the dominical side finish at eating the bread and drinking the cup, and for any further instruction we need in regard to the service do we have to take up Paul's ministry? You have referred to the epistle to the Hebrews; He is the Minister of the sanctuary there.
J.T. That is right. It looks on to the covenant. The highest point reached in that instruction I think is in chapter 2, where the Lord sings in the midst of the assembly. But in the application of the instruction to us He is called the Minister of the sanctuary (chapter 8), and the instruction proceeds to bring in the covenant for the first time. When the Spirit of God touches the idea of the Minister of the sanctuary, He turns aside to link up the priesthood of Christ with the covenant, and carries it along from verse 3 of chapter 8 to verse 19 of chapter 10, where the Spirit of God urges us to draw near to God. That is to say, the covenant is brought in and treated of, but obviously with a view to setting our hearts free to draw near to God. The teaching of @Hebrews 8, 9 and 10 enters into the service. As the Minister of the sanctuary is named, the Spirit of God turns to this matter of the covenant, and leads us up to the drawing near to God: "having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach". I think that in principle enters into the service of the Lord's supper after the emblems are partaken of.
A.N. I remember a remark of Mr. Raven's, that as the Minister of the sanctuary He has the preparation
{580}
of the holy vessels, but the way in which the holy vessels are prepared is by the ministry of the new covenant; and as you were saying, it sets the heart free.
J.T. That is a good remark. I would not suggest that these are simple matters; @Hebrews 8, 9 and 10 require close attention if we are to be in assembly. Christ is on our side as the Minister of the sanctuary. Not that we should not address Him; He is in our midst (the cup carries that thought to completion); but the fact that He is in our midst does not preclude our addressing Him. The assembly may address Him even after the emblems are partaken of and the box is round. I think it opens up opportunity for richness and liberty of soul to make more room for Christ than we habitually do.
F.I. But you would address Him in regard to what He is as the Minister of the sanctuary, leading us on in relation to the service of God, not going back to what we have already touched in regard to His love expressed in death?
J.T. No. The chapters in Hebrews bring in the covenant; He is formally said to be the Mediator of the new covenant. Not only has He made it effective, but He makes it effective in us, so that we take on a change, from glory to glory.
Ques. That is a very important part then of Paul's ministry, bearing upon assembly service?
J.T. It is. What He has in us must come in because we are to be changed; "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord ... are transformed according to the same image", @2 Corinthians 3: 18. That is part of the service of the Lord in relation to the covenant.
R.M. When Eutychus was taken up in the apostle's arms, would he be moved to a higher sphere? Would he move on to the spiritual side as set forth in @Hebrews 8, 9 and 10?
J.T. Well, you certainly get Paul's touch.
{581}
Rem. I should like a little more help on the point that you have drawn attention to in @Hebrews 8 as to the change over from the minister of the sanctuary to the introduction of the priest, and how it bears upon the service as going forward.
J.T. Well, I think the writer refers back to the great subject of priesthood, that He must have somewhat to offer. That is all he says about offering there; he leaves it there. It seems to be a collateral line. Nothing more is said about offering until the covenant is introduced. Then chapter 9 goes into the question of offering and runs on to verse 19 of chapter 10, where he again formally alludes to the new covenant. "Having therefore", he says, "brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus". God would promote liberty in our souls so that the service might be in power, and not merely formal.
J.D. Is the great thought in the covenant that we should be brought to God? At the very outset in @Exodus 19 the subject comes before us, "Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and how I have borne you on eagles wings and brought you to myself". That lies at the very root of the covenant does it not?
J.T. Well, it does. We have not yet come to the covenant here. In that chapter you remember Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God. Now that passage which you quote is spoken of them whilst in the camp; they encamped before the mountain. I think we may fairly connect the camp with the public position in the Lord's supper, and our being brought out of it by the Mediator to meet with God suggests the inner position. The covenant was there in principle, because He proposes what He would do for them and they accept it, undertaking to be obedient. The camp is an earthly, public position; to meet God is another
{582}
matter. But when we proceed in the book of Exodus we find that in chapter 24 Jehovah proposes that they should go up. That chapter brings out the volume of the blood, the blood put into basons and sprinkled on the altar and on the people. The thought is that before going up we are imbued with the idea of the covenant and the love that is expressed in it. @2 Corinthians 3 brings out the service of the Mediator in changing us, so that we take on proper dress, not simply as we came out of our houses. We are not without glory as we sit down obedient to Christ; there is glory in it, public glory. But the glory that we take on is by the Lord the Spirit. We look on the face of Jesus, "looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face" and then He acts -- it is by the Lord the Spirit. We must make room for the service of the Mediator in effecting the covenant in us to bring about a change, so that we are in proper dress in the assembly.
Ques. That brings us to verse 19 of chapter 10?
J.T. Well, I think so. The covenant being applied, the Mediator having served us according to @2 Corinthians 3, we would proceed to the heavenly side of the service as enriched, as having taken on glory.
Ques. Is @Hebrews 10: 16 in view of setting our hearts free for movement?
J.T. Now I think that is good. Only that @2 Corinthians 3 takes it on to the assembly level. The terms of the covenant that he quotes here are from Jeremiah, but Paul in writing to the Corinthians puts it on a higher level: he brings in the spirit, not the letter. "The Lord is that Spirit". It is not in the terms of it, the question of forgiveness of sins; it is in the spirit of it that it comes into the assembly. So that instead of saying that our sins and iniquities shall be remembered no more, it is a question of beholding the glory in His face. The allusion is to the second giving of the law, meaning that we have
{583}
a higher level of things. We get the spirit of the covenant. They got it as it was written; it was really made with Israel and Judah; but the Lord as Mediator of it carries it forward into the assembly and applies it to us, and it is not only that we are forgiven, but we change our dress from glory to glory.
J.S. You make a distinction between the service of the Mediator and that of the Minister of the sanctuary?
J.T. Yes. The service of the Mediator bears on us. In His death He made the thing effective from God to us. But that is not the whole service; He makes it effective in us too. 2 Corinthians has that in mind; instead of being called the Mediator He is called "the Lord the Spirit", and "where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty".
P.D. Is it in this service that he secures in the hearts of the saints what He can offer -- that he should "have somewhat also to offer"?
J.T. Well, I think that 'somewhat which he may offer' is more than what you may have in your heart; it is what the High Priest is doing. I believe the point is to refer back to the priesthood again and carry it on in the line of the covenant, the collateral line, to what we had in the end of chapter 7, so as to bring us suitably into the service as knowing the new covenant.
F.I. In @1 Corinthians 11 you have "This cup is the new covenant in my blood", but in chapter 3 of the second epistle is it more the Person that is in view, not the blood so much?
J.T. The blood is not mentioned; it is the spirit of the thing. He begins with, God "who has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit". Then we have a long parenthesis, in which there is much richness, as to the new covenant. Then we come to verse 17
{584}
in which he says, "The Lord is the Spirit". It is a question not of the external side, but the spirit of the thing, so that we are changed from glory to glory even as by the Lord the Spirit.
F.I. Would you infer from that that we should dwell upon Him more as the Mediator of the covenant?
J.T. That is just what I think is a little defective with us. There is not enough scope given to the Lord to effect that service, to bring about the change. I believe scope should be given after the box is passed round -- the box itself enters into the matter of the covenant, the thought of giving -- to give time for the Spirit of God to move with us in relation to Christ in the various offices in which He functions in the assembly. Why should He not have full scope in which to function, if He wishes to bring Himself before us more, so as to affect our appearance that we are suitable for the presence of God? God looks at us and is pleased with us in our very appearance. It was said of Stephen that his face was as the face of an angel. That indicated what was going on.
A.N. I was wondering, as to our actual state, whether the hindrance often is that we are more under the old covenant than the new. In the old there was the question of our responsibility Godward, but in the new it is what He has in His heart toward us. Would that be the cause of our slowness sometimes, that we are more occupied with what we are than with what He is to us?
J.T. I think that is good. If you go back to the first covenant you get instruction about the new. We get more in the first covenant; the new covenant is entirely a question of what God does, so that even the change effected in us is by the Lord the Spirit.
Rem. You have referred to the possibility of a hymn being given out at the beginning of the meeting which may express responsive affections to
{585}
Christ that may not truly be with us. Would that not apply also to a hymn given out after the Supper had been partaken of? If the free movement of the affections of the people of God were allowed, we might get the true expression of the state of the meeting, and where the Lord was in it.
J.T. Quite so. He will affect all the saints as the emblems are partaken of. It is remarkable that He spoke about the cup and what it meant, *after* they drank out of it. Drinking of the cup ought to have an effect upon us. It includes the idea of drinking into one Spirit, into spiritual experience governed by the Lord, and our demeanour and faces reflect what is inside. He is doing that by the Lord the Spirit, to make room for Him as still serving us before the idea of the Minister of the sanctuary is taken up. I believe the matter is left to the brethren who usually take part, but the service of the Mediator would be to change every brother and sister. If there are those sitting there who ought to be taking part and drinking the cup, there is a voice to them, because they all drank out of it. Now if all drink out of it, what the Lord has administered ought to affect all of us, and produce a certain experience and movement which constitute us fit for the service of God. So that we are not sluggish; if a hymn is given out that is suitable we are all touched and carried along with it. God is looking for movement in the assembly; it a place of love. Divine Persons are all there and active to serve us to bring about the desire of God.
J.S. Would the thought of the Mediator help us in relation to @Hebrews 2: 11, "Both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren"?
J.T. I think we come to that. We have it as doctrine of course every day of the week, and it may be we enjoy it, but it is another thing to come
{586}
to it that we are the same kind of humanity as Christ. I believe that is ministered to by giving scope to the Mediator to affect us by what is presented in the cup.
Ques. Would you say a little as to what is suggested as to the conversational side?
J.T. Well, that comes in in verse 11, "And having gone up, and having broken the bread, and eaten, and having long spoken until daybreak, so he went away". It seems to be a question of what he did and said. There is no question here of order of the Lord's supper, but of Paul having to say to them, and of our letting into our souls all that he has said about it. The conversational side I think is perhaps an allusion to meetings where we converse as we do now. The Lord's supper sets us free for that.
A.N. Your reference to drinking into one Spirit raises the question as to whether we have taken in the significance of that. It is, of course, the communion of the blood of Christ; but on the other hand there is what you have been indicating, a forward movement which leads you a step further.
J.T. Quite so. They all drank out of it, and that brings everybody in. Now the Lord tells them what they had drunk into. Then it says *they* sang a hymn, meaning that they are all brought into it, and they went out to the Mount of Olives, in a mutual and feeling way.
F.I. Of what character do you think it would be, a hymn to God or a hymn to the Lord?
J.T. I think it would be a hymn to God.
F.I. Perhaps some of us have stressed that too much, and we have turned straight away with a hymn to God. But I gather that an interval should be left, that we might have the proper clothing on, as contemplating Christ as Mediator.
J.T. I think so. The fact that there is nothing said as to who is addressed in the hymn does not
{587}
settle the matter. We have to come to the doctrine of the thing, and the doctrine is in the epistles. So if it is the Lord's supper, all that relates to it is to be addressed to the Lord. Then there is the paternal side, "For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named", @Ephesians 3: 14. So that we are finished with the dominical side and we are ready, through the service of the Lord in the assembly, for the higher thing. We are His brethren; He has us with Him now. Our affections are moved, and we are ready to go on. So that the Spirit of adoption now begins to take effect; someone gives out a hymn to the Father and that is right, we are all in it. We are with the Lord on heavenly ground now.
A.N. I think that is what underlies; "having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives". There was a higher elevation.
J.T. That is what I think is meant. The Lord used to go there at night; it was the place of His relations with the Father.
{588}
REVIVAL
@Psalm 85: 6, 7; @2 Chronicles 30: 26, 27; @2 Chronicles 35: 18, 19; @Nehemiah 8: 17
J.T. I thought the Lord would help us to consider the thought of revival. @Psalm 85 says "Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?" Habakkuk asks for a revival of the work of God. Here it is "Revive us", for evidently we cannot look for revival of the work of God before the revival of ourselves; God uses His people in a revived condition answering to the mind of God, and the assembly must take on a character of revival. I thought these three scriptures show this thought. One goes back to Solomon, the next to Samuel and the third to Joshua, so that there is increase towards the end. Malachi, it may be added, saw increase in quality in those that "feared the Lord" and "spake often one to another", and Jehovah regarded them as in sonship. We come into the new dispensation and in Simeon and Anna we have this quality still further.
I thought it would be encouraging to look into the subject with a view that we might be set for increase in quality and quantity.
Rem. It is suggested that there is some work of God there to revive.
J.T. Quite so. It is that which is latent and needs to be stimulated so that in Nehemiah. Josiah and Hezekiah we have conditions to revive, and what was revived was there, only dormant, and therefore the question is to feel all that is of God that He may get the best results from us.
Ques. Is the thought that these things should be held in life?
J.T. That would be the idea. "Revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee" -- something for
{589}
God in revival and something for ourselves. In revival God rejoices in us and we rejoice in Him.
Ques. Is the thought seen in the apostle's prayer in @Ephesians 3 where he prays that they might be strengthened by His Spirit in the inner man?
J.T. That would contemplate a somewhat advanced state. The epistle to the Ephesians contemplates more than revival, in fact it contemplates the work of God effective.
Rem. You had something more in your mind in regard to the going back to Solomon.
J.T. The increase. Josiah goes further than Hezekiah. It says there was no passover like his from the days of Samuel, and Nehemiah says they had not dwelt in booths since the days of Joshua. Ephesians contemplates the normal result of the work of God, and yet it was not revival, but the Lord says in Revelation that revival was needed. They had left their first love.
Rem. They felt the state of things.
J.T. Yes. It brings it home to us.
R.S.B. Hezekiah says "Hear me, ye Levites", @2 Chronicles 29: 5. Would that be to stimulate the state of revival in their hearts more for the house of God?
J.T. We should see what marked each of these revivalists; it is in that way we shall get help. The Psalm is said to be "of the sons of Korah", referring to the sovereign mercy of God. His sovereign mercy can be reckoned upon. The sons of Korah had no rights at all, but they were spared, and can speak feelingly of the matter. They experienced God's mercy.
"Wilt thou not revive us again ... ?" The next thing would be how does God effect this; it needs a suitable person.
Ques. Would the thought be to secure more for the heart of God, because the scripture is suggestive of nearness and joy in singing?
{590}
J.T. That is what would come out in each case. The service of God comes out of it all. "Revive us again", he felt the need of it. Do we really feel the need or are we satisfied with ourselves?
Rem. That would correspond to our taking a lowly place before God.
J.T. We have to be thankful for what there is, and there is more than many of us are aware of. There is as much as there ever has been. In Ezra's time they began to revive; the younger men were equal to what they saw because they had not seen the earlier things. It is a question of improving things; they can be much better than they are. One has been encouraged to refer to David as one who had the thought to improve divine circumstances down here. He had made them better already by bringing the ark back, but he was not satisfied. He thought his own circumstances were better than the ark's, so that he would build a house.
Rem. We are apt to think only of increase in numbers, but we ought to consider for the interests and joy of God.
J.T. That is what comes out in every case here. See how Hezekiah began. He began to reign at the age of 25 years. In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah; then he brought in the priests and Levites, and told them that their fathers had shut the doors of the porch and had put out the lamps, and had not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings. So that we see what characterises a man whom God uses at such a time. He opened the doors of the house and removed all that is contrary, meaning that when we have the service of God in view what is contrary is removed. Then he goes on to say more: "Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel" (verse 10). So he is calling for the greatest service. He is laying it upon us to
{591}
go forward so that God should have the best from us.
R.S.B. The Levites seem to have a particular place in this service. David had some sense of that in preparing for the building of the house, showing that such a spirit would be required to maintain things for God.
J.T. David would govern all these revivals. When we come to Josiah, David is particularly alluded to. They were to do according to the writing of David and Solomon his son. They are aiming at the highest thoughts -- David representing that in the service of God, and so it comes home to ourselves, as to what is our standard. What have we in mind in our service?
Ques. What is the standard of service that we should look back to?
J.T. David. As regards the authority of God. Moses ministry would be the standard.
Ques. Can you put that in the anti-type?
J.T. With regard to Moses the standard enters into the Lord's supper, the authority of the Lord. Then we move further -- we have partaken of the Lord's supper, and the types would be David and Solomon and the singers.
It says "My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him", @2 Chronicles 29: 11. In the sweet savour offerings. God has chosen certain to do that, but it includes all of us now. The object in a revival is to get the people moving practically so as to afford what is needed. That is what Hezekiah presents.
J.H.T. What are the specific features of the time of Solomon, Samuel and Joshua? I thought if we saw the specific features we might see the objectives better.
J.T. Solomon would be recent testimony. Samuel is more distant and Joshua still more distant, but
{592}
nearer to the primary thought. Indeed he himself represents the great spiritual idea in the economy. Samuel would represent, I thought, faithfulness in the judicature as being a prophet and outstanding as the last of the judges. Solomon is the great end, which would be sonship. The fact that Hezekiah only goes back to Solomon, I thought, is to say that there was not as much in his passover as there was in the days of Samuel. Not that there is anything stated in the days of Samuel, but going back to Samuel covers a much longer period. Hezekiah's passover was not equal to Josiah's because it is the second month instead of the first. He takes advantage of the weak state of things. Josiah had it in the first month; there was more spiritual power and no need for a month's grace. Nehemiah goes further back still, but it is the feast of tabernacles; it would be a question of love, brethren in nearness to one another. Nehemiah and Hezekiah reached it more on that line, which is maintained in Joshua, representing the spiritual side of the economy.
J.H.T. It is recorded that 42,360 went back, and yet they went forward with what was spiritual.
J.T. That is it; it comes down to our own times. The suggestion is viewing men according to quality; large numbers are apt to divert us.
H.G. Would that feature mark the activities of the Spirit of God at the present time? In these revivals of recent years the tendency has been to go in for numbers, all kinds being brought in.
J.T. The Lord has been helping us into higher levels of service. It would seem that in Simeon and Anna these levels were reached. Attention was called to her remarkable life, unmarried, married and a widow, and how in her advanced years she served God night and day in the temple, speaking of Him to all that looked for redemption. These two seem to be outstanding as coming down from the Old
{593}
Testament. The few in Malachi's time are on that line too, the line of quality.
Ques. Is a revival occasional or continuous? I was wondering whether there was the thought of continual revival with an ever-increasing portion for God.
J.T. The facts show that revivals were continuous because there was a lapsing after each one. A revival should be sustained.
Rem. If we were in the good of things there would be a sustaining of God's portion in an increasing volume.
J.T. If there have been revivals so often, we should not lose ground. Some localities suffer, for mark, the enemy is reducing them from what they used to be. The same would exist here.
Rem. Instead of lapsing we should move from strength to strength.
J.T. If there is lapsing the question is whether there can be an improvement or a return to earlier conditions; for example, in Europe things are not what they used to be. The question is, can we make them better? Indeed, by the grace of God all responsibility attaches to us. These were models.
R.S.B. Is the quality of a revival marked by the depth of exercise? Hezekiah writes that God had blessed the people; Josiah set his heart to seek the Lord; Nehemiah had many years of deep anguish of soul.
J.T. Hezekiah begins later, Josiah gains in his earlier days. The revival qualities came in more after he began to reign. His life is divided up after he begins to reign and there is increasing quality. He dies a young man but he began at the age of sixteen to seek the Lord, and at twenty to purge the house; at twenty-six he finds the book of the law. Hezekiah is twenty-five already, and he is not as keen, but God must have been preparing him beforehand
{594}
without anyone noticing. We should keep this in mind and see who is likely. Ahaz, his father, was very unspiritual -- he would not take a sign from Jehovah. Hezekiah is a sovereign provision and he began earlier, a word for all young men and young women. As soon as we begin to feel things God would work with us, and say 'You are the man, or the woman'. He will not go past us. Elijah prayed and God gave him what he asked for. Hezekiah may be taken as a young brother who has had the experience secretly, so as soon as he is in the position he is equal to it, and has not to learn afterwards.
Rem. Hezekiah was concerned as to the condition of the people.
J.T. He says "Our fathers have transgressed, and done evil in the sight of Jehovah". He calls upon the Levites; that is everyone here today, we are all levites and priests. The question is whether we can make better circumstances for God, and incidentally better for ourselves.
Ques. Each one of these revivals is governed by the law of Moses. Does this suggest that holding and following divine principles is an important feature?
J.T. We must go back to the beginning; Moses is the beginning of the economy. It is a question of authority which we get in the Lord's supper. Thus we go on to David and Solomon to get the full result for God. It is a question of the whole truth. We must have a definite standard and as we have God would help us. Contend earnestly for the faith once delivered.
Ques. Did you say the feature that marked Solomon was sonship?
J.T. Well, it was royalty based on sonship -- the highest point reached externally. Solomon is regarded in sonship -- son of the father's love. As to our side Joshua represents Christ in us. So that

Nehemiah goes back to Joshua. Solomon is more recent and there is less ground to be covered. There is more ground covered in regard to Samuel inclusive of Solomon, and Nehemiah goes back to Joshua inclusive of Solomon, Samuel and David, the further back the more praise and virtue.
Rem. If any brother feels things are not right he should seek the Lord, to make a start himself.
J.T. That is the point; it is open to young brothers and sisters, all are brought into it. We should be concerned as to what is latent among us.
R.S.B. The apostle wrote to Timothy as a young man about the house of God before recovery is taken up.
J.T. He says, "That thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house", @1 Timothy 3: 15. God speaks to this young man and tells him what is going to happen. The young people are the hope of Israel.
J.H.T. Hezekiah would say that no one is at a disadvantage if the sovereignty of God is in operation. He is at a disadvantage in view of the circumstances into which he was born.
J.T. Hezekiah's life is in Isaiah, who tells us how things were. It ought to encourage us; if we feel things God will use us. The Lord says "Whom shall I send" and Isaiah says, "Send me".
Ques. When the past history of a locality has been judged, can the revivalists afford to ignore it?
J.T. No.
Rem. But it should not hinder them.
J.T. Go on with it. This man considers for God; Josiah is concerned and God takes account of that.
Rem. Samuel opened the doors and Eli enquired as to what Jehovah had said.
J.T. Jehovah took him on in time, but he was being brought forward for use. In chapter 30 Hezekiah is on right lines. No question of sin or anything
{596}
like that; he seeks to win all Israel. This revival is not equal to that in Josiah's day, but the people come forward, showing there was power. Unless we have the universal outlook we are a sect. We should be living in the light of the whole assembly to the end (verse 21). The Spirit of God just delights to bring that before us and we should have in mind to make things better for God in our localities. There may be latent power and God would tax us as to it.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the way Hezekiah skilfully secures the co-operation of his brethren?
J.T. The great point is to lead the saints along with you.
Rem. There was great joy in Jerusalem, and the priests the Levites arise and bless the people.
Rem. There is not enough feeling in these days.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. Timothy cares with genuine feeling.
J.T. That is why the apostle takes him up. Josiah begins young. In the eighth year of his reign he began to seek after God thus showing the thoughts he had. In the twelfth year he purged Israel; in the eighteenth year when he had purged the land he sent some to prepare the house of Jehovah his God.
Then the book is found and we find that "the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that are written in this book", @2 Chronicles 34: 31. So that we should see he is influencing the people rightly. We find in the next chapter that things are ready for the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month; he is not needing a month's grace. Josiah is in his place, also the Levites, singers and doorkeepers. There is no difficulty.
{597}
Josiah finds his place according to what he is fit for.
Rem. No discrepancy as with Hezekiah.
J.T. Whilst the principle of revival is not actually found in the epistles to the Corinthians we have the feature of Hezekiah in the apostle wishing to secure as many of the persons as possible. Yet when the apostle writes to the Ephesians he is at liberty with them immediately. There was the necessity of mentioning the Lord's supper in the letter to the Corinthians; he needed to bring about what obtains in the whole assembly. The Lord's supper is rightly set in the front. We are subject.
Ques. Is the extent of one's feelings seen in relating them before God?
J.T. That is it. The Psalms show deep feelings before God. It is all an outcome of right feelings. Now Josiah's service as revivalist has everyone in his place; a quality according to the mind of God. God helped Hezekiah but things were not ready; hence it is a kind of passover. You might have jubilance but yet discrepancy. With Josiah, the ark is in its place, and so the service is according to the writing of David and Solomon.
R.S.B. It is the result of his progressive exercises.
J.T. He began young; a great tribute to him. How the Spirit of God divides up his life! An angel of the Lord spoke of "all the words of this life", @Acts 5: 20. The words of the life open up what the life is according to God, so delightful under the eye of God; the more details the more wonderful the life is. So Josiah is in his place and he leads; authority attaches to him; he influences the people.
H.G. Would they be each one taking up his own specific kind of service?
J.T. Yes, and all are happy in it.
Ques. Have you got that idea with Titus? He had to put things in order.
{598}
J.T. Yes. In Nehemiah and Ezra we have two men working very happily in this service. God would stress the importance of more than one being used. We are told it was the seventh month, the end of the spiritual year, that part of the year in which we reach higher levels. If there is no love there is nothing. The feast of tabernacles means I can move with my brethren happily. For love you need two, and we have Ezra and Nehemiah working together. In the seventh month the children of Israel were in their cities (@Nehemiah 8: 1, 2). It was a good long reading but they were not tired of it. Love is active. It is a love matter and the leading men promote holy feelings of affection and jubilance. There is enough to make us happy; it is good to mourn, but let not the mourning overcome the happiness. It is the first day of the feast. In the second day (verses 13, 16), it is the service of God and the happy state of the brethren in relation to one another; without this there can be nothing for God. There must be love for one another.
Ques. Would the booth idea cover Onesimus and Philemon?
J.T. Yes, a brother beloved and not a slave.
Ques. Would the symptoms of a revival be a readiness to come together and a willingness to come joyfully? 'Love will not be alone'.
J.T. Quite so. So we have special readings in our localities when we all come together; we also invite the brethren to our houses, the feast of tabernacles. The less distance there is, the better; distances are swallowed up in love. The quickness with which the spiritual truth is taken up is seen here. In the second day they found this and they put it into practice immediately, and there was very great gladness. In a place where there are three or four meetings we should get meetings together with the idea of love in our minds, "having fervent love among yourselves", @1 Peter 4: 8.
{599}
Well, the houses of the saints are most conducive to this.
J.H.T. The house of Nehemiah was not only a house where you would learn deep feelings, but a house where he entertained daily a hundred and fifty of the Jews besides those from the nations round about and made provision without being chargeable to the government, qualifying him to move amongst the saints.
J.T. Wonderful provision without taxing the saints.
R.S.B. He would not only have food but provide priestly garments.
J.T. Such love in the leading man is very beautiful (see @Nehemiah 5: 16, 17).
Rem. The same spirit was found in Josiah (@2 Chronicles 35: 7).
J.T. It is what marks the service in Israel from David onwards; it is princely, meaning that we are all to be that. We ought to use all our wealth. It is a question of what the thing is worth. Open your door to the brethren and find wealth inside; it is a question of the state of your heart, the spirit in which you do things, given to hospitality.
Ques. What about those for whom nothing is prepared?
J.T. The secrets of the heart of anyone coming in are made manifest (@1 Corinthians 14: 25). He would not be forgotten; the saints would do the best for him. You say you have not got any more room; this passage says there ought to be something for him, it involves the princely side of things.
Rem. It seems to suggest our households in relation to the testimony.
J.T. Love will never fail. We should not have to exclude a brother from the meetings or our houses;
{600}
not that anyone should impose, but it is a question of the attitude of our hearts.
J.H.T. This is seen in the house of Simon the tanner.
J.T. Sometimes I take the liberty of inviting a brother to where I am staying.
{601}
THE SERVICE OF GOD SEEN IN EXODUS
@Exodus 24: 12 - 14; @1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 34
J.T. In linking Exodus with the epistle to the Corinthians I desire that we may see how the teaching of Exodus enters into the service of God in the assembly, for the passage in 1 Corinthians contemplates the saints together in assembly, which is the form used in verse 18. The immediate suggestion is that both scriptures contemplate certain instruction furnished but with more to follow. We are furnished with light as we need it, and as we are equal to it; and in receiving it we are to be patient and wait for the promised help, for the instruction is sure to be furnished, as in the Lord's hands. So that Exodus furnishes much instruction in regard to the service of God in this chapter, but there is more; we are told that "Jehovah said to Moses, Come up to me into the mountain, and be there; and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction" (verse 12). Then Moses makes provision as going up into the mountain for the elders to wait. He said, "Wait here for us, until we return to you; and behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matter, let him come before them". So that the position is that Israel had much instruction, and experience too, in keeping with the instruction, in regard to this matter. There are other matters also, besides the service of God, of course, but in regard to it, they have to wait and be patient. Moses is called up from them; he had plenty to represent him. Aaron and Hur, two men already tried in the service, associated closely with Moses; so that they are to wait. In like manner the ministry at Corinth was according to the state of the saints. The apostle could not go very far with them, while he was with them,
{602}
although he had been there eighteen months teaching the word of God. They had much opportunity to learn; an eighteen months course from Paul was a long course; the second longest of any that we have. The position in Rome was hardly this although he was there two years or so; but here he has been eighteen months, and three years at Ephesus. During these eighteen months they had ample opportunity to learn from him what he had from the Lord. But then, he had to deal out to them according to what he had judged they could take in, and that principle enters into these epistles too, with the promise of more. If he were writing to the Ephesians, we could understand there was much more in his mind which he would like to open up to them. The work at Ephesus followed after that at Corinth, and it would seem as if the apostle is able to open up his mind more at Ephesus, for he says to the elders, "I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God", @Acts 20: 27. But not so at Corinth; indeed, he tells them he is coming later and he would set in order what was wanting. It indicates there is more to follow, and the second letter, as we know, has much more for them, which we may be able to touch on a little. But I just wish to indicate the immediate thought in mind, that the Lord is helping us and we are to be patient and wait. There may be moral questions to be raised with us; we have light coming in as there was at Corinth, but we may not have availed ourselves of what we have had already. Here the apostle had already delivered this message to them that he had received from the Lord as to the Supper, but evidently they had not profited by it as they should have done, so that we have the idea of deliverance: he delivered it to them. They were defective; that was what I had in mind, and perhaps we might look a little at Exodus from that point of view, that we may gather up thoughts that enter into
{603}
the service of God initially, for as yet they did not have the truth of the sanctuary. They had much that would fit into the sanctuary later, but they had not the sanctuary yet; they had not the formal thing called the tabernacle.
M.W.B. Do you imply that the previous communications in Exodus would give a groundwork for the further communications relative to the sanctuary?
J.T. I think that is the thought. These wonderful things ought to have a shrine, a holy place where they would be guarded. Israel proved they were not able to guard them, as the sequel shows, but they are put to the test in the meantime. The mediator is gone up and they are to wait. The sequel is a solemn lesson, because in waiting for adjustment as to the light we have already, we may fail on moral lines. The Lord may become displaced in our hearts. This might be before the truth is confirmed to us.
M.W.B. So that before they actually had further communications, they were in the overruling ways of God permitted to fail, and they had to go through a very searching experience.
J.T. That is what I thought.
P.L. Would this arise in regard of Luke's account subsequent to the Lord's supper? Instead of proceeding directly to Olivet, as in Matthew and Mark, the Lord enters into a number of moral questions that would need solving before the fresh communications belonging to the sanctuary, and subsequent to the Supper, would be unfolded?
J.T. The first was that the betrayer was at His hand.
P.L. There was strife amongst them.
J.T. That seems to fit.
M.W.B. I was struck with an expression in thanksgiving this morning that this question involves preparation on our part -- a matter that is perhaps overlooked a bit.
{604}
J.T. There is, of course, immense light thrown in on the disciples during the Lord's stay with them, and indications too of the heavenly relationships into which they were to enter; all unordered things, as you might say, have to be set in order. The apostle Paul by the Spirit was to take the truth and put it into order. Much had to intervene in their identification with the Lord in His sufferings; they were in the presence of wonderful truth put together in the gospels later, but not yet. They had to experience something of His sufferings, and alas, they are seen to be very poor, shallow and wanting. He takes them in hand to put them together, put them in right relation to Himself and one another, and make them spiritual. So that when the Spirit came down from heaven they should be equal to what He had to unfold to them. The first great point made is in the converts: "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". That is, things began to take spiritual shape and order in @Acts 2, but there was still more. The Lord in His remarks about the Spirit in @John 15 said they should bear witness of Him because they had been with Him from the beginning, and the Spirit should also bear witness, but evidently through others besides them. All that was in prospect, and so it is that things awaited Paul, and as he took up his work in detail the same principle had to be worked out. The Corinthians had to learn to take things in and be left to themselves, to see where they were, and to what extent the work of God had taken form in them. The letter showed there was still more, but then they have to wait, to be patient and judge themselves in the meantime.
M.W.B. Is it for this moral reason that assembly service as ordered necessarily is to begin with the thought of the Lord -- the Lord's supper? We recognise Him as Lord in obedience, and then proceed
{605}
to the covenant which would touch the heart. Is that the reason of the order?
J.T. That is a good way to put it, because you feel, however much truth may come, and sometimes it comes in an unordered way, undesirably so from the Lord's point of view, it tests us as to where we are; so that what is stressed here in @1 Corinthians 11 is just as you say. The *Lord's* supper; it is a question of the Lord.
E.G. Does verse 12 come in in accord with what you say -- "I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction"?
J.T. That is what I thought we might link on with our scripture in 1 Corinthians, what Jehovah had in His mind for the people; the mediator was to be there. "Come up ... and be there". That is, he is to be ready to receive the mind of God; in the meanwhile the others have to wait, but they are not left without care. Aaron and Hur are important men; God never leaves us without sufficient. Of course, we know how Aaron broke down. Aaron was a tried man and associated closely with Moses; he and Hur are there, but there are great things above; I believe Ephesus coming in after Corinth is just the heavenly side, the coming in of the light of God in the sanctuary -- a heavenly order of things. That is what really is the counterpart of the light received at Corinth, but we have to be very patient, and wait and see. There are moral questions with us, and many are ever learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth, and even those who have it have not challenged their own hearts as to where they are as to it, so that I think it is designed, that we have to wait.
P.L. "Whosoever has, to him shall be given", @Mark 4: 25. We have to prove morally that we have what has been given in order to get more.
{606}
J.T. Quite so. Those that have not are like those around; I am not accusing anybody; they are like those around who have nothing in a true sense; whereas there are those who love the truth and have it in that sense. The Spirit has promised to guide us into all truth. It is in services like this the Spirit is here to take up what is said and put it together for us. We must give Him room.
M.W.B. There is an important collateral consideration along with the truth that might be unfolded, were conditions right; that is, a state that is right is required in order that there may be the understanding of the truth for the taking up of the service of God. So that the very start of the service might have to call consideration into our hearts as to whether we are practically there.
J.T. We are assured in this epistle that all things are ours in the service, however great. Paul, Cephas, everything is ours. So that everything is in our favour, but he insists on self-judgment in this section we have read.
A.T. Is there a link with "Wait here for us" and "when ye come together to eat, wait for one another"?
J.T. There is a link there. The principle is to be patient. Moses has gone up; things are in God's hands. It is all under the direction of Jehovah, and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders are there. In the first part of the chapter the point is to go up. It does not say anything about a place, it is the idea; but when we come to Moses, the place is stressed, that is, Christ's present session. Everything is in the best hands: Christ above. Just wait and He will find ways and means of getting the truth to us, and from the next chapter to the end the book is wonderfully full of heavenly light for us.
M.W.B. So the going up in the first part of the chapter is for us a moral idea, not so much in regard
{607}
to the place but going up, implying a movement of the soul.
J.T. That is what I thought it was. The people are led to that point; not all the people, but representatively they are led into the place of elevation where they see God. They ate and drank up there, so they are wonderfully set up so far. But the whole of the immense amount of truth, beginning with chapter 3, has to be set in order and enshrined in the divine dwelling.
E.G. So they make progress; in verse 10, "they saw the God of Israel", but in verse 11, "they saw God, and ate and drank".
J.T. They are accredited with that; they are equal to that.
E.G. One is "the God of Israel", and the other "God".
J.T. There is progress in that. They are accredited with ability to go up, because in chapter 19 they are just brought to the foot of the mountain and left there. There is no idea of their ascending in chapter 19, but the four chapters that intervene before chapter 24 furnish light as to the land, their being in the land. These have to be taken by themselves, but they are intended to enrich our souls in this position. What a people we are! What an example we are going to have in the Hebrew servant! What kind of an altar we are to have! All that intervenes, and it would seem as if it so qualified the people, so affected the people in the mind of God, that now in this chapter He proposes they should go up, not to a place yet, but as you said, to a moral elevation: it was above the level of the world.
F.W. Would you say a word as to the relation that the going up in chapter 34 has to the way up in chapter 24? Does that touch more the practical side on our part? That is, the second
{608}
going up of Moses where he had to hew for himself these two tables of stone.
J.T. I think it is to enhance the greatness of Christ as the Mediator. Moses is gaining, gaining in all this from the failure of the people, so that we really touch the new covenant, another thought of the covenant, as he comes down. He is not there just to receive the tables of stone and the commandments for the instruction of the people, for Jehovah says to him, "And it shall come to pass, when my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand, until I have passed by. And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see me from behind; but my face shall not be seen", @Exodus 33: 22 - 23. Then as Moses is up there, it says, "Jehovah came down in the cloud, and stood beside him there". This is an action of Jehovah's. He "stood beside him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah. And Jehovah passed by before his face, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation", @Exodus 34: 5 - 7. That is what you get. Then, after speaking much more, He says to Moses, "Write thee these words; for after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel -- And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights" (verses 27, 28). It is really the second covenant in figure, a great addition in the sense of glory, what God is, shining out so that Moses face shines; this was not so at the first.
Rem. That is more 2 Corinthians, rather than 1 Corinthians.
{609}
M.W.B. In that connection you made a remark in conversation that for us the new covenant implies, as in the spirit of it, very much more than it would for Israel in the future. Would you amplify that?
J.T. I think the allusion to chapter 34 helps in that Jehovah comes out, and He says, "After the tenor of these words" (verse 27). That is more the spirit of things left with the Mediator to amplify; so that 2 Corinthians, I think, has to do with the anti-type. We have the bare allusion to the covenant in the first epistle, the blood of it corresponding with chapter 24, but in the second epistle the question is raised of a letter of commendation, and that leads the apostle to speak about this matter of the new covenant. He says he is a minister of it, a competent minister of it, and then he goes on to say, "not of letter, but of spirit" (@2 Corinthians 3: 6), the spirit of the thing. Who but Christ can open up the spirit of it? The letter of it is given in Hebrews, but the spirit of it is in Christ; He is not said to be the spirit of it in Hebrews. He is said to be the Mediator of it there. But in 2 Corinthians He is the spirit of it, and, of course, the spirit of it was reflected in Paul as a competent minister of it. But Paul does not say he is the spirit of it; he says the Lord is, and I think that is Moses coming down the second time with his face shining, when Aaron and the elders were afraid.
F.W. While giving due place to the Lord as Mediator at the Supper, do you think there is a further thought in "the Lord the Spirit", the Lord bringing in glory on that occasion?
J.T. I think there is. I was going to read from further in that chapter which I think is a foreshadowing of the new covenant. It says, "Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him". It is rather a suggestion of the attitude of the Corinthians towards Paul. There was a distance
{610}
on their side, not on his side. They were afraid to come near him. "And Moses called to them; and they turned to him -- Aaron and all the principal men of the assembly; and Moses talked with them" (verse 31). "And afterwards, all the children of Israel came near: and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him on mount Sinai. And Moses ended speaking with them; and he had put on his face a veil". Then it says further, "He came out, and spoke to the children of Israel what he was commanded". So that it would seem as if happy relations are brought about now between Moses and them; still the mediator, still the Lord in type, still the one with authority, but he speaks with them, and happy relations are restored between him and them. So I think @2 Corinthians 3 gathers all this up. The apostle begins with himself but transfers the whole matter to Christ and says, "The Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty", @2 Corinthians 3: 17.
E.G. Those words seem to be very touching.
J.T. Things are left with Moses to hew out the two tables like the first. Deuteronomy would show that he made an ark of wood, so that the humanity of Christ is brought in more.
M.W.B. As illustrating what you are saying as to the new covenant applying more in the spirit of it, would it be seen in Hebrews that the question of forgiveness is emphasised, whereas in Corinthians it is righteousness and change "from glory to glory". That takes on more elevation.
J.T. Quite so.
F.W. You were stressing the importance of sight. I was wondering whether that came in here in connection with the mediator, what we have in connection with the Lord the Spirit; it is the glory as appreciated by spiritual sight.
J.T. Just so. "We all ... beholding".
{611}
Rem. Then the glory at the end of chapter 34 surely affects us on the line of worship.
J.T. Quite so. The second letter to the Corinthians, I think, is to make men out of us; the first is, you have just to wait, 'I have given you sufficient', the apostle is implying. 'I have already given it to you', he would say, 'but give it to you again, the same thing, and you are to wait'. Then in the second letter it would seem as if he himself were affected more; something happened that was intended to affect him, and he is himself greater. It is an all-round matter; we are all together in the school of God, that we might take up our privileges intelligently; if we are all together in the school of God, everyone is gaining.
E.G. So you are glad when the leader is getting on.
J.T. The first thing is to see Moses has gone up and the matter is in the best possible hands; he is looking after our affairs. Aaron and Hur are down here. When we come to the second letter, which corresponds pretty much with @Exodus 34, we have formation, great formation all round, so that there is confidence in one another, even the distance between them and Paul is gone. A great change had come about; that is the thing to look for. Titus came and told him their zeal about him. Then the apostle says, "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago" (@2 Corinthians 12: 2), as much as to say, 'During all this time I have been with you and elsewhere, I have had a wonderful thing in mind'. So what may we not expect now?
F.S. What are you referring to in this matter of waiting?
J.T. The verse read, "Wait here for us, until we return to you; and behold, Aaron and Hur are with you". The Corinthians were saying that the apostle said he was coming and he did not come, imputing
{612}
prevarication to him. He says, It is on your account I am not with you; make the most you have got and become men -- "quit yourselves like men". That is the first letter, but in the second letter he has got help himself, and he is now bringing in this thing. They are questioning him as to whether he needed a letter of commendation, and the whole matter of commendation comes up.
P.L. Do you think they must recognise Aaron and Hur before this coming down? "I rejoice in the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; because *they* have supplied what was lacking on your part", @1 Corinthians 16: 17. Do they have to recognise not only what was on high but what was left in their midst which they had disregarded? Their attention must be drawn to men amongst them.
J.T. That is a very encouraging element in this chapter. It contemplates one far ahead of others. Stephanas had a great place. There were those who understood Paul, Stephanas and the house of Chloe, and were concerned about the whole position; that is another thing to bear in mind. But in a general way the two letters contemplate the apostle as away but the truth amongst them; there is more to follow, but the truth is amongst them, and what are they doing with it?
M.W.B. Might the actual entering on the truth, therefore, the distinctive heavenly side of the assembly experience, necessarily have to be delayed because of the state of the saints in a locality?
J.T. I am sure that is what Scripture contemplates. A well-known passage which bears on that is @Psalm 15, "Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tent? who shall dwell in the hill of thy holiness? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth from his heart ..." And again in @Psalm 24: "Who shall ascend into the mount of Jehovah? and who shall stand in his holy
{613}
place? He that hath blameless hands and a pure heart ... This is the generation ... that seek thy face, O Jacob", as if the whole thing would be in Jacob, what Jacob is in the mind of God. And so the passage in Exodus, I think, would test all Israel. This man had gone up. They had seen the God of Israel. Well, can everyone say that? What is the use in my being taught as to heavenly truth, as to what is in the sanctuary of God, which is the figurative representation of things in the heavens, or what is the logical force of my wanting to know this heavenly truth if there is a moral reason why I cannot go up?
A.M.H. Is your object in referring to the Psalms to further the thought of preparation which is to go on with us continually, the Lord being absent and discipline coming out in chapter 11?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. You may take up light mentally, but the question comes, Am I equal to it morally? Thus the elevation of chapter 24 is already reached by some, but now what is going to happen? Are all equal to it? You are to stay and wait until Moses comes back. It may be you will be equal to it then, but the sequel here shows that they were not.
J.H. Does that necessitate having to say to the Lord personally, as we have in Luke? He says, "Handle me and see", and He shows His hands and His feet, not His side, as if it would adjust them in their walk.
J.T. Quite so. We were noticing this morning, as perhaps you remember, that in Luke the Lord just stands. It does not say He came. The service of God is going on and there is urgency. They have begun already and the Lord just stands in their midst, and of course, conditions were not very suitable, so He puts them right. That is one side of the position, and the other side is that He can come in,
{614}
as in @John 20, in relation to what we are as the subjects of the work of God, and by His gracious influence shut out all else. In @John 20 they had already shut the doors; Luke does not record that they had done that.
-- T. Will you say a little as to Joshua's position? He is linked with Moses.
J.T. We have the plural. Moses uses the word "us", but Joshua involves an accessory thought. It is really the idea of Christ going up and our being tested by His absence.
F.S. What I gather in relation to this matter of waiting is that we should take home individually the concern as to moral conditions, recognising that the Lord has gone and that everything in relation to God in regard of the covenant is in good hands, and that if we attend to the moral conditions He will see we come into it.
J.T. That is what I have in mind in regard of this meeting. It is a challenge to each of our hearts. Even Paul got gain in the waiting, but they were saying he was using lightness, prevaricating. There was a very bad state among them that had to be settled, and he says in @2 Corinthians 12 that he not only had heavenly light but he had been there fourteen years before, so why were they not getting the good of all this?
M.W.B. It is striking that he should have been at Ephesus when so hampered in writing to Corinth!
J.T. I think that helps. Ephesus is his next great work. He saluted the assembly at Jerusalem, that is in his mind; he salutes the assembly and came back to Ephesus, and there was a wonderful work there, exceeding all others, as he says in @Acts 20: "For I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God". Why not at Corinth?
F.W. Was it because they were carnal, as he says in @1 Corinthians 3?
{615}
J.T. That is what he says.
F.W. So would this waiting period discover just where we are, and we would not go beyond our measure for the moment?
J.T. If I do not see a thing and cannot put the truth in order, the Lord will give me understanding: that is the principle. The Lord will give me understanding in all things, but it may be, there is something which darkens my vision.
Ques. How does the Supper come in to adjust one on these lines?
J.T. As has been pointed out, it is the *Lord's* supper: it is the beginning of the matter. "When ye come together to eat, wait for one another". Paul would say, Regard the saints rightly, and then remember what I said to you. I said it to you, and now I have written it to you, but proceed now on these lines. Proceed with the saints, and proceed with the instruction. To spare you, he says, I did not come, but I will come in due course.
E.G. Is there any link between what you are saying and what Hur was to be with Aaron? Then in chapter 32, you get those who come out on the Lord's side; God is not going to lose everything.
J.T. There were those in the camp who were faithful, and so there were at Corinth, but the waiting attitude brings out the true state of things. So that the word, I believe, would be for us to go along together; and I believe all the great troubles the brethren have had over so many years arise from the inability to move on together and wait for one another. Take full account of what all have got and go on with that.
M.W.B. So that one of his reasons for delay in the matter of bringing the truth before them was the fact that he wished to carry the saints in his service, as you pointed out. It is no good ministering if the
{616}
saints are a long way behind what you are talking about.
J.T. Quite so, and the second letter shows he is bringing them along.
P.L. He would make them appreciate what they have before things were increased. We must be true to our charge and make the most of it before the Lord will add to it.
J.T. The apostle shows in chapter 1 that they had plenty even in the way of ability, but were they using it aright? So the thing is to go on. I am not with you yet, he would say, I am coming. Some think I am prevaricating, but it is not so. He is in accord with God. Every promise of God is Yea and Amen in Christ, and so it was with him too. So that he will come, but they had plenty to go on with and they were to make the most of it. They were making partisan use of their leaders.
F.S. Would the early part of chapter 24 help in that regard -- the way in which these twelve pillars are put up, as you have been reminding us, what there is to be gone on with as moving on and working things out together, and the effect of the sprinkling, the love of God touching us in that very setting?
J.T. The chapter is wonderfully rich in that way. Take the youths: why do we need anything official? Let the young brothers take part and make the most of them! There is really nothing official according to God outside the Spirit of God. That was a great point made by Mr. Raven many years ago. Any other officialdom is useless, and worse; so the thing is the youths, and they are doing their work well, they offer the sacrifices.
P.L. Would the introduction of Timothy at the end of 1 Corinthians draw attention to what there was available in the youths?
J.T. Quite so -- and Titus, too.
{617}
RESULTS FOR GOD
@Acts 13: 4 - 12, 52; @Acts 14: 8 - 10, 23
These two chapters furnish us with the account by the Spirit of God of the first missionary enterprise of Barnabas and Saul, particularly Saul, that is Paul; and these sections are read with a view to presenting the gospel from them, but more particularly to show the results for God, and for Christ too, from this great enterprise of these two servants of God. It is well to bear in mind that results for God are intended in the gospel, although incidentally relief and blessing for men are also included, or the word 'gospel' would hardly fit. It must carry good news, and what is immediately good news to those in distress from sin, is relief, a means of relief from the distress. If there are those here under pressure from sin, either directly or indirectly, let it be understood by all such that the aim is that there should be relief.
But these chapters are exemplary as indicating that in the relief there are to be results for God, and that in the way of assembly material, assembly material set up in assembly relations, and in these relations functioning under the eye of God here. That is what God has in mind; that is a great moral triumph, ultimately a great and glorious triumph for eternity as we see the assembly in heavenly glory, every member of it there, every member of it in his own history having tasted the gospel as relieving him, but now in glory with all his like. The Lord lays the whole matter out before us in that way, and the first element brought to our attention here as the result of these labours and journeyings is an intelligent man. That is the first idea. This man is not presented to us as suffering from sin, though of course he
{618}
was a sinner like all of us. He was a deputy of the island, a man of distinction politically, but he is called an intelligent man from the beginning. The evangelists had a good journey to take before they found anyone that could be regarded as a real case, as we say, a case of blessing; it is a good phrase. They had journeyed down the island of Cyprus, full of evangelical feeling, patience accompanying it. They did not seem to have been discouraged by the paucity of cases in their immediate efforts; indeed, we read that "they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus". A very unlikely case! Very unlikely soil! and it is not out of place to suggest that we are living in days in which the soil is very, very hard, and if we are susceptible to discouragement, we shall be discouraged in our evangelical efforts on account of the hardness of the soil. The Spirit of God, however, did not have this man in mind; he is not among those who are saved; we have to regard him among those who are lost. A terrible thought! "If our gospel be hid", says the great evangelist, "it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ ... should shine unto them", @2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4. A terrible thought that there are many such now! This man was one of them, and he was with another kind of man. Alas for that man, the deputy, that he should have such a companion as this! Companionship is used of the devil constantly to keep souls away from Christ. It may be that someone here has a companion, unsuspectingly, a companion that you do not think for a moment would divert you from Christ, but he may be doing it, or she may be doing it, and doing it in a pious way, for this man's name was Bar-jesus; some religious profession attached to him. He is a sorcerer, however, a "child of the devil", for it is
{619}
not easy to discern at once what may be hid under such garments: it may be, as here, a qualified person, a qualified emissary of the devil, one who would hinder your soul from drawing near to the Lord, and too, hinder the Lord from getting near you. But it is your matter. If there is anyone here with such a companion in any degree, the matter is yours; the Lord is saying to you, You must get rid of that companionship or you will be blinded, as he is, or as she is. So the apostle spoke to him. His name is given to us in verse 8, "Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith". As I said, things may not appear on the surface, but that companion is hindering you. You may bring him or her to the meeting, and you hear of Christ, and after the meeting you are still the more darkened; the influence is there.
Now the deputy was exercised, as we say; he sent for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. Bar-jesus did not suggest that to him. Thank God there was a power greater than Bar-jesus working with that man, as there is with everyone whom the Spirit has in His mind to secure for Christ, for the assembly. It is a question of the power of God, and this man was there by the side of the deputy to turn him away from the faith. Thank God it was clear at the outset that this was a faith matter. It is not a matter for mental enquiry; christianity is a faith matter or nothing, and anyone who takes it up otherwise simply whitewashes himself. It is a faith matter, and this distinguished man had that in mind. He had the idea of faith in mind, and the devil knew it. It is not simply, beloved friends, that we believe in the doctrine of justification by faith; that has been crystallized for three or four hundred years; it is a question of faith as the gift of God. The Lord in speaking to persons who gained by faith, calls it
{620}
"*your*" faith; and evidently this man had faith, although the word has more meaning here than that -- it is "*the*" faith. "The faith once delivered to the saints" is being set out by these great servants, and the devil would turn away this man from it.
Now as I said, one would appeal to young people as to their companionships; that is one point that seems to me to be urgent at this time: the use made by the devil of companions to turn away persons from the faith. The passage goes on to say, "Saul, who also is Paul", and let us call him Paul henceforth, for it is his name spiritually, and it is well to have the spiritual touch in the use of names in the service of God, for personality enters into this, personality in those who serve, for those who serve are to be examples of what they are saying, and that is the idea in "Saul, who also is Paul". His converts would notice this. No one is put forth more in Scripture as an example next to the Lord than this great servant, and every servant of Jesus is to be representative of Jesus, and worthy of being followed, at least, to a point. He will not let you follow him long if he is like Paul: we have "Paul and his company". You might say, 'Paul is a partisan man now'. Never! He tells the Thessalonians, "Ye became followers of us, and of the Lord". He soon turns us on to the Lord. He will do what he can for us. Why should not every lover of Jesus do what he can for souls? -- but not to make himself a party head. You get into excellent company, saving company, when you touch Paul and his company, and that is what you get here. I would advise every young one to get into that. You would soon find those who form this company are all set to get you into touch with Christ in an experimental way, that you may know Him as Head, as Leader, the Leader appointed of God, the appointed Leader of our salvation; that is what He is called. The word signifies
{621}
that the Lord Jesus has gone before and He has set out the idea of salvation; then He becomes the Saviour in it, the Captain of our salvation. So that Paul and his company here are not to be questioned; they are over against the deputy, Sergius Paulus, and this man Bar-jesus; the latter is a bad companion, a dangerous companion. One, an elect one to be a participant in the blessings of the gospel; the other, a child of the devil using every possible effort to turn away the man who is seeking after the faith and the mind of God -- to turn him away from the gospel, to turn him away from the faith. I warn everybody here against such a companionship; even though it may not be such an one as this, there may be persons very like him, whose faces are toward the world, and they will drag you into it if they can. Cut that companionship at once; it stands between you and blessing; it is Satan thwarting your salvation and your blessing.
So the apostle Paul exposes this man in the most dreadful terms -- "child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?" He is exposed. We can thank God for the exposure of such a companion. So here Bar-jesus is exposed and comes under the judicial dealings of God, for God is always acting judicially; day and night it is going on in our favour in order to make a way for the gospel. He acts judicially: He may take that friend away, or He may take you away and make you sick so as to get you away from him. He wants to bless your soul. This man is exposed and the deputy is secured, and he marvels at the teaching of the Lord. It is a question of teaching; and we have the kind of material that is greatly needed. It is the first element here. A man who is called an "intelligent" man is delivered from his evil companionship, he is a believer in the Lord Jesus, and he is wondering at the teaching of
{622}
the Lord. You would like to meet a man like that! He will soon be in fellowship! He is ready for the Scriptures, ready for any ministry that tells him of the Lord. It was well worth traversing the island of Cyprus in order to secure him, and he is secured in faith, marvelling at the teaching of the Lord! Many get blessing through the preaching, and teaching is made very secondary. Relief comes into the conscience and, of course, that is intended; but then, the teaching is the next thing. Young souls, young converts, need teaching, and this man presents that side to us. He is the subject of the work of God secured through the gospel, and now wants divine teaching. You marvel at it, you are thirsting for it, and the Lord has provided for you in what are called "pastors and teachers". The order of the Lord's provision, as above, as gone up into heaven, is "apostles" -- that is, the authority of God; secondly, "prophets" -- that is, the mind of God forced into your soul; and thirdly, "evangelists", and fourthly, "pastors and teachers" -- persons who love your soul. They will go any distance to help you, and at the same time bring to you the teaching of the Lord. Well, that is the first element; the next is the result at Antioch.
We have first an intelligent man, wondering at the teaching of the Lord; secondly, believers who are said to be filled with joy; we need those, the testimony needs those. It is a remarkable thing how joy in heaven is linked up with conversion, with persons who repent. Heaven is not so doleful as some might think; heaven is very active, there is no night there, it is a place of eternal joy. You may say, 'Because of conditions up there' -- but it is rather because of what happens down here, what is happening down here from the east to the west all day, namely, souls repenting -- not simply once and for all, there is no such thought as that. The idea
{623}
of a repenting sinner is characteristic; a characteristic repenting sinner occasions joy all the time in heaven. It may be you have never thought of contributing to the joy of heaven; heaven is contributing to your joy as here, but think of being able to contribute to the joy of heaven! That is an item to be received into the mind. Am I to be slothful in that? It is a very practical matter because there are many offences and transgressions; you know there is a good deal of this current amongst the Lord's people, and a great deal of slothfulness in repenting. Of course, there is more in it than I am speaking of. I am speaking now of making history in heaven, that it is in my power, in repenting of that false charge, that bit of slander; it is in my power to cause joy in heaven through that, "one sinner that repenteth". You may say, 'But that is a sinner'! But you are a sinner if you are making a false charge against anyone, or doing anything like it. We are all brought into it, dear brethren, as to affecting heaven. Some of us have been speaking about influencing heaven to do things down here, but it is a very delightful thought that I can affect heaven in the way of causing joy up there in the presence of the angels of God; and then, heaven in its turn causes joy in you. It fills you with the sense of its approval.
So the second part of this chapter deals with the work at Antioch in Pisidia. Paul is the speaker; he, like Stephen earlier, enters on the history of the testimony. You say, 'What is that to do with me if I am convicted of sin here tonight?' It has a great deal to do with you, because the testimony has had to do with persons like you from the very beginning; from Adam and Eve down to the present time, the testimony of God has had to do with persons like you -- sinners. Adam was one, Eve the first one. Let it not be forgotten by the feminine side, the woman was in the transgression by herself: Scripture
{624}
holds her to that. God had to do with her, the testimony of God had to do with her. God had to make clothes suitable for Eve, woman's wear. That was history. That is a bit of history that should affect every person, that God is thinking of Eve, the first sinner, she who lent her ear to the devil, who listened to the devil speaking against God too. So the apostle Paul makes a sign with his hand, knowing the Jew so well. He knew how to get people's attention. An important thing in ministry is to get people's attention. You do not speak to Jews as you do to gentiles: remember they are Jews and speak to them accordingly. He made a sign and he calls them, "Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience". That is a fine introduction to what he has to say. He is not saying anything against them; it is not indictment. The gospel is not an indictment of men, not that it does not convict men of sin, but it is only to forgive them. There is no penalty attached to the charge made, it is a question of interesting you. "Give audience"; listen to me! And he gives a bit of Israelitish history, appealing to the instincts, their national instincts, and what we find is that in coming down the history he touches on most interesting men. He touches on David; he says, "I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will"; but he means Jesus. See how beautifully he brings in Christ in giving a little bit of history, the history of God's ways in grace with His people. Why do you not come into this? That is the intent. Why will you not come into this bit of history? It refers to you.
So that we find the apostle saying to them, "Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins". That is the point, coming down to every individual sinner. Where is the repentant sinner
{625}
now? He has been making joy in heaven; now heaven is going to make joy in his heart through this wonderful message. "Be it known unto you ... that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins". That is what you need. One would like to put oneself in the position of a sinner to have again the joy that comes into the soul in forgiveness. Is there one under pressure of sin here? The word is for you. And moreover, it says, "By him all that believe are justified from all things". What a sweeping matter this is! How thorough is the gospel! If there is anyone here at all interested in what I am saying, do not question it, accept it in its greatness and fulness, its completeness, justification from all things, however bad, and they are bad. The more he goes on with God, the more the truly repentant sinner judges sin, he finds out the nastiness, the meanness of what he is. He needs the thought to be carried right through; hence we have this word justification from all things. No one can bring a charge against you. It is triumphant.
Then we are told that "as many as were ordained to eternal life believed". Now we come down in this remarkable testimony at Antioch to the counsels of God; your name is there beforehand. We need not fear, dear friends, to look at this side of the matter, for, after all, it is this, "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified", @Romans 8: 30. "Ordained to eternal life", not ordained to forgiveness, but to life, which is a matter of counsel. Eternal life was promised before the world was, and God had someone in mind in promising; the promise is made to someone and all those here are included in that promise. They were ordained to eternal life. You may say, 'Why do you bring in that side?' It is very establishing. It is an establishing truth, and believers do well to take it in.
{626}
If I come into the joy of forgiveness, I have already caused joy in heaven, but now I find my name has been known beforehand. I have been ordained: think of that! Everyone who is a christian has been ordained to this great matter, to the promise of God, purpose too: "For God so loved the world", in order to reach this "that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life", @John 3: 16. As soon as that "whosoever" believes, he finds out he was ordained to it; it is a double security. There is no question about it, and do we not need it? With the terrible winds blowing around the young people they need to get into their souls the fact that believers have been ordained to eternal life. And so, as you might expect, they were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. The joy is mentioned first, as if the Holy Spirit takes up His abode in a heart filled with joy. Why should He not? We talk about the Spirit almost entirely in a theoretical way, but there is such a thing as the Spirit dwelling, perfectly at home with nothing to disturb. The heart is made joyful by the gospel and by the knowledge of the counsels of God regarding him. Think of being named before the ages, before the world was! Let us let the thought in, for it is gospel. Why should it not be gospel? To think I have been known before and "ordained to eternal life"! Does it not fill the heart with joy? It does.
Finally, there is this man spoken of in chapter 14: 8. "There sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: the same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked". This is another bit of material. First, we have an intelligent person, then we have persons
{627}
ordained of God before the world unto eternal life; and now we have persons who are upright, balanced. He sprang up on his feet. He had never walked. The testimony needed a man like this! It is said these servants went in together into the synagogue of the Jews. What lovely men they are, those two servants of Christ, heaven's witnesses! Let there be no hesitation in two brothers taking on gospel service; that is a divine way, and how lovely they are! Lovelier than ever Saul and Jonathan were, although David speaks with such pathos of them, they were not like these two men. These two men are unique. Paul and Barnabas entering together, full of evangelical feeling, full at the same time of the sense of Christ's love for the assembly, for the bride. His companion for ever. They are full of that! They are not evangelists only, they are lovers of Jesus; they are in sympathy with Him as the three mighties were in sympathy with David about the well of water at Bethlehem. They are heaven's best, going together into the synagogue at Iconium, and they so spake that a great number, or multitude, both of Jews and also Greeks believed. That is, attention is called to the speaking, another feature of service; in order to get what is needed there must be right speaking. "They ... so spake". It says both of them, "they ... spake". I suppose they spoke one after the other. It would be very lovely to hear Paul and Barnabas speak, one after the other. How delightful! The apostle Paul speaks of himself and Silvanus and Timotheus preaching the Son of God. One would like to have heard! Paul speaking and Silvanus speaking and Timotheus speaking! Maybe they had three meetings going on at the same time in Corinth. I should think there were a good many meetings in Corinth, for the Lord says "much people", and much in His account *is* much. These three men preached the Son of God. I would love
{628}
to hear them preach the Son of God: it is the way they speak, and it is remarkable that Paul is called the chief speaker. Some of his rivals in Corinth said that his speech was contemptible. Think of what the devil would do against a servant of Christ; an opposer is forced to say an illogical thing against a servant. Here he is the chief speaker, and he so spake that a great multitude believed. It is a question of the speaking, and then there is this one man singled out in Lystra. Beautiful as these men were, they were persecuted and flee the town.
So they come to Lystra, and here was this man, an impotent man, a lame man -- he had never walked. I suppose he represents the gentiles. It is emphatically said that he never walked; it does not say this of the man in chapter 3. Now the word is for anyone here who is failing in his walk: a christian, it may be, who has had light in his young days, and now is damaged. You came in here tonight to hear the word of God and it enlightens your soul. That is what it is intended to do. Paul saw this man, and he heard Paul speak: that is the idea. This man would never forget this speaking, for in his turn he will speak too. Our meetings, assembly meetings and prayer meetings, are often very dead because of a mute brother, mute people. Of the Lord it is said at one time that He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. He was doing it. It is not a historical thing merely, but the sort of thing that goes on. The Lord sees the need of it amongst us. It is a question of the assembly; the previous chapter deals with the furnishings of the assembly. Now the point is not that he speaks, but Paul speaks and with a loud voice. These early ministers of Christ could hardly use these amplifiers. We have to learn to speak with a low voice. It is a humbling thing that we have to accommodate ourselves to them, we have
{629}
to use them. We hope one day they will accommodate themselves to us, for surely a minister of Christ must be actuated by feeling. The Lord Himself cried with a loud voice, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink". That would not be through an amplifier but spoken by the blessed lips of Jesus. "If any man thirst", He cried. It is very interesting to follow up the cries of Jesus: that is one of them.
So Paul, here, we are told, "said with a loud voice, Rise up straight upon thy feet: and he sprang up and walked". He sprang up. That is a question of the energy that is needed in the assembly; these are all assembly features. It is assembly material that is in mind. Luke has that in mind right through the gospel. Not only that I should be in heaven, but I am to be here for God now having these features. It is a question of the spring in the soul, and a walk in keeping with it; so that no one can point a finger at me, for my walk is right. "Rise up straight upon thy feet", the apostle said; and he did. It is a question of balance, but that of a man who heard Paul speaking. He is imbued with the thought of the speaking of this great servant of Christ.
Then finally, the apostle is concerned that this material, such as it is, precious gold, should be housed, and it comes, as it were, under the dignified word "assembly", trustworthy, representative not only of the grace of heaven, but the order of things -- heaven itself is brought down into every locality where these people are; hence, the apostles made selection of elders. The word 'ordained' is that they chose them. They ordained elders in every church and prayed with fastings, and committed them to the Lord, persons who would take care of this precious gold. In Timothy and Titus we get the qualifications required, not simply that they had grey hairs. These are to be set up in the towns where the apostles had
{630}
laboured, so as to be representative of heaven. Think of the greatness of the divine thought in a provisional sense, what the Lord needs us for now in our localities, to be representative of heaven, set up like the boards of the tabernacle, in which the testimony is preserved! May God bless the word.
