CHRIST'S KINGDOM NOT OF THIS WORLD (1)
@John 18: 33 - 37
J.T. Scripture abounds with intimations that the dispensation in which we are is heavenly, and one hopes we may be helped to a more concrete understanding of this qualification. The heavenly character of the dispensation is admitted theoretically amongst us, but whether it is understood is a question. Current public events give occasion to bring out the concreteness of the truth of the heavenly character of christianity. The confession of the Lord Jesus before Pilate, recorded in our chapter, which is peculiar to John, will help us as to the initial thought in the subject, the Lord Jesus saying, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought" (@John 18: 36). This statement of the Lord is the kernel of the whole matter. In other dispensations from the very outset, the sword was used. War meant war in the physical sense, and this character of warfare will be resumed when the Lord Jesus returns publicly. In the meanwhile, as far as christians are concerned, the sword is put into the sheath (@John 18: 11). "Our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies" (@Ephesians 6: 12). The Lord's words before Pilate are especially alluded to by the apostle Paul, "Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession" (@1 Timothy 6: 13).
The present time affords much opportunity to witness a good confession as to the character of the
{2}
dispensation, and many are availing themselves of it. God is ordering it, confessions are reaching the authorities as the Lord's confession reached Pilate. The Lord is pleased with the confessions that are being rendered, and the hope is that what may come before us may strengthen the position in that respect, especially that the idea of a good conscience towards God and before men may be clarified.
The Lord leads the way here, and in this first reading our remarks should bear on the phase of the subject in the passage read. Later we may be able to see the practical working out of the heavenly dispensation in our lives, as taught in @Romans 12; later still in the truth of the heavenly calling in Ephesians; and the heavenly priesthood, entering into the service of God as shown in Hebrews: that in result we may have a clearer idea of the whole position, that it is really heavenly. Our contact with the earth is provisional in the sense that the assembly is of heaven; formed on the earth and used here for heavenly testimony at the moment, but received back into heaven as having spiritually come out of heaven. That is the general idea of what is in mind.
R.R.T. Is your thought that the matter of confession has to do with the kingdom of heaven? Our confession as to our allegiance among men is a great matter just now, but the allegiance to Christ made Lord in heaven is much greater.
J.T. Quite so. John's presentation of the matter is intelligible as entering into these last days, how the truth works out in remnant times. So that the chapter is a unique one, beginning with the Lord in the garden, not here called Gethsemane, because the idea of pressure is not the side of the truth presented in John. It is the Lord in liberty and power so that when He says, "I am he", His enemies "went away backward and fell to the ground" (verse 6). Throughout He is in liberty and
{3}
in peculiar power, which is applicable at the present time as to what is needed -- a knowledge of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, who He is divinely; and liberty in relation to that. We have priesthood in this chapter under the enemy's power, in Annas and Caiaphas, and on the other hand Peter's denial of the Lord Jesus without any repentance attached to it. In John we have the character of the general position in the last days indicated in this chapter, and the Lord's confession coming in in these verses as the guide for the young men and for all of us at such a time.
D.R. What other dispensations do you refer to, and what would be the character of them with which you intend to contrast our dispensation?
J.T. Paul says, "these things happened as types of us" (@1 Corinthians 10: 6); and in verse 11, "all these things happened to them as types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come". That would mean that there is capability contemplated in the assembly to take up everything; it is, as it were, a clearing house for the principles of all the dispensations. The assembly in which the all-various wisdom of God is active is, viewed normally, equal to this. All these principles are seen worked out in the very best hands, first in the Lord Jesus Himself, and then in the assembly in which the Holy Spirit dwells. The Spirit guides us into all the truth so that we understand divine principles, wherever they are, or however expressed.
The antediluvian period involved great root principles and the Spirit has opened them up to us through certain ministries divinely provided. We may regard it as a dispensation. That period of long lives was more extended than ours, but is covered by only six chapters of the Bible; but what histories and principles they contain! These all were written for us. They enter into our own times, but yet had application at that time.
{4}
Then there is the idea of God's call, seen in Abraham, involving the great family of faith. There is no calling out of the antediluvian world, although there was suffering for the truth, calling on the name of Jehovah, separation and walk with God as apostasy set in. It is after the flood that the call comes in, when idolatry had gained a footing. Nothing is said about idolatry in the first world.
Exodus introduces the dispensation of law under Moses. It continued on to Christ; but features were added, each of which had in itself a dispensatory character: judges as set up of God; and particularly kingship as inaugurated in David, through whom the royal seed was established. All these dispensations are only intelligible in the assembly; in their full significance they awaited the presence of Christ on earth, and, redemption accomplished, the presence of the Holy Spirit here in the assembly. The principles involved could not otherwise be perfectly administered nor even fully understood; the prophets sought to understand the things they ministered, and it was revealed to them that it was to us they ministered them (@1 Peter 1: 10 - 13). The Psalms express the greatest spirituality and it is quite plain that in speaking of the principles of the earlier dispensations they had Christ in view.
D.R. You think then that God has in mind the assembly as the consummation of all the dispensations?
J.T. Yes, the divine thought is that, not only what comes out of heaven, but everything to be established in the millennium is to be made intelligible in the assembly.
J.L.F. This thought of witnessing a good confession enters into our own period and it also extends back to the dispensations which have gone before, does it not? Paul and Stephen are examples in the former, and
{5}
Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in Old Testament times. You get a climax as to this in the passage before us -- "Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession".
J.T. Just so. We have it in a supreme way here, and it is taken up in the epistles for our learning. Perhaps before we enter fully into the verses read we should grasp the teaching of the chapter, that we may understand the conditions that occasioned the truth the Lord developed.
The garden into which the Lord and His disciples entered is noted, and Judas and his band came there. "Judas therefore, having got the band, and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons" (verse 3). That is, it is an apostate crowd coming back to attack the Lord with light, such as lanterns and torches; also with weapons. Then, "Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them, Whom seek ye?" (verse 4). "Knowing all things". We are not to be in the dark as to these circumstances; whatever the enemy may be thinking of, the saints are to know. John says elsewhere, "*ye* have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things" (@1 John 2: 20). Then the Lord says, "Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus the Nazaraean. Jesus says to them, I am he. And Judas also, who delivered him up, stood with them. When therefore he said to them, I am he, they went away backward and fell to the ground" (verses 5, 6). So that there is *triumph manifested in relation to the Person of Christ*. As long as the Person of Christ is the basis of the position, then nothing can stand before it. This being attested, the Lord allows Himself to be bound and led away.
C.A.M. They were against the name of Jesus the Nazaraean, the despised Man. But what came out was that they were also against God.
{6}
J.T. That is it. The Lord accepts the lowly title. He says, "I am he", but then, a divine Person was there, God was there. He answered to the name, "Jesus the Nazaraean", but who He was expressed itself in power as He said, "I am he". "They went away backward and fell to the ground". 'He' is not in the original, so that His Person is expressed in 'I am'. "Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus the Nazaraean. Jesus says to them, I am he". When He said to them "I am he, they went away backward and fell to the ground". That is the basis of the whole position: Jesus is I Am.
The will of God was that He should die. Peter uses the sword, but the Lord says to him, "Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?" That is the position, the will of God; whatever God orders is according to His will, and the responsibility of the believer is to stand by that; in connection with it is the divine presence and nothing can overcome it. The will of God must be accepted, even if it involves death, as we see in the Lord here, but the presence of God with us and the power that marks it settles all for the faithful believer.
A.D.S. What is the import of His asking of them again in verse 7, "Whom seek ye?"
J.T. Well, that is to bring out what was definitely in the minds of the betrayer and his band; so they said again, "Jesus the Nazaraean". Then "Jesus answered, I told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go away; that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, As to those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them". That is, the saints are being looked after in these terrible situations. The Lord is there, His Person is in evidence and the power
{7}
that causes them to go backward. But He adds, "If therefore ye seek me, let these go away". He is going into the grave by the will of God, but He takes care of the saints. They are all divinely looked after.
R.R.T. Would it be right to say that the opposition of the enemy in the various dispensations takes character from the vessel that God is using for the moment? That is, the opposition of the enemy here is centred against Christ as here in the flesh.
J.T. Yes; thus He challenges them: "Whom seek ye?" It is a question of the will of God, and hence those who are attacked are not evading anything that may come upon them in the way of suffering, for the will of God must stand. But the Lord shows here that He has power to deliver His servants. He allows His enemies to take Him, but says, "let these go away;" He takes care of His people. That is one of the greatest comforts.
C.H.H. Would what you are saying enter into Paul's account of the Lord's supper? He says, "the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up" (@1 Corinthians 11: 23). He uses the term "Lord" as well as "Jesus" -- the Lord, and yet Jesus, that very Person.
J.T. Quite so. He "took bread, and having given thanks broke it", verse 24. He is in the circle of the saints. It is in view of His going away and leaving something for their affections by which they should remember Him. Here He is taking care of the saints. "If therefore ye seek me, let these go away; that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, As to those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them".
J.L.F. The Lord jealously takes care of what should characterise the situation. On the one hand, divine power was there in Him, on the other hand He would not allow Peter's sword to falsify the position.
J.T. That is right; He healed the ear of the bondman of the high priest (@Luke 22: 51). In view of the
{8}
destructive and defiling conditions in which many of our brethren are today the Lord's word here, "I have not lost one of them", is most assuring. He also said, "a hair of your head shall in no wise perish" (@Luke 21: 18).
C.A.M. The number of officials, including officers of the chief priests who came with Judas, is remarkable.
J.T. I thought of that. How miserable the whole effort was, including their lanterns and torches! Compare them with Christ -- the light and power manifest in Him! How morally despicable was this band of Judas! With the betrayer were the representatives of the accepted current religion to arrest and crucify the Lord of glory! It is really an apostate band with their pretended lights, but the Lord exposes them, especially their impotence. But still He is not destroying them. Infinite power was there, but instead of using it against His enemies, He allows Himself to be taken, directing that they should let the disciples go away. Like the ark in the wilderness, He was really taking a three days¬ journey to find a resting-place for His own, (@Numbers 10: 33).
R.R.T. Does this passage also indicate the greatness of the Person? It says, "that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke". We have referred to the Lord fulfilling the prophetic word in Scripture, but here His own word takes that place.
J.T. Yes. The allusions to the fulfilment of Scripture in this gospel are striking; that nothing is left out. In John everything is according to plan, you might say, in spite of all that has happened, in spite of the darkening influences of the middle ages and what has come down to us today, everything is proceeding in our time according to divine ordering. "These things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken" (@John 19: 36). When the Scriptures are assailed by so-called critics, with their "lanterns and
{9}
torches and weapons", the Spirit of God shows in John that Scripture is true and that it cannot be broken (@John 10: 35); that what God is doing is according to what is written.
J.A.W. Referring to the lanterns and torches, do you have in mind the literature, secular and religious, which has expression in the world today, and which sometimes finds its place in the minds of the saints?
J.T. That is the idea. The Spirit of God is here speaking ironically of the boasted light of modern science as to the things of God. The leaders have torches and lanterns and weapons; with the weapons, they will persecute. The weapons go with the lanterns. The Lord says to Peter, "Put the sword into the sheath". *You* are not to use such a weapon. Doing the will of God may involve persecution. The Lord here says, "The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?" Judas and his band have their lanterns and torches and weapons to do harm to Him who is doing the will of God.
J.A.W. Would you say that truth is followed up in Paul before Agrippa when he says, "Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision" (@Acts 26: 19). The light found its way into Paul's heart?
J.T. Yes. There was testimony to him in a two-fold way -- light from heaven and a voice from heaven; and both the light and the voice evidently increased in his mind as he progressed in the truth.
J.L.F. Would the fact that Judas stood with them be an effort to bolster up their position?
J.T. No doubt; he was there unrelentingly.
J.A.W. Thinking of our young men, if the lanterns and the torches are not effective in extinguishing this loyalty to Christ, the weapons may come into effect in putting some into prisons and concentration camps. Is that the idea?
{10}
J.T. Yes; the weapons attached to the lanterns and torches. Then following upon that, Peter's action in using the sword is to bring out what some christians are doing. "Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and smote the bondman of the high priest and cut off his right ear; and the bondman's name was Malchus". So that we must not use the sword. How sad that a christian should cut off a man's right ear -- that by which he should hear the gospel! The Lord's remark to him settles the matter as to the use of the sword; the truth requires that we should *not* use it. He says, "Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?" That is the ground we take. It is a question of the will of God. Nothing happens without the will of God, and if we are attacked, it is for us to take the attitude of sufferers instead of using the sword. "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (@Romans 8: 36, 37).
J.L.F. Has the cup here reference to the cross?
J.T. Yes. It is a question of the will of God. That is the point. The Father had given Jesus a cup to drink. He says, "Not as *I* will, but as *thou* wilt" (@Matthew 26: 39). Nothing happens without being in accord with the will of God, so that, if it entails suffering for us, we must accept it.
J.L.F. I was wondering how the thought of the cup here would link up with John's line?
J.T. It is suffering for the will of God. The crucifixion was in mind; the will of God required the death of Christ. But a triumphant character marks His death in chapters 18 and 19. Although the Sufferer, He is supreme throughout. Alas! human hatred was there, but its violent stroke only brought forth the blood and water from the side of Christ. There was there provided
{11}
for faith the means of the settlement of every moral issue which had arisen through the working of sin in men.
D.R. Would the Lord's remark to Peter here be the basis of maintaining faith and a good conscience today?
J.T. Yes. That is what the Lord is bringing out here. He is weaving the fabric of the dispensation in directing that the sword is to be sheathed. The Father's will is the supreme matter for us. If it entails persecution we suffer. "Bless those that curse you; pray for those who use you despitefully" (@Luke 6: 28).
J.A.W. Referring to the ear again: it is the medium through which truth enters into the mind. The saints of God, as coming under the authority of Christ, are to see that the light of the gospel should reach the ears of all men.
J.T. Luke says that the ear was healed, but it does not say that here. Things here are running on to the end just as they are. Peter's act, or the effect of it, is allowed to stand, and Peter does not get recovered here. The effect of adverse things is allowed to stand to the end.
J.A.W. That principle runs down to our day.
J.T. Well, it is the most solemn thing that certain things are allowed to stand. "Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still; and let the filthy make himself filthy still" (@Revelation 22: 11).
R.B. I suppose in the eyes of the world Peter's act would be an act of righteous belligerency, but in the presence of the Lord it is rebuked.
J.T. It is the will of God taking the place of the sword; and this implies that suffering is accepted instead of having recourse to vengeance. The young men say to the authorities, It is a question of the will of God. If it is the will of God that His people should now take the sword, they will do it, but then the will of
{12}
God does *not* allow it. The Lord Himself plainly intimates this in the chapter before us.
C.A.M. At the time of the Reformation the sword was used by some who in measure supported the truth, but they ignored the Lord's instruction in our chapter.
J.T. Yes. Christianity is developed in suffering, in persons accepting the will of God. The light, as God furnishes it by the Spirit, accompanies that.
R.R.T. Two statements of the Lord in this chapter connect beautifully: "The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?" verse 11, and, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought" verse 36.
J.T. That is right. The Lord in directing Peter to put the sword into the sheath is saving him from discrediting the dispensation He was inaugurating.
R.R.T. Thus the Lord Himself becomes the example in this respect for the whole dispensation.
J.T. That is what I thought we might see in this chapter -- "the good confession" (@1 Timothy 6: 13).
A.D.S. Mohammedanism springs out of the use of the sword, does it not?
J.T. Yes; by military conquest it spread through the Near East to India, towards the West into Eastern Europe, and through North Africa up into Spain. What a great contrast to what we are considering!
A.D. S. In connection with the matter of confession, I was wondering if, for the sake of our younger brethren, we might not get some help out of @Romans 10: 8, 9, "the word of faith, which we preach: that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord". One had thought that confession was initial or elementary, but in the light in which you are presenting it, it would seem that it is something to be *carried through*. Am I right in that?
J.T. Yes, confession saves you, the confession with your mouth. The idea is to confess in the presence of
{13}
the enemy. God defends that, He defends the confessors.
J.A.W. It would appear that what you have just said in respect to the ear not being restored makes the present moment a very solemn one. The truth is out, and the present ministry which they have refused means cutting off really.
J.T. That is right. The judicial dealings on the part of God in Revelation bring that out, that if one goes on and on refusing the truth God may say in effect, The end for you has come, you are filthy and you will be filthy, (@Revelation 22: 11). It is a very solemn matter. Here it is opposition taking the form of apostasy in Judas and his band, and everything is just left as it is. But those who are real and faithful are going on with confession. The Lord is making clear the position, that His kingdom is not of this world. It must have been a wholly new thing to Pilate; doubtless he had never heard of a kingdom not of this world; but the Lord described His kingdom in this way. People today do not understand the Lord's people, why they cannot do as others. The answer is simple -- they belong to Christ's heavenly kingdom. They are not of this world as He is not of this world.
J.L.F. It was a matter in relation to which the Lord had to continually adjust the disciples, was it not? In one instance two of them wanted to call down fire from heaven to consume certain ones, (@Luke 9: 54).
J.T. Quite so. Then the following facts here are to be noted: Peter's denial of the Lord, and the high priesthood in Caiaphas, to whom Annas was father-in-law; and, in keeping with this gospel, the liberty and dignity which marks the Lord. There is also the brutal unfairness among those present who should have been the guardians of righteousness: "One of the officers who stood by gave a blow on the face to Jesus, saying, Answerest thou the high priest thus?" verse 22. And
{14}
not a word from the high priest as to this cruel action. He smites the Lord of glory. The Lord says, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?" verse 23. That is another principle: witness in relation to judicial procedure. The chapter contemplates that the high priesthood, though used by the devil now, had yet divine authority attached to it. Indeed Caiaphas had already prophesied, as we are told here, and that is another thing; it was an important truth directly relative to the Lord Jesus, that one man must die for the people. It was the time of one man dying for the people. How solemnly impressive is this group of circumstances!
C.A.M. It would be almost like Balaam's prophecy, would you say?
J.T. It is of that character. It is remarkable how things have turned around in modern times. A certain system long opposed to the truth is now contending for some features of it. In Europe one high up in the system made lately a striking statement -- that no blood is of any moral value but the blood of Christ. God would help even such a man contending for such a great truth. And so as to what @John 18 presents, God could, a little while earlier, use a man to prophesy the truth, who is now condemning Christ to death.
C.A.M. No doubt some are suffering for Christ's sake in the so-called systems.
J.T. God has in some sense a testimony there. And there is in them what God owns as responsible; thus what the Lord Jesus said to the cleansed leper applies: "go, shew thyself to the priest, ... for a testimony to them" (@Matthew 8: 4).
J.A.W. But is it not true that many of the so-called preachers of today deny the divinity of Christ? In other words, they give "a blow on the face to Jesus".
J.T. They do indeed; but there are others who confess the truth of His Person.
{15}
P.H. What is the significance of the Catholic church bringing out a new revision of the Scriptures just lately and putting it into the hands of the people?
J.T. It bears on what we are remarking. I understand the New Testament only has been revised. But the general position remains unchanged and the judgment announced will not fail, so that @Revelation 16: 19 says, "And great Babylon was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath". For the moment other things are more prominent but the final judgment of "the great harlot" is certain.
To proceed with our chapter -- verses 28 - 32: "They lead therefore Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium, and it was early morn. And *they* entered not into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but eat the passover". They are carrying on religiously in spite of all these things. "Pilate therefore went out to them and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man? They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to thee. Pilate therefore said to them, Take him, ye, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not permitted to us to put any one to death; that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke, signifying what death he should die". This signifies that the *word* of Jesus comes into these circumstances; it is not a matter of chance, the word of Jesus must come to pass. It is a question of divine plan, not accidental at all. Then the Lord is in the presence of Pilate, and the fact comes out that Pilate abstractly is ready to do what is right; but he is influenced by the religious element. This indicates the uncertainty of the governing powers, and thus that our eyes must ever be on God. The best are apt to be governed by political motives. However, we must be thankful for any government that is ready to do right.
{16}
J.L.F. Would you say that according to John we cannot trust anything that is outward? Here is a disciple denying Jesus and another delivering Him up. Would you say that the high priest in his position, acting as he does, and the Roman governor walking forward and backward in uncertainty, testify that there is nothing outward to be trusted?
J.T. That is what the chapter presents. The next chapter records that Pilate scourged Jesus and brought Him out clothed in a purple robe put on Him in derision, saying, "I find in him no fault whatever", verse 4; so that government is seen broken down. Although Pilate had right thoughts at the beginning, he finally gave way to the Jews and delivered Jesus to be crucified. Thus nothing of man can be trusted. But a government may be trustworthy for a little while according to the will of God, and we can thank Him for this. The prayers of the saints have a great deal to do with it.
R.R.T. But on the other side and opposed to all that cannot be trusted, the word of Jesus is fulfilled. That is going through.
J.T. That should be steadily in view.
C.S.P. He bears witness to the truth.
J.T. The conversation in the verses we read between the Lord Jesus and Pilate brings this out. The character of this dispensation enters into it. The Lord says, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence". It is not an ordinary kingdom coming down from an old dispensation, but another order of things entirely, not of this world at all.
C.S.P. Would that be seen in His baptism? That is, He is baptised, and all men come to Him. A man cannot receive anything except it be given him from above.
J.T. Just so, that is right. The heavenly order of
{17}
things is coming into evidence in the 'good confession' of the Lord Jesus.
H.G. Do you think that the Lord had this in mind when He said in @John 11: 7 - 9, "Let us go into Judaea again"? The disciples said, "Rabbi, even but now the Jews sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?" The Lord says, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world".
J.T. Yes, and He is not afraid of the possibilities. Thomas says, "Let *us* also go, that we may die with Him", and of course martyrdom was in mind. But He went into Judaea nevertheless. He faces whatever the will of God requires. That is the great point now -- accept whatever the will of God requires.
D.R. Would you help us as to how we may be freed on the ground of a good conscience from taking the sword? There is the tendency on the part of some young men to make a choice of some certain service so that they might not have to use a sword.
J.T. The question of how that works out in Canada, for instance, as to the question of conscience, is very poor, I understand. In certain districts a labour camp is the only alternative for a man who wants to keep a good conscience before God and men. One may say, I will select a certain service and ask that I be put down to medical work; but there is no guarantee in that, that you will be saved from taking a sword. That is your own device. The only right alternative for faith is to accept what non-combatant work the government allocates to you, and leave it with God.
D.R. Making a selection which *may* involve the use of the sword is taking ourselves out of the path of God's will.
J.T. I think it is compromise and one may have self in view: perhaps wages or something that is more
{18}
respectable. If I am on that line I am sure to suffer. The simple acceptance of whatever God allows, providing I can keep a good conscience, is the thing. If it is a question of conscience, let it be conscience, not compromise, because conscience is the point -- "a good confession".
J.A.W. On that particular point, what lay before the three young men in the book of Daniel was the fiery furnace. They accepted that as the will of God for them.
J.T. It is very pronounced; they tell the king what they *could not* do. They were very definite in stating that.
W.T. Did not something go before that? There were other princes that had gone out of Judah beforehand.
J.T. These three and Daniel seem to be God's best. In a crisis God always has those who are equal to it. The idea of a man of God is one who represents Him in a crisis. These four mentioned in the book of Daniel, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, seem to be the divine provision for the situations that arose; and they shine.
J.A.W. Coming down to our day, would you say that Timothy was a man that stood out in a crisis? He was a young man addressed as a man of God.
J.T. That is the idea. He is about the only one called a man of God in the New Testament. He served in a broken state of things, as Elijah and Elisha did. They are outstanding men of God. In connection with them you get more references to men of God than anywhere else. It is a state of defection that specially brings out the need for men of God.
R.R.T. I think what you say about making a compromise is important. Was that not a reason for the failure of Peter here? "Peter was standing with them and warming himself", verse 18. That savours of
{19}
making a compromise with the enemy to make the path easier. It is bound to end in failure, is it not?
J.T. Yes; what comes out in the chapter is that John was known to the high priest, and through his influence Peter got into the palace. Then Peter is warming himself with the others. So that if I ask for a certain work or regiment that is a little more respectable, but perhaps brings me into worldly associations, I shall suffer. As sure as possible, if I make a compromise and take myself out of the hands of God, I get into circumstances that occasion damage. That is what happens here.
R.R.T. The Lord's word to Peter was, "The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?" Peter had not profited by that word, had he?
J.T. He had not, and he is allowed to go through here as a type of a person who denies the Lord. He has to suffer to remind us that we must not resort to human influence to reach an end, because we take ourselves out of the hands of God and thus the enemy has an advantage.
H.G. What the Lord did in accepting the cup is the only standard for us.
Ques. Just why is Peter found with the sword in the company of Christ? Do you think that would be because of defection?
J.T. The answer is in @Luke 22: 35 - 38; but that passage shows that the disciples did not understand the Lord's mind. His remarks vividly told them that the protection His presence with them afforded was to cease, and hence that for a while at least they would have to see to themselves. The means the Lord expressed were to be understood by the principles He had taught and exemplified, but they would be obliged to exercise them without His aid. They regarded His words literally, hence Peter's error in smiting the high priest's bondman. Their warfare was
{20}
to be spiritual, as Paul teaches in @Ephesians 6 and elsewhere.
J.A.W. Would your point be illustrated in @2 Kings 7 as to Samaria, where Elisha is? It is surrounded by the king of Syria's army; but the Syrians hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, and the noise of a great host. They flee and the lepers find their camp with plenty of food, silver, gold and garments. That is divine help. It is not a sword, is it?
J.T. That is right. The inquiry is constantly made of the young brothers, What would you do if your mother were attacked by the enemy? But God is left out. The chapter before us shows the Lord Jesus being attacked and Peter uses the sword to defend Him, but the Lord told him to "put the sword into the sheath".
C.S.P. Is that the attitude of the Lord in this gospel, that He is receiving the things? He is not taking them into His hands.
J.T. Yes; He accepted the cup as expressing the will of the Father.
In considering Pilate we are out of the realm of the high priest and in the presence of the representative of the four monarchies, the representative of government. The Lord says to him, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above" (@John 19: 11). Earlier it is said, "Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence". God is stressing what the Lord says here. It should be kept before our eyes in the boldest type so that it should govern us at the present time.
M.D.F. Would you tell us why men in general did not understand the Lord?
{21}
J.T. John's gospel certainly makes it simple. He came as light into the world: "In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not" (@John 1: 4, 5). That is the connection with all that follows as to why men could not understand.
M.D.F. Did the Lord not indicate who would receive Him and who would hear Him?
J.T. He did. In the opening section of John's gospel you get the whole position. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men". Not light for angels but for men. It was not a torch or a lantern, but the full blaze of light divine in a Man, a Man among men. Surely everybody sees this! John, however, points out that everyone does *not* see it. The light appears in darkness and the darkness apprehends it not. Then, "There was a man sent from God, his name John. He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him. *He* was not the light, but that he might witness concerning the light. The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man" (@John 1: 6 - 9). Light shines on him, but he is not letting it in. Then we are told, "He came to his own, and his own received him not". The Lord was in the world, made by Him, and the world did not know Him; "but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". "But of God", that is the secret. It is the work of God, and nothing else will do; no matter how learned and energetic you may be, you must have the work of God underneath or you are dark and unfruitful.
C.H.H. Do all these circumstances you have been speaking of form a kind of area in which we bear witness of the truth? The final word here from the Lord is, "that I might bear witness to the truth".
{22}
J.T. That is the thought, we must stand by the truth. It shows the terrible darkness we have to do with. The Lord says, "I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth", verse 37. Thus we too are here, and we too must stand by the truth. That is what comes out. Pilate says, "What is truth? And having said this he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault whatever in him", verse 38. He did not wait for the answer. He wanted to know what was truth, but the truth was there before his eyes, and spoken in his ears.
What comes out in chapters 18 and 19 is the triumph of Christ on moral lines. He "delivered up" His spirit (@John 19: 30). It is a question of *power*, they do not take His life from Him. It is a question of the will of God, men can do nothing but what God wills. So if we stand by the truth, God will stand by us. That is the whole position.
D.R. So the Lord says, "I have been born for this", verse 37. That enters into believers¬ households. Their children are born in relation to the testimony.
J.T. Surely. You baptise your children and bring them up in the truth. They are said to be holy, (@1 Corinthians 7: 14).
R.R.T. Would you indicate for us just briefly what is implied in the Lord's words, "My kingdom"?
J.T. It would be a question of what it is in a moral sense now. His kingdom as the Son of David would be an earthly one, which will take form later, and then the sword will be used. We are told in @Revelation 19: 11 - 20 how He comes out of heaven Himself, riding upon a white horse. Many crowns are on His head; "And the armies which are in the heaven followed him upon white horses, clad in white, pure, fine linen. ... And the beast was taken, and the false prophet that was with him, who wrought the signs before him by
{23}
which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast, and those that worship his image. Alive were both cast into the lake of fire which bums with brimstone". That is what is going to take place, but He is saying something different here. It is an order of things purely heavenly, and that is the difficulty; but we are to understand. We do not take the sword. We understand, but the average man does not understand. It is just a puzzle to him. He thinks we must be out of our minds. We must get to the basis of the position as the Lord Jesus unfolds it in the passage before us now, that He is going to die. There are the representatives of the four monarchies, and we have to tell them *why* we cannot do this and that; and pray to God that they may recognise our consciences.
R.R.T. Then the path for us is to walk in the light of what is involved in "My kingdom" in contrast to all the kingdoms of the world.
J.T. Yes. It will work out in that way. It is His kingdom, which, as the Lord says here, is not of this world. It is a real kingdom, nevertheless, taking character from Himself in His *present* circumstances: that is, rejected by this world, put to death and not resisting; nor did His servants fight on His behalf.
C.H.H. John connects the kingdom in Revelation with *tribulation and patience*.
C.S.P. Do we not get the thought of power in connection with the kingdom, sufficient to meet the whole situation?
J.T. We do, but it is *grace* reigning, as Romans teaches. There is infinite power, that is, the Holy Spirit, but it is exercised in grace -- for the salvation of men, not for their destruction. Men need to be instructed as to it. It adapts itself to the gospel period. It is not the time of vengeance. So that what has been referred to as to patience is helpful: "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and
{24}
patience, in Jesus" (@Revelation 1: 9). The footnote says the words 'kingdom', 'tribulation', 'patience', are brought together by one article. The preposition 'in' implies power in the position. This statement of John illustrates what the Lord means by 'my kingdom' at the present time. It is of Himself, marked by tribulation and patience. He is now at the right hand of God, all power given to Him, but His servants and saints in His kingdom down here are marked by the features that marked Him as rejected and crucified in this world. He did not use the sword, nor do they. It is the time of 'patient endurance'.
A.D.S. Would you say that, while John presents the truth of the Son of God, the principle of 'my kingdom' is involved in what Matthew presents in regard to the transfiguration? The Lord says, "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom" (@Matthew 16: 28).
J.T. That refers to coming glory, but the appearance of it was intended to affect the disciples in view of their testimony and ministry; thus it bears on what is before us. The time for the kingdom of the Son of man had come, but instead of entering into it publicly, He was rejected and crucified. This agrees with the Lord's statement to Pilate, "If my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence". There is a new order of things. Paul's epistles bring out the full thought, but the Lord is showing here briefly that His kingdom was of a wholly new order. Pilate represented government and hence the Lord thus spoke to him. He did not say this to the high priest. The Jewish high priesthood had some authority as the Lord appeared before it, but that has come to an end; and its successors in our day have no authority over the people of God. We are to come out
{25}
from among them. But we recognise governments. Therefore the Lord explains to Pilate the new position into which He was entering, and of which christianity is the fulness.
C.H.H. As to your remark that Timothy was to lay hold of eternal life, we are reminded that eternal life was greatly emphasised among us some years ago.
J.T. Just so. In its present realisation the circle of the saints is involved. This implies a living state of things. The understanding of these great matters depends largely on our possession of them in some measure. In christianity we have the blessings offered in the gospel, and as having them the Spirit enables us to understand them.
J.L.F. The things themselves being there help the authorities to understand the statements that are being made.
J.T. These verses tell us of the conversation between the Lord Jesus and Pilate, Pilate being thus owned of heaven. The governments of today have the same place, and therefore we have to do with them; we pray for them. We do not pray for the priesthoods of human religion, but we pray for the authorities. The Lord is here telling Pilate of the new form the kingdom was taking, and hence we as His followers should have liberty to testify of it in our day to the authorities as they inquire from us.
{26}
CHRIST'S KINGDOM NOT OF THIS WORLD (2)
@Romans 12: 9 - 21; @Romans 13: 1 - 10; @Romans 16: 25 - 27
J.T. Reverting to @John 18, the Lord, as we noted this morning, asserted that His kingdom is not of this world. He said, "If my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought". That is, there would be combat as of old, as in David's day, and there will be such combat again, according to Revelation, in view of the establishment of Christ's earthly kingdom. What He alludes to in 'my kingdom' has to be understood from His own service, and that of His apostles; and the precepts of it would come from Himself.
It is thought that Romans should be taken up to pursue this thought, that we may learn what is becoming to Christ's kingdom, it being not of this world. Similar instructions and exhortations to those in Romans are found in Matthew and Luke. In stressing the Lord's authority as over against the authority of the world -- what was said 'to the ancients' -- the simile in the end of @Matthew 7 of a man who hears the Lord's words and does them is of great practical importance. The Lord likens him to one who; built his house on a rock, which stood in spite of adverse elements. It would be instruction especially for the Jewish remnant. But Romans contemplates an upward trend, beginning with basic conditions here below, unfolded through the great servant of the dispensation, the apostle Paul. Contemplating the mystery as seen in the last passage read, the gospel is unfolded in the epistle up to the end of chapter 8 in a most striking manner, finishing with the triumph that belongs to those who receive the gospel as divinely presented. It begins in verse 35, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? According as it is
{27}
written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (@Romans 8: 35 - 39).
That is victory that accrues from the gospel; God known in love. Nothing can separate us from the love of God, and who shall separate us from the love of Christ? The position is immutable. And then we have three chapters which account for the promises made to God's ancient people. By this section we are taught that the gentiles as a testimony on the earth shall be set aside and all Israel shall be saved and set up here as a nation. Then in chapter 12 the apostle resumes his direct instruction to christians, and the principles intended to govern them are plainly stated. The kingdom the Lord alludes to in @John 18 is worked out in the state of those who have part in the fruit of the gospel. The gospels of Matthew and Luke link on with the Jewish state of things as it then was, the remnant on right principles, in view of their part in the assembly; but Paul starts in this book, which is the great gospel epistle, in view of the mystery mentioned in the last paragraph. So that we have an *up* line in this epistle which is pursued in later ministry, particularly in Colossians and Ephesians, all tending to bring out the heavenly condition and setting of the present dispensation.
R.R.T. The connection between what you are saying and what we had this morning would link @Romans 8: 36 with @John 18: 11: "According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter;"
{28}
and, "Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?" Would that be the working out in us of what is seen in its perfection in the Lord in @John 18?
J.T. That is what the Lord has in mind; we are to be conformed to what He was Himself here. He would set Peter right as to the sword -- it should be put into its sheath. He does not say, Destroy it. The time will come when all military implements will be destroyed; but the Lord did not direct Peter to destroy the sword, but to put it into its sheath, because it will be used again in regard to the earth. In the meantime christians come into something not known before, hid in God, according to the end of the epistle to the Romans.
D.R. Is that the difference between the kingdom now -- the kingdom in mystery -- and the kingdom existing outwardly and dispensationally in a coming day, when the sword will again be used as alluded to this morning?
J.T. That is what I understand. The Lord said, 'my kingdom', not David's kingdom. But later He shall have "the throne of David his father; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages" (@Luke 1: 32, 33).
D.R. So the statement that "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come" (@Revelation 11: 15) implies that war will be resumed.
J.T. Quite so. It is Christ's kingdom as generally presented in prophetic scriptures. It fits in down here; but the Lord said to Pilate, "my kingdom", and "my servants;" it is largely a question now of attachment to Christ, and of being governed, not only by His commandments, but by His ways. In truth you can hardly make it intelligible to men, and that in itself involves suffering. That is what @Romans 8: 36 provides for. "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long". It is a
{29}
question of love for Christ. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" That, I think, we might connect with "my kingdom" and "my servants" in @John 18. The characteristic believer is devoted to Him and on His side as to what He says and what He does; to him Christ is "everything, and in all" (@Colossians 3: 11).
D.R. That helps as to the *present* working out of Christ's kingdom, involving suffering and reproach, with glory resting upon it.
J.T. It is a question of what works out from heaven. We may say of any kingdom that it is a question of what develops naturally. Christ's kingdom works according to His present circumstances. In His most trusted servant He brings it out peculiarly. All the apostolic epistles work out this great thought of His kingdom, but the Lord speaks of Paul as "an elect vessel unto me", and I think the trend of Paul's ministry as to Christ's kingdom is in accord with @John 18.
J.A.W. Is one right in thinking that what works out in "my kingdom" is what you get defined as the kingdom of God? "For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit" (@Romans 14: 17).
J.T. Yes. It includes the features of the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the Son of man, etc. I think the moral power lies in our attachment to Christ, and in following up what He is and what He says.
A.D.S. The book of Acts closes with the statement that the apostle "remained two whole years in his own hired lodging, and received all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom unhinderedly" (@Acts 28: 31).
J.T. Well, that is a formal declaration of the kingdom for public testimony. He preached the kingdom of God. It is what God is morally. The kingdom of God stands related to *the Holy Spirit down here*. What
{30}
we are dealing with includes all that, but we are considering Christ's kingdom, which for the saints involves attachment and devotedness to Him in the period of His rejection. It works out in loyalty and correspondence to Him. @Romans 8 brings out the love of Christ. It enters into what Paul is speaking of; but it is on the line of suffering, running into the thought of the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. "It is Christ who has died, but rather has been also raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (@Romans 8: 34 - 37). So the position is invulnerable.
Then we have the matter of the promises to Israel, which is a deposit among those classified in chapter 8 as the subjects of the love of Christ. @Romans 9, 10 and 11 are a sort of trust -- His earthly people held in the affections of those who love Christ. So that the whole testimony of God is carried down with us, as sharers of this personal love of Christ, and of the love of God in Christ, from which nothing can separate us. It is a question whether we can take in the whole scope of the testimony and carry it down. This parenthesis in the epistle is in full keeping with what is worked out in us in a practical way in relation to the gospel. Chapter 12 resumes this subject.
A.D.S. You say the position in invulnerable?
J.T. Quite so. It cannot be overcome; therefore things can be entrusted to us.
C.H.H. There is a contrast in @Psalm 44, from which the quotation in verse 36 is made: the psalmist speaks of pushing down the adversaries of Israel, but
{31}
*we* are to accept persecution, and to become more than conquerors through Him who has loved us; it is the character of this dispensation in contrast to that of the old.
J.T. Yes, we are fixed in an invulnerable position in chapter 8. It is a question of the love of God and the love of Christ, and instructions as to a state in us working out to the mystery as in chapter 16, with an upward or heavenly trend.
R.R.T. In @2 Samuel 23 we have in David a contrast to Christ as seen in @John 18. In the former the mighty men used the sword, being attached to David; but now there is attachment to Christ and His kingdom, and the sword is not to be used; this feature represents Christ in suffering.
J.T. That is the idea. "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long". The Lord's followers have no swords; it is a question of accepting the will of God and whatever it involves.
R.R.T. His servants take character from the King.
J.T. Quite so. I would like the brethren to grasp the position of those three chapters, because they refer to earlier testimonies that are to be carried down with us, held as it were in abeyance, not put into a pigeon-hole, but held in love. So that Paul says, "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit, that I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart, for I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to flesh; who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises; whose are the fathers; and of whom, as according to flesh, is the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen" (@Romans 9: 1 - 5).
This passage shows how this testimony of God is
{32}
kept in love. Paul goes so far as to say he had wished to be a curse from Christ for those who once had it and will have it again -- the Jews.
C.A.M. Would you say that the doxology at the end of the three chapters would show that they form part of "all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" that are put into that great depository at the close of the epistle?
J.T. Yes. The apostle, you can see, advances in a worshipful spirit as he proceeds with this great subject of the promises to the fathers.
J.A.W. Is it the thought that when the Lord was here and was rejected by His own, His kingdom was rejected too; but that now His kingdom is finding a practical expression in the hearts, minds and lives of the saints who form the assembly; and that what comes out in the three chapters you refer to is cherished in the assembly now?
J.T. That is the truth exactly. So that we come out in the character of Christ as sufferers, that which marked Him from the outset. Nothing is lost sight of; all is in keeping with the light of the kingdom of Christ, according to what He said to Pilate, "my kingdom is not of this world". It is a new thing altogether; the natural mind of man does not grasp it, but it is the character and qualities of Christ worked out in those that are true to Him as formed in the light of the gospel.
J.A.W. Is that why we have such an extended list of worthies in chapter 16, persons in whom those features were being demonstrated? "In the Lord", and "in Christ", are said of several.
J.T. The apostle does not mention specifically every saint at Rome. There was evidently a large number, but he mentions about twenty. They represent the community that he had in mind; they are to be saluted.
{33}
A.D.S. You remarked that all the dispensations have come down to us. Will you say a little more about that?
J.T. It is in @1 Corinthians 10: 11, "Now all these things happened to them as types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come". "For our admonition" -- that fits in with what is before us in @Romans 12 and 13; quality in us is in mind, the saints involving trustworthiness, those who hold and cherish what is of God.
J.A.W. I understood you to say that the doxology at the end of chapter 11 suggests that nothing of God is lost, that all is treasured in the assembly now.
J.T. Well, that would imply the last paragraph in the book -- which treats of the mystery. Chapter 12 resumes the instruction directly for christians. It is to develop *quality* in us, fitting us for Christ's kingdom. Chapter 12 works out the qualities of Christ in us, so that "my kingdom", as He calls it, is seen in its features. We begin with *love*, verse 9, which I think is appropriate. "Let love be unfeigned". In @Romans 13: 10 we have "love therefore is the whole law;" so that love is the great basic thought. From this point we may be able to touch the mystery.
C.S.P. So the kingdom now is the kingdom of the Son of His love?
J.T. That is a touching designation of it. By it you are directed to the book of Proverbs, where you get subject matter for contemplation for your whole life. Solomon spoke 3,000 proverbs; we have about 300, but they are sufficient to give us an inlet into wisdom as known in Christ, so that we should become wisdom's children.
C.A.M. Do you think that love has such a great place because all returns to God? That would be the suitable result of all these wonderful ways.
J.T. "For of him, and through him, and for him
{34}
are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen" (@Romans 11: 36).
D.R. Is the Father or God in mind here?
J.T. It is God. The verses we have before us give the working out of love in the most practical way.
J.S.C. When the kingdom is delivered up to God it is still the same kingdom?
J.T. You are alluding to @1 Corinthians 15: 24 - 28, "Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him who is God and Father; when he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that is annulled is death. For he has put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he says that all things are put in subjection, it is evident that it is except him who put all things in subjection to him. But when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all". The divine kingdom has various phases, as we have been noting: this is what it is at "the end". There will, no doubt, be certain eliminations as of features which had a provisional character; we have in the passage quoted the *abiding* kingdom, what subsists in the eternal state of things. What the Lord calls "my kingdom" will, I suppose, merge in this. The Son uses the kingdom to subdue everything to Himself; then He delivers it up "to him who is God and Father". The Son Himself is placed in subjection. All is perfect and yet the principle of kingdom remains -- "that God may be all in all".
C.H.H. The apostle makes a distinction between "love" and "brotherly love", verses 9, 10. Peter does the same: "in brotherly love love" (@2 Peter 1: 7).
J.T. That would save us from personal preferences. Love is of God; brotherly love is the form it takes
{35}
among brethren, but there is what checks it so that we should not love certain persons unduly. You are to have brotherly love, but have love in it.
R.B. Reproach and suffering would be marks that identify with the testimony.
J.T. "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long". You can see what it is for sheep to be herded in a market or a slaughter-house, about to be killed -- that is the figure. The Lord "was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers, and he opened not his mouth" (@Isaiah 53: 7). That is the position; thus we do not take the sword and defend ourselves but take up the idea of suffering in the path of the will of God.
C.S.P. Would that come out with the little maid in @2 Kings 5? Naaman was a conqueror, but she was *more* than a conqueror.
J.T. Yes, she was more than a conqueror because she, as a captive, overcame resentment of her captor; she was possessed of evangelical sentiment toward Naaman. There is deep *feeling* in the wish, "Would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria!" (@2 Kings 5: 3).
C.A.M. There was an impression made upon the Ethiopian eunuch through reading @Isaiah 53. It must have impressed him that there is something greater than war with the sword. His baptism was in the light of Christ's suffering as presented by Isaiah; and, no doubt, he would work this out in returning; the sufferings of Christ would remain before him.
J.T. He went away rejoicing; he was left, Philip being caught away by the Spirit; and the eunuch *went on his way rejoicing*. What happened when he went back to Ethiopia we are not told, but you would expect that christianity would be represented there, for Christ's life was taken from the earth -- that is what was presented to him. That is the basis really of the life of the saints
{36}
of the heavenly kingdom of which the Lord speaks.
A.D.S. In @Isaiah 53: 7 it says, "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers, and he opened not his mouth". In @Acts 8: 32, when Philip comes to the eunuch the scripture which he read was, "He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in presence of him that shears him, thus he opens not his mouth". There is a difference in the wording.
J.T. It is because the quotation is from the Septuagint; but it conveys the sense of the truth. The quotations in the New Testament are generally from that version.
C.H.H. In a practical way do not these principles come into our circumstances constantly? For instance, we may be defrauded; it is not a question of the sword, but in our circumstances would it not be right to accept the loss instead of contending?
J.T. That is the spirit of the truth which we are considering now. We shall see how the Spirit of God goes into detail, and it begins with love. "Let love be unfeigned; abhorring evil; cleaving to good: as to brotherly love, kindly affectioned towards one another: as to honour, each taking the lead in paying it to the other: as to diligent zealousness, not slothful; in spirit fervent; serving the Lord. As regards hope, rejoicing: as regards tribulation, enduring: as regards prayer, persevering: distributing to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality. Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not. Rejoice with those that rejoice, weep with those that weep. Have the same respect one for another, not minding high things, but going along with the lowly; be not wise in your own eyes: recompensing to no one evil for evil: providing things honest before all men: if possible, as far as depends on you, living in peace with all men; not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it is written,
{37}
Vengeance belongs to me, *I* will recompense, saith the Lord. If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" (@Romans 12: 9 - 21).
These verses represent the truth or law governing Christ's kingdom. It does not fit in at all with what the nations have to do, as the next chapter shows. They must have swords and other military weapons, but the kingdom in which we are precludes that altogether. "If thine enemy ... thirst, give him drink". The real test for us is the working out of this in present conditions, because it seems to most to be foolish and this in itself is reproach. But we have to accept it; to be truly His disciples we must follow what the Lord speaks of as His kingdom, what He is working out. It is a provisional kingdom that will come to an end as the assembly is translated, but in the meantime it is carried out and worked out in suffering. This is not intelligible to the natural mind, and this fact in itself causes persecution.
R.R.T. Looking at these features that you are speaking of as principles of "my kingdom", we come to understand in a better way what the Lord means in saying, "My kingdom is not of this world". They are not features which pertain to any kingdom of this world.
J.T. So that as you come before the tribunals with this in your heart you are governed by another thing altogether from what men are going on with. We are foolish in their eyes, and we have to depend on God to enable us to bear the reproach and to make ourselves commendable to all.
W.F. Paul's ministry in Corinth sets out the same principles that are seen here. He says, "Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded?" (@1 Corinthians 6: 7).
J.L.F. So that the principles that belong to the
{38}
Lord's kingdom would affect us in relation to one another as brethren, in relation to all men, and in relation to our enemies.
J.T. With that in your heart when you go before the tribunals, and they say you must have a sword at least for an emergency -- you say, No, and they cannot understand it. It is a hard thing to be misunderstood and ridiculed publicly, but that attaches to the position. This is morally the greatest thing in the universe, and it is being worked out in the saints now. Are we great enough to take it on?
P.H. So that generally sheep have no horns.
J.T. That involves the principle. Sheep are characteristically passive.
H.G. Thus they represent the kingdom of Christ as He witnessed before Pilate; He was there the exemplification of these features, and He demonstrates this truth in His people now -- is that what we are to understand?
J.T. That is exactly the point.
The next thing in this section of Romans is that the ruling powers represented in Pilate are brought in again in chapter 13. "Let every soul be subject to the authorities that are above him", verse 1. Pilate is brought in again to show how the government of the world is recognised by christians as it was by Christ. He said to Pilate, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not give to thee from above" (@John 19: 11). Therefore the Lord submitted to him, and now we should submit to the authorities that are above us. We take a lowly place, they are *above* us. But this of course implies, as said elsewhere, that God is above *them*, and hence that we must obey *Him* in all circumstances.
J.A.W. They are above us in so far as they do not interfere with the rights of Christ over us. What I had in mind was that the government says, You are a
{39}
citizen, then you must take a sword. But you say, I cannot, because I am under a higher authority, under the lordship of Christ.
J.T. Well, that is what you have in your heart. You can answer in a very seemly way, as the Lord did. You recognise them in their own department; they are not mere politicians, they are set up by God. You can tell them, I pray for you, but I have something else, the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is not of this world, and I belong to that. It is almost impossible to get an unconverted man to grasp it. Therefore, you are ridiculed; he may be a 'gentleman', and would not say much to you, but that is what is in his mind -- that you are to be pitied, as foolish. That is the suffering side; and of course it may extend to severe treatment.
H.G. What bearing has the word of Paul to the Colossians that Christ is Head of all principality and authority?
J.T. That belongs to the mystery seen in Colossians and Ephesians. That is going to come out presently. Meantime He is on His Father's throne; He is not on His own throne yet. It is a provisional state of things, it is only for a time. The Lord is on the Father's throne instead of His own. His operations are in connection with the assembly and the gospel. The Father governs the universe. He "is over all, and through all, and in us all" (@Ephesians 4: 6).
H.G. So that the light governing the present situation is what we are considering this afternoon?
J.T. Yes; it is the suffering side; "we are put to death all the day long". When Christ takes up His rights in government His disciples will not be killed all the day long.
R.R.T. What the Lord said to Pilate governs the present position: "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above".
J.T. That is enlarged for us in @Romans 13. So that
{40}
the word is, "Let every soul be subject to the authorities". Christians belong to heaven; but in the government of God we are down here, as Jesus was down here doing the will of God. And He said to His disciples, "I am in the midst of you as the one that serves" (@Luke 22: 27). Although He was above all, He took a bondman's form, taking His place in the likeness of men. He humbled Himself and He suffered. But when He comes again He will have crowns on His head, and be sitting on a white horse; and He will be "clothed with a garment dipped in blood" (@Revelation 19: 13). "And the armies which are in the heaven followed him upon white horses, clad in white, pure, fine linen".
J.A.W. In taking a stand for Christ now in the manner in which you have been indicating, the authorities are *for* you: "For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil one", verse 3. You can count on the authorities to support you in the stand you take.
J.T. Yes; the government being ordained of God, "is God's minister to thee for good", verse 4. It is remarkable that Pilate at the outset was favourable to Christ. The government of this country is favourable to the saints; that surely is of God, and we thank Him for it.
C.A.M. Paul, according to @Acts 26, stood before Festus and Agrippa; hard things were said to him, but he answered in meekness and had liberty to present the gospel, rendering a powerful testimony.
J.T. Quite so. He was what he wished them to be. He said, "I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bonds" (@Acts 26: 29).
J.L.F. Peter connects the will of God with the believer putting "to silence the ignorance of senseless
{41}
men" (@1 Peter 2: 15), meeting conditions in such a way that an opposer is put to silence.
J.T. Yes; the passage treats of subjection to divinely ordained authorities, @1 Peter 2: 13 - 15. The present governing system is another order of things from that with which christians are connected, but nevertheless it is, so to speak, a department of God. It is a provisional state of things for our sakes. It is a minister to us for good, so that we are thankful for the policeman on the street and for the jail, because they suppress evil. The assembly could hardly exist without the outward order and protection which, under God, the government affords.
A.D.S. There is a footnote to @Romans 13: 1 in the New Translation: "'Let every soul subject itself:' it is reflexive; ... 'sets himself in opposition', verse 2, is in direct contrast". In the scripture referred to by our brother, Peter says, "Be in subjection, therefore, to every human institution for the Lord's sake". What is the distinction between authorities which are above us and human institutions?
J.T. They convey the same general idea; trade unionism would not be included. It is a question of what is provisionally owned of God, whatever human institution is in this sense owned of God. I think that is what is meant, because you might have the worst things under the head of an institution. But government is of God. 'Be subject', as we have noted, is reflexive. And the word 'soul' would suggest that you are *feeling* in the thing, you respect the authority. You say, God put it there for my benefit; you are not resentful of it.
A.D.S. Peter says, "for the Lord's sake".
J.T. In Romans you have, "on account of conscience", verse 5. It is a good word for the present time. Verse 5 indicates that, if you are not subject, your conscience will be bad; your conscience demands
{42}
subjection, and therefore you cannot at all support a person who says, I would not do anything for the government. Conscience requires that you do all you can for the government.
J.A.W. Do you not find that confirmed in the apostle's further word, "Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise what is good, and thou shalt have praise from it; for it is God's minister to thee for good"? So that those in the services, and all of us, should keep this before us: "practise what is good".
J.T. Yes. We have to take this up somewhat abstractly, because in the working out of government there are many very bad things; so that it is the abstract idea of government that is in mind, and which Pilate represents. Left to himself he would have released the Lord, but as influenced by the Jews he scourged the Lord. The point largely for us is to keep the authorities doing right, and hence we pray for them. God would help them to do right.
C.H.H. Would you feel free to form a judgment of the governments and to pray consistently in line with the judgment you form of those governments?
J.T. Just so. The abstract thought of government was in God's mind in taking up the gentile monarchies as seen in Daniel, and Nebuchadnezzar was brought to it through severe discipline. This has occurred, no doubt, in many cases. Pilate illustrates how God *can* act in this respect. @Zechariah 6: 5 presents the four monarchies in the abstract sense. There they are called "the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth".
J.L.F. In our chapter it is said, "For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God" (@Romans 13: 1). That is in effect what the Lord said to Pilate.
J.T. Therefore we see that what is in mind as to
{43}
government in this chapter is what is ordained of God. It is not trade unionism or institutions like that that would harm and even murder people; it is what God institutes that we are to submit to.
C.H.H. God may remove certain governments.
J.T. Just so; you see many examples of that in Scripture, also examples of God influencing rulers to favour His people. Our prayer meetings enter into all this -- that the authorities might be favourable towards God's people; we pray and it comes to pass. In @1 Timothy 2: 1 - 4 the apostle says, "I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men; for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity; for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God, who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth".
C.H.H. In the scripture in 1 Timothy, "all men" are mentioned first.
J.T. Quite so; it is a very important matter to keep on praying for them, because otherwise we may suffer; we must, therefore, keep on praying for the authorities. That is the general thought, and then for kings and those in dignity -- "that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity". All this instruction in @Romans 13 ends with love in verse 10; and it may be linked with the mystery in the end of the epistle: "Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, as to which silence has been kept in the times of the ages, but which has now been made manifest, and by prophetic scriptures, according to commandment of the eternal God, made known for obedience of faith to all the nations -- the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever. Amen" (@Romans 16: 25 - 27).
The truth in Romans works up to this paragraph. It
{44}
is to prepare us for the teaching of the Colossian and Ephesian epistles. Thus, as already remarked, Romans has an upward trend, leading us in principle and in spirit outside of this world altogether. Those saluted by the apostle, mentioned in chapter 16, would be saints who appreciated the truth and walked in it.
{45}
CHRIST'S KINGDOM NOT OF THIS WORLD (3)
@Acts 2: 42 - 47; @Nehemiah 5
J.T. Our subject is the present dispensation as compared with other dispensations; it was proposed in order to bring out that christianity is a heavenly dispensation. This is accentuated in these last days, so that the end should be as the beginning. We looked at @John 18 yesterday morning, the conversation between our Lord and Pilate, in which the Lord asserts that His kingdom is not of this world.
We considered the chapter generally and it became clear that His kingdom takes character from Himself. It is not a question of what He inherited from David, but what comes out from Himself; it is not of this world and the sword is particularly forbidden in the chapter, not abolished finally, but put back into its sheath, implying that it may be required again, but not in this dispensation. So our position is peculiar and involves reproach. The natural mind is unable to enter into it, and therefore persecution is bound to attach to us as we are faithful to the character of the time; thus our attitude is a suffering one, accepting the will of God, and stressing that it must have the first place. The Lord says to Peter, "The cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?"
In the afternoon we looked at the epistle to the Romans, chapters 12 and 13 particularly, but considered a little the general scope of the epistle as setting forth the gospel, and that believers according to chapters 12 and 13 take on the character of Christ in their relations to one another and towards all, especially those in authority. The powers that be correspond to Pilate; the Lord had to say to him, and we have to do with the powers that exist at the present time. We are instructed in Romans how to comport
{46}
ourselves in relation to them, as the Lord did in relation to Pilate.
It is thought now that we should look at Luke's presentation of the truth as bringing out the heavenly side of it, the example being seen in the section in @Acts 2 that we read. It is a beautiful product of the truth seen in the announcement of the gospel through Peter. It is Luke's line of service, bringing out a state of things that the Lord recognises as suitable to Him. Therefore He adds all that were to be saved to what was there, a company outside of the course of this world and characterised by a new spirit and new principles.
R.R.T. So that we have here presented in the Acts, really in effect, the product of the Lord's ministry, the witness of the good confession before Pontius Pilate, where He speaks about "my kingdom". Now as the fruit of that and the coming down of the Holy Spirit, we have coming to light in the Acts this heavenly company, united to a King in heaven.
J.T. That is what is mind, but "my kingdom", as the Lord calls it, would be worked out from heaven. It is not called the kingdom of heaven here; we are viewing it from the standpoint of the Lord's own remark; the kingdom of God is involved, but it is a question of "my kingdom" and "my servants". They were at Jerusalem and this is the product of that; there is no sword in the physical sense. Peter himself is the servant who serves, and he had learned from the Lord that no one is to take the sword in the literal sense. It is a question of the Spirit, the power that came in from heaven. What came in was powerful, although it was in the form of breathing; there was "a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting". The Holy Spirit was coming in. It is not stated that He was breathing into the disciples, but "there appeared to them parted
{47}
tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them". It is a question of the *public* position and the power by which it is maintained, the Spirit of God.
A.D.S. You said in the résumé of what we had yesterday that the natural mind cannot apprehend, it does not understand the position. Would you say a little more about that?
J.T. Well, it does not; it receives not the things of God, it does not understand them at all. Paul tells us that they are spiritually discerned. The natural mind is shut out, it is not capacitated to take them in. It retains its own importance, however, and that involves suffering on the part of those who are heavenly. We are not understood, but the superiority and wealth flowing from the indwelling Spirit are there.
D.R. Do you think God might give conviction to those who represent the powers that be, although they do not understand the position?
J.T. He does. Acts brings out how persons in authority are affected; the person to whom the treatise is addressed may have been one of those, "most excellent Theophilus". The allusion would be to one in dignity. And we have several others of the great ones of this world who came within the range of the testimony and were affected, such as the eunuch, the deputy of Cyprus, and Cornelius. Rulers and those in dignity generally come within the range of the operations of the Spirit, and therefore the younger brothers having to say to the tribunals may reckon that there will be some effect produced by their testimony, hence the importance of a good confession. In connection with the Lord's own testimony Pilate's wife was affected, and we know that the centurion who stood by the cross was, and those that stood with him. So, however feeble our testimony, there may be some result from it in those 'above' in the governmental ordering of God.
D.R. Caiaphas was made to prophesy, and yet he
{48}
was not affected by it; I was wondering if this class of men appears in Acts in Gamaliel; he could say, "Withdraw from these men and let them alone, for if this counsel or this work have its origin from men, it will be destroyed; but if it be from God, ye will not be able to put them down".
J.T. Yes; there was ability to give wise counsel, and this was used of God to save His servants at a critical moment; this is a matter of great importance at all times, but there is no evidence that Gamaliel was genuinely affected -- any more than Balaam was affected.
R.R.T. Would you say just a word as to the difference between "my kingdom" in John and "the Father's kingdom" in Luke? When he teaches them to pray, He says, "Father ... thy kingdom".
J.T. Well, I was remarking that when the Lord says, "my kingdom", the stress would be on "my;" what it may embrace is another matter. I suppose in one sense the whole idea of the kingdom comes in under Him. The article placed before the kingdom in @1 Corinthians 15 makes it general; it is said, "He shall have delivered up the kingdom", without specifying which one. It is evidently the general idea of rule which never ceases; the principle of the kingdom goes right through; it must apply in all dispensations, even in the eternal state it must apply. He delivers up the kingdom to God the Father, and He Himself is subject. I would not like to undertake to deal with the specified kingdoms in our subject, but to fix our minds on the Lord's words, "my kingdom" and "my servants". You allude to chapter 11 of Luke. The Lord is praying in a certain place, and it was a question of how the disciples should pray. He said, "When ye pray, say, Father, thy name be hallowed; thy kingdom come", which is very beautiful. Addressing prayer to the Lord Jesus is more prevalent with some than addressing it to the Father, which is certainly not according to the tenor
{49}
of Scripture. I have heard prayers times without number and the Father has never been alluded to.
I think in our subject we should keep to what the Lord says to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence". The passage in Luke enables us to speak of how the matter enters into Luke's gospel; and also the passage in the book of Acts, both by the same author. In both he stresses the heavenly side; this ought to affect us much. The books, being addressed to an individual, have a personal touch. Thus in reading they affect you in a personal way. In chapter 11 which has been alluded to the Lord says, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" The Father which is of heaven, not simply in it, but *of* it. The Son of man is also of heaven; it is not exactly the idea of place, but of character, the character of the dispensation, it is of heaven, it is here provisionally, not to continue. It is a provisional dispensation without time limits, as in the feast of Pentecost (@Deuteronomy 16), a type of the Spirit; there is no time limit. It is elastic, as it were. And therefore the Father which is of heaven gives the Spirit, and the Spirit comes down from heaven.
He is sent down from heaven, too; so that the incoming of the Spirit is marked by heaven's assertion of itself in the sound that filled the house; and the Spirit coming in from heaven sat upon each of those gathered in the form of cloven tongues as of fire. It is a question of what is of heaven, what is set up there in Christ and what is inaugurated down here to testify to it; not only the terms of the gospel, but the system itself is heavenly, the centre being in heaven. In Luke it is said that shepherds were keeping their flock by night and the angel of the Lord was there by them;
{50}
light was there round about them, and presently a multitude of the heavenly host came down, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good pleasure in men". That is the general position, the earthly side is in view, but when we come to chapter 19 it is "peace in heaven", not peace on earth, that is celebrated, verses 37, 38.
That is the idea, peace is established in heaven, and the earth left in abeyance. It is presently to come in, but in the meantime the heavenly testimony is rendered. In @Luke 9 the time of Christ's receiving up is said to have come; that is, everything was to be transferred up there. The centre of operations was to be in heaven.
When we come to chapter 24, the brethren will notice that there is no reference to the 40 days of the Lord's sojourn here. All the other gospels contemplate a delay after His resurrection before His ascending, but not Luke. All is viewed as having happened on the day of His resurrection. He is carried up into heaven, "received up in glory" as Paul says. The idea is speed to reach the point of the centre of operations above in heaven.
The Lord says to the disciples, "remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high", that is the position. So in @Acts 1: 6 the apostles raise a question as to the kingdom of Israel. "They therefore, being come together, asked him saying, Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?" This is an earthly matter; He is not opening up that at all. He says, It is not for you to know the times and seasons. There is no such idea attached to the kingdom in @John 18. It is "my kingdom" as we have seen. That was to be known. But as to the kingdom which Israel is to have part in, it belonged to "times and seasons", and the Lord says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power". That is the
{51}
point, it is the Holy Spirit here, that is the thing for us, as for them, that the Holy Spirit has come down and is carrying on a system of operations, taking on a heavenly character, and men are, through the gospel, to come under the power of that. Later, as seen in chapter 10, the vessel comes down and goes back into heaven remaining there; it is here only provisionally.
C.A.M. Speaking about the dispensations, would you say that during the course of them there was a sort of stopping of the clock so that the present one should come in?
J.T. Yes. The 70 weeks do not include our period. The present is in a sense a nondescript dispensation. It does not fit into the ordinary or earthly ones; it is a new heavenly order of things which in itself is, in a way, inscrutable. It involves the *mystery*, the idea of Christ and the assembly, which is not understood save by those forming the assembly -- those who are initiated.
C.A.M. And yet this question was in mind in the book of Daniel when the four monarchies started. There was a recognition of heaven. It was "the God of the heavens" who was going to operate. Would you say that was preparatory in a providential way for this?
J.T. Well, what is stated in Daniel of course runs on into our dispensation. The mention of heaven would be over against Jerusalem as a centre; the Lord owned that Pilate had authority from above. Nebuchadnezzar and those who followed him were rulers on earth, and that leads us into what we had yesterday, chapter 13 of Romans. That system runs on, but only with a view to our system, the heavenly system. Everything is subservient to the heavenly system. The image that Nebuchadnezzar saw represented a state of things that would be abolished, but it serves a divine purpose.
J.A.W. Nebuchadnezzar had to learn a lesson, that the heavens do rule. That is what we are learning now.
{52}
J.T. He was king of kings on earth. He does not represent a heavenly state of things at all, it is just what is here for the moment.
D.R. So, referring to our brother's remark, while the clock has stopped as to the time of dispensations, yet what you said yesterday is important, that the fulness of every dispensation enters into this dispensation.
J.T. Quite so. The assembly is, as it were, the clearing house so that everything is understood. The prophets did not understand all they were saying, they anticipated the present period. Everything waited the incarnation; this dispensation is the filling out of Christ in the assembly, the body of Christ. It is all going to be received back into heaven and the clock of earthly time will start again. When God has the assembly in heaven, it will influence what will be on earth. So that things will be all named, as it were, adjusted in the future. Things will be understood in Israel better than they were ever understood in the Old Testament. Those who inhabit the earth in the millennium will have a much clearer apprehension of God and His kingdom than the Old Testament saints had.
J.A.W. Where do you fit the passage in @Acts 2 into this?
J.T. To bring out the product of the first preaching of the gospel; what a beautiful result it was, and how true to itself, that in principle the character of this company was entirely heavenly! It is not what had been at Jerusalem; it was, under God, *derived from the apostles;* "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". It was a wholly new order of things.
R.R.T. Would you say that those things mentioned, the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, breaking of bread and prayers, are the features of this dispensation?
{53}
J.'I'. They are the basic features. Look at the following beautiful features that are depicted by the Spirit in the verses read, 44 to the end -- "all that believed were together". Now in the beginning of the chapter it is said, "they were all together in one place;" but the point in verse 44 is that they were together in *character*, knit together in heart; "and had all things common", which confirmed their oneness. Conditions testifying to love in the Spirit were there. They "had all things common, and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as any one might have need. And every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people; and the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved". Conditions were suitable for the Lord to add to. They were conditions of salvation and the Lord brought those that were to be saved into them. They were what He had in mind in speaking to Pilate of His kingdom. I hope we shall see in chapter 10 how this beautiful state of things is accentuated in a *vessel*. This will be largely through Paul. Here the thing is already proceeding in the character of it. The Lord can add those who are to be saved to that. It is the haven of protection and blessing for those who are to be saved.
J.L.F. These mutual conditions that were inaugurated here, the world has sought to re-establish as an ideal, but they have utterly failed through the years; but these conditions are in the assembly.
J.T. This is a great and blessed fact. Communism is a wretched imitation. This is the real thing, it is a heavenly product, not yet exactly named that, but it has already that character. It is presently to be definitely named 'the assembly;' it is the circle of the saints.
E.G.M. Is it that the one who drew the sword in
{54}
the garden and cut off the ear of the high priest's servant is used as a witness through the gospel to bring men together so that these blessed features should characterise them?
J.T. Quite so; he was a difficult brother to perfect, but the Lord says at the outset, I will *make* you something; the making was slow, but toward the end it was very rapid. The worst things that happened to Peter were within a few weeks of this time. We are living in an urgent situation and Luke has that in mind, and so he mentions at the end of his gospel two men in shining garments appearing suddenly. So that *we* may look for some sudden things happening to prepare us to go up. We can keep on praying for things to happen suddenly. The work proceeded rapidly with Peter, so that he became a finished product. Chapter 1 and this chapter show this. Through his great preaching and general service with the other eleven apostles we have the wonderful result described in these verses. The Lord could well designate it "my kingdom".
J.A.W. Does this thought of persevering mark what you said last night as to tilling and cultivating and spiritual formation?
J.T. Yes -- persevering; you mean of tilling and cultivating? You can see how they persevered, how these features marked the large number that were converted. Adam was placed in the garden for his own comfort and blessing first; it was a matter of favour to be in such a place. After the river is depicted he is again alluded to as being set in the garden to "till" and to "guard" it; and as regards the tree of responsibility, he is commanded; but he is already put to work, and I think that is what you get here. They persevered in the apostles¬ teaching, fellowship, the breaking of bread and prayers. They are like a beehive. We are not sleepy or careless or using the third person in speaking of the brethren; as converted through the
{55}
gospel we begin to do something for the brethren immediately.
C.H.H. Would this indicate that the collective and public position should continue in the way of testimony to the end? It has often been said that what is collective and public is gone, but this would indicate that, although in a small way, it continues.
J.T. I think the idea of being together goes on as in @Malachi 3: 16, "they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another". So that the Lord addresses Philadelphia in the singular, "I will keep thee;" that is, the assembly is in mind, however small or feeble it may be. So that the heavenly city, the light of it, as it were reflecting back upon us, is governing us, the great thought of the assembly in the future. And what it is actually here in a concrete way is never to be given up, that is, the idea of the saints coming together to Christ's name. The Lord clothes with assembly glory the twos and threes gathering together in His name.
R.B. Verse 43 speaks of fear; is that normal and the result of teaching?
J.T. "Fear was upon every soul", meaning wholesome, godly fear; it was piety. Our God is a consuming fire. We are apt to overlook this searching and solemn fact. @1 Corinthians 11 speaks of many among the saints being weak and sickly and of many who had fallen asleep. We are apt to be very careless, but the severest thoughts enter into the government of the house of God. "*Our God* is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12: 29).
R.B. We may attend a meeting and at the end say that it was very nice -- but the result should be godly exercise and fear, should it not?
J.T. That is right; you go out of the door and the world, or the devil may confront you; hence you need to be on your guard, and retain carefully what you have received as together with the saints.
{56}
E.G.M. Do you mean that, while the present aspect of the kingdom is passive as to this world, it is anything but that in regard to us?
J.T. just so; in it is the *direct rule of God*. In regard of the public ordering of God, He is ruling indirectly in the nations, but His direct rule is in the assembly.
D.R. And so, would you say that Ananias and Sapphira are brought in after this to show that, while the fear of God was there, God would manifest any working of evil in the assembly and would prevent evil coming in? "But of the rest durst no man join them".
J.T. We get the spiritual position enhanced as we are faithful in judging sin. I always notice after a care meeting in which the Lord's interests are faithfully looked after that we have a good following first day of the week. In chapter 5 after the judgment of Ananias and Sapphira you get a striking testimony to the power of the apostles. Multitudes were added to the Lord, both of men and women; that is, the Lord's authority being recognised, souls were added to *Him*.
E.G.M. Are you accentuating the great truth of the presence and power of the Holy Spirit to maintain all of us in the assembly character against all adverse powers down here, so that we can maintain a good testimony as the Lord did before Pilate?
J.T. That is what is in mind in the book of Acts. Peter who used the sword and was told to put it back into its sheath is the one taken on immediately in the service; he is a finished product included in those whom the Lord calls "my servants". He is the leading one and he is not now talking about self-defence or attack in a physical way. The point is the Spirit, the power coming down from heaven, and that is effective in the assembly in dealing with Ananias and Sapphira; but the principal thought is that it is effective in delivering souls from the power of Satan and is spoiling his kingdom.
{57}
Chapter 4 speaks of the brethren praying as Peter and John were let go; they prayed to God as 'Despot', they are so concerned about the position that they approach God in that way. Under such circumstances we are impressed with the need of subjection. There is no room for our wills. They tell God about what happened at Jerusalem, "in this city". "For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass. And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word, in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus" (@Acts 4: 27 - 30). Not a word about a physical sword at all. To Peter it would now be an utterly foreign thought.
There is more power in the Spirit than there is anywhere else. They are invoking God that this power should be turned to the salvation of men; and so "when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness". That is the position, it is a question of the Spirit.
C.H.H. What is the significance of the temple? When the testimony becomes public they were in the temple, not in the upper room. Does the temple suggest what is public?
J.T. Yes, it involves the light covering the position for the moment. That is, the patience of God towards the Jews was involved in their service. It is the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ. The kingdom and patience involves that the Jews must be appealed to in the gospel first -- to the Jew first -- and they are in accord with that light. According to Luke the Lord
{58}
led them out as far as to Bethany. It is a further point, but not any further than Bethany; that is the remnant position, where love was among the Jews; they were to carry on there as long as possible, which applied up to the time of Stephen's martyrdom, and further indeed. It is a great matter that the position taken at any time is suitable, and in things that are said, that the things said apply. The apostles understood what was implied in the Lord leading them to Bethany.
C.H.H. Now in our testimony do we maintain what is spiritually represented as the upper room and also the temple?
J.T. Not now; the Jewish period is over.
C.H.H. What I mean is, what that represents to us. For instance, we are here in temple light, that is maintained.
J.T. The word 'temple' in the sense in which you are using it is not what is employed here. The original word for temple here refers to the general buildings. It is not the shrine; it is the shrine we are in today, where the Spirit of God is. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" -- that represents the inner position; this is the outer position.
E.Mac. In Acts they returned from the Mount of Olives; in Luke's gospel it is Bethany. The former connects us with a new movement.
J.T. The Acts has the assembly in view; the gospel ends with the Jews in view, that the gospel was to be preached to all the nations, but "beginning at Jerusalem".
J.L.F. Would you say a word as to the difference between Bethany and the Mount of Olives?
J.T. I think Bethany would refer to what is said of it, that the Lord used to go there, as if He had a home there, a place of love. He went out to Bethany and spent the night, a very touching thing. He also used to go to the Mount of Olives. There are thus two
{59}
places that have, in this respect, to be understood. On the Mount of Olives He would be occupied with heavenly links; if He went to Bethany He was occupied with the Jewish links; there was affection. The Mount of Olives is seen in the beginning of the book of Acts; I would connect it there with the upper room; Bethany would connect with the temple. From there the disciples returned to Jerusalem and were in the temple praising and blessing God. That was a testimony to the Jews -- the result of the work of Christ; God was yet lingering there in patience.
C.H.H. Would that indicate that the full thought of the temple, the inner shrine, awaited the development of Paul's doctrine?
J.T. It would; he stresses it, applying it to God, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" God is now reviving the thought among ourselves.
R.R.T. Linking on this passage with what you said as to "my kingdom", I was thinking of verse 45, "and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as any one might have need". Would that be a proper thing to do now in the light of what the Lord said: "My kingdom is not of this world"? If we take that in it will set worldly possessions in the right light.
J.T. It breaks up the whole system of commercialism, not that you want it broken up literally, but it is to show that the heavenly thoughts run athwart everything down here. That is what I thought we would see in Nehemiah in remnant times. This is carried on; in the beginning they sold their possessions and substance and distributed to all according as any one might have need. That was modified later. In this chapter we see the freshness and fulness of love as the Spirit came in from heaven. It is viewed in this way, not as the result of a commandment. It was modified, however, by teaching afterwards, the teaching of
{60}
wisdom. So that, when we come to chapter 4, Barnabas, a good man and ennobled by the apostles, had possessions which he sold, and he did not distribute the money himself, but laid it at the apostles¬ feet. It needs fidelity and wisdom to deal with money in relation to the things of God. It should be handled by at least two persons. There should be no room for fleshly feeling or suspicion. Barnabas laid it at the apostles¬ feet. God has vested wisdom and authority in those men, so that even in regard to money it was set at their feet, so that there was no danger of damage accruing from it; and the wisdom of all that is immediately demonstrated negatively in the action of Ananias and Sapphira. The devil worked in them through money; they kept back part of the price of the estate. It is remarkable that the example of Barnabas should come in there. Teaching and experience -- which mark the children of wisdom -- lead to stable results. These keep the river energised by the Spirit flowing within its banks. As we come to Paul we have much teaching regarding the custody and distribution of money.
That leads us to the passage in Nehemiah where the question of money comes up, and, being a remnant time, it applies for us now. Nehemiah was not a priest or prophet, but the servant of a gentile monarch, externally he was a governor appointed by the Persian king; but he brings in the heavenly thought as to money, agreeing with our passage anticipatively.
J.L.F. Do you think in Nehemiah the principle of commercialism had been pretty well established?
J.T. Yes. We know how much the Jews have been universally identified with it. God has allowed the Jew to be prominent in the history of human affairs, especially in commerce; it is "that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful". The love of commerce, of money-making through it, marks them peculiarly. It comes out in Nehemiah's time that
{61}
they used money for making money. The word is "usury", but then the Jew or any natural man would say, Why should not I make something out of my money? Why should not a man get interest on his money from the bank? That is commercialism, quite right in its place; but we are dealing with heavenly things and there it is quite wrong. The circle in Jerusalem (@Acts 2), had got that thought in a very striking way. You cannot introduce the idea of usury in that circle, but here it is introduced.
Nehemiah says, "There was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. ... And there were that said, We have had to pledge our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses, that we might procure corn in the dearth. And there were that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute upon our fields and vineyards; yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and behold, we must bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already; neither is it in the power of our hand to redeem them, for other men have our fields and our vineyards" (@Nehemiah 5: 1 - 5). There is the direct opposite of the heavenly thing, it is just earthly -- hard, financial trading in the hands of the Jews. That is abominable in the light of what we are talking about.
R.R.T. It is not in the light of the word of the Lord, "My kingdom is not of this world". They were dealing with worldly goods in accord with worldly practices; that is not in line with the thought of God.
J.T. Just so. Today christendom has come under the power of worldly principles; many preach the gospel for a salary, and many corresponding things are attached to the service. If you look into the Romish system you will find it characterised by money; money is the first and last word there. @Revelation 18 depicts the immense
{62}
wealth which the merchants of the earth acquired through supplying the luxuries of that system. Among the articles of commerce were the "bodies and souls of men".
C.A.M. I suppose those coming under the influence of heaven have the result that they shall be received up in glory.
J.T. Yes; and if one has material means, wisdom in him would use them in view of the future, which will imply benefit to others. The steward mentioned in @Luke 16: 1 - 9 used what was under his hand in view of the future, and the Lord said as to his actions, "Make to yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles". Returning to our chapter: Nehemiah was not an apostle, priest or prophet, nor even a Levite; he was just a governor appointed by the Persians. But he took up the things of God in his heart. A man may be, under the government of God, in service in any department of the government, but at the same time have the things of God in his heart; and God may use him very definitely. Nehemiah could say, I have not been chargeable to the people as other governors have been -- "I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor". He was governed by the heavenly principles of which we have been speaking. And although he had no official spiritual appointments he rendered remarkable spiritual services.
D.R. Although in remnant days, would he represent the spirit of discernment and judgment that belongs to God's people under normal conditions?
J.T. I think that is the thought, and it should be encouraging for us because we are more or less occupied with secular things, even some in military things, in all the countries. The Spirit of God does not make little of military men, for they may be in positions in which they serve with good consciences, and may be fully in
{63}
the truth. Daniel was a great minister under Nebuchadnezzar, but he had God and His people and Jerusalem in his heart. That is how Nehemiah begins his book. He was deeply affected when he heard the state of Jerusalem, because that is the centre of the Jewish order of things. He was the king's cupbearer and he came before the king, and his countenance was sad. That was dangerous as liable to arouse apprehension in the king. Nehemiah sacrifices for the sake of Jerusalem. He told the cause of his sadness to the king -- the king was there and the queen also, a suggestive thought spiritually. He told the whole story and he was sent to Jerusalem as governor. The persons who were practising this usury were men of a certain distinction. Nehemiah says, "I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. And I consulted with myself; and I remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother! And I set a great assembly against them. And I said to them, We, according to our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the nations; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? And they were silent and found no, answer" verses 6 - 8.
Applying this to our own times, the revival in which we have part has the deliverance of the brethren in mind. If I take any course because of certain distinctions, whatever they may be -- my profession may give me distinction, my family also -- to advance myself, I am sure to bring the brethren into bondage in some measure.
E.G.M. So that we are supposed to keep our natural and spiritual assets in a condition of liberty.
J.T. Let heaven govern us; thus we shall be morally above selfish motives. You are not going to use the little or much of material things you have under God to bring the brethren into bondage.
{64}
J.L.F. Do we get the idea of assembly action here? This matter is gone into in a collective way.
J.T. I think so. What is brought out in the chapter is the distinctiveness of Nehemiah as a heavenly man in type. He says, "I consulted with myself;" that is a good word in such a connection. Nehemiah can do things by himself. There are a lot of personal friendships amongst us; there is hardly a thing more damaging. Initially, as one has a serious matter brought to his attention, he turns to God as to it by himself; thus as challenging his own heart the position becomes clear, and he has liberty to move in relation to the assembly, having righteous influence. Nehemiah "remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers ... and I set a great assembly against them". Evidently God was with him in all this, for the offenders said, "We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou hast said", verse 12.
R.R.T. Is it not solemn that those who seem to be chiefly harmed by it are the young amongst the brethren? They are brought into bondage.
J.T. Yes; and there would be the thought of equality on their parents¬ part in their families as compared with the families of the nobles, whereas they were becoming enslaved. So that the nobles are using their money to captivate their brethren and degrade them.
R.R.T. Anything that brings the young among the brethren into bondage curtails their liberty.
J.T. Indeed, these are the complaints made here. The people said first, "We, our sons and our daughters, are many, and we must procure corn that we may eat and live". That is a good word to many of the young people. One of the most encouraging things I know of is the great number of young people affected by the truth; but they need to be fed. Then again, "There were that said, We have had to pledge our fields, and
{65}
our vineyards, and our houses, that we might procure corn in the dearth". That is the second thing, and then thirdly, "There were that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute upon our fields and vineyards; yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and behold, we must bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already; neither is it in the power of our hand to redeem them, for other men have our fields and vineyards".
This is a clear statement of the situation, and the gist of it is that some were being made inferior and others were made superior, which is foreign to the heavenly thought; all our names are written in heaven. Every Levite is a firstborn, which is impossible in the world. In the world every person cannot be a firstborn; it is a heavenly idea -- "the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven". You cannot get that in the world at all.
R.R.T. That is contrary to what we had in @Acts 2, "all things common", although, as you say, the working out of it requires wisdom.
C.H.H. In Galatians the features of attack were to bring the brethren into bondage, so that the apostle gets "all the brethren" with him.
J.T. "All the brethren with me", he says. In the matter before us Nehemiah represents a brother who has power; what a brother who is with God may effect -- what one man can do in a spiritual way if he is with God. He influenced the brethren to be with him in meeting the difficulty. He said, "I consulted with myself; and I remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother! And I set a great assembly against them. And I said to them, We, according to our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who
{66}
were sold to the nations; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? And they were silent and found no answer", verses 7, 8. That is how a spiritual man shines; but he knows what to say, and they had no answer. So the victory is won.
C.S.P. Does not his moral power for good come in as an example?
J.T. Exactly. He said to them, "Restore, I pray you, to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive-gardens, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine and the oil, that ye have exacted of them. And they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, as thou hast said. And I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise", verses 11, 12. He brings the priests into the thing, to enforce what had been undertaken. And then he says, "Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. But the former governors that were before me had been chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God", verses 14, 15.
If that man were a mere Jew he would say, What a fine bank account I have built up during these twelve years! That would express the Jewish mind, but not so with the heavenly man, he has nothing to do with that. Nehemiah further says, "Yea, also I applied myself to this work of the wall, and we bought no fields; and all my servants were gathered thither for the work. And there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers, besides those that came to us from among the nations that were about us. And
{67}
that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance. Yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor; for the service was heavy upon this people. Remember for me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people", verses 16 - 19.
That is typically a heavenly man, he had not gotten a penny out of all this, but he had the people, he set the people free.
E.Mac. He is like Paul, he would not be chargeable to the brethren.
J.T. He asserted his right but he would not use it. We can understand how he could say, "The Lord ... shall preserve me for his heavenly kingdom" (@2 Timothy 4: 18).
D.R. "I do not seek yours but you", he said.
E.G.M. Nehemiah states two good reasons for what he did: "But I did not so, because of the fear of God;" and then, "for the service was heavy upon this people".
J.T. Another thing is that in these last days the Lord has brought to light and stressed the thought of eternal life, and I believe that Nehemiah here is typically promoting the idea of eternal life in entertaining and thus getting the saints together in his house and providing good food for them. I believe that is one way by which God would have us lay hold of eternal life, to get spiritual persons into our houses and show them hospitality, which is a heavenly thought; it is like entertaining angels. Nehemiah said he had one hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, "besides those that came to us from among the nations that were about us". What times they must have had, representing spiritual gatherings! You get the concrete idea of eternal life as spiritual brethren are gathered together. See @Psalm 133.
R.B. Gatherings of today are often of the young people, by themselves, the older ones not with them. That is not your thought in speaking of this matter, it is rather young and old together.
{68}
J.T. Yes. You will not get eternal life characteristically in gatherings of young people by themselves; they have not enough spiritual power for it. They are apt to bring in the natural. It is safer and holier for them to be with the older brethren. Nehemiah says, "There were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers". Typically they would be the spiritual. You will get spiritual power in a house like that of Nehemiah; there would be no lightness or frivolity at his table.
E.G.G. Why are the heathen referred to as being there too?
J.T. They would be interested ones, "besides those that came to us from among the nations". Why did they come? It must have been because they were interested in what was current in Jerusalem. It is the idea of spiritual heavenly links. We are wise in entertaining the saints; we shall get returns.
C.H.H. The family of Job was a sad affair, doing *without* their father.
J.T. The young people were getting together without their father. I thought in suggesting this chapter that it would help the brethren here to see how in the types we have examples in the last days, in remnant times, of heavenly things brought into view; in a man sacrificing for the sake of the saints, loving to do it, and having a good table. He records what was prepared daily: "one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance". Mentioning these items of food is not unimportant; it is all to promote the good feeling that belongs to a heavenly people.
D.R. Have you time to tell us what the ox and the sheep might suggest?
J.T. Much might be said. An ox would go a long
{69}
way, it would cost something; six choice sheep also would be costly. Liberality is indicated; what marks a heavenly man is that he is liberal and provides for what will produce good feeling and build up wholesome constitutions in the saints.
J.L.F. There is completeness in the things that Nehemiah does; he not only restores their fields, their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their houses, but also the hundredth part of the money and of the corn, the wine and the oil.
J.T. Yes. The hundredth part of the money would be the interest, which would be one per cent a month, as was customary. The wine would be stimulation which is good in a sense; if it is spiritual it is very good, especially in eating; in spiritual appetite there should be good assimilation, so that wine would have that in mind. Nehemiah's strong admonition and warning evoked a very satisfactory response, one which glorified God. "All the congregation said, Amen! And they praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise", verse 13.
R.R.T. Nehemiah here would answer a question that was raised earlier as to what was said in Acts, "fear was upon every soul". Nehemiah said, referring to his refusal to be chargeable to the people, "But I did not so, because of the fear of God". This would illustrate a man moving on unselfish lines.
{70}
CHRIST'S KINGDOM NOT OF THIS WORLD (4)
@Acts 10: 9 - 20
J.T. Heaven's repeated interventions, according to this book, greatly help in the consideration of our subject, especially the one in the verses read. A vessel is seen let down from heaven and taken up so as to remain there -- pointing to the finish of the present dispensation, which is now imminent; and this passage was suggested as conveying a very definite thought as to what is before us, the heavens opened and the sheet let down, all in connection with Peter's vision. He said, "it came even to me", as if to remind us that he had been engaged as in the lead throughout, and that he is now being helped as to the change in the course of the testimony, in which heaven is even more stressed as asserting itself.
What was said this morning connected itself with Peter's work at Pentecost being accomplished, heaven asserting itself in a powerful way. There was "a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing", as indicating the character of service which was to be rendered; it would be marked by *power*. Then Stephen, at the turning point, sees the heavens opened, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. Luke tells us in the close of his gospel, of Christ being carried up into heaven, but he does not say that the disciples saw Him as He was *there*, but Stephen sees Him standing at the right hand of God. It was as yet a transitional state of things, God was lingering in longsuffering as to His ancient people, maintaining the character of this dispensation. The Son of man standing at the right hand of God is to remind us that a change is taking place in heaven as the centre of operations, *all men* being now in view for blessing. And then, the light from heaven that surrounded Saul and the Lord's
{71}
voice speaking to him, saying, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?" are mentioned in @Acts 9. All this precedes our chapter, where again the heaven is opened and a vessel like a great sheet is let down to the earth; in which were all the quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth and the fowls of the heaven. Following on the light afforded to Stephen and Saul this vision to Peter makes known to him that God was now operating among the nations, bringing them into the assembly.
The truth of what the Lord said to Pilate, that His kingdom was not of this world, is thus opened up and amplified. It was the time of suffering. Stephen was exemplifying this. Kneeling down he cried with a loud voice, "lay not this sin to their charge". It was a time of persecution. That is the idea that we are seeking to make clear now: that the kingdom of which the Lord Jesus speaks is not of this world, and that one who is of it and characterised by its principles is not revengeful, but on the contrary, prays for his enemies. And when Paul is brought in, the Lord says of him, "I will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name" (@Acts 9: 16). It is very remarkable that the Spirit of God stresses that the present period is one of suffering.
C.S.P. Would this have a link with the opened heavens in @Luke 3?
J.T. Yes. There heaven opens and proclaims what it thinks of Jesus as down here; but in the Acts heaven opens and Jesus is seen *there*, and its operations in the power of the Spirit here below are intimated. In @Luke 3: 22 it is as the Lord was praying the heaven was opened, and the voice came out of heaven, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight". It was to announce the Father's pleasure in Jesus. In the Acts the interventions of heaven are to remind us of what heaven is doing or going to do. Jesus is made
{72}
Lord and Christ up there, and having sent the Holy Spirit, divine operations are proceeding. All men are in view for blessing and the assembly is the building. The great and blessed work is now nearly complete. @Acts 10: 16 says, "the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven". That is what should be before us. The time is coming for the assembly's translation to heaven. In the meantime the Lord is providing men to carry on as His servants to preach the gospel and work generally "with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (@Ephesians 4: 12, 13).
J.L.F. Is the thought in @Acts 9: 6, "rise up and enter into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do", in keeping with the thought of heaven being prepared to proceed in relation to what is here?
J.T. Yes; it was really indicated in the Lord's first word to Saul and Saul's reply, "Why dost thou persecute me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, *I* am Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest". Saul was convicted of dreadful criminality but, instead of the deserved penalty, the chief of sinners, as he characterised himself later, was taken into the service of Him whom he had persecuted. The Lord's further word to him was, "rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do". But he must suffer, not for his guilt, but as bearing testimony to the Master whom he was now learning to obey and to love. The Lord said, "this man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel: for *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name" (@Acts 9: 15, 16). Instead of penalty Saul had part in the continuation of this wonderful kingdom of which the Lord spoke to Pilate. He was to be one of His servants; he was indeed a pattern servant. As to what

the Lord had in mind, Saul himself says, "that in me, the first, Jesus Christ might display the whole long-suffering, for a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal" (@1 Timothy 1: 16). To the saints he could say, "Be my imitators, even as *I* also am of Christ" (@1 Corinthians 11: 1). So that it is now a question of putting ourselves into this immense matter each in his measure, as serving in Christ's kingdom for the little while that remains. As an example for us John addresses himself to the saints: "Your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience in Jesus" (@Revelation 1: 9).
J.A.W. You are suggesting in this that if we are determined to go in for these heavenly things that you have been suggesting in these readings, we must be prepared to suffer?
J.T. That is the point. Any attempt to avoid suffering implies that in principle we are moving out of the position into which we have come professedly through baptism and the Lord's supper.
J.A.W. It is on the principle of laying down your life for His name's sake and gaining life eternal.
J.T. Quite so, "because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also" (@Philippians 1: 29). It is *given* to us.
D.H. Given by God, do you think? Paul says, "I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men ... . Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer it; insulted, we entreat: we are become as the offscouring of the world, the refuse of all, until now" (@1 Corinthians 4: 9 - 13).
J.T. Quite so. To the Corinthians the apostle enlarges greatly on his sufferings.
C.H.H. Would the character of the dispensation be preserved in the prayer in @Acts 4? They pray in regard to the *threatenings* of their enemies. They ask God to
{74}
stretch out His hand to *heal;* instead of asking for revenge.
J.T. That is right. We noted when looking at @Romans 12 that we are not to avenge ourselves. God says, "Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense". Our part is to be like Stephen, who kneeling down, as he was being stoned, and praying said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge".
C.H.H. Would this section suggest the work of God as securing right feelings? Peter, being hungry, is affected in this sense.
J.T. Yes; "he became hungry and desired to eat", before the ecstasy came upon him; the sense of hunger prepared him for the vision, in which he is directed to slay and eat. He had gone up on the house to pray. In this we are reminded of the need of peaceful conditions as engaged in prayer. We are to pray at all times, but suitable conditions should not be overlooked. In view of the vision, the state of Peter's stomach was taken account of, that the feeling of hunger should be there.
R.R.T. Is there a significance in this passage in God correcting Peter, because he was one that was inclined to cling to the old dispensation?
J.T. Yes; as Ananias questioned the Lord as to what He said of Saul, so Peter refuses the direction to him, "slay and eat". He said, "In no wise, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common or unclean". Peter questioned Him. That is often the case with us, we profess obedience, but when conditions do not suit us we rebel. We call Him Lord, but do not the things that He says.
J.A.W. What you said about praying is very interesting. Stephen kneeled down and prayed, and one of the features that Ananias was to find in Saul was that he was praying; and you find Peter going up to pray.
{75}
J.T. The Lord Himself was praying when the heavens were opened on Him, showing the importance of prayer in all that has come before us.
A.D.S. He went up to pray about the sixth hour. Would that have some significance?
J.T. Well, I have no doubt that certain allusions in the Acts to time have spiritual significance. The sixth and ninth hours point to the cross. The ninth hour in chapter 3 is very suggestive of the actual time of our Lord's death, when He said, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" This hour also comes into chapter 10 -- involving the remarkable experience of Cornelius. The moment is quite significant as linking the incoming of the nations with the actual time of day in which the atoning death of the Saviour of the world took place. And in chapter 10 we also have the sixth hour -- connected with the same event. The light for the revelation of the gentiles was becoming dispensationally effective, @Luke 2: 32. Referring again to sufferings as marking Christ's kingdom, James says, "Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not resist you". That was exactly what Saul found in the disciples in Jerusalem. He entered into the houses "one after another, and dragging off both men and women delivered them up to prison" (@Acts 8: 3). People say, What will you do if an enemy comes in and attacks your wife or your mother? What did the christians in the early days do? That is the point. What did they do when Saul dragged them out of their houses and put them in prison? They did *not* resist. Just as he says of himself later: "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter".
C.S.P. That is always in keeping with the attitude of God in Christ at the present moment.
J.T. Exactly. The matter of suffering is so little understood and experienced that we are hardly able
{76}
to speak of it in power. We are privileged to take the attitude of suffering; "to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also" (@Philippians 1: 29).
It will be well to follow the history as we have it in Acts in regard to the subject before us -- the heavenly side of it. Chapters 2, 7 and 10 treat of this great feature. Chapter 7 is the most touching of all the records, Stephen follows so closely the example of his Master, representing what His kingdom is. "My kingdom is not of this world", the Lord says. It is an order of things involving suffering. He was about to suffer, the apostles suffered, and Stephen follows. Stephen seems to have been taken up to exemplify that side of the position. Kneeling down he says to the Lord, "Lay not this sin to their charge". He is priestly, maintaining a suitable attitude in severest suffering.
J.L.F. The heavenly feature was evidenced in the fact that "all who sat in the council, looking fixedly on him, saw his face as the face of an angel".
E.G.M. Do you find in the stoning of Stephen characteristically what marks persecutors? He says, "O stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, *ye* do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers, *ye* also. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain those who announced beforehand concerning the coming of the Just One, of whom *ye* have now become deliverers up and murderers!" (@Acts 7: 51, 52). And it is recorded that "hearing these things they were cut to the heart, and gnashed their teeth against him. But being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God". In a way he disregarded their murderous efforts against him -- no doubt largely because he had his eye on heaven.
J.T. Just so. Stephen looks up into heaven. Being
{77}
a true martyr, he is accepting the stoning, "having fixed his eyes on heaven". He sees Jesus standing at the right hand of God. He tells those present what he saw. He put it in his own words: "Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God". Stephen is one of the most important persons entering into our inquiry. Among other things he understands what is going on in heaven, and while experiencing dreadful sufferings he is able to describe the position visible to him there. There was a turn in the course of the testimony, and this description of what he sees in heaven implies this. Heaven was to determine everything, and Stephen conveys in his own language what he saw. Instead of referring to Jesus as the Christ, he says, "I behold ... the Son of man" -- this implying that the testimony is going to widen out. The witness is being murdered, but the testimony is going to widen out to the whole race of man. In all this Stephen is a representative of Christ's kingdom -- both in verbal testimony and suffering.
E.G.M. In the power of this, does he still control the situation? It says, "And they stoned Stephen, praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And having said this, he fell asleep" (@Acts 7: 59, 60), as though he was in the full effect of what he saw in heaven.
J.T. Yes. The position is morally very great. It is as if what he saw in heaven dominated him. As already said, it represented what the Lord conveyed in the expression, "My kingdom". Had Stephen seen the Lord coming out in full military form, as in @Revelation 19, riding on a white horse, and the armies which are in heaven following upon white horses, he would not have said these things. He would understand the position was changed. But in effect Stephen's face,
{78}
actions and words reflected the attitude of heaven at that time, and this continues to the present moment. Heaven is still pursuing this course of testimony in grace, and suffering is involved. Normally the believer is accepting the suffering, in keeping with heaven's attitude.
H.G. Is that why three great converts follow immediately: the Ethiopian eunuch, Saul of Tarsus and then Cornelius?
J.T. Just so. The prayer of Stephen reflected the impression made on him by what he saw in heaven. It is a heavenly matter. Heaven is the centre of operations, and thus we need to know what is current up there.
H.G. It would work out in the whole earth.
J.T. Yes. The present war accustoms us to every part of the earth; names of places in all parts of the earth are coming up constantly. That is not for nothing; God thus enlarges our view through governmental circumstances.
R.R.T. What Stephen does here is according to the manner of what the Lord did as recorded in @John 17. He lifted up his eyes to heaven.
J.T. The next feature of our subject is in chapter 9. Chapter 8 shows there was an evangelical activity without a commission. We have to learn to carry on without a commission. Let us do what our hands find to do and the work will be successful, as we observed in Nehemiah. What a successful service his was! Outwardly he was simply a Persian governor, but he carried on in God's work and God blessed what was done. The great result in Samaria through Philip was similar. And then Philip was taken on definitely by heaven. It is a question of what the man is, which is evident in the results of his work. @Acts 8 is a finished matter in itself; and chapter 9 is Paul. It is a particularly heavenly matter. Paul is to be shown how much he *must* suffer for Christ's name.
J.A.W. It is interesting in regard of Philip, that he
{79}
ultimately had his commission -- "Rise up and go southward ... and he rose up and went". And Paul is directed by the Lord to go into the city, and he goes into the city. Later Peter is told by the Spirit to "rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting", and he did so. All the ministry that is constantly coming before us in these meetings is meant to have an effect upon us and it is incumbent on us to follow it up, being responsive to it.
J.T. Exactly. First Philip is directed by an angel; but later the Spirit takes him on, @Acts 8: 26, 39. It is a greater thing to be taken on by the Spirit than by an angel. "The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip". He is in this way distinguished, and also *called* an evangelist; and he had four daughters who prophesied.
D.R. It seems to complete his work. The Spirit said to Philip, "Approach and join this chariot;" and then the Spirit caught him away, his work with the eunuch being finished.
J.T. Just so. He was found at Azotus. He did not immediately go to Caesarea. Evidently the Spirit of God at first worked in Caesarea without any servant, that is, in Cornelius. Later Peter opened the door to the gentiles there. But Paul's ministry is all-important, following upon Stephen. He was a witness to Stephen's martyrdom. He saw the way that saints die in service. Stephen shows how to die for the truth, and I am sure his death impressed Saul. The Lord says, "For I will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name". Who suffered more? You marvel at the record we have of Paul's sufferings. The Corinthians forced him to write about them, and what he wrote is in Scripture for us to read.
C.H.H. You quoted @Revelation 19 in connection with the Lord coming out of heaven sitting on a white horse, but just previous to that the chapter speaks about the Lamb's wife having made herself ready. That
{80}
involves suffering during the present time, does it not?
J.T. Yes. The *Lamb* is the Sufferer. She is His *wife*. It is granted to her to be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure, which is the righteousnesses of the saints.
Now when we come to @Acts 9 we get the Lord's mind about Paul; also the history of his conversion and early service. Peter had been somewhat in the background; but the movement of heaven centering in Paul having begun, he is seen in this chapter active in "all quarters", verse 32. This would imply that he was able to sense the changed conditions through the new ministry. He directs one man to rise up and make his bed for himself; and then he raises up Dorcas. Afterwards we are told that he remained in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner. He was on the Mediterranean, having an outlook toward the west; he was there "many days", after raising up Dorcas.
All this is preliminary to what is presented in chapter 10 -- the creatures in the "vessel;" because a tanner must have skins, and these are from cattle that are slain; so that he would be conversant with the thought of animals. Adam had to do with them and named them. And now Peter is on a tanner's housetop and sees the vessel which descended from heaven containing all the quadrupeds, etc. I am saying this to bring out the position. What skin did Jehovah Elohim use to make coats for Adam and Eve? We cannot tell, but he made them of skin. And now we have another idea, skins tanned by the man with whom Peter "remained many days". "But a certain man in Caesarea by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic, pious, and fearing God with all his house, both giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually". He had not been evangelised so far as we know, but now he is directed by the angel to send for Peter.
P.H. The thought of tanning clearly has to do with death.
{81}
J.T. Yes. The tabernacle was marked everywhere by what suggested death. The outer coverings were all of skins of animals; and if the law was carried out animals were slain every day, blood was flowing. As of the antitype, we have to face those solemn facts. All that suffering referred to the death of Jesus, and the saints must be in accord with that.
J.A.W. The house of Simon the tanner was by the sea. Does that give a suggestion that Peter is in readiness to see what God was going to do in the peoples of the earth?
J.T. Yes, the Mediterranean is regarded as the centre of the western world. It was an outlook for him, and whatever he may have understood by it, we can understand it now. The truth is all out. God would impress him with it; he had an outlook from the roof of the house. We are on the western extremity of the earth at this moment. 7,000 miles from where Peter was. His outlook would be in this direction; the western world was specially in God's mind for blessing.
C.A.M. I suppose with that vision he would pray for one who could navigate! Navigation had to wait for Paul, the great navigator.
J.T. Quite so. "Yonder is the great and wide sea; therein are moving things innumerable, living creatures small and great. There go the ships" (@Psalm 104: 25, 26). The gospel ships were being prepared.
J.A.W. You are speaking of having reached the extreme point in the west. Does that make the present moment a very important one, as if the testimony was about to be completed?
J.T. I think it does. What are the dear brethren going to do about this extremity? How is this end to be held up? The finish is near, and conditions among the saints must be right. Peter's prayer on the housetop would surely extend in this direction.
E.G.M. Peter no doubt had the choice of any of
{82}
the saints¬ houses in that town, but he chose this one; this would be in God's ordering as marked by the suggestion of death, and it had a right outlook.
J.T. That is what I think. The facts mentioned have a meaning, also the facts relative to the garments made by Dorcas. All that is said about her garment making reminds us of conditions that the gospel had to overcome.
E.G.M. Would you take it that the vision coming at the time of Peter's prayer was rather a surprise to him? Peter was evidently exercised over something, and God says, I will give you the right answer, but it may not be what you are looking for. Is that the way unexpected events often come into our circumstances?
J.T. I think so. He was not ready for what the creatures in the sheet signified. His reply to "the voice" was negative.
W.F. What would help us in relation to Peter's answer here? The Lord said, "Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say?" Peter had a great deal of experience with the Lord, yet he questions His voice.
J.T. I suppose it suggests to us the danger of being self-willed, although calling Him Lord, Lord; but not doing the things that He says. The voice says, "Rise, Peter, slay and eat". Put into spiritual language that means, Arise, Peter, and appropriate the effect of the work of God among the gentiles, as well as among the Jews. God is taking them on; the vessel is full of them in representation, and Peter must accept them. Cornelius is, of course, the one immediately in mind. But Peter says, "In no wise, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common or unclean". He has to learn that what God cleanses is clean indeed and must be recognised as qualified for christian fellowship. Peter submits, however. The Spirit took him in hand and he went with the men who were sent by Cornelius.
{83}
And as with him and the company gathered in Caesarea Peter said, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him". The answer to Peter comes three times: "What God has cleansed, do not thou make common. And this took place thrice". We see here the patience of heaven in bringing servants into accord with itself. Three times is a perfect process, so that it is said, "the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven". Then it is said that, "as Peter doubted in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold also the men who were sent by Cornelius, having sought out the house of Simon, stood at the gate, and having called someone, they inquired if Simon who was surnamed Peter was lodged there. But as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because I have sent them". The Spirit comes on the scene. Wherever the Spirit comes in definitely, as we may see in chapter 13, a conclusion is reached. The Spirit Himself is taking the thing in hand. It is not now an angel, as in verse 3, but the Spirit. He says, "go down, and go with them". That is how Peter was adjusted.
R.R.T. In regard to this "pious soldier", verse 7, here was a military man, and yet a pious man. Would that help us as to how we are to regard brethren who are called into the service, and yet carry with it piety?
J.T. The reference is very remarkable. Luke especially mentions military men as coming into relation with the testimony. We must not despise brethren because they are military men. There are brethren in Great Britain who are in actual service, both in the navy and army. They joined before they were converted. Undoubtedly Cornelius and the pious soldier were of this class. No doubt the word, "if thou
{84}
canst become free, use it rather", governs such positions. What has been said as to Christ's kingdom in its present form should determine the christian's attitude as to combatant military service. @John 18 makes the matter perfectly clear. It is due to the government that he should do what he can for it except taking human life. Anyone enlisting takes things out of the hands of God. It is a heavenly matter, involving that the bodies of the saints belong to the Lord and His kingdom. Our struggle is not with flesh and blood.
E.G.M. Does the sheet with all the different animals, fowls, etc., in it, indicate that God had a different way of subduing them than by the sword?
J.T. Yes. They are in the sheet and come down from heaven. We should have confidence in what comes down from heaven. The voice tells Peter to slay and eat; it is not slaying men, but slaying beasts, making them available for food. All is typical -- to show that what God had cleansed in a spiritual sense should be appropriated in this sense.
C.S.P. Is the thought that when a man is converted, he is slain?
J.T. Well, that is the way it works out, made available for the purpose in hand. That is what the type means, an element for the clean or unclean.
M.D.F.Jr. Our young brothers are asking one another, What is the difference between a man who makes a bullet and one who fires it?
J.T. You are serving for wages, and the government has certain work to do and you do it. What the government does with the product you make is not your business. We pay taxes: there is no question as to what the authorities do with the money. The governments of the world are ordained of God, and they represent Him in the work required of them. For this they need physical means to maintain order, involving the taking of human life, extending even to war. Christ's kingdom
{85}
in its present form recognises all this as we saw when considering @John 18, but it does not admit of christians using the sword, as the Lord's words to Peter and Pilate recorded in that chapter plainly show.
E.G.M. In verse 21 Peter is seen going down to the men who were sent to him from Cornelius, and he said, "Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye come?" He was ready to go now, but he would not yet have complete understanding of the situation because in verse 29 he says, "Wherefore also, having been sent for, I came without saying anything against it. I inquire therefore for what reason ye have sent for me". I suppose you take each step in faith as you come to it.
J.T. Just so; and in Simon's house he invited in those who came from Cornelius. Let us not forget that. It suggests that if you come to a town to serve the Lord and a brother receives you into his house you may have liberty to invite others to it. Peter invited them in. He did not ask his host to invite them in. "Having therefore invited them in, he lodged them. And on the morrow, rising up he went away with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa went with him". All this points to the liberty marking Christ's kingdom.
J.A.W. Is it not interesting that Peter, although evidently not quite clear in his mind as to why he was going, moved in faith and obedience, verse 23? And in verse 24 it is said that "Cornelius was looking for them". There is faith in the receiver and in the one who was sent.
J.T. Just so. Peter is now the object of attention. The Spirit of God occupies us with Peter as an adjusted man; heaven taking account of him in this way. "And on the morrow they came to Caesarea. But Cornelius was looking for them, having called together his kinsmen and his intimate friends. And when Peter was now
{86}
coming in, Cornelius met him, and falling down did him homage". Cornelius was looking for them, and "falling down, did him homage". That is remarkable. Peter is tested and through this a needed truth is asserted -- that the most honoured of Christ's servants is not an object of worship. Peter is a representative of heaven, but his so-called successor is not a representative of heaven. He who sits in the Vatican would accept as due to him the reverence which Cornelius rendered Peter. But the apostle here is in accord with the Lord's designations, "my kingdom" and "my servants". He said to Cornelius, "Rise up: I myself also am a man". He is thoroughly with the Lord Jesus as the Son of man standing at the right hand of God. He is working for heaven. So that the record is very beautiful as developing what the Lord designates as "my kingdom" and those He calls "my servants". To Cornelius and his company Peter explains the position in relation to Christ in a general way, and he preaches the gospel to them. And the Spirit fell on those men who are listening to the apostle's words -- a wonderful scene of heavenly operations! "While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word. And the faithful of the circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that upon the nations also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out: for they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered, Can any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did? And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord. Then they begged him to stay some days". So that is the finish of this great administrative service committed by the Lord to Peter according to @Matthew 16 and by the grace and guidance of the Spirit carried out so successfully, as we have seen in the chapter before us.
{87}
CHRIST'S KINGDOM NOT OF THIS WORLD (5)
@Hebrews 8:1 - 6; @Ephesians 2: 4 - 10
J.T. These chapters will enable us to see how the subject before us enters into the service of God. They treat of the heavenly side of the believer's position. Hebrews has been regarded as 'the book of the opened heavens'. Not in the literal sense in which we have already spoken of the opened heavens, but in a truly spiritual way. There "we see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour". The passage read calls attention to the fact that if He were on earth He would not be a priest; He is a priest in heaven. "We have such a one high priest who has sat on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man".
These facts enter into our services on the first day of the week, and indeed generally, but especially on the first day of the week, involving a rising trend. The passage in Ephesians has been read because it tells us that we are raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. The trend in the services is heavenly and really prepares us for our ascension into heaven. That is the normal consummation of the whole matter of divine service as entrusted to the assembly. It will continue eternally because God will be glorified in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages.
The idea of elevation, an upward trend in the service, is in keeping with what we have been saying and prepares us for our heavenly part. The service of God as in the assembly will continue in its own heavenly way. And the service of God will resume its place in Israel as down here. Primarily it was committed to Israel, and it will again take its place in Israel restored;
{88}
whereas the service of the assembly will continue eternally.
R.R.T. So that what we began with in this series of meetings was the negative side of the subject, "My kingdom is not of this world". But now we have come to what essentially is positive.
J.T. Yes; it bears on our translation to heaven. The Lord purposes that we should become accustomed to elevation. The apostle Paul says, "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago ... caught up to the third heaven ... into paradise" (@2 Corinthians 12: 2 - 4), as if to mark off the altitude of the assembly's place. And Ephesians contemplates that we who form the assembly are blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies.
J.L.F. So the scripture in Hebrews would indicate how much "better" what we have come to is than what had obtained before.
J.T. Yes. So that Paul says, "*We* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh" (@Philippians 3: 3). That is christian service and it will continue essentially in eternity where God is to be glorified in the assembly throughout all generations of the age of ages. In christianity everything takes on the character of the best. Hebrews contemplates what is "better" than the Old Testament dispensations had.
E.G.M. Why is the priest so greatly stressed -- "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens".
J.T. It is to call attention to Christ's personal greatness -- what the writer had specially spoken of: "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens". It is alluded to in @Hebrews 1: 3, "set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high". It is in each case to bring out His deity. He has the right or liberty to thus place Himself. Here
{89}
it specially brings out the greatness of His priesthood. It is "We have such a one high priest" -- *we* have Him. The superiority of christianity is implied. The Jewish system was not to be compared with it, or any other system; the greatest of them is not to be compared with what is inaugurated in heaven. It is what *we have*. In verse 26 of the previous chapter it is said, "such a high priest became us", pointing to the calling of the saints; what is on earth is not good enough, as we have seen, the Lord said, "my kingdom is not from hence". It is a heavenly system and it is needful, too, because of the dignity of the saints of the present dispensation.
M.D.F. The service now would be in sonship.
J.T. That is in accord with what we are saying. It is said in chapter 2 that God is bringing many sons to glory, the service is in that connection. So that "he that sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren" (@Hebrews 2: 11). The service is on those lines; it is not only the great Priest but the great persons who are associated with Him and to whom He is Priest.
P.H. Would you say just a little more about "such a high priest became us"?
J.T. Well; it brings out the greatness of the saints in this dispensation. At Pentecost these great facts did not fully come out. They awaited Paul's ministry. This epistle stresses the superiority of christianity to the previous dispensation and even to the future dispensation; the "us" refers to christians; what attaches to them because of being subjects of divine purpose -- chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. Christ only could be their High Priest.
C.A.M. Christ being the Priest, the greatness of the system is determined. Whatever religious system we are thinking about, if we know what kind of a priest it has, we know the character of a system.
J.T. Yes, it is said "as the people so the priest" (@Hosea 4: 9).
{90}
Think of needing, according to divine thoughts, such a glorious Priest -- no less than a divine Person who sets Himself down at the right hand of the throne on high!
C.A.M. It says in the last verse of chapter 7, "a Son perfected for ever". Speaking of Aaron and his sons in the Old Testament, where do you place that in the New Testament?
J.T. Well, it is alluded to formally in Peter, that christians are a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices. We are not really called priests in Hebrews but it is inferred in that we are sons. The sons are priests as the Great High Priest is Son. In Exodus Moses is directed to take Aaron his brother, "and his sons with him", that he might serve God as priest. Then Jehovah associates with Aaron his sons by name: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. The habiliments of Aaron are described first -- most gorgeous and varied; then the attire of the sons, much less gorgeous, but nevertheless garments of glory and beauty. The garments denote divine thoughts as to the persons of the priesthood. God is expressing His thoughts about us by the clothing He accords us. So it is with the bride, the Lamb's wife, she is dignified by the kind of clothing she is given to appear in -- to her is granted that she shall be arrayed in fine linen clean and bright, which is the righteousnesses of the saints. I think the garments indicate the dignity of the persons, the divine thoughts about them in that sense.
J.L.F. As to @Hebrews 2: 10, "bringing many sons to glory", is it right to raise the question as to whose sons they are, or the full character of them?
J.T. They are sons of God, we know from other scriptures. Their dignity is expressed in the family relationship in which they stand with God.
J.L.F. Then there is the thought of "Behold, I and the children which God has given me" (@Hebrews 2: 13).
{91}
J.T. Well, there it is "children", of course; we are not viewed as children in heaven, we are viewed as sons; the assembly of the firstborn registered in heaven, they are firstborn, viewed as sons. Everyone there is a firstborn. It is a remarkable thing.
C.H.H. Would the naming of the sons of Aaron involve distinction in personality and individuality, everyone having a distinction?
J.T. I think that is how the truth stands. In @Exodus 6 we get the priesthood, the genealogy of the tribes to Levi, indicating that the priesthood is in mind. It is proceeded with until the Spirit arrives at Levi. And then Aaron and Moses are born -- they being especially in view. Eleazar and Phinehas also have special notice, both having important places in the testimony. The priestly line ran down in that way.
H.G. That would not be necessary now, due to the fact that Christ is Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. Is that the suggestion here?
J.T. Quite so; that is the point that is made. Aaron's priesthood is contrasted in chapter 7, that he was hindered by reason of death; but Christ as Son is Priest perfected for ever.
A.D.S. Have you not said that sonship underlies priesthood?
J.T. Well, it must; that is the idea.
A.D.S. One sees that in relation to the sons of Aaron, but how do You apply it to Aaron?
J.T. Sonship applied to Israel in the Old Testament. Aaron is a *type* of Christ, not because Aaron was a son, but that God took him up in that way. He told Moses to take Aaron his brother; as the brother of the mediator, he was *typically* Christ. In our epistle Christ is Apostle and High Priest of our confession -- the two offices in one Person; and the teaching bases that position on sonship. So that He is Son over the house. Moses was a servant in God's house.
{92}
M.D.F. Sons of Aaron would be what God is looking for now -- priesthood continued in sons.
J.T. Yes, each high priest would be son of Aaron, but Melchisedec is the great type of priesthood in Hebrews, and he *lives*. So there is no other high priest. Aaron is recognised as typifying Christ in *function* in our dispensation. Melchisedec is a type of Christ's personality as he is without father, mother, or genealogy; "having neither beginning of days nor end of life", he "abides a priest continually". But Melchisedec is not said to have any sons; so that we have to go to Aaron for the priesthood in its function in our dispensation, and it is a heavenly priesthood. Hebrews speaks of Christ being the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: this passage refers to Moses and Aaron, Christ combining in His Person both types.
C.A.M. If I understand, when you are thinking of the priestly service of Christ, Aaron comes into view, but as to the Person you are thinking of Melchisedec.
J.T. Yes. Melchisedec denotes the Person; One really a divine Person. But Aaron's service is a pattern of the service that Christ carries on now.
C.H.H. In @1 Chronicles 24 lots are cast for the priests, each one being named. Would that involve that personality would give a peculiar touch to the way they ministered?
J.T. No doubt each priest would have his own distinction, and each singer too; that opens up the economy under David, but Hebrews alludes to the economy under Moses; it is what was in the tabernacle. The tabernacle is said in our chapter to be a figure of heavenly things. It says, "If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer gifts according to the law, (who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told when about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make
{93}
all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.)" verses 4, 5. It is the service in the tabernacle that is in mind in Hebrews, because we are viewed as on the way to heaven as they were on the way to the land, and the tabernacle was the pattern of heavenly things. It was God's house and the service was carried on there, and thus Aaron comes in. There were priests before Aaron, we are told in @Exodus 19; there were priests and young men acting as priests, but it is when we have Christ prefigured in the Hebrew bondman as possessed of love in all its features, that we have the full thought of priesthood brought in. When the tabernacle is described on the mount, the pattern of it given to Moses, then there must be this priesthood. There must be approach to God and hence the need of priests. So that Aaron is introduced in chapter 28 to be in this capacity, and his sons as well; so that we have there the suggestion of the service going on at the present time. Christ is priest above, and we are priests, too: sons of Aaron, so to say, to offer up, as Peter says, spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God.
The priesthood around us in the various denominations is not what Scripture presents. In these, Jewish and heathen habiliments and practices supersede the spiritual qualities of Christ and the saints. Indeed if Christ, according to the description we have of Him, were literally here He would not be admitted in Rome, nor in the Anglican system; He would not qualify.
H.G. What is the distinction between chapter 2, where in the midst of the assembly Christ sings praises, and what we get here?
J.T. It is not much. Priesthood is involved there, verse 11 speaks of it. "He that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one". That would involve Aaron and his sons, only "those sanctified" are not *called* priests. God is bringing many sons to glory and the Captain of their salvation is perfected through suffering.
{94}
It became God that the Leader of those brought to glory should go through sufferings. So the passage goes on to say, "Both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one;" that is, we are all of one kind and that qualifies us for this heavenly priesthood; we are the same as the Great Priest in that sense. Then He praises in the midst of the assembly. That is what we have before us to arrive at in this meeting -- how the service of God is carried on in the assembly.
H.G. Does that imply that if Christ is High Priest it involves others?
J.T. It involves that there are other priests, "all of one" with Him as stated in Hebrews. Peter says that we are "a holy priesthood ... acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 2: 5).
P.H. In order to do that would you have to come out from all religious systems having official priests?
J.T. Certainly, true priesthood of christians would not be owned there, as already remarked; not that there are no christians there, but in those systems priesthood is according to man. Nominal christians are marked off as clergy and laity, whereas Scripture regards all true believers in Christ as priests, as already noted. According to Scripture, divine service can be found only where Christ is owned as High Priest and all true christians as priests.
P.H. Are you considering an ordained minister an official priest?
J.T. As in Rome, and the Anglican system and the Greek; yes. Indeed the idea of priesthood attaches generally to all so-called ordained ministers or clergymen. It is no question now of attacking them, but only to bring out the truth. As remarked before, if Christ were on earth He would not be a priest; He could not qualify. The high priesthood of Israel rejected Him and put Him to death.
{95}
D.R. What are the services of priesthood that we have been brought into?
J.T. That brings us down to what the apostle said in writing to the Philippians, that "*we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh" (@Philippians 3: 3). That largely governs the principles of christian service. The word worship in this verse refers to the public service of God. The apostle states that christians¬ worship is by the Spirit of God -- not by a mere ritual. Our Priest has not been constituted according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life, @Hebrews 7: 16.
J.L.F. Do these three things mentioned in the verses read, a more excellent ministry, a better covenant, and better promises, have any bearing on service?
J.T. They do; they largely constitute and enrich the ministry. Paul enlarges on this subject in a striking way in @2 Corinthians 3. It is a ministry of liberty, including the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit, which abounds in glory; a ministry in which those who have part in it behold the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the same image from glory to glory. Further, as in @Galatians 4 and @Romans 8, christians have received the Spirit of God's Son crying, "Abba, Father". Therefore, we should not be tied up as in the service; we should be free to address God as "Abba, Father".
That cry was heard from Gethsemane. Gethsemane is a place of pressure, but in spite of the pressure the Lord said, "Abba, Father". He was above the pressure. The assembly normally is not a place of pressure, the pressure is all gone; the heavens are opened to us; we are set up in the light of Christ up there, and He comes to us according to His promise, @John 14: 18.
E.G.M. Is that why we have a mediator mentioned
{96}
in our chapter -- to set us free and support us in the service?
J.T. Yes. He is "the mediator of a better covenant;" through Him the called "receive the promise of the eternal inheritance". This is to bring out the kind of people He would have in the service. It is a more excellent ministry, by so much as He is mediator of a better covenant, which is established on the footing of better promises. This all enters into our part in assembly service. We should not be hampered or tied up, but in liberty; the Lord's supper is intended to liberate us. The bread and the cup are a dual testimony, bearing upon us to set us free in the assembly, the new covenant being included, as we have seen.
J.S.C. What is the distinction between the High Priest and the Minister of the holy places?
J.T. High Priest is that He is high above all; He is also called a Great Priest; it is a commensurate idea; He is *great* morally. He will set you free; He is not harsh or demanding. As you come into contact with Christ you prove how great He is morally. He is High Priest over the house of God. It is an official matter that He takes on the service of God in the true tabernacle, as Aaron took it on in the old. In order to understand the Aaronic service you have to understand Leviticus. Exodus is the setting up of the system including the typical dignity and glory of the high priest, but in Leviticus God is *in* the tabernacle, there to be approached, and the priesthood is there that you may approach. The sons of Aaron were to serve the worshippers, and some of them might be very poor. In Eli's time they were very low morally, they were wicked. But look at the kind of priesthood we have! So we are to be entirely free from everything that would hinder us to approach God. "Let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith" (@Hebrews 10: 22).
C.H.H. Although worshipping the Father is not
{97}
mentioned in Hebrews, does what you say involve the framework and basis for it?
J.T. Yes. Hebrews is really very initial because it is dealing with Jewish christians who were in danger of giving up christianity, and the writer is endeavouring to push them on, holding out to them with great vividness the great and glorious things set up in Christ in heaven. If they gave up what was presented, they would go back to apostasy and utter darkness for ever. This epistle, therefore, is devoted to the truth of the opened heavens, as if to say, There is nothing better, why give it up? There is nothing better; indeed there is nothing else. Going back is eternal ruin.
D.R. What did Christ offer?
J.T. He offered Himself. "Every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer" (@Hebrews 8: 3). This chapter and the two following up to the end of @Hebrews 10: 18 show the greatness of what He offered. In @Hebrews 9: 1 - 10 we have the tabernacle alluded to. "The first therefore" (meaning the tabernacle) "also indeed had ordinances of service, and the sanctuary, a worldly one. For a tabernacle was set up; the first, in which were both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of the loaves, which is called Holy; but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies, having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant; and above over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which it is not now the time to speak in detail".
"Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services; but into the second, the high priest only,
{98}
once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people: the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the holy of holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has its standing; the which is an image for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices, unable to perfect as to conscience him that worshipped, are offered, consisting only of meats and drinks and divers washings, ordinances of flesh, imposed until the time of setting things right".
Then we come to Christ's service: "But Christ being come high priest of the good things to come, by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation,) nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the holy of holies, having found an eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh, how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship the living God?" verses 11 - 14.
There it is: He had something to offer. He offered Himself.
D.R. So that would be one feature of the present dispensation as compared with the past, that in the past the priests had certain sacrifices to offer. The basis of the present dispensation is that Christ has offered Himself.
J.T. That is right, so that we have the basis for an eternal inheritance. The passages show that He is set up as Man in eternal relations with God, in relation to the true tabernacle. That is the great point for us to lay hold of now. The old tabernacle was a type of heavenly things, and that is christianity. We serve in the antitype, the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not of this creation; it is a heavenly thing.
{99}
E.G.M. What constitutes the "true" and "perfect" tabernacle?
J.T. It is in contrast to the material or physical structure. It is the great moral system of things in which God is apprehended in Christ, and in which through Him we approach God.
C.A.M. It is a heavenly thing and we are in the enjoyment of it now. How far in your mind does this glorious service go on? According to Ephesians eternity seems to surround all. Does this service enter into eternity?
J.T. Quite so. We have noted in our chapter that if Christ were on earth He would not be a priest; His priesthood awaited His going into heaven. It is not that He did not exercise priesthood in a true sense while here below, because it is said in chapter 9 that He came in connection with this new system, "Christ being come high priest of the good things to come, by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation)" verse 11. We have to consider what the Spirit of God is speaking about. Christ being come -- that is the incarnation. He owned provisionally the temple at Jerusalem, but He did not present Himself there as an official priest. Nevertheless He was a real priest, and the idea of the true tabernacle was in His heart, in fact, He was it Himself. Still, as I said, He recognised the temple. In His boyhood He went up to Jerusalem with His parents to the convocation, and He was found in the temple at the age of twelve. He could not go into the holy places, because He was not of the tribe of Levi; He was of the tribe of Judah. But the true Aaron was there notwithstanding. Of the ten lepers who were cleansed, one came back glorifying God and failing at the Lord's feet gave Him thanks, @Luke 17: 15, 16. That was in principle the true tabernacle. To the blind man that received his sight (@John 9: 35) the Lord says, "Dost thou believe on the
{100}
Son of God?" He is introducing the new tabernacle, not, of course, yet formally. The man says, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe?" He was ready for the new thing. The Lord says, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord; and he did him homage" verses 36 - 38. The Lord had already said to the Jews, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up ... . He spoke of the temple of his body". As Christ was risen from among the dead by the Father's glory, the true tabernacle became more and more indicated, although, of course, the full thought awaited His ascension and the Spirit come down, forming the assembly. It should be remembered that the first day of the week was inaugurated by the Father's glory. The greatest thing in the sense of glory began the first day of the week. The Father raised His Son from the dead. On that day the Lord joined two that were going to Emmaus, and He opened up wonderful things to them. He began at Moses and in all the prophets expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. Doubtless He would refer to Moses and Aaron as seen in Exodus; *He* was the true Apostle and High Priest. Then He would go to Leviticus and so on. Suppose He came to @Psalm 22: 22 -- "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee". He would say, I am the Person spoken of there. Their hearts began to burn. And then He went into the house and sat at table, He took the bread blessed and, having broken it, gave it to them. He was Head -- He took the house-father's place. In full effect He is Son over the house of God. The two were being impressed with what was later unfolded through the apostle Paul. The Lord was impressing their understanding, and then they recognised Him and He disappeared from them.
They went back to Jerusalem, and as they gathered
{101}
with the disciples and were telling them of what happened, and how He was made known to them in the breaking of bread, the Lord stood in their midst. Then He opened their understanding and instructed them, led them out to Bethany, and having lifted up His hands, He blessed them. And He was carried up into heaven. They worshipped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. The true tabernacle was in mind in all this. The Spirit came down, and later Paul by His power unfolds the truth of the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man.
C.A.M. I think that is very impressive.
J.T. The book of Acts would teach us as to the various parts of the tabernacle set up, but it was a pattern of things in the heavens; it was a heavenly system, and so the vessel comes down to Peter. It comes out of heaven and goes back into heaven.
R.R.T. In regard to the Spirit, I would like to ask as to @Hebrews 9: 14, "How much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship the living God?" It is a remarkable verse; we have there the Spirit, Christ, God, and the saints. What is the force of that word, "Who by the eternal Spirit offered himself"?
J.T. This point begins, as we have already remarked, in verse 11, that is, that Christ came in relation to certain things: "by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation,) nor by blood of goats, and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the holy of holies, having found an eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh, how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit
{102}
offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship the living God?"
We have already enlarged on the better and more perfect tabernacle. Then Christ also came in relation to the means of atonement -- that is, by His own blood; "having found", through it, "an eternal redemption". And then the writer proceeds to add the great thought of the purifying of our conscience from dead works to worship the living God, saying, "how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship the living God".
R.R.T. In your word this morning you brought in the important thought that the assembly cannot function at all to the pleasure of God apart from the Spirit. And here we have the great thought that the Lord offered Himself to God by the eternal Spirit. It would mark this dispensation, that if the assembly is to function it must be in the light of the Lord offering Himself by the eternal Spirit; and our worship must also be in the Spirit.
J.T. That is exactly what the apostle said: "*we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God" (@Philippians 3: 3) -- not by outward forms. And the Lord Himself had already said, "Ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father. ... the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; ... God is a spirit and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth" (@John 4: 21 - 24). For completion of the new divine system and the service involved in it the apostles had to wait for the Spirit. Being assembled with the disciples before ascending, the Lord commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but await the promise of the Father. Hence the sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind. It was the Spirit m power coming in. Thus the service of the new
{103}
tabernacle should proceed, and that is what, through the mercy of God, has been recovered to us and what we are engaged with week by week. It will go on eternally. @Ephesians 3: 21 says, "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".
The passage in Ephesians was read to point out that the service of God in the assembly *rises*. Paul was caught up as far as the third heaven (@2 Corinthians 12: 2). I believe that is an allusion to creature limitations. We do not enter into uncreated conditions; the Lord Jesus did, He "ascended up above all the heavens" (@Ephesians 4: 10), which is an infinite thought. It refers to an uncreated condition that we can never touch. Ephesians has "the heavenlies", conveying what is characteristically heavenly as to *place*. Paul in 2 Corinthians is specific as to elevation. He was caught up to the third heaven -- as far as that. But he says he was caught up *into* paradise, and he heard unutterable things said. So that in @Ephesians 2 we are said to have been raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ. It is the plural. I had thought only of adding these remarks as giving the fulness of the truth before us, completing the whole subject.
{104}
LEADERSHIP (1)
@Exodus 2: 11 - 22; @Acts 7: 30 - 36
J.T. I was thinking about leadership. The basic thought in mind is taken from the prophet Micah: Moses, Aaron and Miriam being sent before Israel in the wilderness. It was thought that we might look at these three leaders and then at others that are linked with them: Eleazar, and Joshua, five in all, who had to do with the great typical movement of God involving leadership in a most definite way. No servant in the Old Testament has more space given to him in history than Moses, so we have to be selective in our remarks about him in the time allotted to us. His childhood and boyhood are known very well to us, so that we shall hardly need to touch on the early stages of his history, but rather on what applies to him in his service or leadership.
The account of Aaron's history is comparatively brief and Miriam's is much briefer. Eleazar is important and so is Joshua. It is a question of skill to allot to each his place. Moses comes first, being the greatest servant of the Old Testament, a full type of Christ as prophet. He speaks of himself as a type of Christ, that God would raise up a prophet after him "like unto me". The Spirit of God honours him as being allowed to appear on the mount speaking to the Lord.
What is in mind first is to refer to his decision when he came to Midian, in view of the much service, and the many servants today, for whom we may give thanks. We might look at the definite features that marked Moses as moving, before he is inducted into the service. He had grown up to be a man of forty years of age, in a position of great distinction as a man of this world. He had of himself made a definite move: "And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went
{105}
out to his brethren and looked on their burdens" (@Exodus 2: 11).
A.P.T. In @Hebrews 11 it is said that he "chose".
J.T. Yes; he reached his decision after his experience in the world. We are told that he was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and deeds; but the definite point is in his decision -- the stress as to definiteness. The first point is definiteness at one's own volition, and at one's own cost, so that he came into persecution.
J.D. Do you think that there is secret soul history seen in Moses in the words, "when Moses was grown;" that there had been a previous education in relation to the work of God in his soul before he revealed himself to his brethren?
J.T. Well, there must have been; but it is recorded as on *his* side, the movement is directly from himself. In Hebrews faith is stressed, "By faith Moses, when he had become great", and the skill and method of the Spirit in the record would be to help other servants as to what we do from our own side, so that the credit is to us. God retires, as it were, if He has a certain thing in mind and if He wishes to set out a certain model for us. The record has that in view. So that it reads, "And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown". @Hebrews 11: 24 - 26, referring to this part of the history says, "By faith Moses, when he had become great, refused to be called son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God than to have the temporary pleasure of sin; esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he had respect to the recompense". It is all put on his side.
I thought that would be the lesson for us to begin with. An allusion is made to his place in Egypt and to his refusal; the word "refused" is used, then "choosing" and then "esteeming", and the root explanation, that
{106}
"he had respect to the recompense". It has an application to our early experience and how we come to take part in the work of God, and begin to take part in the service of God. It is a question as to whether we are definite, fully estimating where we have been, or we shall surely go back to it; and choosing at our own expense, knowing that it involves loss but having respect to the recompense. This line of action intimates that the service of God cannot add to me as a man in this world, nor is it intended to add to my material circumstances. I believe that is what this chapter teaches.
A.E.H. The Spirit of God is crediting Moses with having arrived at the sober estimate of Egypt; and he is ready now to subordinate that to what God is to get.
J.T. Yes. He took full advantage of the choosing and estimating which he had the opportunity of testing out. He was mighty in words and deeds. He had evidently acquired what was available to such a young man and deliberately gave it up on the principle of appraisal, knowing what the consequences would be, or he would be likely to revert to it again. It is one of the most important things in service.
Ques. Would looking on their burdens have a part in this?
J.T. That shows what a man he was; he could take account of the sufferings of others, anticipating, without knowing it, what God was going to give him to do. God looked on the burdens of His people too, and heard their groans. He is in accord with the divine current at the moment. If we are not in the divine current in some sense, we shall be running up against elements that God is using, not knowing what we are doing. We want to come into the divine current.
C.H.H. In the sovereignty of God could what he was taught in Egypt be used in service?
J.T. No doubt it was, but in his own estimation it
{107}
was not of much account. He protested to Jehovah that he could not speak, yet he was mighty in words and deeds earlier.
R.A. Does "when he was grown" suggest a point reached in his history?
J.T. That is what is meant; it was when he was forty years old. His life is divided into three forty-year periods. We are beginning with the forty-first year. He is entering on the second forty years of his life.
Rem. What you said about being in the current is very important. Leadership in any measure involves that all should be under the Lord's control, that we should not get in one another's way.
J.T. I thought it would be helpful to notice that he came into the current of things. Apollos was an independent work of God. He went from Alexandria and arrived at Ephesus where Paul's greatest work was to take place. He was not altogether clear about what was current, but he came into contact with two who could tell him "of the way of God more exactly". Aquila and Priscilla showed him the way of God more exactly, which he evidently accepted. Apollos encountered no difficulties; he was thoroughly in the current of the work of God. Although some of the Corinthians would set him up against Paul, yet there is no indication whatever that he encouraged that. He was not minded to go to Corinth, as though he would not countenance opposition to Paul.
J.D. Do you think that the features of leadership begin to show themselves when one hears the brethren?
J.T. I think it calls for a feeling man. The work of God requires one who feels how things are. The Spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters in @Genesis 1, which is a good indication of what enters into leadership, taking into account all the conditions that you have to deal with and feeling them.
J.D. I was thinking of the Lord in Luke's gospel
{108}
when He saw the city, He wept because of what would befall it, involving deep feelings.
J.T. So Nehemiah is a very feeling man. He wept when he heard of conditions at Jerusalem; he grieved so much that it was apparent before the king. That is a good beginning. When he arrives at Jerusalem, he goes out at night and surveys the conditions of the city.
J.D. Mordecai cried with a loud and bitter cry when the judgment went forth against his people.
J.T. So Moses "went out to his brethren and looked on their burdens". Then he would put two of his brethren right, as we have often noted. "Why art thou smiting thy neighbour?" That is a good feature because there is so much smiting. Stephen comments on this. The one who was wrong said, "Who established thee ruler and judge over us?" (@Acts 7: 27).
J.D. Is it to be noted in this question of leadership that forty years ago the boy wept? That would be carried forward; the Spirit of God would take notice of all the feelings in the boy.
J.T. Quite so.
A.R. We might suffer at the hands of the world, and that is bad enough, an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew; but two brothers quarrelling is very serious.
J.T. This incident shows how difficult it is to deal with such a circumstance, but yet it should be dealt with.
A.E.H. He looked at their burdens; it is the burdens that cause deep feelings and sorrow.
J.T. As we were saying, that is an indication that he is already in the current of the mind of God, an important thing. There is always a current, God is always operating.
J.T.Jr. Being delivered from the Egyptian current would be the beginning for us. The river is in the previous paragraph. Moses as delivered from the
{109}
influence of nature is able to move in the current of God's mind.
J.T. He was drawn out of the river by Pharaoh's daughter. His name means that. But then, the current of Egypt was there in Pharaoh's house, and it brings out all the more his power of decision in leaving that. It is the deliberate decision that we ought to notice; knowing just what he has left, and in some sense knowing what he is coming into. He had not long to wait to discover what he was coming into: firstly, the burdens that were there, and secondly, the dispositions of the persons he was seeking to serve and the refusal on their part to be served. In looking over Stephen's comments we have a side-light on the verses read: "This Moses, whom they refused, saying, Who made thee ruler and judge? him did God send to be a ruler and deliverer with the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush" (@Acts 7: 35). And then an emphatic he, in "*He* led them out". *He* is this man. Whatever the attitude of the persons, *he* is God's man and he will come into the thought that was in his heart. The right thought was in his heart. So after a decision in the service we have to make up our minds for opposition from the brethren as well as from Pharaoh. Opposition comes from the brethren first.
C.DeB. The brethren misunderstood him. They did not understand the motives really that he had before him.
J.T. That is what it states. Why did they not understand? Would they have any knowledge of who he was? Why should he be coming out to them? It is worth while inquiring into it and not to set ourselves up against such a man. Let us look into the matter.
Rem. It was the man that was in the wrong who became the spokesman in this verse.
J.T. We may be sure that as there is refusal of help it is on the part of the wrong-doer. The man who
{110}
is in the current of the mind of God is ready to be helped. The lesson is, make full inquiry before refusing assistance.
H.B. It says that Moses wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. Is there something that answers to that in our day?
J.T. There are literally signs and wonders according to Mark. "These signs shall follow", the Lord told the eleven, but not simply because they were apostles. Indeed they are not called apostles in the passage alluded to. "And these signs shall follow those that have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well" (@Mark 16: 17, 18). That is the sort of thing. With Mark it is a question of believing, "those that have believed". In our service there should be *faith*.
J.S. Do we have leadership added to this, the thought of "ruler and judge"?
J.T. The point is that what they needed he accomplished. They said, "Who made thee ruler and judge?" but "him did God send to be a ruler and deliverer". He did the work. That is the test. Is the brother doing the work? The apostle says, "he worketh the work of the Lord as I also do". That is the question, Is he doing the work?
C.A.M. Would you say that, after the decision is made, the course that things take to work the matter out will be in the hands of God? Really a state of things develops that Moses would not have chosen at all.
J.T. The successive steps bring out in principle what a servant may look for. Pharaoh heard of this political incident and sought to slay Moses, but Moses fled from before Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of
{111}
Midian. It is said in Hebrews, in the passage I alluded to already, that he did not fear the wrath of the king. "By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible". The rulers and the powers that be may turn against us, and we may be overwhelmed. So that all these features of the servants of old are recorded for our use in service. Therefore we are told here that Moses fled from before Pharaoh; but the Spirit of God in Hebrews says that he did not fear, because that would be a question of his state. The fleeing is not a question of his state, but the fearing is. Fear would damage many and render them useless for service. "Not fearing the wrath of the king; for he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible". He saw Him who is invisible, that is the way it is recorded. There is a greater than the king, which would alleviate my fears so that I can go on. It was a long way to Midian but Moses knew what to do; he was learning all the way. He was not overcome by the fear of Pharaoh. It says in verse 23, "And it came to pass during those many days, that the king of Egypt died". God deals with him from whom he fled. In the meantime he is occupied with Him who is invisible, a very important point for us. Otherwise we shall not be available.
Ques. Must we therefore leave the slaying of the Egyptian to God in His governmental dealings?
J.T. Leave the fear of such obstacles too.
A.E.H. In the land of Midian he sits by the well, serving in a limited way, but still serving.
J.T. That is the next thing. The question of fear that might be in his heart is settled, because according to the Spirit of God there is not any. He fears God, that is, he sees Him who is invisible. He sees God in all this. Ultimately he goes back to Egypt after God deals with Pharaoh, but in the meantime he is not idle. He sat by the well and very soon work appeared before
{112}
him in these women coming with their father's sheep. It says, "And the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs, to water their father's flock. And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses rose and helped them, and watered their flock". He is not using his physical power to deal with the situation at all, which is a beautiful trait in a servant. He helped the women. The women represent weakness, but the Spirit joins itself to our weakness in devoted service. They are watering their father's sheep. He did not attack the shepherds. They drove the women away, "but Moses rose and helped them, and watered their flock". He joins himself to what the women were doing and he is successful -- the flock is watered. There is something done and done well. It is a very commendable piece of work over against what the shepherds did.
J.H.E. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah" (@Zechariah 4: 6).
J.T. It is a beautiful trait of the Spirit of God to join itself to our weakness. We are doing the thing, but He is helping us. Here it is this generous trait in Moses, and we shall see it in Eleazar this afternoon. It is a question of a servant developing and coming fully into his service. He is not in it yet, he is not put into it immediately, but this is happening in the meantime.
E.G.McA. Would this acceptance of limitations by Moses in going to Midian bring out the development of what was in the man; and when his education had reached the right point God removed the opposition?
J.T. That is what comes out. It was when the time came; verse 23 says, "it came to pass during those many days". Moses is going through something, but then God is acting governmentally at the same time. "It came to pass during those many days, that the king of Egypt died". It required years, though he would
{113}
die in a minute, but he must go, for God is saying that Pharaoh is in his way, an obstructer. He just dies in the ordinary way, no doubt, but God has His eye on him that he might be removed.
C.H.H. Would a similar case be seen in the history of the assembly in @Acts 12: 24 where Herod withstood the testimony and persecuted the saints? But he dies, and then "the word of God grew and spread itself".
J.T. And so in the case of Sennacherib when he defied Jehovah and His people, as recorded in @2 Kings 19. God had His eye on that man. It might be slow work, we are not told exactly; it might have taken twenty years after the 185,000 Assyrians were slain by the angel before Sennacherib was slain. That is, God keeps His eye on a thing -- during these many days. God has not withdrawn His eye from this thing that is going on in the world today, because His people are involved. Our prayers go on. Moses prayed, as to conditions in Egypt, and maybe Jethro. It is a question of what God is doing in "those many days;" during them the king of Egypt dies.
E.G.McA. This time was exercising for Moses. He had to develop patience and wait on God for instructions.
J.T. The idea of this chapter is that Moses is content; he "consented to remain with the man" -- no doubt contrary to his natural thoughts. While in Midian he might well revert back to the times he had in Egypt; but he consented to dwell with the man, not that he felt that it was any great advantage to him -- there is no evidence that Zipporah was particularly attractive. But God is keeping His eye on Pharaoh all the time.
J.D. Jethro says to his daughters, "where is he?" Would there be inquiry as to a man like that?
J.T. Quite so. You wonder at the women; they
{114}
are not like ordinary women. There must have been a lack of womanly interest in them. Here is a man that has delivered them and watered their flock, and they do nothing about him. Jethro is a good-minded man, a man in whom there is something of God. He is concerned rightly about Moses, not for getting a husband for one of his daughters. But still the mind of God went on, and there is the mention of the birth of Gershom. That is the thing to notice. "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land", Moses says. There is not much said of Zipporah, but still she is a type of the church; but the point here is the history of Moses. It is this child called Gershom who reminds Moses that he is "a sojourner in a foreign land". The servant has to experience the sense of being in a foreign land -- it is not congenial at all, but he was there forty years and worked well for his father-in-law. As we have been saying, he was taking on the traits of the Spirit of God. He sat by the well -- a type of the Spirit of God -- over against what he learned in Egypt. He began to rely on the Spirit, and the effect began to come out immediately. Instead of driving the shepherds away, he helps the women; he takes on the shepherd character. He would not have been taught to be a shepherd by the Egyptians. He is learning the spiritual side and throwing off the natural -- the Egyptian acquirements -- "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts". The apostle Paul is a full example of this. He says, "For I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified" (@1 Corinthians 2: 2). That is where the Spirit adds help to our weakness. The Lord was crucified in weakness, but He lives by the power of God. The servant has to come to that, that he does not have to rely on his natural acquirements.
C.A.M. The paragraph closes with sonship. Would you extend the thought to @Romans 8, that there
{115}
is a wonderful result always in being in accord with the Spirit's activities?
J.T. I think the first effect in his own mind as to children is the sense of being in a foreign land. I am not going to build myself up here, he would say. God says to Baruch in @Jeremiah 45: 5, Do not build yourself up here; "Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not". He is just a foreigner. Some have experienced that. In a foreign country there is usually a feeling of disadvantage -- Gershom is that; but Eliezer is another thing. He is not mentioned here, but in the wilderness, @Exodus 18: 4 says, "and the name of the other, Eliezer", which means 'help from God'. He says, "For the God of my father has been my help, and has delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh".
C.A.M. I was struck with what you said about his not acting against the shepherds with violence, but instead helping the women; and this being typical of what the Spirit does -- helping us in our weaknesses.
J.T. There are these two sons in Moses¬ house. One is, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land", and the other, "the God of my father has been my help, and has delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh". The power of God in a man's house -- that brings out what a man ought to be. So it is not what he learned in Egypt that enables him to execute the service entrusted to him; it is the help which he gets from God.
G.A.T. What did you have in mind about being in a foreign land?
J.T. In a moral sense, you do not identify yourself with the country in which you are. Moses did not become a citizen of Midian, he remained an alien and called his son by that name. Why did he call his son by that name? Because he was a foreigner. He was there under God's government and accepted the alienation involved.
{116}
H.B. Is that why as to Eliezer he says, "the God of my father has been my help"?
J.T. Yes, you might ask Moses, Why did you call him Eliezer? Because, he says, 'God is my help'. In the same way, I do not identify myself with a trades union, I trust God. It is a question of the state of my household. The names Moses gave to his sons were a constant testimony in his house.
Rem. The absence of these features in a household would greatly weaken leadership in the head of it, although otherwise right.
J.T. You have to accept that it is the government of God. If we accept it humbly, God will not forsake us. These two boys in the house would be a witness to the father's testimony.
F.N.W. "Esteeming the reproach of the Christ", would that have a bearing on this matter of his household?
J.T. It was a definite estimate of the reproach of Christ. Reproach attached to the name of these sons of Moses. He professed to be dependent on God -- helped by Him and not by political affiliation. And also he professed to be "a sojourner in a foreign land". This involved reproach and natural disadvantage.
A.E.H. Why, in this attitude of strangership, did Moses fail to circumcise his son?
J.T. That was a defect clearly. Evidently it was Zipporah who objected to it, but it was his responsibility, just as it is now the responsibility of every head to baptise his household in faith.
A.R. Paul says to Timothy that an overseer should conduct his own house well.
C.H.H. Would the fact that these two names are mentioned in @Exodus 18 suggest that Moses had retained these impressions through his forty years of experience?
J.T. Clearly. His family is mentioned where he
{117}
is in the very height of his work. God is actually using him, and he is devoting himself to the people; he is sitting there all day answering questions without complaint. It comes in there strikingly, and Jethro, too, shines there. So the facts would show that Moses¬ visiting Midian, and his relation with Jethro, was not detrimental to him, but God overruled it for blessing. As there is faithfulness, things that may seem to be detrimental in our marriages God will overrule for good beyond what we may expect. We have little idea how God loves a true servant, a man like Moses or David. David says, Jehovah chose me because He liked me; likeableness in him as made king is referred to.
A.P.T. "Hast thou considered my servant Job?" (@Job 1: 8).
J.T. Job had a place with God, although he had much to learn. God had His eye on him as His servant and would reach His end with him. Jehovah honoured him under this designation at the end as at the beginning. In view of the history that intervened this is most touching and should assure all who seek to serve God.
A.B. Do verses 21, 22 stand over against the end of verse 12, "He smote the Egyptian"? That was the end of that exercise, but in verses 21, 22 there is great fruitfulness as typically having the Spirit.
J.T. That is the thing to see, how God oversees the history of His servant in giving him this son and then another one; and how he links the latter with God -- "For the God of my father has been my help, and has delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh". What I think we should see is that normally the servant is peculiarly loved by God and occurrences favourable to him will come about. Moses is loved by God and God will do things for him.
E.G.McA. What do we learn from Moses¬ patience in the school of God for forty years?
{118}
J.T. He "consented to remain with the man", that is in keeping with his decision; he was a man who had made up his mind. He bows to the situation and God accepted that and honoured it. Patience in a servant is one of the greatest things.
J.T.Jr. He was not concerned about wages. He leaves that matter with God.
J.T. That comports with 'Eliezer' and God honours him. Jethro would not be an unfeeling man. There is no question here about wages, but Jacob made much of it. His father-in-law changed his wages ten times. How unfeeling we are -- taking advantage as to natural things of being in fellowship! That is what happened with Jacob and Laban. There is no question with Moses of wages. There is in this respect dignity attached to him. Unionism, in which some christians take refuge, is abhorrent to the mind of God, and it should be to the saints too.
C.H.H. The apostle Paul says, "*I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls" (@2 Corinthians 11: 15).
J.T. Quite so.
J.S. Would the forty years be a question of slow experience with God?
J.T. That is it; he is qualifying for the third chapter. We may have to touch on Moses again; we cannot leave out the third forty years, for that is where the full fruition is seen of all this experience. Even though things are against us, decision is the great point. He consented to dwell with the man.
Ques. Is there a link between the second forty years and the third forty years? Moses returned with his sons and the staff of God in his hand.
J.T. We will begin with that next time. The first thing in the third chapter is the vision. He led the flock behind the wilderness and came to the mountain of God -- to Horeb. That is a fine touch. And the angel of Jehovah appeared to him.
{119}
LEADERSHIP (2)
@Exodus 3: 1 - 6, 11 - 15; @Exodus 4: 21 - 23; @Exodus 32: 11 - 14; @Exodus 33: 7 - 11
J.T. This chapter begins the third phase of Moses¬ life, his third forty years. Undoubtedly, the one hundred and twenty years of Moses¬ life is intended, among other things, to afford God an opportunity to show His precious interest in His servants¬ histories. The third phase of Moses¬ life is the most fruitful one, the one to which divine honours belonged. The second chapter contemplates his history, as it were, by itself; it is not what God did in him, but what he did himself; spiritual history, however, is clearly marked. God was working in Aaron at the same time, but we hear nothing about him until he appears in his eighty-third year. We hope to dwell on that later.
Now in the third chapter God is having to say to Moses directly, and He brings out openly the results in Moses of his earlier experience. Applied to us this is when a brother's works show what he is secretly; he proves it openly, purchasing to himself a good degree. It is himself. But in this third phase God is working with Moses having in mind the great work He designed for him, beginning with this extraordinary experience of the bush. What transpires brings out the effect of the experience and education of the previous forty years. He turns aside to see what Jehovah would present to him. Thus his name is called twice as if he had been acquiring distinction in heaven. "And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush, and said, Moses, Moses! ... And he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob". The time had come for the coming great servant to become definitely acquainted with God. And it is "I AM THAT I AM". It is God in His essential Being, as this and subsequent scriptures
{120}
show, who is revealing Himself to Moses, and who is sending him to the children of Israel, and who is sending him to Pharaoh.
C.H.H. Would @Acts 13 where the apostle Paul gets his commission at Antioch correspond to Moses being committed definitely to service?
J.T. Yes. Earlier history had been the making time for the apostle. The fruit of this is now apparent. His novitiate was completed -- applying to the five year period of the Levite. He and Barnabas had served in the assembly for a whole year. Their work was honoured of God. The disciples were first called christians at Antioch. We have an allusion to the assembly there, which was the fruit of their service, and five names are given as distinct in the place. The Holy Spirit is free to act now and send him out. There is a definite sending forth by the Spirit. "Moses", we are told, "tended the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian". It is the second phase of his history. "And he led the flock behind the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God". That is the point to which the flock was led. Many would lead elsewhere, into blind alleys, the party-making principle would be that, but he led to the mountain of God -- to Horeb. The angel of Jehovah appeared to him in the midst of the thorn-bush, and the thorn-bush burned with fire but it was not being consumed. "And Moses said, Let me now turn aside and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt. And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see". That is the point. He is now ready for this great event. John says as to the Lord, "we have contemplated his glory".
J.D. Would you say a word as to the difference between Horeb and Sinai in connection with the question of leadership?
J.T. I think Horeb is grace. Sinai involves the terrors of the law, that is, what God is in His severity.
{121}
We read in Romans of the goodness and the severity of God. The goodness, I think, is seen in Horeb and the severity in Sinai. They are in the same range of mountains, but I refer to the way Scripture presents the facts.
J.D. Would the bush burning represent Israel?
J.T. Yes. It is not consumed. The burning went on and the bush was not consumed. God Himself was there -- "the good will of him that dwelt in the bush" (@Deuteronomy 33: 16). God was *dwelling* there. That is wonderful. Israel will appear in the future after all the extraordinary vicissitudes of God's discipline as not consumed, as the Israel of God.
R.W.S. Is it a question of the yield in quality now in Moses? Actually, it was only one-third of his life.
J.T. Well, I think it shows how much *making* is needed before we have the full result in any servant. This third phase had all the honours that could enter into it, all the decorations, all the loveliness too, for God was increasingly appreciative of Moses. He says in @Numbers 12 that there was no one like him, that he "was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth". Even prophets did not have his distinction. Jehovah says in @Numbers 12: 6, "If there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak to him in a dream. Not so my servant Moses: he is faithful in all my house. Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah doth he behold". A most unique distinction! It is not written for Moses; it is written for our sakes that we might aspire to acquire a place with God. God intimates that we all may be favourites. Each of us may discern what distinction he has with God.
J.D. What do you see in verse 3? That must have been most acceptable to God. He says, "Let me now turn aside and see this great sight". Does that fall in
{122}
line with what you said this morning as to being in the current of divine operations?
J.T. Quite so. It is pursuant of what we had; and now he is in the very centre of divine things. He turns aside to see what he calls "this great sight" -- why the thorn-bush was not burnt.
Ques. You are linking up this idea of leadership with moral qualities, are you not? Will you distinguish for us between leadership and gift?
J.T. That is a good point. We may have leadership without gift. It is really more a matter of moral quality -- by which others are influenced. It is the man, the person himself, that comes under God's notice as pleasurable to Him, as conforming to Christ, whom He would put forward among His people to lead them in the right way. At Nazareth, @Luke 4, it was the Lord's manner, not the exercise of gift. He did not say much; having read a passage, He commented on the scripture, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears". What the hearers noticed was "the words of grace that were coming out of his mouth;" His whole manner, and the proceedings. That is, I think, what affords leadership -- what one *is*. In the synagogue the Lord was conscious that He was anointed.
Ques. I notice that sometimes where there is evidence of gift, it is supposed that leadership is there too, necessarily. That would not be the case, would it?
J.T. No. You feel the vessel is marred unless there is likeability in it. He becomes endeared to God and to the saints by his manner. Paul says, "my ways as they are in Christ" (@1 Corinthians 4: 17). Timothy, his own child in the Lord, would put the Corinthians in mind of these ways.
A.A.T. In Moses¬ time there was one leader. Is it right to think there is more than one leader at a time?
J.T. We began this morning with *three* leaders in
{123}
Moses¬ time. Micah says God sent before Israel, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. That was the idea exactly. It was not that they walked before them literally, but morally. They were all at least eighty years of age before God began to use them, so he is telling us that God took great pains with the leaders He provided. God led Israel "like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron" (@Psalm 77: 20). Miriam led with them as we see in Micah.
A.P.T. It says in @Judges 5: 2, "leaders led in Israel".
J.T. That fits into this. It is a question, not simply of being a leader, but of *leading*.
G.A.T. Does the eighty years have anything to do with it?
J.T. God is indicating that being so old before being used, they had been long in His school. We have a life-size picture of Moses, not of the other two. Aaron is not mentioned until he is eighty-three and Miriam, if she is the one mentioned in @Exodus 2, is over ninety. I think that God has in mind to impress us with His care in preparing people to lead us, so that we are to respect them for the Lord's sake and for their own sake. "Remember your leaders", and then, "obey your leaders;" (@Hebrews 13: 7, 17). That is, remember the past ones and obey the present ones.
J.D. "Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith" (@Hebrews 13: 7). It is largely a question of state and conduct.
A.E.H. Do you attach emphasis to the personal pronoun "I" at the end of verse 4 -- the sense that he had in his own soul of being pleasurable to God?
J.T. He answers the definite word, "And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush and said, Moses, Moses!" His answer is, "Here am I". The repetition of his name would impress him with the fact that he
{124}
was divinely thought of. "Moses, Moses!" Great personal history entered into that definite address.
Ques. Would Moses¬ feelings be involved in the fact that God was saying to him that He was continuing in their midst? Would that come out in the thirty-second chapter?
J.T. Yes. God is now impressing him with the importance of the people, what they were to Him. In the thirty-second chapter Moses shows that he values the people, and God listens to him on that account. Here the people are in Jehovah's mind and He is impressing Moses with this fact. In verse 11, "Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? And he said, For I will be with thee; and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you. And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you. This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations". He is impressing Moses with the people and their importance in His mind. There is not time to go into it all. Jehovah goes on in verse 16, "Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I have indeed visited you, and seen that which is done unto you in Egypt; and I have said, I will bring you
{125}
up out of the affliction of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. And they shall hearken to thy voice". He is impressing Moses with the greatness of the people in His mind, and Moses is to respect them; so that the servant begins thus in the knowledge of God to see that the people necessarily are greater than himself. He is to be an instrument in God's hand for their blessing. "Ourselves your bondmen for Jesus¬ sake" (@2 Corinthians 4: 5). Every servant should reckon that the saints are not *his* flock; he is their servant.
C.H.H. Would this instance of the thorn-bush be a final test as to God's own work with Moses during the forty years, and would that qualify him for leadership, having due regard for the people of God?
J.T. Yes. The knowledge of God is opening up to him. Moses is coming to know God in His essential Being. It is God essentially -- "I AM THAT I AM". Moses is directed to say to the children of Israel: "Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you. This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations". The people were in God's heart. He had great thoughts and purposes as to them. He compassionates them in their present misery in Egypt and would bring them out of their affliction there unto the land He had purposed for them -- a land flowing with milk and honey. I AM is sending Moses to the children of Israel with these good tidings. He has been raised up on their account, and is now to be used by Jehovah to deliver them from their cruel bondage and lead them into the land His love has provided for them. Besides his mission to Israel, Moses is to be sent to Pharaoh -- "that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt". As to this Jehovah said, "I will harden his
{126}
heart, that he shall not let the people go. And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah: Israel is my son, my firstborn". It is affecting that Pharaoh is to know that Israel is Jehovah's son, Jehovah's firstborn. "And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me". That is the line of thought in chapter 4. After he comes into the knowledge of God the servant comes into a direct transaction with God, involving committal on his part and on God's part. God is revealing Himself essentially to Moses. He had already regarded the people, but now they are to be known as in God's counsels, as God's son. In serving we should apprehend what the saints are to God, how we are to clothe them as we minister to them.
L.E.S. Do you think Solomon came to this where he says to Jehovah, "And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude" (@1 Kings 3: 8)?
J.T. That is a good example in serving -- that we value the brethren. We never love the brethren if we do not *respect* them; nor can we serve them with feeling unless we love them. A great servant says, "if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (@2 Corinthians 12: 15). Love has its own reward. You have pleasure in loving people.
A.R. Why is it that God says He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and then it says, "Moses hid his face"? God is appearing in relation to His people. Why is he afraid?
J.T. He is still in the making here. God says. "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham". It is not his immediate father. Abraham is in mind. Is he equal to this? He still has to learn to be at liberty with God. Moses was afraid to look at God and hid himself. What is presented here enters generally into service and leadership. It is only as a servant knows God and has liberty with Him that he can serve Him
{127}
acceptably. And it is only in this liberty that he can truly serve the saints.
G.A.T. What does it mean to be on good terms with God?
J.T. We are to be with Him on His own terms. His goodness and severity run on together; but He has no pleasure in dealing harshly with us. Normally God has pleasure in His servants. Moses was faithful in all God's house (@Numbers 12: 7). What enjoyment He had in him! But how much more in the perfect Servant! Of Him God said, "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!" (@Isaiah 42: 1).
C.DeB. Does what you have said of Moses fit in with Asher, who dipped his foot in oil that he might be acceptable to his brethren (@Deuteronomy 33: 24)?
J.T. Yes. It is the blessing of Moses, the man of God, himself. Moses, at the end of his life, helps us in all this; he conveys the mind of God in blessing in regard to each of the tribes. @Deuteronomy 33 is full of this -- how the saints are apprehended as in favour with God.
E.G.McA. He uses the expression, I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but when Moses expresses a doubt as to his going and ability, God says, I AM.
J.T. "And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? And he said, For I will be with thee; and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say, What is his name?" That is a good question. It is easier to ask it than to answer it, but God put it into Moses¬ mouth. "God said to
{128}
Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you". "I AM" is His essential, infinite Being. But at that time much more remained to be disclosed.
E.G.McA. Then He said, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you". Is that falling back on His essential Being to establish His great thoughts?
J.T. That is the idea.
A.R. When you say, 'come up' what do you mean?
J.T. What has already come out. Think of the history that was antecedent to all this! The world in which Moses was then was probably 3,000 years of God's relations with His creatures. How much had come out! There is much more to come out; "I AM" is infinitude, but you have to wait for its fulness.
A.E.H. Does John's gospel come into your mind as you are dwelling on these thoughts? I was thinking of the prominence of the word 'sent'.
J.T. John's gospel fits into Moses peculiarly. The Lord says of Moses to the Jews, "if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe my words?" The great I AM is speaking. That brings out the greatness of Moses¬ ministry. Thus you can link this on with John's gospel. "In the beginning *was*". That is Being. It is "I AM". "In the beginning *was*" is historic, but extending back infinitely, but in @John 8: 58 the Lord says, "Before Abraham was, I am" -- that is eternal existence, as in @Exodus 3: 14.
A.E.H. The Lord says in that gospel to certain ones, "unless ye shall believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins" (@John 8: 24). That is, the fire will have full effect in judgment, but here the bush is *not* consumed.
J.T. Just so. As already said, He says in the same chapter, "Before Abraham was, I am". Not I was, but *I am*.
{129}
G.A.T. Would you say that Jehovah wanted to impress Moses and the people with the greatness of His Person?
J.T. Yes. He is putting it on its own infinite basis. The full unfolding of this awaited the incarnation. It requires the incarnation to be understood. John's gospel opens it up. All anticipated the incarnation. Even what we are speaking of as to service looked forward to the presence here on earth of Christ as Man -- for God. And as to how He served, He says, "I do always the things that are pleasing to him" (@John 8: 29). We can only touch on these great things now, and it is in view of our subject -- that there may be an immediate effect on each of us who are seeking to serve. God comes in; He is desirous to have transactions with us, so that we may be representative of Him in serving the saints. He is with His people. They will come out glorious at the end, even though there may be failure. The bush is not consumed. What understanding have you got of the people of God? How are you going to serve them, how are you going to clothe them in your thoughts in serving them? He is not only there with them in the bush, but in infinitude. The heavens cannot contain Him. 'I am raising you up on their account', He would say to each one. Therefore let us get into our souls a right apprehension and attitude as to God and of those we would serve, so that the ministry may be between Him and us. The position is "God's dispensation, which is in faith" (@1 Timothy 1: 4).
J.D. Would there be anything in the change from Jehovah to God in verse 4, "And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called"?
J.T. It is the supreme God (Elohim) of the first of Genesis, but He is now operating in relation to His people and revealing Himself as Jehovah.
The next point now to be considered is this matter of sonship, the message as to sonship to Pharaoh. What
{130}
strength in the servant's soul would this intimate conversing with God afford -- God Himself, in view of his mission to Pharaoh! "Thus saith Jehovah: Israel is my son, my firstborn. And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me. And if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill thy son, thy firstborn". The servant is fortified with that, what God will do as He is disregarded, because he is now to be a representative of God.
J.D. Are you suggesting that the thought of leadership has the service of God in mind in connection with sonship?
J.T. That is plain enough here. We are rising now in our subject of sonship. It is the service of a son that God has in His mind. He is warning every Pharaoh, every government, every one as to what His people are to Him. He is not only speaking to His servant Moses now, but speaking to Pharaoh. He is using this wonderful term as to Israel, "my son", and he is to serve Him. God is entering into conflict with those that oppose His people. The servant should be impressed with the greatness of the things he is dealing with, the greatness of the people in God's mind, that they are in the great relation of sonship with Him. That involves Christ's sonship, the incarnation: "out of Egypt have I called my son" (@Matthew 2: 15).
J.D. It is necessary for the servant to have this abstract view, this high thought of the saints being the sons of God.
J.T. Paul develops that in the letters to Corinth, what the saints were to God and what they were to him; how he regarded them, and warned them too to be enlarged as he was enlarged because of what he heard about them. "Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded ... let *your* heart also expand itself" (@2 Corinthians 6: 11, 13). Then he goes on to speak of what would *hinder* their being expanded; namely, worldliness.
{131}
But God says, I have taken you into relationship with me. "And I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty" (@2 Corinthians 6: 18). We have these exceedingly great promises, and thus we should be "perfecting holiness in God's fear" (@2 Corinthians 7: 1).
E.G.McA. Do you think the apostle Paul had that in his mind in the epistle to the Galatians, trying to deliver them from legality?
J.T. Yes. Galatians corresponds, so that sonship is the point; what we are, "Jerusalem above" being our mother.
C.A.M. The impression that Moses had, the light of incarnation typically brought before his soul, would be sonship. The great thought that would come before us as the truth of the incarnation dawns on us is sonship.
J.T. That is how the truth will stand eternally.
A.R. As Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh and tell him this message, he increases the pressure. What would you say about that?
J.T. Well, the most serious thing is that God says He will harden his heart. Verse 21 says, "I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go". That is a terrible thing. You have got to deal with a man whose heart is judicially hardened. You will have a hard time of it. But God is now moving against Pharaoh for the deliverance of His people, and "who hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered?"
G.A.T. Is it not hard for us to understand that God had hardened this man's heart and still feel that he was wrong?
J.T. It is God's way. Romans opens this up. "Who art *thou* that answerest again to God?" (@Romans 9: 20). "The scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst men, that I might thus show in thee my power" (@Romans 9: 17). Why should
{132}
God not have a free judicial hand? He is supreme. God will wear Pharaoh down through the ten plagues; but then He is testing His servant. But Moses becomes greater and greater -- the *man* Moses (@Exodus 11: 3). That is the testimony of this book. That is the normal way of God with His servants. The very hardness of the task brings out "the power that worketh in us".
A.E.H. While God has His thoughts of the saints in an abstract way, He would have in His mind that they are distinguished, and all that opposes them at the outset would be brought down.
J.T. If you look at @Exodus 5 you will see what a plight they seem to be in. In verse 1, it is said, "Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharaoh" etc., and in verses 6 - 15, "And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. And the number of the bricks they have made heretofore shall ye lay upon them: ye shall not diminish any of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. Let them put heavier labour on the men, that they may be taken up with it, and not regard vain words. And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh: I will not give you straw: go ye, get yourselves straw where ye may find it; but none of your work shall be diminished. And the people were scattered abroad throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. And the taskmasters urged them saying, Fulfil your labours, the daily work, as when there was straw. And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and it was said, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and today, as heretofore? Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh,
{133}
saying, Why dost thou deal thus with thy bondmen?" Pharaoh says, verses 17 - 21, "Ye are idle, idle! therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah. And now go -- work! and straw shall not be given you, and ye shall deliver the measure of bricks. And the officers of the children of Israel saw that it stood ill with them, because it was said, Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks, the daily work. And they met Moses and Aaron ... And they said to them, Jehovah look upon you and judge, that ye have made our odour to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his bondman, putting a sword into their hand to kill us". Now look at where they are, look at what a servant has to contend with. This record is made for those who serve. "And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Lord, why hast thou done evil to this people? why now hast thou sent me? For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all!" This is a most critical time, but Moses is going to come out victorious.
G,A.T. Is there weakness here?
J.T. This is God's way. God is bringing Himself before us. This is the God we are to serve. We are to serve Him with reverence and godly fear. If you do not answer the test, He may have to discard you.
A.R. We may think that Pharaoh was going to wear down the saints to oblivion, whereas God was wearing down Pharaoh, not Israel.
J.T. Yes. This lesson enters into all times. What a time we are in now! It is a learning time for us all, and especially for those who serve.
C.H.H. Is @Exodus 4: 24 a *personal* test?
J.T. Yes-a most searching one, Jehovah sought to slay him. It was a domestic matter, but typically, disregard of the death of Christ was involved -- circumcision was neglected. We have to learn to go through with
{134}
God crises in our circumstances as we seek to serve Him. The brethren may turn against us. They turned against Moses here.
A.P.T. Is Stephen illustrative of a real leader in a practical way?
J.T. Stephen's leadership involved martyrdom, and coupled with this is his ability to unfold the ways of God in a crisis, to pick out the line of things, or the lines of things that have to be dealt with. Stephen was meeting a most difficult situation and he died for the truth in it, but it was bringing in what was needed at the time. His ministry was brief, but he brought in what was needed in a masterful way. It was most effective. What he was shone out in his face.
L.E.S. Referring to being discarded, did you have in mind Elijah at Mount Horeb?
J.T. Yes. Of course, he discarded himself, but God accepted his resignation. That is a humbling thing in itself. He asked God to let him die. God says 'I will let you go all the way you have in mind'. He was going back to Horeb -- retrogression. He was going to resign his commission. God said, 'I will help you to go back', to fulfil what he had in his mind. It is solemn because it is an exposure of the state he was in at that time. After his greatest victory he collapses.
A.P.T. When Paul and Barnabas were about to start on their second service among the gentiles there was quite a crisis as to whether John Mark should go with them. Paul did not take John Mark because he gave up and went back, so that he took Silas instead.
J.T. Yes. Barnabas would take Mark because he was a natural relative. The allowance of the influence of natural relations among the saints is most baneful. That is what Paul had to stand against there.
Ques. Would not the fact that Moses had learned not to fear the wrath of the king serve him well in connection with issues arising among the brethren?
{135}
J.T. It would. He manifested that spirit at the beginning. Now he has to face Pharaoh, apparently not fearing him. @Exodus 7: 1 says, "Jehovah said to Moses, See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet". Aaron's staff will become a serpent. They are acting in the presence of Pharaoh apparently, without fear. Jehovah tells him to go down and stand "in front of him". I think he began well in not fearing the wrath of the king. God removed that king, @Exodus 2: 23. The present king is not especially opposed to Moses, but the question is general now as to the service of God. He is now more manifestly against God than Moses.
E.G.McA. What is the bearing of circumcision in this crisis of Moses in chapter 4: 24? Why does circumcision come in just as Moses got a message to go back to Egypt?
J.T. Jehovah met him and sought to slay him, as we have noted. It was because of the circumcision. A servant may fail in regard to circumcision, that is, the putting off the demands of the flesh in relation to our houses. You have to put it off *totally*, that is, in the circumcision of Christ. The word to young men is not to love the world nor the things in the world, because what is of the world is not of the Father. Many a young servant has been damaged by his wife, because she wants the things of the world -- sometimes through urgency for a better house, better furniture, etc.
A.R. If Moses had been allowed to continue without circumcision in his house he might have misrepresented God before Pharaoh. "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh", Jehovah says. That makes him a very great man, does it not?
J.T. Yes. That brings in another thing in relation to service: that is, that there is a divine system -- that one is not merely an individual, but serving in a system of things. Here Aaron is a constituted prophet, "Aaron
{136}
thy brother shall be thy prophet". Moses is God to Pharaoh, not a god, but *God*, and Aaron is his prophet. So that the servant recognises others; he is working in a system. Surely God has a system. Christ is the Apostle and High Priest of our profession.
G.A.T. Would you say a word as to "Let my son go, that he may serve me". What does that service include?
J.T. Worship is implied -- ministering to Him. So @Philippians 3: 3 says, "We are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh". That is, in type, what is in mind here, service Godward. Jehovah directed Moses that Israel should serve at Horeb, @Exodus 3: 12.
L.E.S. Would Paul's apostleship in the Corinthian epistle, being based on the will of God, be God's representative authoritatively, and the brothers Sosthenes and Timothy be linked up with the apostle in the same way that Aaron is linked up with Moses?
J.T. Yes. Aaron is the more sympathetic side of the position, but he is not the priest yet. He is a prophet. We shall look at Aaron tomorrow, God willing.
We have already touched on the passage in Numbers where God says He spoke to Moses "mouth to mouth". That was a great honour, involving special knowledge of God. Then in @Deuteronomy 33 it is said Moses was king in Jeshurun. That place he acquired with the people; and then in the last chapter of that book it is said, "there arose no prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah had known face to face; according to all the signs and wonders that Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land; and according to all that mighty hand; and according to all the great terribleness that Moses had wrought in the sight of all Israel". Another thing is that God buried him. That is a beautiful distinction conferred on Moses.
{137}
LEADERSHIP (3)
@Exodus 4: 14 - 17, 27 - 31; @Exodus 6: 26 - 30; @Exodus 7: 1 - 7; @Exodus 32: 1 - 6; @Exodus 15: 20, 21
J.T. Our subject this morning is Aaron and Miriam. It reminds us at the outset of the brotherly spirit in service; it is not a question of gift, but brotherly feeling and affection, and ability to speak, and through this the obligation to take a secondary place in service -- not an independent line as with the apostles. Each apostle had his own line of ministry. In this type it is the same ministry, the same current of things, and the introduction of the brother, or brothers, of a brotherly spirit, with readiness to take a second place in order to augment the position already inaugurated. Aaron appears as an afterthought. God intimated that He would go on with Moses alone, but Moses felt weak and unable to take the service up by himself, and so God in this first passage tells him about his brother, or rather by his question, reminds him of him. "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well". Aaron represents divine resources and reserves, but he is not brought in in any way to supplant Moses but to supplement his service. So that the deficiency that Moses asserted of himself is to be made up, the whole position is to be buttressed by the addition of Aaron. The verses read in chapters 6 and 7 show respectively the ages of the men. Aaron was older than Moses, which would not be an accident; God intended that there should be, through this fact, occasion of exercise in each of the brothers. Moses would have to overcome by moral power the discrepancy of age. Aaron came to that in time because he called him lord, showing that the moral feature is a great thing in service. Miriam is Aaron's sister in @Exodus 15, but in @Numbers 26 she is 'their' sister, just the three in the family so far as the record goes. They will be tested
{138}
family-wise. Natural relations are often very testing; nature by itself does not help at all in the family of God. It is always treacherous. That God should take up three from one family is remarkable. In view of their great age and being from one family, this confirms that these three persons are intended to furnish teaching for all servants coming after.
J.D. Allowing fully for the sovereignty of God in the selection of Moses, there is what has been in Moses of his own volition in coming forward. Do you think Aaron recognised that?
J.T. Well, he follows in happy accord: "And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him. And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent him, and all the signs that he had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel; and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses". He did not add a word of his own apparently, but just spoke the words that God had spoken to Moses; so he falls into the position at once.
L.E.S. Would the family at Bethany somewhat correspond -- Mary and Martha and Lazarus -- the Lord qualifying them to serve?
J.T. There is a link, I am sure. It is only seen operative at the final supper at Bethany where they are all functioning together.
J.H. Is there some indication of service in the words, "the Levite thy brother"?
J.T. That is to be noted. He is not simply 'a' Levite but 'the' Levite, as though God would distinguish him in this way. The fact that his name is not mentioned earlier is to remind us that prospective servants are under the eye of God early. For God begins far up the stream with all of us if He is going
{139}
to use us. He knew Aaron and called him "the Levite". Why does He call him that? Evidently he had manifested the instincts of the Levite.
A.E.H. Is this what betrays him later when he makes the calf -- the idea of "the Levite" overcoming what might have been priestly in him? I was thinking that he was more on the level of serving the people there, and this betrayed him into falling below his proper level as placed of God. The Levite element has to be under control of what is priestly.
J.T. Well, clearly he fell under the influence of the people. His failures are marked by coming under other influence, whether it be the people here, or Miriam later, or the example of Moses as in @Numbers 20. I think Aaron's history reminds us of the dangers attaching to an amiable brother, a brotherly brother. He is apt to forget divine claims in meeting the claims of the brethren, falling under their influence; not being alone with God enough, too much with the brethren, and too much concerned about having their support.
H.B. Is that what is meant by "in brotherly love [have] love" (@2 Peter 1: 7)?
J.T. That is just what is meant. Peter says that love is the saving element. Brotherly love, if in excess of love, will expose us to undue influence of brethren, which is always damaging.
A.A.T. We have Paul and Barnabas working together and later Silas working with Paul. They work in couples. Is there any link in that?
J.T. Yes; the Lord sent out the apostles and the seventy others two and two. The point here is that Aaron shall augment fully what has already been inaugurated; therefore the connection in those cases would be that the brotherly spirit is allied with the apostolic spirit in Paul. The authority of God in Moses, or in Paul, might be too much for the brethren, so that the addition of a brother or brothers is intended
{140}
to assure all of right sympathy and right feelings generally.
J.H.E. Would you say Jacob rose to the situation when Joseph brought his sons to him? He really did the right thing in blessing them.
J.T. Yes. He was entirely above Joseph's influence. With anybody in Egypt but Jacob and Pharaoh, the word of Joseph would be enough and there could be no withstanding it; but Jacob had blessed Pharaoh, and now he is dealing with Joseph. Joseph says, "Not so, my father", and you may be sure that there was authority in his voice, but Jacob is not influenced by that. He says, "I know, my son, I know".
A.R. Do Moses and Aaron represent one idea rather than two?
J.T. Yes. Aaron is brought in to augment what is there. Aaron was to supply the deficiency in the power of speech; other things came in later, but what comes into @Exodus 4 is that God would go on with Moses alone.
W.L. Do we find today these two qualifications in one brother at the same time -- ability in the way of gift coupled with moral qualifications?
J.T. Yes; we certainly find them in the true Moses and Aaron, who is the High Priest of our confession. We begin with Christ in all these matters and see the perfect blend in Him, and Paul came nearer to that than anyone else. Paul sent Timothy to Corinth that he might fill out the thought he had as to example -- that they might learn his ways as they were in Christ.
W.L. So that the moral thing is by far the greater.
J.T. I do not think any brother should assume that he cannot do this or that. The apostle Paul never faltered, even if it were to carry money from the brethren or to build a fire; he was ready to do what was needed. The Lord Jesus says, "*I* am in the midst of you as one that serves" (@Luke 22: 27). We must see that we do not
{141}
appear to be clerical in any way, to be above our ordinary work. Paul says, Why should Barnabas and I not cease to work? but we are not doing it. Why should we not marry wives? but we are not doing it. They voiced what was right, and the saints should respect those rights, though they were not asserting them. There are rights, and the saints should recognise those rights, while the servants themselves are ready to do anything that is to be done. Aaron could speak well. It is said of Paul in @Acts 14 that he was the chief speaker.
Ques. I suppose no service that involves several persons could go on without the moral qualities we have spoken of, in addition to co-ordination?
J.T. That is important, and is more plainly stated in chapter 6. Here God says in @Exodus 4: 16, "And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God". God has made both mouths and He is going to give effect to both mouths, and in result I expect Moses¬ mouth exceeded Aaron's. In the meantime God is taking the matter in hand. It is a great undertaking. As we are entering on the service of God, we are entering on a great matter; it is already inaugurated, and it is a question whether we can fit in. Here God says, I am going to be with both your mouths; so that both increase in power, increase together. Therefore their speech would be a fit representation of God because there would be no disparity at all, no divided thought. Then in chapter 6 Moses raises the question of his poor speaking again. He says he is "of uncircumcised lips". It is a critical stage: Moses is not yet established and Aaron has come on the scene and chapter 5 is the crisis. God is hardening Pharaoh. It is a testing time and Moses is still afraid of his speaking powers, which is rather poor because God had said He would be with his mouth.
{142}
Then Jehovah said in chapter 7, "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh", as if in the crisis God is capitalising what can be used. He is not capitalising Moses; his great words in Egypt are not capitalised at all. It is that God is to be with the mouths as they are, not simply with their words, but with their *mouths*. Who has made man's mouth? God has not only made them, but He is going to be *with* our mouths, that is the point. The Lord at Nazareth opened His mouth, and those present wondered at the words of grace that were coming out of it.
Now God says, "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land" (@Exodus 7: 1, 2). Now it is a question of brethren working *systematically* but according to God's appointment. It is not a question of Moses liking Aaron particularly, nor is it that Aaron is such a brotherly man, but that God is placing them together. It is a question now of the representation of God to Pharaoh.
J.S. Is it God Himself establishing the Mosaic system here?
J.T. Well, that is what it is. But really it is a question of what He is doing in this room, of suggesting to us that we have to work *together*. If I have to take a second place let me do it, or if I have to take a first place let me do it; but without the undercurrent of brotherly affection it will not be real or effective. Christianity involves systematic divine representation; and underneath all there must be moral authority developing and that is what happened in Moses¬ case.
J.D. Do you think the opposition from the inside, from the difficult people he was serving, as well as from the hardness of Pharaoh's heart on the outside, established Moses¬ leadership? They did not listen
{143}
to him, chapter 6: 9. But in the face of all that, leadership was being established in Moses¬ heart on brotherly lines.
J.T. That is the idea. God is working to get the institution moving. It is a great matter, but the state of the people is inimical to it. It is very difficult to serve brethren that are disgruntled. If the brethren are oppressed or divided, there is great difficulty in serving them; chapter 5 brings that out. But the terrible thing is that God is hardening Pharaoh's heart. God had furnished Aaron as speaker for Moses, and Moses is to be God to Pharaoh. Let no one be afraid of this. What is before us here is a type of what God has set up in Christ in heaven. God is thus represented down here. The Spirit in the assembly implies an anointed system in which God is represented. Here God is putting His stamp upon what He has effected. There is representation of God both to the saints and to Pharaoh.
J.D. This seems to open up that passage, "A brother is born for adversity" (@Proverbs 17: 17).
J.T. There is one called "the brother Quartus" in @Romans 16: 23. That he was a brother evidently characterised him. But we have to pay attention to the tendency in Aaron of coming under the influence of others; and it is sure that if brothers form special links with each other that is what will happen. @Exodus 32 discloses a bad underlying state in the people. There is a crisis and these two men are before us. We have had Moses representing authority, and he does not come under evil influence, he is definitely with God in this great sorrow. Aaron's first great failure is that he was influenced by the people, failing to be with God. As Moses was on the mountain with God, Aaron and Hur were left with the people. But in the absence of Moses he came under the influence of the people and blamed them for the great sin. He says, "the people ... are set on mischief". He was
{144}
right in a sense, but he was wrong too in listening to them. Indeed he was guilty as having become the instrument used in their idolatry.
J.H.E. Would you say that was Peter's failure? When he was with the Jews he was like the Jews. Paul had to reprove him.
J.T. Before certain came from James he ate with those of the nations, but when they came, he withdrew. That is what we have here in @Exodus 32.
J.H. Was it seen too in Barnabas, a very brotherly man, who was carried away "by their dissimulation"?
J.T. Quite so. Barnabas was in it. It just confirms what we have been saying -- the damage of special links, brother with brother.
J.S. Does Paul in the temple with the vow on him illustrate the same thing?
J.T. Well, he does. These are all cases included in what we are saying, how a servant may come under wrong influence.
A.P.T. In @Matthew 16: 22, after the Lord had given Peter great truth regarding revelation, he says to the Lord, "God be favourable to thee, Lord; this shall in no wise be unto thee". Was Peter there really coming under another influence?
J.T. Yes, but he would bring the Lord under *his* influence. He was trying to divert the Lord from the path of the will of God. The Lord says, "Get away behind me, Satan; ... for thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men".
J.D. The Corinthian error was in forming parties. @1 Corinthians 4: 6 says, "not letting your thoughts go above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for such a one against another". Does that help?
J.T. Yes. That first joint service of Moses and Aaron was highly successful. @Exodus 4: 31 says, "And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the
{145}
children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped". That was a highly successful bit of service at the start. Then the crisis is seen in the fifth chapter, the state of the people and the state of Pharaoh; and in the sixth chapter, "Jehovah said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh", verse 1. And in verse 9, "Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel; *but they did not listen to Moses* from anguish of spirit, and from hard service. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, Lo, the children of Israel do not hearken to me: how then should Pharaoh hearken to me, to me of uncircumcised lips? And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a commandment to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt". That is a settled thing in God's mind from verse 13, overruling all Moses¬ felt weakness and anxiety. It is a settled matter.
The next thing is the genealogy working out into the priesthood. In verse 16 we have the sons of Levi. Their generations start with Levi and end with Phinehas; Moses and Aaron are in mind in all this, who these two men are. What a history behind them! That is what you get in verse 26, "This is that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts. These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: this is that Moses and Aaron". God is telling us here that these men are going through. He has made no mistake in the selection.
And then it is said, "And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, that Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I am
{146}
Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how will Pharaoh hearken to me?" He reverts back to his weakness. But Jehovah inaugurates the system of which we have already spoken, chapter 7: 1. This would support Moses and Aaron in the great task assigned to them. God says in @Exodus 7: 15, "Go unto Pharaoh in the morning -- behold, he will go out unto the water -- and take thy stand by the bank of the river in front of him; and take in thy hand the staff that was turned into a serpent". Aaron is brought into all this, and Moses and Aaron are seen running right through to chapter 12 in this immense undertaking of God. There is no let-up at all and Moses is increasing in power in all these operations until he can say, "I will see thy face again no more!" @Exodus 10: 29. All this indicates how the service of God must go on.
G.A.T. Would you say that from verse 13 of chapter 6 Jehovah puts Moses under a command? It is not what Moses can do or cannot do, it is what he must do.
J.T. Quite so. It is God now. God is to be here representatively. That is why the system is set up in this way: "Jehovah said to Moses, See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh". Now that is not an empty commission, God is to be with his mouth. Applied to ourselves today, this is a question of God, we are in God's service, we have come into something that was inaugurated hundreds of years ago. It is a question of our coming into it, and representing God in His service. What they say to Pharaoh is in power; that is what is seen in chapter 7; and what these two men say to Pharaoh will have power until Pharaoh has to let the people go.
J.H. What is the thought in Aaron doing these signs before Pharaoh?
{147}
J.T. They represent God to bring down the world as the Lord Jesus did. It is Moses as God, Moses in the dignity of God in representation. You do not get Aaron as priest officially until chapter 29. Here we are dealing with the person of Aaron, what the man is himself.
A.R. That is what is in mind in Corinthians, in the prophetic meeting. The prophet brings God in, and as it says, God is among you.
J.T. Yes. The prophetic meeting, as we call it, is carried on in the light of the representation of God. Hence, as a brother is prophesying God is known *there*.
A.MacD. Is this a good balance in service: chapter 6: 26, says, "this is that Aaron and Moses", and verse 27, "this is that Moses and Aaron"?
J.T. It is a good balance. When the Spirit says, "Aaron and Moses", that is a recognition of Aaron's age and brotherliness; but when He says, "Moses and Aaron", that is the recognition of Moses¬ place morally and his power.
Ques. Is there any great evidence that Aaron is a man of faith?
J.T. There is nothing said of it, but I would say that he was. Aaron is drawn into the faith system. Moses is specially designated to the system of faith and Aaron is joining in what Moses is doing. We read about Aaron's burial (@Deuteronomy 10: 6), a remarkable burial, only two at the funeral! "And they went up" (@Numbers 20: 27), a beautiful evidence of his recognition of God's right to him, entire submission to the will of God. He died by the will of God, like the Lord Jesus. It is a most touching thing to think of those three up there, Moses disrobing Aaron and putting the high-priestly garments on Eleazar. God honours Moses in that way. "Moses and Aaron among his priests" (@Psalm 99: 6).
G.H. Would you say that God seems to be stressing
{148}
the feature of representation at the present day in brethren having to do with the authorities?
J.T. Yes. On the one hand the authorities represent God to you (@Romans 13: 1 - 6), but on the other hand, on the moral side, you represent God to them, @1 Peter 2: 9. That is the test, as to whether there is any testimony for God. God is putting as a spear-head "a conscience without offence towards God and men" (@Acts 24: 16). God is using that in the young men before the tribunals. It is a moral representation of Himself.
G.A.T. Would you say that is the essential without which you cannot expect God's support?
J.T. Yes. It is a remarkable time in that sense; and it is a question whether we are entirely given up to conscience, or if we are modifying the thing for the sake of gain, for the sake of what accrues to us financially.
A.R. We might do it for a way of escape. In @Exodus 5 the pressure is crucial. Today we might modify it as a way out; we might volunteer for something easier.
J.T. That is what I was thinking of. It is a question of whether you are putting conscience in the front, a conscience void of offence before God and men.
J.H. So that the will of God enters into it.
J.T. Putting the moral side first; first things first, and righteousness, involving a good conscience, has this place.
A.B. In chapter 6, it says in the one case, "this is that Aaron and Moses", and in the other, "this is that Moses and Aaron;" but at the beginning of verse 27 it says, "these are they". Is there something in that?
J.T. God is calling attention to *them*. God is really dealing in this critical part of our subject with His own system, a representation of Himself, and He is capitalising the position not simply by telling Moses, You are to be God, but, "I have made thee God".
{149}
*God* did it. You may be sure that God will be there, He will be there to make it effective. Pharaoh is made to feel that he has to do with God, he is dealing with God.
Ques. Would you say that a real leader would feel that he has to act like God and for God?
J.T. If there is to be representation, there must be that. "Let us make man in our image:" that is representation.
W.L. Would you say that would be inseparably linked up with the brethren?
J.T. Quite so. Aaron is that element.
C.R. Paul could say, "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place" (@2 Corinthians 2: 14). Does that apply?
J.T. It does apply. God is doing that. Paul says, "an angel of the God ... whom I serve" (@Acts 27: 23), and "having therefore met with the help which is from God, I have stood firm" (@Acts 26: 22).
F.N.W. As to Moses being conscious of his weakness, do you think that sometimes a sense of weakness may be God's working? Paul had a constant thorn in the flesh and that would require Christ's service.
J.T. Well, Moses would require help too, but here he is telling God he has uncircumcised lips.
F.N.W. In some of our localities leadership from God is hindered through over-occupation with weakness.
J.T. Therefore God augments our position, linking us on with the brethren. But now He says, "I have made thee God" -- not, 'to the brethren', but -- "I have made thee God to Pharaoh", because that is where you will need more support. It is not said that Moses was God to the brethren. It is "God to Pharaoh". God is capitalising the position, so that Moses might succeed in the representation of God; and he did succeed.
J.T.Jr. When Moses and Aaron got into the subject
{150}
they did well. They feared before they started their address, but when they got into it, God helped. Is that not very often true?
J.T. Very often a brother is very timid before he stands up, and he gets far more support than he reckons on. Because God wants to fit him, He is with his mouth; he will do better the next time.
L.E.S. Do you not get the idea in Jeremiah where he says, "Behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child. But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for thou shalt go to whomsoever I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah" (@Jeremiah 1: 6 - 8). And then it says, "And Jehovah put forth his hand and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant" (verses  9, 10).
J.T. There is a great similarity between Jeremiah and Moses.
G.A.T. When the Father spoke about His Son: "This is my beloved Son; hear him", there were no Moses and Aaron there.
J.T. No, because He is Moses and Aaron combined. He is the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. I hope all the brethren get some little impression of this matter of representation, because we are in a terrible time, and these features are necessary if God is to be represented in these terrible times, especially if the conscience void of offence is to be put forward. It is the making of the young men if they are before God in prayer about it. God would help in prayer.
G.A.T. Would you say a word on how you go in for this?
J.T. It is not a question of going in for it, but of
{151}
being put into it; first purchasing to yourself a good degree, and then God takes you on. You did not know you had such power, but as you go on God will give you such support that you will be conscious that He is with you.
C.A.M. You were saying that God starts with this matter far up-stream. I mean that the preparation of the servants dates back long before they had any apprehension of it.
J.T. Quite so. The sixth chapter shows these two men brought into the service; we have their full genealogical position. In genealogical positions God is telling us that He has been thinking long before about us. So in @Exodus 6: 2, "God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am Jehovah. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob". So we go back to the foundation, the source of things, when God began to operate in Abraham; and then we have the sons of Jacob down to Levi, because that is what is in the mind of God -- to bring out what these two men were. What men they are! He does not mention Miriam here, but He does later. They spring from a pure family, as we get in the first part of the book, "A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi" (@Exodus 2: 1). It was a wholly right seed. Is there a wholly right seed in the links we form? That is the point for us. These two men sprang from that, and God says these are the two; and they did the things required, for it says, "These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: this is that Moses and Aaron". Their ages are given later. There they are, they stand out all through the ages representing this great principle for those who undertake service. God has put us into families so that we should understand that, even if there is disparity of age, it is a question of moral qualifications. This must prevail. That is what prevailed in Moses.
{152}
A.E.H. I notice that each time Moses refers to his weakness, it is when he is speaking to God. Do you think it is a false sense of humility if I am referring all the time to my weakness in speaking to the brethren, instead of speaking in power as having to do with God?
J.T. Well, just so, it is power with God. Jacob set out that principle; unlike Moses, he wrestled with God, he did not give up; he wrestled with the angel and *prevailed*.
J.D. What is the point in God selecting the meeting place, verse 15, "he will go out unto the water"?
J.T. Pharaoh was going out to the water as was usual. He might say to Moses, This is no time to see me; why do you not come to my place of reception? The word is, "behold, he will go out unto the water -- and take thy stand by the bank of the river in front of him". That is, the river would be the resources of Egypt. God is going to operate against Egypt there; God chooses His own battle-ground.
J.H. It has been said that that is a mark of a good general.
J.T. He had taken up the same thought in sending Aaron to meet Moses; Aaron would be influenced by the mountain of God. He met him on the mountain of God and kissed him; meeting his brother, his affections became active. It is a good thing to know where to meet the brethren, as well as Pharaoh.
A.R. Is the meeting at the river intended to break down the world system, one system operating to bring down another?
J.T. That is the idea. The first sign had reference to the river -- what Egypt prided itself in and relied upon. God is meeting Pharaoh at his strong point, not at his weak point. Moses is to stand in front of him. God is ready now, He has a system inaugurated, so that we are not to be afraid. While you are to be
{153}
subject to the tribunals, your heart is not to be full of fear or you will never represent God. The scripture says, "Fear not".
C.H.H. Pharaoh had boasted that the river was his. Would this be to counteract that claim?
J.T. I think so. God is dealing with the position at its strongest point, and that is how God deals with the world, to expose it and overthrow it.
H.B. What would you say about the crucifixion being outside Jerusalem, the great centre of that time?
J.T. It *must* happen there. Moses and Elias spoke to the Lord of His exit, of what would happen at Jerusalem. It was the strength of the world religiously, and the political power was there; Pontius Pilate and the nations were there. That is the strongest point of all the world, and there God exposed it. "The earth was shaken".
Ques. What would you say is conveyed in the staff in the hand of Aaron?
J.T. The staff is the same whether in the hand of Moses or of Aaron; only the idea of a divine system is maintained and God's authority, as we have been saying, is in it. The rod is seen in God's hand (chapter 7: 17), in Moses¬ hand and in Aaron's hand. In Aaron's hand it would, I suppose, be modified according to what he generally represents -- priestly grace and sympathy.
M.O. Paul reminds Timothy that Christ witnessed a good confession before Pontius Pilate. Is that representation?
J.T. Just so; representation is not in a symbol; the staff represents *experience* with God. Both Moses and Aaron have staves here, but they represent one thought. Moses¬ staff is called "the staff of God", also designated "the staff that was turned into a serpent".
J.D. Jacob gathered up his feet into his bed and leaned upon his staff. Is that experience?
{154}
J.T. I think so.
C.D.B. What about Stephen as representative under those trying circumstances?
J.T. He represented God. He represented God by the masterful way in which he presented the truth. He outlined the truth from the beginning. And he represented God in maintaining the truth of the dispensation in suffering. "Kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" (@Acts 7: 60).
E.F. Would you indicate the difference between the thought of representation and the thought of a young person confessing the Lord's name?
J.T. Such a one is typically just at the age of 25, he is in his novitiate. He has to take the place of a learner. The Levites went in at 25, later at 20, but the full levitical age is 30 to 50; as though God would have full manhood to represent Him. The Lord Jesus as proclaimed at the Jordan "was beginning to be about 30 years old". God recognised Him as representing Him.
A.P.T. Is that why you referred to the ages of Moses and Aaron? Is there any suggestion of the increase of the knowledge of God in the 80 years?
J.T. There is. Aaron, Moses, and Miriam were all old. The point is that God does not appoint novices to His service; they have to learn. He uses us as we serve according to what our hands find to do, and this leads to official recognition. God had been watching over Aaron and He knew he could speak *well*. Aaron had skill, at least in that sense. It was what was needed.
J.T.Jr. The man of God is to be complete, fully fitted for every good work, to know the Scriptures, which are profitable for instruction. 2 Timothy seems to be special instruction for the man of God.
J.T. That is a good scripture to bring in. Timothy was a young man, but he was to overcome his youth by putting on manliness.
{155}
W.L. Do you think that putting on manly features is one of the things today in regard of the young men having to appear before tribunals?
J.T. That is right, he is to appear in the Spirit of Christ. As a young man comes into the truth he gains by what he finds. But Moses is not presented like that. We want to get at what each one is with God. Aaron is not presented like that. He is older than Moses and God has known him. I think it is what a man is in himself with God. Aaron's name is not mentioned until he is 83 years old, and yet God says, I know him. He was not with Moses and God, but evidently with God. What have I acquired with God in my own personal experience with Him? That is what each has to challenge himself about. Have I been with God?
R.W.S. Would not God keep this matter of conscience before the authorities by our young brothers appearing before them, and then as definite inquiry is made, in correspondence as to it by older brothers writing to the heads of governments -- as if God would have all to be reminded of conscience?
J.T. I am certain that is true. I am sure God has given the authorities and men in this world an opportunity. We read in Revelation of 7000 names of men; these are the men we have to do with. God is giving them an opportunity to see what the representation of Himself is. They profess to represent God, but the young man does too. He has a good conscience, void of offence toward God and man, which they have not, perhaps. He is telling them what first things are, that God is first, that God must be served rather than men. That is a fine testimony.
J.D. Referring to Timothy again, we often hear the first part of the verse quoted, "Let no one despise thy youth", but not the latter part of the verse, "but be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity" (@1 Timothy 4: 12).
{156}
J.T. So that you overcome your disparity of age by moral qualifications.
C.H.H. @Acts 26: 2 says, "Then Paul stretching out his hand answered in his defence: I count myself happy". He counted himself happy to give the testimony which is there stated.
J.T. He is so sensible of the power that worked in him. What would make us happier than that -- the sense that God is with us? The sense that God is with you and that you are with God is what makes you happy.
C.H.H. I was wondering whether the young men in appearing before tribunals should learn to welcome it, instead of dreading the ordeal; to give this testimony and be happy about it?
J.T. Paul is in great power. One always refers with pleasure to an occasion of a brother's being in power, but better still to be conscious of yourself being in power. You do not have to speak of it, but the consciousness is there. Paul says, "I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as *I* also am" (the consciousness that he had), "except these bonds" (@Acts 26: 29).
A.P.T. Was he a little more representative of God in that chapter than he was as seen at the end of chapter 16?
J.T. When he directs that the magistrates should come and take him out? Yes. And as before the high priest he says, "God will smite thee, whited wall" (@Acts 23: 3). That was a mistake, but he is there a fine example of a man who corrects himself *quickly*. He did not know it was the high priest. The word is, "Thou shalt not speak evilly of the ruler of thy people" (@Acts 23: 5). He quoted from Exodus.
C.H.H. I was wondering whether @Acts 26 would be a good indication of suitable feelings that brethren should take on to properly represent God. These are
{157}
spiritually ignorant men and here is an opportunity to represent God in the way of feelings for them.
J.T. It is certainly one of the finest chapters as to public testimony that you can get, a man calling attention to what he was -- his own state; not to what he was saying, but to what he *was*. He was in a happy state. Nothing affects people more than your own state when you are speaking.
T.S. As a representative he stretched out his hand. It would look like a matter of his heart, would you say?
J.T. "All the day long I have stretched out my hands" Paul quotes of God in @Romans 10: 21. But at the end of the chapter it is a question of what he was. Stretching out the hand would be appealing. Paul seemed to have a sign of his own; he made a sign with his hand at Antioch of Pisidia, @Acts 13: 16.
W.L. Would you say that there are degrees of representation? One can only be what he is.
J.T. Whatever little representation there may be, if you give only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, it is of value, @Matthew 10: 42. Now as to Miriam, we have not time to give much attention to her, but @Exodus 15: 20, 21 says, "And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing to Jehovah, for he is highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea". Here she is entitled, "the prophetess;" she is the sister of Aaron. Whether she and Aaron were together in their younger days, and how she acquired the state of a prophetess is not named. If a sister is to have a place in leadership, she appears according to what she is -- Miriam is seen as a prophetess. She represents God in some measure in prophecy. That is an honourable title for a sister. If she is already known as speaking the words of God certainly she must be heard.
{158}
G.A.T. When and where is she supposed to be heard?
J.T. There are restrictions or limits in the New Testament as to a woman prophesying. She is not told not to prophesy, but she is told to do it with her head covered. She is not to speak in the assembly or with her head uncovered. But if she is a prophetess she is to be heard; if she prophesies she is to be listened to. If sisters are to have a lead among the brethren, let them speak the words of God. There are plenty of words, but it is a question of speaking the words of God.
Rem. Miriam was one of the four women who had to do with the introduction of this great vessel -- Moses.
J.T. Her name is not mentioned but undoubtedly she is the "sister" who helped to preserve her infant brother. She was a young girl of tact and energy. Now she is introduced to us as a prophetess, the sister of a well-known servant.
J.D. Moral and spiritual capabilities enter into @Acts 21, where we read that Philip had four daughters who prophesied. Would the idea of virginity enter into sisters prophesying?
J.T. Surely; but as just remarked, they are not supposed to speak in the assembly: "I suffer not a woman to teach" (@1 Timothy 2: 12), and, "Let your women be silent in the assemblies" (@1 Corinthians 14: 34). But @1 Corinthians 11: 5 clearly states that if a woman prophesies her head is to be covered. Then the reason is given, "but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God". That is, she is before the public; it is a question of God's order in creation and she is to have her head covered.
A.A.T. Miriam's service here is connected with singing. Is that a point?
J.T. That is the next thing, what she does. We have her identity, and she is a qualified person, worthy
{159}
of mention. You get throughout Scripture women who are worthy of mention, holy women, as they are called in the New Testament. She is one of them, a sister of Aaron, and a leader in Israel. Now she is taking a leading part in the service of God not attempting to bring in her own composition. What is said is simply that she took a tambour in her hand, and all the women went after her, which would mean that she was influential in the right direction, a very important matter. She was influential in misleading her brother later, but she was influential among the women in doing what was right here, and they do what she does. It says, "Sing to Jehovah, for he is highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea". That is just the refrain from the first verse. She not only sings, but she appeals to others to sing also. She is simply augmenting what has already been done by Moses and the children of Israel. She is simply taking part in the refrain, and answers them in this way so that the service of God is augmented, but in just the measure of those words. She is not really adding anything to what Moses said, but she is singing, using these words; she is being used in the service, and she and the other women represent here the measure of the state of Israel in their service Godward at that time.
C.A.M. In @Psalm 68: 11 it says, "The Lord gives the word: great the host of the publishers". Mr. Darby's footnote says the publishers are women, and he refers to this chapter. There is a large sphere of service in that way.
J.T. It is a beautiful jewel set here as to what is called subjective conditions among us. You might compose a hymn and sing it and the brethren join in, but the question is the extent of the measure of the subjective state, and I believe these women represent that here.
J.H. There are two other women spoken of as
{160}
prophetesses -- Deborah and Huldah. They seem to have had great influence with the people and great support with the leaders of the day. Does that come into this?
J.T. It is opening up a door to the sisters. It is the order in which they serve. She appeals, "Sing to Jehovah". She takes up what is there, but it is a beautiful finish to what is there. That is what is seen, a beautiful finish in the measure of the subjective conditions.
J.S. Does singing and dancing involve great spiritual agility?
J.T. Quite so, and the women follow her.
A.E.H. Do you think that what she says here about the horse and rider suggests that she had come through all the exercise of the overthrow of that system? All that entered into her experience. In type she had been in all the exercises of the assembly.
J.T. It is the confirmation of the male side, the full intelligent representation of the matter in the song; in the subjective or feminine finish there is a real state behind the singing; only in a small measure. The sisters are all brought into it. It is a very beautiful suggestion as to how leadership in the service of God is to proceed. It is alternate singing. They are all brought into it in a subjective sense. There is feminine feeling in it. Dancing is a type of spiritual agility; it is a remarkable expression of musical feeling.
Ques. Would you suggest that what is spoken by women would bear more on the feeling side than on teaching?
J.T. I think it does. That is what is meant here. Miriam uses the very words of Moses, but in the service there is a beautiful subjective touch and the women fall into it, and as answering, there is response.
C.H.H. Would that be seen in @Luke 8? There you get women with substance who ministered to the Lord.
{161}
J.T. Just so, all arising from chapter 7; the woman there *loved much*. She had what was needed to minister to Christ.
A.P.T. No doubt the sisters at Corinth needed help, as to leadership, chapter 11 so as to have part in the service.
{162}
LEADERSHIP (4)
@Numbers 3: 32; @Numbers 4: 16; @Numbers 16: 36 - 40; @Numbers 19: 1 - 4
J.T. Eleazar is our subject this afternoon. Eleazar became high priest as his father died, but the passages read do not allude to him as high priest; his father is still living, so we have to consider him from the standpoint of being a *feature* of priesthood, not representing the whole idea. As recorded in @Numbers 20, his father dies and he becomes high priest, and then, of course, he presents the priesthood fully and his service runs along with that of Moses and Joshua; but these passages contemplate him as subordinate. Yet a peculiar and essential feature of priesthood is worked out in him in this position, made clear from the meaning of his name, which is 'the help of God', or 'God helps'. The more spiritual features of priesthood are seen in him applying first to the Levites as a whole; he is seen as "the prince of princes of the Levites" (@Numbers 3: 32), alluding to his moral greatness. He is over certain things in chapter 4, "the oversight of the oil for the light, and the fragrant incense, and the continual oblation, and the anointing oil, -- the oversight of the whole tabernacle, and of all that is therein, over the sanctuary, and over its furniture". He is, therefore, a remarkable person as having to see to the most sacred and exalted things of God, in fact the whole tabernacle in which God dwells; and yet his father is living. We have to learn by these facts, and I hope we shall -- how he represents a special service that enters into the service of God in the most sacred and precious way by affording 'help' always; as much as to say, we have the general thought, but we can always reckon on this influence which extends and expands as it goes on. The expression "prince of princes" reminds us at once of a personality, the word prince denoting that, adding to what already exists, adding dignity and greatness and glory, affording
{163}
help always, never retarding the progress of the service of God. It may be remarked that Eleazar has very little place in Exodus, Leviticus or Deuteronomy; his service is practically all in Numbers. That is, it is the movement side, the carrying side; the service goes on in spite of great obstacles and opposition, so that there is always the assurance of help, we can always reckon on it.
L.E.S. Would the principle seen in @Hebrews 10: 9: "He takes away the first that he may establish the second", apply here as to the first two sons being taken?
J.T. Yes; Nadab and Abihu suffer judgment according to @Leviticus 10, and Eleazar comes into more responsibility there so that the weakened priesthood would be enhanced. The loss of these two would be felt, as the chapter teaches; Aaron and the other sons would feel the serious breakdown that had taken place. The chapter shows that the sin was divinely pressed home on them. Eleazar, as seen in Numbers, no doubt indicates the gain of the pressure and exercise. In him personality is brought out and priesthood is greatly enhanced.
C.H.H. In @Revelation 1: 5 the Lord is spoken of as "the prince of the kings of the earth".
J.T. That is the idea. It is to be noted in Ezekiel in the person of David in view of millennial times.
A.E.H. Is personality a matter connected with sovereignty, or is it a question of learning to adapt oneself to the society in which one lives?
J.T. In divine things it is developed in relation to God, that is, it begins with Jacob who was made weak by God. He was made strong first and proved his strength in wrestling with the angel and prevailing. He would not let the angel go until he blessed him; Jacob must have blessing, that is the principle of a prince. He has power with God and with men.
{164}
W.L. Would Eleazar be more on the moral side, whereas Aaron would suggest the official side in priesthood?
J.T. Yes, Aaron is the official priest. Eleazar is often called "the son of Aaron". He comes in here in chapter 3 where the Levites are classified according to their services, where they are seen receiving their charges. "Prince of princes of the Levites" is a remarkable title.
G.A.T. Why did you call our attention to the fact that his father was still alive?
J.T. Well, his service is not official. We are not dealing with him officially, but in what he is personally. It alludes in the antitype to the personality developed by the Spirit in the assembly. The presence of this element would secure blessing. I think God is showing us how it works out in meetings for fellowship and ministry; almost universally we get blessing.
C.A.M. Does @Romans 16 suggest this sort of priestly consideration? Those in that chapter are referred to as helpers and so on. The apostle cites a number who are carrying things, and they had help and were helps in their service.
J.T. Paul attested that certain were helpers of himself.
A.R. Do you mean to say the element of help is greater today than it was twenty-five years ago?
J.T. Well, I do not want to make it too personal in that way, but I think that in current meetings of the saints help from God is unfailing. There has been promotion of universal contact giving more scope to the Spirit, so that the Levites who can help, not simply those who go out to preach but those who can really help in the things of God, in divine teaching, are increasing. Surely God alone is to be thanked.
J.T.Jr. "There were many lights in the upper room" (@Acts 20: 8). Would what you are saying suggest the upper room at Troas?
{165}
J.T. Yes. There were those present who represented the work of God through Paul in different sections; seven persons are mentioned who were products of his work from different parts. They were there with him and he is now speaking. Luke says, "We being assembled to break bread ... there were many lights in the upper room". I think that is what is alluded to, the product of the work was there adding to the position. Their presence would add to Paul's ministry -- affording 'help'.
J.S. Taking it as a type, are princely features being acquired?
J.T. I think so. The princely idea begins with Jacob who says, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me" (@Genesis 32: 26). The determination that God approves of obtained the blessing.
Ques. You could not have princeliness without having the whole tabernacle in view, could you? You have alluded to the past: at one time there were many special lists among the brethren, some for instance that only preached the gospel and had little regard for the whole tabernacle.
J.T. Yes. They declined certain other services, whereas Eleazar is over the whole system. He is "prince of princes of the Levites", and then he has the oversight of the whole tabernacle system; so that he would see to it that the Levites attended to their service, which had the whole tabernacle in mind. Officially it would be his father's matter, but moral power is suggested in Eleazar.
J.D. Referring to our brother's point, @Exodus 7: 1, 2 says, "And it came to pass on the day that Moses had completed the setting up of the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and hallowed it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all its utensils, and had anointed them, and hallowed them, that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers¬ houses, the princes of the tribes, they
{166}
that were over them that had been numbered, offered". Would that be the idea of having in the present day the abstract thought of the whole tabernacle system and princes maintaining it?
J.T. Just so. These were princes of Israel, men of wealth in the sense of giving. The Levites had princes too, over which Eleazar was.
A.B. Chapter 3 suggests the persons: "he had the oversight of them that kept the charge of the sanctuary". It seems to be more things in chapter 4 -- the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, and so forth.
J.T. Well, the first thing is the persons as you say, "prince of princes of the Levites". Eleazar had the oversight of them and they kept the charge of the sanctuary. In chapter 4 we have things, the oversight of the oil for the light alluding to the Spirit, to see that room is made for the Spirit; and the fragrant incense for God, and the continual oblation. These are the most precious things that he is over, included in "the oversight of the whole tabernacle, and of all that is therein, over the sanctuary, and over its furniture". He, therefore, would influence all sections related to the service of God. He realises that he needs help, his name means 'help of God'. You can reckon on that.
A.B. Would that be in mind in @Hebrews 13: 7 where it says, "Remember your leaders"? The verse says, "taking courage, we may say, The Lord is my helper", the principle of Eleazar carried forward.
J.T. Just so.
Ques. According to @Exodus 6, he comes in as a third of the four sons. Is there any point in that -- being the third member in the family?
J.T. Well, the genealogy is given in view of Aaron and Moses. We have, "And Aaron took Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar" (@Exodus 6: 23). The third, you mean, would
{167}
have a thought of something reached, as with Enoch, the seventh from Adam. His place is stressed in that sense. There is something reached and then the genealogy runs on, "And Eleazar Aaron's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas". So that it is an outstanding line, a branch of Aaron's family. Eleazar and Phinehas -- God is, I think, calling attention in the records to these two men.
C.H.H. Would the third chapter answer to Romans, and the fourth chapter to Colossians in the tabernacle system?
J.T. Well, I think the elevated character of the things mentioned would go further than those epistles -- to Ephesians. The Levites would be in mind as in Romans in those who help. Colossians contemplates personality in the service, especially in prayer, so that Paul agonised for the Colossians although he had never seen them. They must have been helped through priestly intercession for them of the Eleazar character. And prayer is greatly stressed in Ephesians.
Rem. There is a reference to Eleazar in @1 Chronicles 24: 4, "And there were more head-men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided".
J.T. That is a good reference. The line is greatly stressed, especially through the son, Phinehas. Now we come to the personalities, first, those of the Levites; this element of priesthood we are considering takes special account of persons. We have the three families of the Levites enumerated; as we look at them we shall see how the persons come into evidence and what they have to do. They are all under Eleazar. Being a great personality himself he would have regard for other personalities, subordinates: for the princes of the Levites, and then for the whole family of the Levites. Then we have these precious things which are essential to our service. There would not be any want of light
{168}
on a matter with this priestly element present, no rationing of the oil, plenty of room made for the Spirit as shedding light on things. One brother after another may speak and light is shed on the position. At Corinth the first thing about which Paul remonstrates with them involved leaders; each selected his own leader, Paul, Apollos, Cephas, etc. Later he says, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God?" (@1 Corinthians 3: 16). That is how things are solved -- not by partisan influences.
A.P.T. In @Acts 15 James says, "listen to me". Would that be any help on this line? Would that bring light to bear on the present position?
J.T. Yes, and James would be a prince. He alludes to Peter, one may say, as a prince: "Simon has related", he says, and now, "Listen to me", and he cites David. That is, light is thrown in on the matter. "For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" is the conclusion reached, @Acts 15: 28. The letter written to the gentile believers brought the Spirit in -- it involved the Spirit.
J.D. The result of it was that "it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with the whole assembly, to send chosen men from among them with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, Judas called Barsabas and Silas, leading men among the brethren, having by their hand written thus" (@Acts 15: 22, 23); a good result, showing a priestly administrative spirit.
J.T. I think that occasion in the Acts brought out the princes, men who acted nobly. Certain gave Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship. They were pillars standing by the truth in a personal way. Victory was reached -- for the truth and unity; so that the letter defeated the wicked one, and the Holy Spirit had part in it. "Our beloved Barnabas and Paul". "Leading men among the brethren;" such are fine expressions.
A.R. There has been ministry of late about everything being done in the dignity of the anointing. Would
{169}
that be Eleazar's service? Whether a brother stands up to read the Scriptures, or whatever is done, the power of the anointing should be there.
J.T. I think that is good, everything should be by the anointing, adding to the dignity of the moment. The Lord stood up to read and another handed Him the book; He read by selection and sat down. The eyes of all that were in the synagogue were fastened on Him. Divine dignity was there.
A.R. That is the passage I was thinking of. It says, "the Spirit of the Lord is upon me". Everything should take character from the Lord Jesus.
J.T. Quite so, He is anointed. I suppose that is the idea, that our meetings would all take on this feature of the priesthood. If we have difficulties and questions -- what day we shall have our various meetings, and such matters -- this feature of the priesthood enters into all that. It is not exactly what is commanded, but what priestly feelings would recognise as right and what is known to be advantageous. You can test what is proposed by experience.
G.A.T. Would you say a word as to what the dignity of the anointing means to us?
J.T. It is the Spirit. "No one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit". That is the idea. That is @1 Corinthians 12: 3, and in that chapter the assembly itself is called "the Christ", that is, the anointed vessel. Everyone is speaking in the Spirit.
J.H. Referring to these leading men among the brethren -- Judas and Silas -- it says in @Acts 15: 25, 26, "it seemed good to us ... to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ". Were these men who were giving up their lives -- Barnabas, Paul, Judas and Silas -- princes?
{170}
J.T. I would take them all to be princes. The element represented in Eleazar would be especially seen in Paul in all that chapter. Paul and Titus were there (@Galatians 2), and Paul said those at Jerusalem did not insist on Titus being circumcised. He was calling attention to the manifest expression of the work of God that was in Titus; he was a levitical prince that could not be excelled in Jerusalem. Why should they insist on circumcision? They did not do it because of the power that was in Titus. The spiritual power in the brother overcame the legal spirit, the Judaean spirit; that is what Eleazar would mean, the princely power among the brethren. You do not even need to quote a scripture, the power is there.
F.N.W. Would there be the danger of the clerical principle intruding in relation to the oversight of the oil?
J.T. I think the clerical principle according to Galatians would grieve the Spirit and shut Him out. That is what the apostle is working against. The princes would all disappear if there is not room made for the Holy Spirit if the oil is 'rationed'. The work of God among the gentiles is great, and there is Titus: you cannot bring forth one in Jerusalem more representative of the work of God than he. So that the brethren there did not insist that he should be circumcised.
Ques. Is the reference in 1 Timothy, elders taking care of the assembly of God, on this level?
J.T. I think so. The suggestion is that one aspires to the position of an overseer, but then he must have the needed qualifications, and these would be princely.
L.E.S. Would Paul's word to Timothy in the second epistle, "the same commit thou to faithful men", bear on this in connection with the service of Zadok later on?
J.T. No doubt Zadok is a continuance of the line.
{171}
His sons will be the priests in the millennium -- the princely time; that will be the time of princes.
F.C. Do you think that the word in Titus by Paul bears on this? He speaks of "the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour" (@Titus 3: 6, 7); that is, the pouring out on us would emphasise this.
J.T. It is the lavishness of the Holy Spirit; plenty of it poured out.
Ques. Did Peter act in a princely way when he went with the brethren to Cornelius? Was he not in princely power there? The Holy Spirit fell on those assembled; there was a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Quite so, particularly when you come to Peter's preaching. The Spirit fell on those who heard the word. I think it was heaven honouring them at the moment, the gentile being brought into the greatness already there. Peter would say, I recall what happened at Pentecost -- the pouring out abundantly of the Holy Spirit, which "fell upon them even as upon us".
J.H.E. Even as Peter walked, his shadow would bring results; and napkins taken from Paul would bring results as having been in contact with him.
J.T. Paul had in mind in Ephesus (@Acts 19), that the work should begin in a princely way. There were twelve men there, and he made inquiry, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" That is Eleazar, that is his service, the oversight of the oil for the light, and the fragrant incense, and the continual oblation, and the anointing oil. This inquiry was in accord with Eleazar's service. It was not simply converts Paul was seeking, persons who simply confessed the Lord, but those who would take on princely character and qualities. Philip's work in Samaria came short of that. The Samaritans were rejoicing in the light they had, but the oil awaited Peter and John.
{172}
A.R. If we understood this verse in chapter 4 would it deliver us from local or sectional practices? Eleazar is over the whole tabernacle system and thus what is done is universal in character.
J.T. Yes, there must be universality in things that are done. No local rules are to be brought in. Everything is to be in keeping with what is universal. I think that would enter into what we are saying.
A.R. There is no such thing as a parish assigned to a Levite, is there?
J.T. He stands related to the whole tabernacle system and Eleazar is over it, which means he is attending to the matter of the light and the Holy Spirit.
T.W.D. Do you think that the scripture in the Song of Songs, "Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense", would be an Eleazar feature? It says, "Who is this, she that cometh up from the wilderness?" (@Song of Songs 3: 6). Is not that a Numbers¬ setting?
J.T. It is. All the grime of the wilderness is out of sight. Eleazar tends to that so that we present ourselves aright in the assembly.
T.S. You mentioned the fact that Eleazar's service was carried on when there was movement. Would that mean that it called for greater care and watchfulness?
J.T. Well, you can understand how the parts of the tabernacle would become damaged as they were being taken down and set up. The grime of the wilderness would have to be met. And so it is, "Who is this, she that cometh up from the wilderness?" She is attired suitably for Christ; He is supreme there. Not that they did not rest at times in the wilderness according to Numbers, but characteristically there was movement. It is remarkable that Eleazar's service is almost wholly in the book of Numbers.
W.L. Is that why the priestly thought underlies what is levitical? Eleazar was the son of Aaron the priest, not the son of Aaron the Levite.
{173}
J.T. Well, that runs through. He was the third in the family, as remarked; the first two die, showing that the great burden of the exercise would develop him. I believe special priestly features are contemplated in Eleazar so that we have him presented in Numbers in this way. He must fill up the void; two are lost, and he and Ithamar were a sort of remnant idea, Aaron's "sons that were left" (@Leviticus 10: 12). The more you realise the remnant idea the more dependent you are on God and the more things are worked out in you. God helps you, that is, 'Eleazar'. In addition to the anointing oil, there is "the oversight of the whole tabernacle and of all that is therein, over the sanctuary, and over its furniture;" so that provision is made for the Spirit and for other things as well.
W.L. Is this not especially necessary today, a remnant time?
J.T. It is, because, as you say, we are in remnant times; "the continual oblation", the personality of Christ, to keep that in evidence. I believe that is one of the greatest things in this revival -- that everything is attended to. The Lord is insisting that everything must be attended to that belongs to the tabernacle, and extraneous things must be refused.
H.B. Is that why the light is the first thing mentioned?
J.T. The light is the first thing. It is light from the oil, not from the letter of the Scripture, but from the oil.
A.E.H. There seems to be an element of recovery in Eleazar's service in chapter 16, recovering the censers out of the burning.
J.T. We are going on to that. This is a wonderful matter that we are dealing with, especially here, in that it comes in in connection with what was left of the priesthood. In @Leviticus 10: 12 it says, "And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his
{174}
sons that were left". That is what I was thinking of, that applies to remnant times -- what is *left*. Something has happened and the burden of all this is now on the third son. Of course Ithamar had his part, but Eleazar functioned in a much greater way. In Enoch's time it was the seventh, but this is the third, I believe there is something in that. This is a turning point in Israel. Aaron's services were more restricted after this. The priesthood had failed, but the great service committed to Eleazar indicates that he gained through the sorrow.
Rem. It is easy to see that as the Eleazar side of the service is functioning there will be more for God in the service of the sanctuary.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. God has been helping us for many years, even in the times of the revival, in stressing the *oil*, that is, the Holy Spirit. It is largely a question if there is anything good; we must carry on only what is according to the Scripture; we must make room for the Spirit. There is insistence on the recovery of the truth of the Spirit. "Do you not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" Let us work on those lines. That is what Eleazar would insist on. So the apostle insists on the Spirit in 1 Corinthians.
W.L. Does it suggest, too, that there need be no let-down even in remnant times?
J.T. That is the idea in those "that are left". Eleazar would insist on the oil for the light, and the fragrant incense, something for the nostrils of God. Exodus lays down what these things are, but Eleazar would insist on their *use* in the service.
A.M. @Acts 8 says there were believers in Samaria, but the apostles had to go there and pray before they received the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Yes. At Ephesus Paul attended to that himself, he made it the first thing. He inquires, What about the
{175}
Spirit? The disciples of John had certain light, but he says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" (@Acts 19: 2). They say, We did not hear about Him. The Eleazar service had been absent and Paul brought the truth in, and the light, making way for the oil: so that they got the Spirit. The matter was settled there, but at Samaria Philip did not settle it; he did not raise that question. Many evangelists -- so-called -- have neglected that side; the Glanton exercise in result stressed that side of the matter; since then the Lord has specially helped us to make room for the Spirit.
L.E.S. The insistence on the Spirit in @Revelation 2 and 3 would be basic in regard of the recovery, would it not? It is what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
J.T. Room is made for the Spirit and He is speaking. If room is made for Him, He will be speaking. Our brother raises the question of Samaria: why did not Philip mention the Spirit? He did not, and in the interim before the Spirit was given, the oil brought in, Simon Magus acquired a place, a big man after the flesh; and when the Spirit was given he suggested that it could be bought with money. He perverted the truth, whereas the Spirit coming in would have shut out this man altogether. Peter says, "Thy money go with thee to destruction" (@Acts 8: 20). It is a question of refusing what is extraneous to the position.
J.T.Jr. Would there be a similar matter in the room made for Tobijah in @Nehemiah 13? Instead of making room for the Spirit as a priest should, Eliashib made room for Tobijah.
J.T. Quite so, that is a good reference. The priest's business should be looking out for the Spirit and making room for Him.
J.H.E. What does John mean when he says, "try the spirits"? Is there a possibility that other spirits may seek to take the place of the Holy Spirit?
{176}
J.T. Clearly. So Paul gives you tests and so does John. He indicates what marks the Spirit of God, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, if they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God" (@1 John 4: 1, 2). That is his test. Paul says, "no one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 12: 3). That is a severe test. There is hardly time for much more, but this is a wonderful passage, this matter of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, and the continual oblation. Eleazar would insist on the personality of Jesus: that is the oblation before God, "Jesus Christ come in flesh" -- that is the meat offering.
J.S. Paul says in 2 Timothy, "But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus". Does that apply?
J.T. Just so. The fact is his whole service is marked by this Eleazar spirit, looking after things for God, the most precious things cared for. And the anointing oil is distinct from the oil for the light. Oil for light is one thing, but oil for anointing is another. It is the Spirit in both cases, but the anointing is outward dignity.
C.A.M. Did I understand you to say that the oil for the light refers to the ministry? It is like a candlestick throwing light on the greatness of Christ.
J.T. Quite so.
J.W.D. Whereas in regard to the oblation, oil and fragrant incense would be connected with that. What would you say about that?
J.T. Well, the oblation would imply all that. Eleazar would see to all that. The incense also accompanied the lighting of the lamps. The oblation refers to Christ, His personality, whether here in the flesh,
{177}
or in the forty days, or as He is now. And then it is oversight of "the whole tabernacle, and of all that is therein, over the sanctuary, and over its furniture". Nothing is left out of all that pertains to the tabernacle. The priests "that were left" applies to our own times, remnant times. Thus there are those who can attend to all these matters.
Then going on to chapter 16, we have a very interesting bit of service as to the censers that Korah and his company had used. "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning; and scatter the fire afar; for they are hallowed, the censers of these sinners who have forfeited their life; and they shall make them into broad plates for the covering of the altar; for they presented them before Jehovah, therefore they are hallowed; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel. And Eleazar the priest took the copper censers, which they that were burnt had presented; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar; as a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron come near to burn incense before Jehovah, that he be not as Korah, and as his band, -- as Jehovah had said to him through Moses" (verses 36 - 40). I think it is a most remarkable service. It applies peculiarly to our own times because this rebellion of Korah and his band is christendom; it is rebellion against Christ as the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. What they used in their opposition was in itself right, the things were hallowed and used, and not to be forfeited. Their lives were forfeited because of their rebellion, but it brings out that right things do not lose their rightness by being used by alien hands. What is of God is to be gathered and secured as witness. However it has been used in christendom, whatever is of God must be maintained all down through the ages. It is to be
{178}
gathered and secured. So that I think this remarkable testimony should be among us. We should never allow clericalism among us, but whatever of God that has been used by it should be preserved.
J.H. In what way do you say the censers were hallowed?
J.T. Well, they were hallowed in that they were used. The fact of the matter is, the truth has been carried on in these hands; it has not lost, the truth is the truth, the Bible is the Bible. Many things that have been used in a lawless way will not lose their value, as in themselves of God they retain their value. The spirit of Eleazar will see that they are not lost, but brought in and used at the altar.
J.H. What do you say about these 250 men being princes of the assembly?
J.T. Their princely position, no doubt, led them to believe they could join successfully in Korah's band against Moses and Aaron. Being princes, "men of renown", they had distinction and lent great weight to the rebellion. In the history of the assembly, especially at the outset of general clerical leadership in which Christ's authority and the presence among the saints of the Holy Spirit were, in principle at least, set aside, this movement was seen in antitype. That is not what the early leaders among the saints were like. "Remember your leaders", we are told, but they were not like that. But the subsequent leaders are described in @Acts 20: 30, "from among your own selves shall rise up men speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them". They turned away and rebelled against the truth. These censers were hallowed as in use. In christendom up to the time of the revival it was not, in some sense, open apostasy; there was something in it. The point here is that the censers are gathered up and used as a testimony for all time against lawlessness.

Ques. Would you on that principle accept the baptism performed by a clergyman?
J.T. I should indeed, even if it is by a Roman Catholic priest -- assuming that the words employed were expressive of the truth.
Rem. Balaam used the altar and rams and bullocks in connection with Balak's desires, but the things were right in themselves.
J.T. The most beautiful prophecies came from a man who said he would never see the Lord. What he said God caused him to say.
A.R. These censers were moulded together into broad plates. It was apparently in view of keeping persons from coming near to the altar.
J.T. That is, that Korah's conduct should never be repeated. "That no stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron come near to burn incense before Jehovah". Antitypically this means that no one who has not the Holy Spirit should serve as priest.
G.D. Was there an attempt on the part of king Uzziah to do what Korah had done when he went into the sanctuary to burn incense and was stopped by the priests?
J.T. Yes, that was the sort of thing. It was one who was not a priest. These men were not priests; they were Levites, just men having to teach or to preach and they presumed to act as priests. Such men become trained at schools and colleges, become 'ordained', acquire a 'flock' and act as priests. Many of them have not the Spirit of God. That is exactly what marks christendom. Such a man acting in the office of a priest is setting aside the apostleship and priesthood of Christ and the Spirit of God.
J.H.E. In going out of Egypt God allowed the children of Israel to take things with them that were used in the tabernacle. They were right things, were they not?
{180}
J.T. Utensils -- silver and gold; and so in Jericho the metals were preserved. These were not gifted men really, but they based their claim on that; they claimed the priesthood, the position of Aaron. So that christendom is full of priests. The clergy generally are called priests. But they set aside the true priesthood -- believers who have the Spirit. Believers are a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, @1 Peter 2: 5.
A.R. In the days of Uzziah the priests burned incense before God on the altar, and they would allow none other to do so. Would that be an Eleazar feature?
J.T. Exactly. They were very bold too; they forced the king out. Indeed *he left himself*. His evil was exposed to himself, which is important.
J.D. The point comes out in @Numbers 16: 40 that the broad plates were made "as a memorial to the children of Israel". The divine idea of representation is kept up and this is a witness of God's judgment.
J.T. Upon any who would act as Korah did. We have had that sort of thing since the revival; the movement in Plymouth involved clericalism, and the leader morally under the sure government of God suffered. God does not change His mind about things in the remnant.
Now a word about chapter 19, the red heifer, something that you might expect to fit in under this service: that is, the wilderness and how it is met in Christ. Christ was different from men in this world, manifestly different. The colour undoubtedly has an allusion to that. "And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without blemish, wherein is no defect, and upon which never came yoke; and ye shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring it outside the camp, and one
{181}
shall slaughter it before him. And Eleazar the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle of its blood directly before the tent of meeting seven times. And one shall burn the heifer before his eyes; its skin and its flesh, and its blood, with its dung, shall he burn" (@Numbers 19: 1 - 5). It is a subjective allusion because it is a heifer, a female. It is a question of the *state* of the saints, and Eleazar would deal with that in bringing in and enforcing the death of Christ as it is viewed in this remarkable type; an unusual type, not only because it is a female, but because of the unusual colour -- red.
C.A.M. The *altar* is not stressed here.
J.T. It is not mentioned. The provision here is for the saints rather than for God. However, God's claims are recognised in the sprinkled blood. "Eleazar the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle of its blood directly before the tent of meeting seven times". It is a question of keeping the relations of the people right with God; it is the tent of meeting, not the altar. The whole position would be affected by worldliness in the people -- defilement through contact with a dead person. It is no question of doctrine now or of open lawlessness as in chapter 16; but of uncleanness through touching the dead body of a man. The heifer is a subjective idea, it suggests the need of a state suitable to God. The water of purification is provided in this remarkable way and if one becomes unclean as stated, and fails to purify himself as prescribed, his case is most serious -- "that soul shall be cut off from Israel".
F.N.W. Would Eleazar's service seen here link with @Micah 6: 4, 5 -- Eleazar acting in relation to worldly principles?
J.T. It would. That was the kind of thing that was dealt with after Balaam's prophecy, after the great light that came in through Balaam. @Micah 6: 5 says, "My people, remember now what
{182}
Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the *righteousness of Jehovah"*. 'Righteousnesses' is really the word, it is plural. It is how God came in in relation to Balaam and Balak when it was in mind to corrupt the people through Balaam's counsel. God answers him and overthrows this principle of worldliness, of mixing with others, of mixed marriages and social links: "that ye may know the righteousness of Jehovah". This would enter into the service of Eleazar here in meeting the state of worldliness by this remarkable type of Christ -- the red heifer, alluding to the subjective condition of the saints. There is a means of cleansing set there permanently in the ashes of the heifer with the running water; that is the means of cleansing, and unforgivable aggravation of the evil is in the refusal to use it. "That soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, for he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled on him". There are two periods mentioned, three days and seven days, verse 12. We alluded to three in connection with Eleazar, but here it requires seven also; seven is the complete exercise. It is a subjective matter, and if one is defiled through evil associations he has to go through solemn exercises before God, judging the state involved, as *feeling* it, for seven days. He must purify himself with the water of separation on the third day and on the seventh day.
A.E.H. We hear it said sometimes that we cannot deal with state, we can only deal with overt acts that are the result of state. But what you are suggesting is that the person involved does deal with the state.
J.T. He does. The person that is defiled has to deal with it, and if he does not he is cut off. That is the point in this chapter. The death of Christ as attested in the fullest priestly way -- in the power of the
{183}
Spirit -- is available, and one who is unclean and fails to use it must be cut off. It is most solemn.
J.S. This all emphasises the uniqueness of Christ.
J.T. Yes, there is no one like Him. How manifestly different from men of this world He is!
G.D. Would that come into the Lord's prayer in @John 17 as He takes account of the saints as not of this world, though in it?
J.T. Just so. He says, with the deepest feeling, "Righteous Father, -- and the world has not known thee" (@John 17: 25). The Lord felt that. So John says in his first epistle, "Love not the world, nor the things in the world ... all that is in the world ... is not of the Father" (@1 John 2: 15, 16).
J.D. Would John seek to touch the feelings of the saints to draw them to Christ when he says, "This is he that came by water and blood?" Would that have in view the appreciation of Christ in this character?
J.T. Quite so. John saw the blood and water flow from the side of the Saviour and the Spirit bears witness. All that would be, so to speak, Eleazar's part. Eleazar, as a type, enters much into John's ministry.
J.H. Another distinctive feature is, "upon which never came yoke". What do you say about that?
J.T. That would mean that Christ never came under the yoke of men or the world: He never came under adverse influence. He was infinitely free for the maintenance of the will of God; always doing the things that are pleasing to the Father, (@John 8: 29).
H.B. Hebrews says, "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners".
J.T. That is right, "Such a high priest became us" (@Hebrews 7: 26).
{184}
LEADERSHIP (5)
@Exodus 17: 8 - 16; @Exodus 33: 11; @Numbers 13: 16; @Numbers 27: 15 - 23
J.T. These passages contemplate Joshua before he became an official leader, so that they afford instruction for the younger brethren who as yet may not be definitely recognised in the exercise of what ability they may have. These scriptures indicate how young men qualify for the ministry and in due course become, in part at least, recognised in a spiritual sense. @Exodus 17 contains the first mention of Joshua, and it is clear that he had already acquired the confidence of Moses. Moses seemed to have no hesitation in appointing him to the service in mind, leaving it with him to choose the men who were to fight Amalek, an important charge, but only temporary. He was not made commander-in-chief of the armies of Israel. He was selected for this particular battle and obviously was successful; and not only so, but it is indicated that he should have in his mind, permanently, the facts of the battle. Moses was to rehearse it to him. "And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua". The article being placed before the word 'book' shows that it was one already existent. The instruction is for the younger men. In these meetings we have had considerable instruction for the older ones, but Joshua and Eleazar represent younger men acting and serving and even leading whilst their elders were still living. They both became leaders before the more official leaders of Israel died. It is a question of how they qualify in leadership, in such service.
Ques. In @Numbers 1: 18 where the young men are called up from 20 years old it says, "they declared their pedigrees after their families". Would that be in line with what you have in mind?
J.T. The allusion would be to believers who have the Spirit, the time of manhood; not full grown manhood
{185}
not fully developed, but coming to it. In @Numbers 27 Joshua is regarded by Jehovah as a man who has the Spirit characteristically. We hope to come to that because it is the main point. Moses expressed the need of the moment to Jehovah and Jehovah knew the man. Moses knew him too but did not nominate him. He nominated him for the battle of Rephidim, but not here. He himself is about to die. God has told him that he is about to die, and he is concerned about who should take on the work, a matter which is always a concern to any who are in it, because the position of all servants is transitory.
F.N.W. Moses and Aaron, Miriam and Eleazar were of the tribe of Levi. Joshua is from Ephraim. Is that significant?
J.T. It is not a question of priesthood; he is the successor of Moses in leadership. He is styled the attendant of Moses in his own book at the beginning.
A.R. I used to think that this conflict was confined to younger men, yet Moses says to Joshua, "Choose us men, and go out, fight". What do you say about that?
J.T. Well, it is the first great battle with the Amalekites and it involves the whole position. That is Satan in the flesh, and the older are not any more immune in a sense from his influence than the younger. But clearly it is a battle that affects the young men definitely, though the older ones are essential to the success of the conflict as we see in Moses and Aaron and Hur. It is a sort of battle that is always here, always current, or intermittently current, and the young are especially in mind because, even though they may be able to teach or preach, they are apt to come under the power of Satan and the flesh. It is a most serious matter. They are to understand how this character of satanic power is to be met so that they should always be available in the service.
A.E.M. Would the expression "from generation to
{186}
generation" imply that every generation would have a kind of crisis, an acute phase of this matter?
J.T. Mr. Darby used to say that, no matter what scripture was being considered at a Bible reading, they always came to the 7th of Romans. That means that this battle was more continuous in his day than in ours; the instruction is always needed.
J.S. How are you viewing leadership this afternoon?
J.T. In a military way, but as just temporary. Joshua is not appointed commander-in-chief of the armies of Israel, but he is selected for the moment. Moses commissions him at once. He says, "Choose us men, and go out, fight with Amalek". He is quite definite about it, and the inference is that Joshua is a known man.
J.D. Coming in here consequent upon the smiting of the rock and the gift of the Spirit, would it involve in Joshua a knowledge of the character of the conflict? The passage says, "Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim;" that was consequent upon the gift of the Spirit. Would that involve that the leader puts himself in touch with any soul in whom, in this sense, the enemy has been active?
J.T. Yes. The thing being rehearsed in his ears by Moses would mean that Joshua would have to do with it again.
C.H.H. Would he have to do with it again in the great occasion recorded in @Joshua 10, where Jehovah listened to the voice of a man? That is recorded in the book again.
J.T. Just so. It was recorded in the book of Jasher. That is a very prominent link with our subject. There it is the voice of a man, not a military leader, but a man. The idea in both involves manhood, only we have youthful manhood here. We do not know how old Joshua was, but he is called a young man later.
L.E.S. You referred to the meaning of the name
{187}
'Eleazar' in relation to the service yesterday. Would the meaning of 'Joshua' have a bearing on what you had in mind this afternoon?
J.T. I thought it would come up in relation to @Numbers 13, but of course he is given his full name here; he did not have this name actually when he fought this battle, but this is Moses *writing* about the matter later, giving him the full name. 'Jehoshua' means 'Jehovah is Saviour'. He gets it at the time Israel should have entered into Canaan, as if Moses connects this first battle with the many battles in which he would have to lead in the land. The new name is in view of the land. There it is 'Jehovah is Saviour', but here it is the beginning of his service and his name would be just Hoshea -- meaning 'deliverance'.
C.A.M. Moses, Aaron and Hur -- do you look at them subjectively or objectively?
J.T. Aaron and Hur represent certain elements, not simply objective, but operative in us; priestly grace and purity. The intercession on high is in the Lord Himself; Moses really is in an intercessory position on high, only that he has the staff of God. He says, "I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand". So that it is more than priesthood; the kind of service involved is from above, and is more than priesthood. At this stage in the believer's history, that is in young people, there is usually the danger of independency. In this conflict the secret is often the want of subjection. Moses here taking the rod of God would mean that we must be subject, if we are to be victorious. We *must* have the element of subjection or the enemy will triumph. The conflict refers to @Romans 7; the flesh in us, if undetected and unjudged, allows Satan to work through it; we have to judge it. That is what is in mind. As young people we are apt to be more or less independent, and the enemy gets advantage over us. The flesh gets power because of that.
{188}
L.E.S. Referring to his name again, it is significant that the name Hoshea means 'deliverance', which would fit in with @Romans 7.
J.T. Yes, "who shall deliver me?" But Joshua is a greater thought -- 'Jehovah is Saviour'. "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord" brings in God Himself. The Spirit of liberty as seen in chapter 8 is God seen in the believer in this very connection. It is a question of the power of the Spirit.
J.S. Do you think we have two special features of the testimony introduced here?
J.T. I think Aaron and Hur are just elements in the position; priestly race and purity are in view, particularly the element of purity. It is a question of the flesh and its lust, as the apostle says, "the commandment having come, sin revived, but I died". The "commandment" referred to lust. "Sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me".
G.A.T. Would Joshua's success depend on Moses¬ attitude?
J.T. That is exactly what is stated, but he is weak himself. The whole position is to create a state of dependence on God. First of all we are told, "Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill". There is no earlier instruction about that. "And it came to pass when Moses raised his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. And Moses¬ hands were heavy; then they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on this side, and one on that side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun". So that it is a very delicate and critical situation. It is intended to create a certain state in us that is to be permanent. This sort of thing is going on from generation to generation, and we must not lose the advantage of Joshua's experience. Every
{189}
day brings its own advantage. You overcome today better than you did yesterday, that is, if you are truly in the conflict. So that Joshua represents the kind of military power that is needed to face the enemy in his attacks through the flesh in us; we must not be discouraged with the character of our experience. We are to *go on*. Thus the victory is assured. God is not giving up. "And he said, For the hand is on the throne of Jah; Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation". I would take it that the hand would be the enemy's hand. The throne of Jah would point to how fully God is entering into this matter on account of His people. He is not giving up, and we are not to be discouraged by the incessant character of this opposition. Joshua, although a type of Christ here, also in a sense represents the believer in this conflict, and he is not to give up because of difficulties. It is a most critical time. But Moses¬ "hands were steady until the going down of the sun". The day was won!
J.S. Would the end of Luke fit in here where the Lord's hands were lifted up?
J.T. Well, that is the sort of thing, but there is no weakness there. It is a question of the state of things existent in the saints in these men being brought forward in this way. We have no high priest in Israel yet but we are looking toward it. No doubt the secret of deflections of many young people turning away is that they get overcome with the power of the flesh. They do not face the thing. They make up their minds it is not worth while going through with the matter and they turn away. It *is* worth while to face the matter and not give way to it.
W.L. Would you say that Amalek would have the whole position in mind?
J.T. The attack was really a challenge to the whole divine position. "Choose us men". It was the whole
{190}
position, and Moses understood that, and that the conflict would go on. According to Moses, Jehovah said it would be a continuous thing, so that the present battle would be of great advantage to us in the way of experience in a future day. The lesson for us today is that Joshua is a trustworthy man, a successful man; and that he is susceptible to support coming in from other sources. He is dependent upon others. He cannot stand by himself. The position is peculiar and *must* be understood spiritually. The names of the different persons mentioned must be kept in view as entering into the whole combination. Each one represents an element entering into this most important exercise. Evidently Moses trusted Joshua and that he would know the kind of men capable of military service at that time, and he left it to him to choose them. I thought that it would be a point for us to establish our trustworthiness among the brethren.
A.R. "Choose us men" -- does that mean that the men would be characteristically persons who judge themselves?
J.T. I would say that. It is a very important thing to establish a reputation, not that you are seeking it in another sense, but a reputation for trustworthiness and reliability -- that you can be trusted with a mission.
S.McC. Was that seen in Titus? Paul left him to choose elders in a place where there was a reputation for fleshly activities.
J.T. That enters into this. Those two men, Titus and Timothy, were looked at as reliable by Paul; so that they were trusted with the selection of elders. The elders were to be *themselves* commendable.
A.A.T. Is there any connection with the woman in @John 4 as to her link with the flesh and the way she lived afterwards?
J.T. Yes, she must have overcome. She went to the men and told them about the Lord; in fact she went further, she began to take care of His interests.
{191}
The Lord would regard her as reliable. It is reliability that is so important in the service of God, it means that persons can be trusted.
R.W.S. Is the believer in the last verse of @Romans 7 unfurling this banner "Jehovah-nissi", when he says, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law"?
J.T. That is right. I myself, it is a question of the ego; he has found himself, his own feet, in the sense of responsibility, and resolves with the mind to serve the law of God. He is establishing a foundation that will give character to him, the character of reliability. None of us is of much account until he begins to make resolves before God.
A.L. The opening of the section reads, "And Amalek came and fought with Israel". We should bear in mind that the enemy is ever ready to come in, so we must always be on guard.
J.T. Yes, it is that he sees an opening here. He works through the flesh; where he moves he has seen an opening where the flesh is unjudged. He watches us: he sees our propensities, our displeasures, our likes. He knows what to bring before you to draw out the flesh, to gratify it.
C.H.H. What would the altar that comes in here refer to?
J.T. It is a landmark. It is a point reached, a victory acquired. It is said that "Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi" -- 'Jehovah my banner'. He fought under it successfully, and God, I suppose, would be worshipped accordingly as helping us against this awful thing, Satan in the flesh.
L.E.S. Samuel dealing with Agag would be in view of David's superiority over Saul and David being able to deal with Amalek. David knew how to deal with the flesh and Saul did not.
J.T. Just so. Saul had just shown how unable he was to deal with Amalek. In fact he was hiding the
{192}
real facts of the matter, which is often the case in such circumstances. We are inclined to deceive and dissemble. That is what he did, so that the Amalekite king came "delicately;" "Surely the bitterness of death is past", he said, (@1 Samuel 15: 32). There was fleshly deception in his attitude, but Samuel hewed him in pieces before the Lord. That is when another king had to be selected. It is a question as to whether Samuel himself had *wholly* judged Saul's character. God says, Go to the house of Jesse to choose another king and I will tell you when you get there who it is to be, as much as to say, Do not decide it yourself. I think really there was a want in Samuel, so that as soon as the first, named Eliab, came, he says, "Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him;" but the Lord had not told him. What was the secret? The height of his stature, and his countenance. That is a very important matter for us now, for no matter how much we have advanced in the truth, under certain circumstances we do attach *some* importance to the flesh.
A.E.H. Does not David show his moral superiority when the news is brought of Saul's death? It would naturally be very gratifying to David, but he slays the Amalekite who brought the message. He carried out what Saul failed to carry out.
J.T. It was the time in which the enemy would attack David on those lines but he maintained the truth against him.
Ques. Might it be said that Samuel judged the Amalekitish principle in Agag the king, but that the same principle was in Saul in a more subtle form? Samuel mourned overlong for him.
J.T. Just so. And that, no doubt, is the secret of his selecting Eliab in his own mind; he must have been a man much like Saul. Jehovah's rebuke would indicate this -- "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature".
{193}
C.H.H. If we do not slay the Amalekite, he will slay us? The Amalekite slew Saul.
G.D. How do you explain the power of Amalek, the fact that war went on from generation to generation?
J.T. Well, Satan will never give up. We get the idea of the power available on our side. We have power over him as we resist him. It is a question of using it, of facing him.
A.R. Is that why it says, "Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword" (@Exodus 17: 13), as if it were not a complete victory, as if it might come up again?
J.T. That is what Jehovah says. "Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation". It is because Satan is continually attacking. Resisting him, we refuse to accede to his temptations in the flesh; then we overcome him. But he will attack where there is an opening. In one sense he is a defeated foe though ever ready to attack, and as we resist him he flees from us. In the millennium he will be bound. But now in the all-wise government of God he is still permitted to attack the saints. His activities are largely through the flesh.
S.J.H. What is involved in the going out? "Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us men, and go out".
J.T. It is a military figure of speech. The meaning would be that you take on military attire and attitude m meeting Satan's temptations in the flesh. In the type we have before us, of course, we have physical action.
A.E.H. Is it offensive rather than defensive -- to go out?
J.T. Evidently; there was plenty of offensive power there, going out would mean that; but Amalek had already come and started to fight. He came and fought with Israel.
{194}
J.D. "The hand is on the throne of Jah". Is it that Satan acts in the flesh to contend what is in the believer's soul?
J.T. That is what is meant, I think. It is in the believer's soul, the throne is there, God shall reign there. So that "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". God's rights are acknowledged.
R.W.S. Would the smiting of the rock in the earlier verses be used as leverage in the soul of the believer to deal with the enemy?
J.T. You mean the sufferings of Christ; the Holy Ghost coming in consequent upon the sufferings of Christ. That side of the truth is calculated to touch our hearts. He suffered that we might drink.
J.D. It was the same staff with which Moses smote the river. The sufferings of Christ are the basis laid for the gift of the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so, and now that same staff is on the top of the hill. So we should be in the thing, judging our wills and independency, for that is where the weakness lies.
A.E.H. In the scripture in @Hebrews 2: 14, 15, where the enemy is spoken of as being annulled, you have the suggestion of being set free. Is that an allusion to the power of the Spirit? It says, "And might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage". The war is going on but the power of the Spirit is there to set free or deliver.
J.T. Yes, that we might be in that liberty. Now we may go on to @Exodus 33. That brings out, not the military side of the young brother, but his love of the house. The psalmist depicts how the believer loves the habitation of the Lord's house, the place where His glory dwelleth (@Psalm 26: 8). It is a beautiful trait in a young person. Moses, it is said, "returned to the camp; but his attendant, Joshua, the son of Nun, a
{195}
young man, departed not from within the tent". He is not said to be a young man in the other scriptures, but he is here. He remained "within;" the power over Amalek, Satan in the flesh, maintained, will concurrently cause the development of the love of the habitation of God.
C.R. As a good soldier he was not entangled with the affairs of this life.
J.T. He is not taken up wholly with military affairs, he loves the divine dwellings as in @Psalm 84: 2, "the courts;" but here it is "within the tent". He departed not from within the tent.
C.DeB. Was that the same thing that characterised Timothy?
J.T. Well, I think it was in mind when Paul said to him, "if I delay;" in order that, if there was delay in his coming, one should know how to behave in the house of God. I suppose it was at Ephesus that the truth of the house was specially brought out, but the point is to know how to behave oneself in it. And then to know what it is: "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly the mystery of piety is great. God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory" (@1 Timothy 3: 15, 16). That is the inner aspect of the house, the mysterious side of it, which a true hater of Amalek would love. That is his place. David said, "One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire of him in his temple" (@Psalm 27: 4).
Ques. Do you think the "camp" should be taken as the sphere of profession, which had been owned, but there is now need to separate and seek the presence of God in the tent outside?
{196}
J.T. That is the thought; the tent had been separated. "Moses took the tent, and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the Tent of meeting" (@Exodus 33: 7). And then we are told in verses 9 - 11, "And it came to pass when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and Jehovah talked with Moses. And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent; and all the people rose and worshipped, every man at the entrance of his tent. And Jehovah spoke with Moses face to face". That is the position, that is the idea of the house, and that is the blessing, honour and dignity attached to it and to those who love it. Joshua remains there but Moses goes back into the camp; for the Lord has a right to do so, to visit His people wherever they are; for He knows where they are. But the lover of the house would stay in it. It is a question of communion, of maintaining communion with God in His dwelling.
C.H.H. Would the truth in Corinthians enter into it, partaking of the Supper worthily as having dealt with the flesh?
J.T. We are to judge ourselves: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat". The Corinthians were partaking of the Lord's supper in an unseemly manner.
C.H.H. I was wondering if this action of Joshua indicates the advance he has made? Does the first mention of him in overcoming the flesh qualify him for this position?
J.T. I think the link is just there. In the meantime he had been on the mountain with Moses and of course he thus had had great advantages; but in coming down he was unable to discern the difference between war and singing. His discerning powers were not strong. I suppose it shows here that we need to keep with God, our safety lies in His habitation. What advantage there is as young people attending the meetings keep with
{197}
the brethren! The enemy, to that extent, is at a disadvantage in his attacks. You cannot afford to absent yourself from the meetings, from being near to God, because if you do you lose connection and get neglectful, and Amalek will get power over you. Thus let us stay in the place of safety.
L.E.S. The "attendants on the Word" in Luke would have in view the service of the house, although perhaps on a little higher level than the attendant of Moses. Would that be right?
J.T. Yes, you mean those who were eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word. The Lord can go back to the camp, He has rights there, "the Lord knows those that are his" (@2 Timothy 2: 19). That is what Paul says, and He attends to His people wherever they are, but in His own way. It is another thing for Joshua to go back because *separation* from the camp had already taken place. There were some there who needed attention because they were worshipping -- although at the entrances of their tents.
G.A.T. Would you say a little on the thought of Moses leaving the camp and going back to the camp? Would it answer at all to the early part of Acts?
J.T. Yes, I would think that. God had not left the Jews yet, that is the principle. But @Hebrews 13: 13 teaches us to go forth to Christ without the camp, bearing His reproach.
Ques. Why does it refer to Joshua as the son of Nun?
J.T. That is his identification. Identification is very common in Scripture: Eleazar, the son of Aaron; Joshua, the son of Nun.
R.A. Do the features of the overcomer come out in Joshua here?
J.T. I think so. He has overcome Amalek, he has had the rehearsal of that victory in his ears, and he is not going to give him any advantage. The house was
{198}
lovable to him. It was God's chief interest, though as yet it was not the final tabernacle, which was not yet made; but it was the tent of meeting where God met with His people and where His people could meet with Him.
C.DeB. There is a great danger in connection with conditions in the world because they hinder brethren from attending the meetings. Would you say the enemy is in that?
J.T. That is one of the strongest points to make when speaking to God about this terrible war -- the possible effect of it on young brothers and young sisters called into the services. They are put into circumstances they never were in before and may not be equal to, conditions in which they are greatly exposed. Of course they would go to the meetings whenever they could; it is their salvation to go to the meetings, to keep as near as possible to the brethren.
W.L. So that you would say you need both sides of the matter: the war with Amalek is the negative side, whereas not departing from the tent is the positive side.
J.T. That is right -- where God is. It is really the place of protection, and at the same time the place of enjoyment; the place where His honour dwells. The Psalms should be read with the books of Moses because they give examples of experience flowing from the light of the Pentateuch.
F.N.W. Does @Psalm 84: 10 enter into it, "I had rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God, than dwell in the tents of wickedness"? Would that be Joshua's voice here?
J.T. That is what I thought.
M.O. Does Joshua furnish a good lead?
J.T. We might see that in this "young man" and in Eleazar, for the young have largely to learn the principles of leadership by example.
{199}
J.W.D. What do you say about John Mark? Would you say that he left the tent of meeting?
J.T. I would say that. He returned to Jerusalem and at that point we have the remarkable phrase, "Paul and his company". The energy of the Spirit would be there and hence salvation and blessing generally. John Mark elected to be outside of that and have some other company than Paul's.
J.W.D. I was wondering if an Amalekite attack would induce us to leave the tent of meeting?
J.T. Yes. One thing to be cultivated is good company. @Hebrews 10: 25 says, "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves, as the custom is with some", and I think the Lord is helping the brethren to value one another.
F.C. Do you think that Luke appreciated that company in Acts where he begins various passages with "we" did this and that?
J.T. That is right. As soon as he joins the company he is speaking as one of them; he does not say 'they'. Very often people say, *They* are doing this and that, whereas the word should be, *We* are. If it is anything to us at all it ought to be our company.
J.V.S. @Psalm 122: 1 would bear on that, would it not? "Let us go into the house of Jehovah;" it is a question of where your heart is.
J.T. Quite so. It was a real joy to the heart of the psalmist to go to the house of God and he went with a joyous company: "Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem".
E.G.McA. John Mark went back to Jerusalem in the face of the trend of the Holy Spirit.
J.T. I suppose he was influenced by natural feelings about Jerusalem, and he may have thought the road was hard, and the work hard and trying. At any rate, he abandoned those who, with Paul, were moving in the energy of the Spirit in the testimony of God.
{200}
A.R. Does the Lord Jesus show leadership in this way at the age of twelve? His father and mother started home but He was still in the temple.
J.T. Yes. It was His Father's business.
A.E.H. Do you think those men who were associated with Joshua in battle against Amalek might be carried forward here in those who are called *men*? In verse 10 it says they "rose and worshipped, every man at the entrance of his tent".
J.T. Yes. "It came to pass that every one who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp". There were others, however, who did not go out to the tent of meeting. "And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose up, and stood every man at the entrance of his tent, and they looked after Moses until he entered into the tent". Those in verse 7 go all the way. "Every one who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp". Standing in their doors is not the same as going out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.
J.S. Is this the movement that is recorded in Hebrews, "Let us go forth to him"?
J.T. Yes, the allusion is to that, "Let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach" (@Hebrews 13: 13). There are other incidents as to Joshua that could be called to mind, and perhaps negatively ought to be in our minds so that they should be avoided. Joshua showed partisanship in @Numbers 11 at the time of the transfer of Moses¬ power to others. Some remained in the camp and prophesied; Joshua would not rest at that. He asked Moses to forbid them. That is a negative thing, but it does point to a danger with the best of young brothers of having a preference for certain ones, especially those who might have been a help to them.
J.D. When the Spirit of God put Paul forward
{201}
instead of Barnabas, John Mark's uncle, there was apparently a party feeling with John Mark, that he was not satisfied to have Paul promoted.
J.T. "Paul and his company" brought in just there would show, as we have said, that there was a spiritual attraction around Paul which did not affect John Mark. Now @Numbers 13 brings out the promotion of this young brother clearly in view of the land. Joshua is going into Canaan. He is going to lead Israel into Canaan and the leader evidently needs all the spiritual dignity that can be conferred upon him, because, given in this sense, it is power. The Lord accorded titles to certain persons, and it implies that it would increase their power; so that Jehovah says, "Moses called Hoshea" -- which means 'Deliverance' -- "the son of Nun, Jehoshua" -- which means 'Jehovah is Saviour'. I suppose Moses would have the sense, prophetically at least, that while Joshua was in Canaan there would be one there who was trustworthy, who would apprehend the whole position before God in view of the ultimate result. It would be Jehovah's power, but through this young man in due course.
E.G.McA. Why is it that Joshua was the only man of these twelve whose name was changed? Caleb was also an outstanding man in perseverance.
J.T. Well, he was not going to get the official status of Joshua, for after all, such a title must be prophetic. Paul says Timothy received a gift through prophecy -- God indicating to a man beforehand what he is to do. It ought to have a great influence over him for good. The more sense of responsibility I have, the more upright in the sense of it, the more power I shall need, and God furnishes this so that His work may prosper. Anyone who did not recognise distinction in this change of name -- Hoshea to Jehoshua -- would be delinquent in Israel. Deliverance is a good deal, but 'Jehovah is Saviour' is more; it is to be demonstrated
{202}
in this young man, and therefore I think the matter is prophetic.
W.L. Would you say his service among the saints is to be more universal, whereas Caleb's was more sectional? The thought that 'Jehovah is Saviour' would suggest that this service is in relation to the whole position.
J.T. Quite so. Caleb was a great man, and greatly to be distinguished too, but he could not be equal with Joshua.
C.H.H. Is it significant that Joshua represented the tribe of Ephraim, whereas Caleb represented the tribe of Judah? What is the significance of these people representing the different tribes?
J.T. The tribes are all represented, a prophetic matter, in view of the distribution of the land later. So that when Moses goes up Mount Nebo to see the land it is taken account of generally according to the tribal positions, not what it used to be.
G.A.T. Caleb felt the same as Joshua in regard to going into the land.
J.T. Yes, he was a worthy colleague, as you might say; what comes out in regard of him is not an official appointment, but what he was morally and spiritually. Joshua is to acquire official appointment, according to @Numbers 27.
A.E.H. Do you think this name received from Moses is intended to leave the sense upon Joshua in after days that he has the Lord with him in leadership?
J.T. Quite so. You can understand he would say, I must be true to my name. We are wonderfully named. "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God" (@1 John 3: 1). And again, "the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch" (@Acts 11: 26). You must be true to your name. "If as a christian" Peter says, @1 Peter 4: 16. So Joshua would say, My name prophetically is 'Jehovah is Saviour'. I have no doubt what it
{203}
says in @Joshua 10 enters into that, how God hearkened to the voice of a man so that there might be complete victory in Israel.
F.C. Do you think that underlying this changing of names is the fact that God says, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man *in whom is the Spirit*"? Caleb is never spoken of like that.
J.T. Yes. That is what we are coming to now -- in @Numbers 27.
C.R. When 'Saul' is changed to 'Paul' he is said to be "filled with the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 13: 9).
J.T. Quite so. When he spoke to Bar-jesus, it was a great triumph. Paul caused him to be blind, "not seeing the sun for a season". Now in this last scripture Moses says, "Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd". This is real leadership. Moses had in mind the whole assembly of Jehovah. "And Jehovah said to Moses, Take Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and thou shalt lay thy hand upon him; and thou shalt set him before Eleazar the priest, and before the whole assembly; and give him commandment before their eyes. And thou shalt put of thine honour upon him, that the whole assembly of the children of Israel may obey him". That is what we have been saying, that he might be true to the honour placed upon him; to refuse pride, but to understand that he must be true to the name divinely given. "And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him, by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, he, and all the children of Israel with him, even the whole assembly. And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded him; and he took Joshua and
{204}
set him before Eleazar the priest, and before the whole assembly. And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him commandment, as Jehovah had said through Moses". So that now the position is clear. Jehovah says Joshua has the Spirit, and I think the suggestion is that he has it *characteristically;* a man who has learned to judge the flesh, has learned what Rephidim means. Instead of the flesh, the Spirit has scope.
A.E.H. Stephen in @Acts 6 is distinguished among the seven men selected; the particular thing said about him is that he is "a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit;" and later it says that he is "full of grace and power". That connects with this, does it not?
J.T. Just so. The use of the word "full" in that instance -- and there are many such in the New Testament -- would mean that Rephidim is understood, that the battle is gained. "Full of faith and the Holy Spirit", he has dealt with the flesh, he is not allowing it any more. He is making scope for the Spirit: "but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (@Romans 8: 13).
J.S. This charge would have a very sobering effect.
J.T. Think of the weight of it! But Jehovah knew His man. He has been through the conflict of Rephidim and will pursue this line, disallowing the flesh and making room for the Spirit.
J.D. Would Joshua be characteristically free of the flesh and able to lead the saints into the counsel of God?
J.T. Well, think of what it would mean spiritually! It involves the light of Paul, especially in Colossians and Ephesians; "the putting off", as he says in Colossians, "of the body of the flesh" -- the whole thing -- "in the circumcision of the Christ" (@Colossians 2: 11). "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; and ye are complete in him" (verses 9, 10). That is the fulness of the thing, so that there is no room for the flesh. All that is involved.
{205}
E.G.McA. Would this indicate a man in the power of @Romans 8 ready to go on to Colossians and Ephesians? I was thinking of the prominence of the Spirit in that chapter -- coming after the teaching of chapter 7.
J.T. You are struck with the frequency of the mention of the Spirit in @Romans 8. There are about thirteen references to the Spirit in the first thirteen verses of that chapter. Before that you have the *resolve* in chapter 7 -- "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law".
A.P.T. How old is Joshua at this period?
J.T. We could not be sure of that, but we could be sure he has advanced. He has been forty years in the wilderness, and he was able to lead an army at Rephidim, at the beginning of the wilderness period, so that you can reckon yourself; he was 110 when he died. So he is fairly advanced now.
A.P.T. I really had in mind that he would not be subject to inflation.
J.T. That is the point. David says, "I have been young, and now am old" (@Psalm 37: 25). He is pointing out the advantage of age; at least, of age and experience with God. He goes on to say, "I have not seen" so and so -- a very important thing to say: that is *experience*, in view of helping another.
J.P. Is what we are in the sovereignty of God one thing, but what we touch here another -- the thought of being influential?
J.T. Yes, and you are trustworthy. You have overcome the flesh. You thus make room for the Spirit. "Full of the Holy Spirit" implies being immune from the power of Satan.
A.E.H. Would you distinguish between "the God of the spirits of all flesh" (@Numbers 27: 16), and "the Father of spirits" (@Hebrews 12: 9)?
J.T. There is not much difference. It means that
{206}
He has a thorough knowledge of you, having given you your spirit. It is a peculiar thing, the spirit returns to God who *gave* it. You do not get it from your parents, God gives it, and hence He has special rights in it.
A.E.H. The thought of experience would enter into that: I have learned that He is not only God in a general way, but that He comes down to very fine points -- "the God of the spirits".
J.T. Just so. So in @Proverbs 20: 27, "Man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah". God has certain rights in it. The spirit returns to God who gave it, so that He knows us in that way and searches us through it.
Ques. There would be some point in Joshua being provided "that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd", would there not?
J.T. What a solemn responsibility as to the saints, how they are cared for! One has often felt, if anyone seeks a gift -- the means or power of serving God -- let him ask to be an elder, one who leads the saints in that sense, who cares with genuine feeling how they get on. The desire of Moses here is, "Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd".
A.B. Is it like the apostle in @Acts 20: "I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God"? There was no shrinking with the apostle.
J.T. Just so, and he is putting the responsibility of it on the elders in Ephesus. It is very remarkable the attention that Paul pays to the thought of eldership shown through Timothy. An elder is not a universal official; he is not as an ordinary Levite who has gift. If he has gift, he is obligated to all the brethren everywhere; gift is universal. Eldership is always for localities, for towns or cities, so that in small meetings we shall
{207}
sometimes be few and weak unless saints accept obligation to be present. Unless I have gift, I ought to be at my local meeting as much as possible to support the preaching. The spirit of grace would lead in this way. An elder takes *care* of the assembly.
G.A.T. Do you see a difference between driving the sheep and leading them?
J.T. In driving much damage is caused. Jacob says to Esau, "the children are tender, and the suckling sheep and kine are with me; and if they should overdrive them only one day, all the flock would die" (@Genesis 33: 13).
A.P.T. Is it not beautiful to see how Moses began in caring for the flock (@Exodus 3), and that now as he is about to die he is still caring for it? He says, "that the assembly ... be not as sheep that have no shepherd". He must have carried this thought right through. Is that what should mark those who wish to be leaders?
J.T. Care for livestock always marked the true people of God even from Abel. The Egyptians abhorred shepherds, which is spiritually significant.
R.A. @John 10 helps, as to how the Lord leads His sheep in and out.
J.T. All these things culminate in Him. He is the great Shepherd and the good Shepherd.
A.R. It is remarkable that in the power of current ministry unity really prevails among the saints universally. Would it be suggestive of the Joshua character prevailing among the saints in some way?
J.T. Quite so. God is helping us, but we have to be on our guard so as not to think there is very much, because we are really in a day of small things. It is remarkable how much of our time, a great portion, has to be used in putting people and things right!
{208}
CHRIST IN RELATION TO HIS OPERATIONS
@Mark 14: 17; @Jude 14, 15; @2 Thessalonians 1: 7 - 9
I wish to speak of Christ in relation to His operations into which He takes others -- among the others, ourselves, as we are available. He also operates alone, of course. We read of His treading the wine-press alone. He was alone on the cross; we could have no part in that, His sufferings for sin the greatest of all operations. But He does carry on certain operations into which He takes others, trustworthy ones, and if untrustworthy ones are found in the movement they are eliminated. Judas represents this class, for the Lord's associate in service is to be true as He is true; He is "the holy, the true". "They that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful" (@Revelation 17: 14).
I have selected Mark in regard to this most attractive and touching of all the movements of Christ. Indeed, it culminates in the cross in all its terribleness, His atoning work into which even His followers could not come. But in view of it we are told in Mark, as I read, that He came "with the twelve". He came *with* them, as if they were initially essential to the great matters before Him. He took them as far as morally possible, that is, into Gethsemane. He took them thus far and disposed of them in the garden on military principles; but He came *with the twelve* in view of all this. He did not come alone. He had sent two earlier to prepare. Great thoughtfulness entered into the matter, as indeed into every divine enterprise. Nothing is taken on lightly or haphazardly, all is on the principle of measure, and so preparation preceded this great matter into which the Lord is said to have come with the twelve. Matthew says that He "lay down" with the twelve at table, meaning that He lay down at a meal with them. It is suitable to do so; no doubt physically it is the best
{209}
way to eat, and the way of eating is not to be ignored. But I am not occupying you with mere details, certainly not urging mere human ways in eating; on the contrary I would keep in view that moral instruction enters into such matters, especially what is now before us. Gideon's enterprise reminds us of this, that we are to learn to discard the natural as sacrificing in everything so as to be victorious in the general testimony of God. So God says, "bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there" (@Judges 7: 4). When you come to the hour of eating or drinking you are tested. Not one out of every thousand in the ordinary eating houses in the cities bows his head in thanksgiving to God when beginning to eat or to drink. The others say in effect, "Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die".
The Lord is implying, according to Matthew, that in what is before us there is to be deliberation. There is more than eating in the Lord's supper, there is *testing*. "On this account many among you are weak and infirm" (@1 Corinthians 11: 30). For what cause? The way they ate and drank what was professedly the Lord's supper. So Matthew, in view of the assembly and all that enters into it, would say, Be deliberate in what you are doing. It is a most important matter and we should be deliberate about it. Weigh the matter, and in weighing the matter be sure to eat and drink according to the divinely given directions. As they were eating, the Lord challenged them as to His betrayal. That is to say, in the Lord's supper, and the service of God, and those who have part in it, there must be discrimination. If the Lord is undertaking anything, He will have with Him whatever number or quality is necessary for the work in view; He knows what He needs in His enterprises. He makes a selection, and it is on the *principle* of twelve. Twelve is a very divisible number, a number that He can use flexibly according to what is in mind. That is what Mark would say.
{210}
The word is to all of us as to whether we are available to the Lord on that principle. If He is coming with the twelve, He is not coming with twelve people who have difficulties with each other. The Lord would not choose twelve persons for any work who are ignoring each other, who have secret or open difficulties with each other. He would make no such selection. Well, you say, there are such people coming to the Lord's supper. But the Lord is not coming with them, He is not selecting them. Think of some of those at Corinth. They would no doubt say, Paul is a remarkable man, I was converted through him; but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is contemptible. What would the Lord think of remarks like that about His servants? Is He coming with such people? No, not at all. He is saying, I must deal with those people; there is no need of the twelve for those people, an executioner is needed for them. Put them away! That is the idea. Think of a man such as the one described in chapter 5 coming to sit down at the Lord's supper! Is the Lord coming with him? The wonder is that there is not an angel meeting him on the way to slay him, as the angel met the prophet of old. We are living in a period of grace and advantage is taken, licence is taken. The prophet says that when God's judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. But today grace reigns, and hence people take advantage. Think of the brazenness of a man such as is described in the 5th chapter of 1 Corinthians going to the Lord's supper! Is the Lord with him? No, He is *against* him. The Lord saw to it that they took up an attitude against him, although in result it was for him; but for the moment it was, Remove him from among yourselves.
The Lord in coming in regard of His supper makes His own selection, those He can use, and the service is carried on in subjection to Him and to one another.
{211}
There are Peter, James, John, Bartholomew, Matthew -- twelve of them. You say, There was one there who was not right. Quite so, but he was only one out of twelve and such a situation is remediable. That one can be dealt with. I mean to say there is power enough, there are men enough, to deal with that one. Let there be no mistake: if there is any person such as Judas, he will be dealt with. My point is that the Lord comes with the twelve. The Lord as risen appeared to the twelve. The Lord was preparing them to be ready for further enterprises, for they are constant. I thank God for these meetings, that they are so frequent, one of the greatest encouragements at the moment. The Lord comes every time with what is needed. Everyone of us would say, I am not going to be there simply as a spectator but as one of them; but if you come, be sure you have love; do not come without it. Do not be pretending to have it; your ways will soon show what your motives are, they will soon tell why you are here. The Lord is constantly working with us to make us available for these occasions, but above all for the great weekly occasion -- the Lord's supper and assembly service.
Luke says the Lord placed Himself at table when the hour was come, He took His place. Luke says *order* belongs to this matter, *time* belongs to it, place, seemliness of way and demeanour; He took His place at the hour and the twelve apostles were with Him. It is a great victory -- they with Him, not He with them. It is a question of men when the word 'apostle' is used; it implies skilled workmen, men of moral weight through acquaintance with the Lord Jesus. We are greatly in need of such people. The Lord, at the hour, came and took His place at table and the twelve apostles were with Him. Judas was there, also, but not affording a situation that was irremediable; there is nothing irremediable from God's point of view. But woe be to him that is there
{212}
against the divine current! Judas was, because Luke says, "the hand of him that delivers me up is with me on the table" (@Luke 22: 21). Think of the awfulness of eating with the Lord and being ready to betray Him, his hand ready to stretch out for the thirty pieces of silver! Think of what the Lord meant, what He felt! What would happen to that one? It were better for him if he had not been born, that is what the Lord says. There is no trifling in these matters. The Lord wants the twelve on His own terms, as His own pupils, as His own finished product, so that He can proceed with His great enterprises. That is what Luke says. How beautiful to have learned from Christ in the way of moral weight and authority, in having a little power to admonish or rebuke a brother or sister! How valuable such persons are with the Lord at the table!
Now, He says in effect, I can go on, I can proceed. Mark is usually urgent, for time is very precious to the Lord, to heaven, and to those who are engaged in the Lord's service. They have no time to spare, and Mark could say, Do not waste any. If you are with the Lord as one of the twelve, or rather, if He is with you, He is trusting you, He is counting on you. If you have been trained, if you have gone to school, gone through the curriculum, you know that time is precious -- not to be idled away. The Lord proceeds to expose the matter of Judas and to institute His supper. He does not institute it with Himself alone, or with just two or three, but with the twelve; and after they have partaken of it they sing a hymn. I suppose they were all singers. It is heaven's way that we should be singers and it is heaven's way to have something to sing. I do not know much about singing, but I can join in. It is heaven's way that all should join in the signing. So they sang a hymn. Had they not often sung with Him before? Undoubtedly. They had sung with Him -- He and they
{213}
together. Who raised the tune? The Lord must have done it, you say, but I suppose any one of them might have done it. And then they went to the mount of Olives. That is to say, Jerusalem was taken account of in the enterprise. These men were accustomed to Jerusalem, John and the others had been there. Moses and Elias had been talking of Jerusalem on the mount with the Lord when the three were with Him. You can understand what solemnity there was in walking through its streets. What about the matter of cities in these military times? What about the matter of administration in cities, of elders? These men were solemn; they had been with the Lord Jesus at the table, they had been with Him at the institution of His supper, they had partaken of the passover with Him. Look at them moving out with Him, moving out from that city, so favoured once, but now doomed. The Lord had already wept over it, and they move out to the mount of Olives; all this enters into this solemn scene. Think of what the Lord has in His mind in this wonderful institution called His supper, involving the assembly of which He says, "my assembly, and hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it". He is passing through Jerusalem and the twelve apostles are passing through it with Him. They are going out to the mount of Olives after having sung a hymn. Think of the seriousness of it; think of the streets of Jerusalem, narrow as they were, all their past and all their terrible immediate future. How the apostles would later recall the Lord's tears as they went out! He had all this in mind in coming with the twelve, they were to be with Him in all this. In our own time it is not a question of Jerusalem, but of cities and their influence. Jerusalem was not then capable of good influence, nor is any city today capable of good influence. The Lord, you will remember, when He came down through the coasts of Decapolis found a "deaf man who could not speak right", evidently the influence of
{214}
the city. How necessary from the Lord's point of view to have the twelve in view of cities! So we have the Lord's supper today. @Revelation 11: 8 speaks of "the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified". Let the young take that in. How do you look at cities, young people? What are they to you? Do you hasten through to the mount of Olives? The twelve were going, and the Lord was going -- do not you lag behind. Instead of going to the Bible reading in the afternoon, do not go for a walk in the city. You will be damaged in your soul. And if you go to the country you will be no better off. Keep on with the twelve, they are influential for good, they are on the way to the mount of Olives. They are going on to heaven, they belong to heaven. All true believers in Christ are going there; the Holy Spirit is indwelling us, and wonderful disclosures are being made. You do not want to be out of all this. The Lord is bringing the twelve with Him; they are being used by Him to hold us. That is what the epistles to the Corinthians teach. You will understand that I am speaking of the principle entering into the fellowship into which we have been brought.
Now to go on to the second scripture, I wanted to point out another enterprise of the Lord's. It is seen a long way off. The prophets saw a long way off. One of the greatest difficulties I have is to take a long outlook and a broad outlook. If you do, it will greatly aid you in overcoming, because the end will be greater than all the difficulties. There is a remedy for all difficulties in the long outlook. So Enoch of old, and other spiritually educated people, had a long outlook. Enoch was a prophet; we are not told about it before, but Jude, like Paul, tells us about things for the first time. We have narrated for us just a small percentage of the great happenings of God and His people. The Holy Spirit knows them all, and He takes up somebody like
{215}
Jude to tell us something new, and we are enriched to that extent. So Enoch says, according to @Jude 14, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads". This is another matter; it is not a question of twelve here, it is *holy myriads*. You cannot count them. The Lord comes with them. It is another enterprise, and it enables me now to say a word as to the difference between the present time and the future in regard to the present war. There is not a word now more prominent in the whole vocabulary than the word 'war', a terrible thought, and we have to take it upon our lips. Enoch was speaking about a holy war -- he speaks about the Lord coming in the midst of holy myriads. It is another kind of war than that which conscientious objectors, as we are called, have in their minds. They are ready for the holy war of @Ephesians 6: 12; "our struggle is not against blood and flesh", that is what the great leader, Paul, says to us in the great military epistle, the epistle to the Ephesians. It is "against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies". Our weapon of warfare is the sword of the Spirit, the word of God. That opens up to us the position we are in and how we have to take up a right attitude in regard of it so as to be a right testimony to those in charge of the present war of blood and flesh. What a war it is! It is not only that, but tanks, airplanes, submarines, cruisers, and destroyers, a terrible situation. We christians have to understand it. What does it mean? God is impressing us in these last days with blood-and-flesh wars. Paul tells us expressly they are *not ours*. Understand I am not saying anything against them -- the war of blood and flesh is a department of God and these weapons are necessary. But our warfare, what is it? Let me put my name into it; I have to learn what it is. If I do not learn it I shall be confused in the presence of the authorities; they will
{216}
think I am foolish and unreasonable; I shall be no testimony. But I shall not act thus if I am instructed in the way of the Lord. He says to Pilate, "if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought" (@John 18: 36). Enoch says they are going to fight -- the armies of heaven are coming out to fight in a very substantial way, but *not now*. The Lord is instructing Pilate about it. Pilate says, "What is truth?" The Lord says in effect, You listen to Me and I will tell you what the truth is. The Lord was not going to lay Himself out to teach a man like Pilate, one who could not take in divine thoughts, but still He says, "if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought". That meant the twelve; they were His servants. Peter was ready to fight at once; Peter would say, I know about the sword, I have used one. The Lord says, Put it into the sheath. They did not understand Him then. Let us be instructed in this matter of war. "My servants", the Lord says. Who are they? I want to be one of them. If I am to be one of them, I must learn from what He says to Pilate and others. "All who take the sword shall perish by the sword", He says (@Matthew 26: 52); and finally to Pilate, "if my kingdom were of this world, then my servants had fought". He is not saying there is not going to be any more warfare of this kind; He is saying otherwise. The prophets are full of it. At this point the Lord is going out alone, the people are not with Him, but in @Revelation 19: 11 - 14 they *are* with Him. There the Lord comes out Himself riding a white horse. It is a war-like passage: "And I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and one sitting on it, called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war in righteousness. And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems, having a name written which no one knows but himself; and he is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of
{217}
God. And the armies which are in the heaven followed him upon white horses, clad in white, pure, fine linen". This is real war. I hope to have part in it. Notice there are "armies;" there will be different armies, having perhaps varied forms of skill. I cannot tell how many divisions of soldiers there are in each, or what the actual equipment will be, but we can be sure it is a splendid system, a heavenly one. And here are the beast and the false prophet. Let us have our eyes and feelings active; God is bringing these two before our eyes that we may be in accord with heaven. These two are to be cast into the lake of fire without dying, and it is perfectly righteous. All these things shall be dealt with in righteousness. Not a stain will be upon the glorious apparel of our great Commander-in-Chief, "King of kings, and Lord of lords". It is said: "Upon his head many diadems, having a name written which no one knows but himself; and he is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God" (@Revelation 19: 12, 13). The inscrutability of His Person is there. What triumph is written across the whole wonderful scene! How stimulating the Lord's language to Pilate in the light of this wonderful display of military power in which we shall have part! It is a question of *righteousness*. So we are told "And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and the false prophet that was with him, who wrought the signs before him by which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast, and those that worship his image. Alive were both cast into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone" (@Revelation 19: 19, 20). What a finish that is for these awful antichristian outbreaks extending back so many years! The present peculiar latter-day eruption of Satanic power is allowed of God, it is not an accident. And this passage
{218}
shows what will happen to it. The movement goes far beyond God's disciplinary and judicial purpose and its authors will have to answer to Him. As the Spirit and the assembly leave the earth the man of sin will appear and his final doom and that of the false prophet is fixed. According to the scripture before us these two representatives of satanic power are alive cast into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone. @Jude 14, 15 says, the Lord comes with holy myriads, and he points out that He comes "to execute judgment against all; and to convict all the ungodly of them of all their works of ungodliness, which they have wrought ungodlily, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him". That is to say, the whole matter is to be brought up, as to why this is so and why that. There is to be the conviction of guilt in all these uprisings of evil men of which Jude speaks; the Lord is going "to execute judgment against all; and to convict all the ungodly of them of all their works of ungodliness, which they have wrought ungodlily, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him". It is an awful time of ungodliness. I want you to notice the recurrence of the word 'ungodly;' we are living in a day of great ungodliness when people are lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. The world without God is atheism; the word 'atheism' simply means 'without God' -- leaving God out. So we have ungodliness and speaking against Him, as it says, "to convict all the ungodly of them of all their works of ungodliness, which they have wrought ungodlily, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him". Think of the man of sin, what a mouth he has, speaking great things and they are against God. And now he is to be convicted of these things he has said against God before he is consigned to eternal doom. God is telling them why they are cast into the lake of fire. What conviction that is! Before
{219}
the lake of fire receives all its doomed inmates, each one will be thoroughly convicted. He will be confirmed that he is getting just what he deserves.
Now a word as to 2 Thessalonians. The Lord will bring with Him His holy myriads in view of conviction; Jude has this in mind. The ungodly will be convicted of their hard speeches. Now the passage read in 2 Thessalonians is another matter. Here the Lord comes "with the angels of his power". It is a question of *power* now. It is a question of those that do not obey the gospel. So that the Lord will come "with the angels of his power, in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall pay the penalty of everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might". The gospel has been disobeyed. The judgment involved would refer more to those who in the present dispensation refused the gospel. I am not saying that others cannot come into it, but it is a question of "those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall pay the penalty of everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might". People ignore Him, and neglect Him, and displease Him. The Lord says, I am coming with powerful beings to deal with you. Think of the difference between coming with the twelve and coming with the angels of His power! I do not know how much strength an angel has but I do know that in military affairs one angel destroyed 185,000 men at one time. What could you not do with one angel in a war like that of today! Think of what ten could do, think of what one thousand could do. God could send them, but He is not doing it. But the Lord Jesus is coming with them presently, to execute unmitigated punishment on those who know not God and do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus
{220}
Christ. At that time "he shall have come to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed".
All this array of power is brought before the suffering Thessalonians and the apostle comforts them, saying, "for our testimony to you has been believed". You are to be at rest with us -- precious thought -- in that day, verse 7. As others suffer the terrible consequences of refusing the glad tidings of Christ, those who believe now shall be at rest with Him for ever.
{221}
THE LORD'S FEET
@Matthew 28: 9, 10; @Luke 7: 44 - 46
I have in mind to speak about the Lord's feet, first from Matthew and then from Luke. They are presented to us in these gospels. We have them in Matthew, administrative feet: that is, the administration that is carried on in the assembly. In Luke we have evangelistic feet, as I hope to speak of them. And the Lord's feet in Revelation are seen as judicial feet; they are like fine brass, we are told. Also, we have in the same book the Lord's feet likened to pillars of fire; this alludes to His rights on the earth, which, of course, are now disputed. It was said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours" (@Luke 20:14). This they carried out, but He reserves the means of taking that inheritance up again. He will do it in great dignity. His feet are symbolised by pillars of fire in @Revelation 10. He puts His right foot on the sea in that connection, and His left upon the earth, so that these feet refer to His earthly inheritance; that is, the means used by Him of dealing with what is opposed to His rights in connection with the earth. The earth is divided into sea and land. He puts is right foot on the sea -- which would mean that He can use the sea -- and the left on the land. These are all figures which would require much time to enter into and enlarge on.
But I wish first of all to speak about the ecclesiastical matter. Some of us are accustomed to the word ecclesiastical, taking the dictionary meaning of it, which is not always accurate. Spiritually it refers to what relates to the assembly. That is the *modus operandi* of all direct divine administration now, because God is not directly administering the affairs of this world yet; He is doing it indirectly. He is not doing it in a direct sense through the assembly, otherwise we
{222}
should be working with the warring powers. What God is doing directly is through the assembly; all direct administration is in that connection. Other administration goes on indirectly. Of course there is the administration of the physical worlds of which we know almost nothing as to how God keeps them going. We know He does it; not only that He framed them by His word, but that He administers their affairs and keeps them in their order, each in its place so as to function. All that is a creative matter and began far back of @Genesis 1; but there are also international matters. There were none in the antediluvian world so far as we can see. There were no nations, but there were administrative services from God. After the flood nations took form, and God set up a nation too. The others set themselves up, they were what we might call a development, or developments; but God set one up of Himself, and in it He administered directly. He had His king there, He had His high priest, and other instruments of direct government. But that failing, He set up indirect government symbolised to us in Nebuchadnezzar's dream in the form of a monstrosity of a man. I can only just mention it, but it was a mixture, running down to our own times; successive features defined run down to our own times. God has never given up His relation with that system, but it is indirect.
At Pentecost, however, He set up a system which He calls His own kingdom, the kingdom of God; and He tells us it is not meat and drink, it is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. God administers directly there and Christ is King there, for the moment Lord; He will take up the title of King presently; in the meantime He is Head to the assembly, an ecclesiastical thought. 'Ecclesiastical' is not a word in Scripture but it is a word that conveys what is scriptural, and ecclesiastical administration is what I have in mind
{223}
in reading the verse in Matthew. There were certain women, very worthy women, but somewhat needing adjustment, and it is very rare to find a sister who does not. In fact, it is rare to find a brother, but sisters need more adjustment than brothers. Now as I said, these sisters were very worthy; they loved the Lord, but we are told they held Him by the feet. They could not hold Him by the feet if the feet were like pillars of fire; it would be dangerous work to attempt that; or like fine brass, as He presents Himself to the assembly at Thyatira. It is in these assembly addresses in Revelation that we get what I have been speaking about; ecclesiastical administration. When things have gone wrong the Lord asserts Himself; and instead of saying, as He does in the end of Matthew, that He is with them all the days until the completion of the age, He says He is the One that walks in the midst of the seven assemblies. He walks in a judicial sense.
Now to walk He requires His feet and He uses His feet, as He tells the angel of the assembly at Thyatira, His feet are like fine brass. Every address is directed to an angel, not directly to the assembly of the place but to the angel of the assembly. The angel is like a cushion between the Lord and the assembly. He cannot take on the assembly as it is; it has failed; still it is the assembly and it has the responsibility of being such, so that He deals with it mediately, and as I said, the angel is like a cushion. The angel is what He can deal with. There is no sense of distance between Christ and the assembly in the epistles, but there is in the Revelation, showing there had been defection, there had been failure. So the seven stars are said to be the angels of the seven assemblies. But I am not speaking of that, I am speaking of the feet. Now He says to the angel of the assembly at Thyatira, "These things says the Son of God", verse 18. That is, He is dealing with the assembly in His authority as the Son of God;
{224}
that is His place in the assembly. That is how He was revealed to Peter, as the Son of God. He is addressing the angel of this assembly, which has failed most grievously; she had Jezebel there: "But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel", verse 20. He is dealing with her in a judicial way but yet indirect. His feet are not as pillars of fire here, as seen in chapter 10, but as fine brass as in chapter 1. "These things says the Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;" He is walking in the midst of the seven assemblies, walking with feet like fine brass. Wherever He set His foot there would be the suggestion of judicial discernment and corresponding judgment. The eyes of the Son of God are like fire, so that we are in the presence of the most serious matters; but I am only speaking of His feet.
So these women in @Matthew 28 are, as I said, most estimable; but in crises our real state appears, and the real state of these dear sisters appeared. The angel had directed them not to fear, but to go to the disciples and tell them that they would see the Lord Jesus in Galilee; and they were going, they were moving. If any of those sisters had been accosted on the way by somebody who said, I want you to come in and rest a little, that would have been like holding them by the feet. When we are on a message, sent directly by an angel from heaven, we cannot afford to be diverted even for a second. Now the Lord met these women on the way and said, "Hail!" He saluted them, and they held Him by the feet. Why did they do that? They would not have admitted it had somebody other than Jesus accosted them and held them, offering some temptation or attraction that they might turn aside for a little and go to see the brethren later. The angel had just said to them, "Behold, I have told you", verse 7. They are under orders from an angel from God. He is described in the beginning of
{225}
the chapter as having a countenance like lightning, so there is no denying his authority. But how easily we are turned aside as we are on an errand under the Lord's orders! Properly speaking we are never other than under orders from the Lord. "And everything, whatever ye may do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus" (@Colossians 3: 17). We are always under orders, keeping His commandments. So that the angel says, "Behold, I have told you", and they were on the errand, they were going. It says, "And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples word". Sisters *running* as bearing divine orders indicate real subjection and obedience. Mary Magdalene ran, we are told elsewhere. Here they are running under divine orders. It might be a spectacle for an unhallowed eye to see those women running, but they were in earnest; they were under orders. That is the idea of authority affecting us. The Lord says, "Hail!" He did not ask them to stop, He greeted them. But they stopped and held Him by the feet. They must have stopped to do that. Would He ever divert them from an errand like that? "Hail!" He said, that is, All is well, as if to speed them forward in their errand. They held Him by the feet. You may say, Why are you repeating that? Well, it is to be repeated. Why should I hold the Lord Jesus by the *feet*? You may say, Such a thing is impossible. But the question is, What is *meant*? Is it not an allusion to Jewish circumstances? They were Jewish; they belonged to the remnant of Israel, of course, but they were Jewish. What did they have in their minds? They would hold Him in relation to the circumstances they had been in. Is that an unfair interpretation? I do not think so. "Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?" the disciples asked Him in @Acts 1: 6. It was a question of Israel, the immediate thing to their minds, what affected them nationally. Many saints are damaged because they take
{226}
things up nationally. The Lord Jesus according to @Acts 1: 3 had been speaking to them about the kingdom of God, and earlier the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of the Son of man had been stressed by him. Why did they not think of these great expressions? No: "Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?"
And so here it is as if they said, We will keep you here. You will remember in @John 6 how they sought to take the Lord to make Him king. Why did they do that? Because He had fed a multitude of people with a few loaves and fishes. The miracle was great; there would be no rationing if we had the Lord Jesus on that line here. There would be plenty, because He could turn stones into bread if He wished. They would make Him king because He could do such things. And no doubt these women had in their minds, however vaguely, that in holding the Lord by the feet they would keep Him in relation to something that was near to them, something that affected them personally. That is my first point, and it is, dear brethren, that we may not hold the Lord by the feet because of any personal or local considerations. "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", Paul says. Very often the thought arises with local brethren to build up something locally, but you must keep in line with all the other assemblies. The building inspector will come around, you know, and he will condemn anything you are building which is not according to specification! So it was that the Thessalonians imitated the churches that were very far away from them, the churches in Judea. We will make them our model, they said. The twelve were there; the great builders were there. But *later* the assemblies of Judea and others turned to the Jewish pattern. Some turned back to Judaism, or if they did not turn back altogether they tried to keep the Lord where they were. The Lord would say, I must go elsewhere. As He said
{227}
to some, "I must needs announce the glad tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also" (@Luke 4: 43). So that we must not appropriate Him to ourselves exclusively. He belongs to others also. The ten tribes said, We have ten parts in David, but what were the parts? What did they care about David? They revolted against him in another day or two. That is the kind of thing you get behind all this. If I am thinking of a local position or of adding to it to make something of myself in the locality, I am holding the Lord by the feet.
You can see by a little thought how much could be said about this, how the whole economy of the assembly might be disjointed if we were to pursue this matter of holding the Lord by the feet. That is, we want Him for ourselves, but it will not do. We should not be as these women were; not that the Lord rebuked them, but what did He say to them? He says, so to speak, The angel has told you to go and take word to My disciples; now I want you to go to "my brethren". They were to be accelerated in their movements. How far away was Galilee? He would never get there if they held Him by the feet, if He permitted it. The Lord could say in effect, I am going a long way to meet My brethren, and I need My feet; and you need to accelerate your pace and get this message to them soon. Do not hold Me by the feet, nor let anybody hold you by the feet; proceed with your message; I am not coming to the disciples now -- they have to go to Galilee. Do not let us practise this feet-holding, dear brethren. If it is a cold night let us not say, Do not go out to the meeting! Let the feet of love be free. These are the feet of Jesus. So He says, "go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me", verse 10. Why did He not go and see them where they were? No; this is an orderly situation; we are under administrative circumstances now. Let us understand what it is to be in administrative circumstances
{228}
If it is a matter of the king, then have respect for the king; if it is his first officers, have respect for them. We are even told in Matthew that you can use the name of a righteous man. It is a poor name that cannot be used in some sense in the way of incentive or authority. So we must respect the order and dignity of the kingdom; democratic principles are not for the kingdom of God. There is such a thing as mutuality; there is such a thing as the mass of the saints being allowed to make choice, as in the case of the deacons in @Acts 6; but the apostles say, It is not suitable for us to leave the word of God to serve tables. And yet tables have to be served. So, as I was saying, this is a matter to be considered. In Matthew we are in administrative circumstances, and there are personalities there. The Lord is a great personality, He is Head of the assembly. So He says, They will see Me in Galilee; not, I will see them, but, They will see Me. They have to go there to do it. Let us understand that we cannot just do as we will in these matters. If you want to see the Lord, then go to Galilee. You must go there, because that is where He has appointed you to go, and if you do not want to go you are not worthy of the name of Christ. If He wishes you to go, you are to go, and if you do not go, it is disaster. People want to do as they like, whereas He says, "there they shall see me". That needs feet. If they are to go and see Me there they must have their feet; and I need My feet too, My administrative feet. Do not try to appropriate them exclusively to yourself. Think of others.
Well, now, I want to go on to Luke. The evangelical feet are the most lovely of all the characters of the feet of Jesus. They are worthy of kissing. I suppose most of us have noticed the recurrence of the word 'feet' in the few verses read. We did not read the whole passage, only the verses that refer to the Lord's feet. Of course when I speak in this way I refer to the
{229}
Sunday evening preachings. They have become a custom. I suppose in a way the Lord falls in with our customs. He leaves things with us and He would say, in effect, If the Lord's day evening is the freest evening you have for gospel preaching, I am entirely with you. That is what He would say to us. I am sure He would put it on the hearts of the brethren to pray about the gospel on Sunday night; I am sure He is in that. And I am sure, too, that He does not like anyone making it optional whether he should go to the gospel meeting or not, assuming that it is for sinners. The person who comes there to preach is sent by the Lord, and all the way there he is using evangelical feet. If he has difficulties on the way, if he has not got a car, if he has to walk, it is like crossing a mountain. How beautiful! That is really where you get the word 'beautiful' attaching to feet. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that announceth glad tidings, that publisheth peace" (@Isaiah 52: 7). That is the preacher, if he is a preacher at all, if he is a preacher according to God. How can he preach unless he be sent? Not all the persons in the meeting can preach, because it is a question of gift, but it is also a question of feet. You say, it is a question of mouth. It is, of course, and of heart, but it is a question of feet too, and that implies difficulties, sacrifices. I have to travel, maybe in the night time, or under the hot sun. "How beautiful", says the Spirit of God. It is one of the most lovely passages; some of us have read it many times. It is quoted in Romans, but the original is in @Isaiah 52: 7. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that announceth glad tidings, that publisheth peace; that announceth glad tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!" That is beautiful language. Evangelical feet are alluded to here and they are on the mountains, the feet of him "that announceth glad tidings of good". That is how
{230}
it reads, he has these tidings. It is not a question of the words he is going to use; it is what he has. It is tidings; he has them in his heart, but the feet are noted; that is to say, you see them climbing the mountain. As we remember about the shepherd in @Luke 15 going off into the mountains to find the lost sheep -- his are evangelical feet.
But I just dwell for a moment on this matter of travel. This rationing matter has brought up a good deal, and perhaps it is not noticeable by many of us that God is testing us out. The whole machinery of the world is turned around to deal with what God is doing directly, that is, His work in the people. It is a wonderful time, but the apparent result is very small now and we want to make it larger; and whatever it is, to make it better. A commodious car with plenty of equipment, of course, makes travel easy; though expensive, there is nothing in the way of stress attached to it. But the Lord had to travel in Palestine on foot. I do not know how many miles He travelled. It is well worth noting His travels. And when you come to Paul and his journeyings -- his 'missionary journeys' as they are usually designated on the maps in the Bible -- think of the distances! He says, "I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ" (@Romans 15: 19). Think of what he had to encounter! There were robbers by the way, highwaymen, and other difficulties like that. We are speaking about the present day difficulties and what God is doing; how He is testing us out as to where we are. Are we ready to sit down, allowing difficulties to stop us and to wait until they are removed? But why not you remove them? The Lord says, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Be transported hence there, and it shall transport itself" (@Matthew 17: 20). Is that nothing? You say, What do you mean by that? Well, read it. I want to know more fully what it means
{231}
myself; but I am telling you that the Lord Jesus said it, and that that mountain is a great difficulty; insurmountable in the eyes of the apostles, but He says, Have faith. So that I must not sit down because there is no gasoline; the thing is that the journey is to be taken, the beautiful feet are to be seen moving. That is what God is aiming at at the present time. How much manhood is there amongst us?
Well, I am dealing with this evangelical matter, and this woman is not holding the Lord by the feet, she is kissing His feet. First of all the Spirit of God tells us what she did, and then He tells us what the Lord thought about what she did. There are these two parts in the record. The first is what she did, beginning with verse 37, "And behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, and knew that he was sitting at meat in the house of the Pharisee, having taken an alabaster box of myrrh, and standing at his feet behind him weeping, began to wash his feet with tears; and she wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the myrrh". That is what she did. That is what the Spirit of God says she did. Now we want to see what the Lord thinks about what she did. I would picture any of us, any brother or sister, doing any service for the Lord. The first thing is what they do, the next thing is what the Lord thinks of what they do. Let Him review us; let Him speak about it. Of course, He will use the saints to do it now; you will get the Lord's mind normally among the brethren. He is not here personally, but His mind will surely be asserted, His commendatory mind, His judicial mind; He will not fail to use whom He will to make it known. We have to be always ready to listen to what is going on, especially at prophetic meetings, so that we may hear His mind. This passage is like a prophetic meeting: we will say the Lord is the Prophet. Simon is there, an unconverted man; others are there and this woman is
{232}
there. The Spirit of God tells us what she did. There are five things: the weeping; the washing, with the use of her tears; the wiping, with the use of her hair; the kissing of His feet; and finally the anointing. These feet are dignified, and they are to remain dignified in their movements; they are to remain in power. That would be in the woman's mind, as loving *much*. These feet, she is saying, have come a long way to reach me and I want to show what they are to me.
So the Lord, when the time for His word about her comes, speaks to Simon. We have often had it, but I felt free to repeat it again. He turned to the woman, that was His theme. He had previously spoken a parable to Simon, that was another thing, and Simon spoke right in answer to the parable. The Lord has a man He can speak to on these lines, He has his ear, and now He turns to the woman. "Seest thou this woman?" Simon might have replied, I have seen her here all this time and I am averse to her presence here. Probably that is what he said in his heart. The Lord would say, You do not think much of her; now listen to what I say. "I entered into thy house; thou gavest me not water on my feet, but *she* has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair. Thou gavest me not a kiss, but *she* from the time I came in has not ceased kissing my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but *she* has anointed my feet with myrrh". We are in the presence of the Lord, dear brethren, and He is making comparisons. Do not let anyone think we shall ever escape being compared with others. He is not simply comparing this woman with Himself, He is comparing her with Simon. This goes on; the Lord has His own way of bringing out what we are doing, and comparing what each one of us does with what someone else does. This is a constant thing, a comparative ministry. The Lord would say, Simon, look at this woman. *You* did not give me so much as a little water
{233}
to wash My feet. It was a customary thing to do, an ordinary civility that was denied the Lord of glory, by that conceited Pharisee. It was an ordinary courtesy that should not have failed, but it did fail; it failed in Simon, but not in this woman. "Seest thou this woman?" the Lord says, and then He goes on to add something that we should not have known if He had not told us. "From the time I came in", He says, she has done this service. Earlier it is said, "a woman in the city, who was a sinner, and knew that he was sitting at meat in the house of the Pharisee ... standing at his feet behind him weeping, began", etc. But the Lord said to Simon, "*she from the time I came in* has not ceased kissing my feet". That is one of the most remarkable statements you could get. It is really an addition to the history. It is the Lord's own enlargement of something wonderful in itself as He is speaking about this woman.
Well, not to go into detail further, I am speaking about the evangelical feet of Jesus. I want to enlist your sympathy in those feet. They are worthy of your kissing. It might not have been expected from the Pharisee; anointing the head might be in order, but not the kissing of the feet. The washing might have been in order, but not the kissing all the time and the anointing of the feet. The Lord is saying to this Pharisee, You are not in this at all. You do not know love at all, it has never entered your heart. This woman loves. Why does she love? Because she is forgiven much. Why does the Lord say that? Why did He not say, It is because of My beauty, My attractiveness, as in the Song of Solomon? No, it is because she is forgiven much; she had learned forgiveness. Dear brethren, have we all learned forgiveness? You say, Oh, I have confessed the Lord. But do you know the wonderfulness of divine forgiveness in the heart? No christian is really a christian in service who does not
{234}
learn forgiveness; who does not love because he is forgiven. It is a love you will never lose; you will never forget it. It is a love of service, and that is what the Lord is enlarging on here. She is forgiven much. He would ask, Why is she making so much of My feet? It is because I have come so far for her. Was there another in the town who got blessing that day? We cannot say. We know *she* did. She was the outstanding product on that day of the evangelical journey of Christ in that community. Well might she kiss those feet! Well might she wash them! Well might she wipe them and anoint them! They have come all that way through difficulties insurmountable to the natural mind; those feet had travelled all that way through the mountains of difficulties to get that soul in such a place. The very house she was in was a difficulty, one of the greatest difficulties. She was surrounded by criticism. In a certain sense she deserved it, but there was no grace in the head of that house. Grace was found there, but it was found when Jesus came, and it was found in this woman when she came in contact with Jesus. She was seeing those feet according to all that they were on the mountains in coming to her. And they have come to all of us. Each one of us ought to see what those evangelical feet are, and in measure to possess them and not allow anyone to hold them. Let them go on, go on with the ministry, go on with the service, go on with the gospel. That is the idea. Do not hold back one whom the Lord has qualified, whether he is your husband or your father. Let his feet be free, and let him keep his feet free. Let them be evangelical feet, or administrative feet, as at the care meeting, or priestly feet as at the prayer meeting; but let his feet be free. Let us not hold him by the feet. Let no Jewish or local condition or household condition interfere with the great services that the Lord has distributed among us; let us be free to fulfil them.
{235}
THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST EXERCISING CARE FOR THE SAINTS
@Genesis 8: 6 - 12; @Genesis 19: 9 - 11; @John 14: 1 - 4
I wish to occupy you with the Spirit of Christ, whether viewed as operating by Himself, or in vessels employed by Him; and how He constitutes those in whom He is, in whom He moves and works, likeable to heaven. They are likeable to men, in measure, but principally to the saints, for in truth what is pleasing to God in the saints is characteristically displeasing to men, which necessarily implies persecution. But I am speaking now of the Spirit of Christ as constituting those in whom He is likeable to God and to one another, as Enoch was. Those who have Him please God. And they are caused to know that they please God and that they are worthy of divine care and protection; that indeed the Lord Jesus, whose Spirit dwells in them and characterises them, would have them with Himself, not merely to protect them, but because He loves them, and would have them where He is.
So I read from the history of Noah, and that history includes the early activities recorded in Scripture of the Spirit of Christ. I may say here that the Spirit of Christ, or the Spirit of God -- for the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God -- may act or move as the Spirit of God or as the Spirit of Christ according to the necessities of the testimony. And so it is that Genesis begins the history of the Spirit by connecting Him with a chaotic condition of things. Chaos is not foreign to us. The more we are possessed of the Spirit of God, the more we discern it, whether physically or morally. And so the first presentation we have of the Spirit is in relation to what is chaotic. He was not turning His back on it, leaving it, but He was hovering over it, over the face of the waters; so that we are reminded that the Spirit of God leads in occupation with a chaotic condition in
{236}
view of recovery. To occupy ourselves with it other than with a view to recovering what is of God in it would damage us. The Spirit was occupied with it with a view to salvaging what was of God under the waters. The waters were prevalent throughout at the time. Darkness was upon the face of the deep, a great general thought, but the Spirit brooded over the face of the waters -- the word is plural. The idea suggested is that they were of value as potentially useful and serviceable to God and to men. And so the Spirit was not hovering aimlessly, but with infinite intentness to bring out what was there; something not yet manifested that has been submerged by some wicked hand, now to be brought again into evidence in an ordered condition. The waters were prevalent, but the dry land was to appear and to become the divisive power in the waters, so that they should become waters -- seas, useful to God in His operations, and to men. But I speak now of the great fact of the Spirit of God intent, for how long we cannot say, brooding over the face of the waters. I speak of it now, as I said, to call attention to how He had to do with such a condition, and how He can have to do with it again and succeed in His object of recovering what is of God.
Then we find Him in a limited state of things, some one hundred and twenty years, for we are now in time; that is the sixth of Genesis. Jehovah says, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man". The striving is not said to be with chaos, although morally it was, but it was with man. God is showing that He is not for the moment dealing with the earth or the seas, but with men. His Spirit, having hovered over the material waters and indirectly the earth, is now occupied with men, and as striving with them. Those of us who have to do with evil in men and in ourselves, each in himself, know the power of striving by the Spirit of God. The Spirit indeed would enlist the individual on His side to
{237}
strive against the working of evil. It goes on all the time. It is yet the striving time, and who is not conscious of it in himself as he has to do with evil in himself, and perhaps still more in those who are unregenerate? We are not to be occupied with each other as more or less marked by evil; we are to learn to be abstract in our regard for each other and to clothe each other abstractly with the good and the good only. We are entitled to do that. The Spirit has more liberty in that than in striving against the evil that is in us. So this allusion in @Genesis 6 is remarkable, for it is a matter now of one hundred and twenty years -- and how long before? It really extended back to Adam, for the striving began as soon as Satan got a footing. God could easily have slain Adam and Eve, but He did not do so. The serpent under penalty is allowed to remain according to the wisdom of God: he will be used negatively and positively in the discriminating government of the Creator. But the man and the woman should become the theatre of the Spirit's striving, so that God should work out the great thoughts of His love. And the Spirit of God succeeded. According to the testimony of the third, fourth, and fifth chapters of Genesis the striving was successful; God is seen gaining -- not in the relative number of men secured for Him, but morally. Enoch is seen in the fifth chapter as walking with God, and so pleasing to Him that He takes him to Himself. Now that is what I am seeking to show -- that God secures in those circumstances such a result, in a man, from his testimony, that He translates him to heaven. It is said in the New Testament that before his translation Enoch had the testimony that he pleased God.
So I come to chapter 8, where the Spirit of God is typically seen as a dove. It is the Spirit in subjection. The record is to call attention to a certain state which God approves. In the deluge judgment prevails, but it becomes discipline, which is used to effect clearance for
{238}
a fresh start. The present is a great time of discipline. I have lived in a city half a century or more and that is what has largely characterised the testimony of God in it -- constant discipline, constantly recurring need for judicial cleansing. But the disciplinary services are not without result, not without victory, even at the present moment. God is wonderfully patient with us, dear brethren, for He sends out the dove from time to time, as it were, to see how the persons under discipline are moving. It is a time of watching, a time of priestly observation, and the priests become the expression of the Spirit of God, or the Spirit of Christ, so that the *eyes* of the priests have to be active; indeed the five senses of the priests have to be active. The most difficult problem we have is that of transparency, to find transparency in disciplinary conditions, to find honesty and uprightness. Unless the priests¬ eyes can see these features there is little or no hope. And so the raven went out.
Sometimes it is assumed that any brother or sister may go to discern a leper; it is not so. The raven was an inmate of the ark as the dove was, but the raven could go and stay outside and the dove could not. So that we must never send a raven; he will never bring back a right message. He will go and not return, he will never come back at all; he will find satisfaction in the company of the erring ones -- partisan conditions are raven conditions. You will go and stay with the people that you should look at and leave, if there be not transparency and uprightness with you. There must be the coming back if we are going to serve on right lines; the dove did come back, there was a link between her and the commanding personage -- representatively God. In the government of the house of God there must always be that -- a commanding spirit, the spirit of authority, the spirit of leadership; and that spirit, in whomsoever it is, will always have a link with
{239}
the dove. So that Noah took her in to him. He sent her out from him, as much as to say that it was no pleasure to him to be minus the dove in the ark. There was a void through the dove's absence, but apparently none because of the raven's, although it never came back. One idea of the Spirit of Christ is leadership, as in David, leading the people out and leading them back. So the Lord Jesus went in and came out, or oppositely under other circumstances, He went out and came in. The dove went out and came in. She was commissioned; she was a missionary, as it were. That is what is needed, not to affiliate with those in error, but to go and see, to exercise priestly observation as to what the condition is and return.
Well, the dove did not find a place to rest her foot, that is, the thing was not finished. The cause of the judgment was not over, the process was not completed. She waited until it was, she brought back the tidings. Things are not right yet. So, dear brethren, what I am aiming at is to set up a priestly, inquiring spirit, an observing spirit; it is needed most distinctly at the present time. So the dove goes out again after some days. There is no evidence that she met the raven or collaborated with him at all, she went out and she came back by herself, but with an olive leaf in her mouth. Now, she says in effect, I have got life -- something is going on; now God is working, partisan spirit is broken up. Partisanship, I may say here, is deadly. It belongs to the raven and the raven belongs to it. The dove is concerned about life, not the number of persons that dissented from the judgment in the house of God. Think of counting up those who dissent from a holy, solemn judgment in the assembly -- counting the heads of the dissenters! This would be to cast the shadow of doubt on the judgment -- a common effort in such circumstances. That is not life. We are looking for life. We are not looking for partisans, we are
{240}
looking for evidence of repentance, leading to recovery.
And so the dove comes back with an olive leaf plucked off. She had to do with it, as it were, she handled it. It was *plucked off;* it has not fallen off through death. It was living when plucked off, it was a perfect testimony that life was operating. And now there is hope, so that she goes out again, the solution is almost reached. We must reach solutions. The house of God is not a place of loose ends, letting these things drag along or pretending to be with the judgment of the assembly and really against it. No, that does not mark those who are with God. We must reach solutions and we must be true men and women to stand by the solutions and not to be in partnership with the raven. We must be with the dove, the olive leaf is evidence of life. As Hezekiah, who is a son of the resurrection, says, "The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I this day" (@Isaiah 38: 19). He does not say, 'as I am *going* to do'. Is there anyone wishing to enter the fellowship of God's people in the assembly? Do not put it off; it is this day, this moment is the time to decide -- it is a living state of things. The dove comes back with a leaf and when she goes out again she stays out, meaning she is at liberty now, she is not restrained now. The persons involved have judged themselves and she can stay there and help them, for the Spirit adds His help to our weaknesses. But there must be conditions for it. Until sin is judged and dealt with -- until we have washed our robes -- the Holy Spirit has not scope to be with us and act among us. I do not mean to say He leaves a real believer, but it is a question of action, direct service, and if we quench the Spirit He does not serve us; we rob ourselves of His service.
Well now, I come to Lot, chapter 19. I am going to deal with a worldly christian -- a very grievous phrase to have to use. But I want to speak of him abstractly, and I am entitled to do so because the apostle Peter in
{241}
telling us about Lot, calls him, by the Spirit of God, a righteous man; vexing his righteous soul every day because of the ungodly conduct, the lawless conduct of the people of Sodom. Every day he was vexed, and yet he was an official at the gate of the city. Inwardly as this one and that one came up to him, passed by him out of the gate, his righteous soul was distressed. A paradoxical state of things, a state of things that could not be pleasing to heaven; but still, heaven has wonderful power of abstraction, that is to say, as dissociating certain elements from others. And that is what happened as to Lot. Two angels came and found him at the gate. How distressing it must have been to them! It was really a question of fellowship. Can we have fellowship with this man? I can understand one of the angels saying that. We will abide outside, they said. He is urging them to come into his house, but no, they are giving him to understand they will stay outside; they are, as it were, taking the attitude before him so that he might understand that they are not ignoring his worldliness. Heaven is well aware of it if in any of us. But he persuaded them and that brings out what was there. It was not "yea yea, and nay nay", but to bring out the sincerity that lay beneath the worldliness in Lot's heart. He urged them and they came in. They came in to the house and the remarkable thing is that he is honoured in that the Spirit of God tells us that he made cakes of unleavened bread, as far as Scripture states, the first one to do it. Heaven knows the worth of that man, as it does each of us even when we are worldly. The worth underneath is known; like precious gold it is going to be dissociated from the dross, or whatever we may call it, that hinders its usefulness, that hides its usefulness, that hides itself, it may be. But heaven knows, and it is to be brought out. And so as soon as heaven manifests itself, as soon as the link is established with the agents of God and Lot, it is seen, and then Sodom shows its
{242}
hand. I would say to any young person here who is worldly, Beware! Sodom is Sodom -- up to that time apparently the worst city on earth. God said He would go down Himself to see it, and surely enough, the guilt was there; it showed itself immediately as soon as God's hand was seen in the angels identified with Lot. From every part of the town the men of Sodom gathered to the house of Lot. Who are these men that have come in to him? They want to know and they would do something to them, evidently they would destroy them.
Well now, the angels took the matter in hand. Lot cannot cope with it. What could he do with every man in Sodom, from all quarters, attacking him? "Back there!" they say to him. They have changed their mind altogether about him and yet poor Lot calls them his "brethren". He never would again, I am sure. For a christian to be hail-fellow-well-met with the world is abominable. He is not in life as we had this afternoon, he is not in the sphere of life, he is in a moral sense in the sphere of death, surrounded with death. He is powerless. The angels took the matter in hand, however, and that is what I am seeking now to bring forward. If there is anyone here whose conscience is affected, who is touched by what I am saying, God is going to show you that you are very interesting to heaven, and all the protection you need you will get. They pulled Lot into the house; that is the first thing. He was out, exposed to the wicked crowd who would have overwhelmed him. But the house is there: we may thank God for it, for the door; indeed for all the christian houses to which some one here who is exposed to the world may go. There is escape *there*, there is retreat there from the Sodomites in a crowd attacking it. The angels drew Lot in, they drew him *to them*. It is not simply his own house now, it is really their house; they are, as it were, taking charge of the house, and as there they are drawing him to them. He is of great interest to them. And there is
{243}
a house now, young people, into which you may be drawn by God from the crowd outside, where there is safety, where there is protection, where there is love; for the angels here represent God. They drew Lot to them into the house. They take care of the crowd too, smiting them with blindness. They do not slay them, they are reserved for heaven's avalanche of brimstone. Terrible, terrible judgment is reserved for them, as it is for the present world. Let us beware that we may not be *judged with it*. The angel is concerned that Lot should not be judged with Sodom.
Abraham was no doubt thinking of all this, waiting outside, as it were, in the spot where he had just stood before Jehovah -- a precious thought. And he saw the flames of Sodom. Heaven rained its brimstone and Sodom became an inferno, and was utterly destroyed. The angels did not do that; I mean to say, they left that for the general conflagration. They caused blindness on the men of Sodom, they rendered them impotent, so that they wearied themselves to find the door. A christian will find the door; the door is Christ, as we learn elsewhere. Will a worldling ever find that door? No, unless God works with him. A blind worldling will fall into the ditch; blind leading the blind marks his position. You can picture those Sodomites: Can you tell me where the door is? one might ask. His neighbour might point to the roof or anywhere in answer, blind leading the blind, both falling into the ditch. "They wearied themselves to find the entrance". Such is the sure action of God if He is seeking to help a worldling who is really one of His people. What comes out is the *value* of this brother. The angels took him to them into his own house. He is precious property; he is known in heaven and spoken of as *saved* thousands of years after. He is known by Peter's pen among the dispersed of the Jewish christians. Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed in his soul by the wicked conduct of the
{244}
Sodomites, is known universally now as a righteous man, not as the poor worldling he had been, although that is known too: but the great point of the Spirit is that he is a righteous man. His uncle Abraham had been talking to Jehovah about him as a righteous man -- that perhaps there were ten like him in Sodom, so that the city might on their account be saved. But there were not, and the city was not saved, but Lot and his two daughters were saved *out of it*. Jehovah and the great saint Abraham were conversing about righteous men among whom, as regarded by Abraham, Lot was. But it was to be known in heaven and known amongst the saints that Lot was a righteous man. Thousands of years later Peter, writing by the Spirit, spoke of him as a righteous man. So the two angels urge Lot to leave the city. They say to him, We cannot do anything until you go. See how interesting he is, how important he is! It is a leverage in the soul of a christian in such circumstances as God gives him to understand how valuable he is.
So that the narrative here shows that Lot was greatly valued in heaven, so much so that nothing could happen to Sodom until he left it. The angels took hold of the hand of Lot, of his wife and of his two daughters and led them out of the city. Then they said, Escape for thy life, it is for him to do the rest. God is here showing the way of deliverance to those in such circumstances; do not look back to the world. Lot's wife looked back; she would never have gone from Sodom if left to herself. It is the urgency of the angels, but, alas! she looked back and became a pillar of salt -- another personage who has come down to us as a warning; one who, being a world-lover, looked back into Sodom after being delivered out of it, and became a pillar of salt. That is very solemn, but God would through it preserve others from doing the same. She looked back from *behind* her husband. She was deceptive. Her mind
{245}
was different from that of the angels and even from that of her husband.
Well now, just a word about @John 14 to bring out how the Lord Jesus loves us, how He likes our company. He says, "Let not your heart be troubled". 'I am going to have you with Me for ever, and in the place I have prepared for you'. He is impressing us, that is, the saints of this dispensation, that we have a peculiar place up there. Others also will have places of their own but none with such a place as ours. So that God is stressing this at the end. We cannot say there are one hundred and twenty years left as in the days of Noah; we do not know how many years or hours there will be, but we do know heaven is looking for us, preparing for us, and making us fit to be there. So the Lord says here, "Let not your heart be troubled". That is the first thing He says, in this chapter. "Ye believe on God", He says; the word is "on", pointing to a definite Object of faith. It was not hypothetical, it was the truth. God was to them a settled Object of faith. Now, the Lord Jesus says, let Me be that too. Let Me be an Object of your faith. I am to be up there and you down here. The idea is, it is to be a settled matter; it is not for a moment, it is to be a settled matter with them: "Believe also on me". How much that must have touched them! The One who, as down here, was with us familiarly, that One we are to have as an Object of faith up there. I am sure it touched them and the Lord intended that it should touch them.
Then He goes on to say, "In my Father's house there are many abodes; were it not so, I had told you; for I go to prepare you a place". That is, the Lord is saying, This matter is so important that I should certainly not leave it out -- this precious fact that I am going to prepare you a place. The "many abodes" refer to other families of the Father's. But the Lord says, "I go to prepare a place for you". He is putting it into their
{246}
hearts -- or our hearts -- that they are wonderfully distinguished in heaven and that they are going to have a particular place there. "For this reason", says Paul, "I bow my knees to the Father ... of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named" (@Ephesians 3: 14, 15). But, the Lord says, I am going to speak to you about *yourselves*. I want you to know that you have a wonderful place in heaven. "I go to prepare you a place; and if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again and shall receive you to myself". That is what the angels in Lot's house did; they brought Lot into the house to *them* and shut the door. And that is what Noah did in the ark; he took the dove in "to him". And now the Lord Jesus is saying, I am going to take you to*Myself* -- wonderful promise! Surely the intent of what I have been saying is that we might be ready.
His coming is imminent now. The Lord is waiting for us. When the hour is come He will not fail; He says, "Behold, I come quickly". That refers to the hour when He comes; the whole matter is in the Father's hand, but when the hour is come He will come *quickly*. "The Lord himself", we are told, "with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven" (@1 Thessalonians 4: 16). No one will be left of those who belong to Him. *Hearing* on our side will enter into it, for He says that those that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall go forth ... to resurrection of life; and those who are alive and remain shall be changed. The voice will be loud, the trumpet will be shrill enough to reach every ear of those who belong to Jesus; and all shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air; "and thus we shall be always with the Lord".
{247}
THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN THOSE WHO SERVE HIM
@Philippians 1: 16 - 19; @1 Peter 1: 10, 11; @1 Peter 3: 18, 19
I have been thinking of the Spirit of Christ. The apostle Paul speaks of the supply of it in the first scripture read. There is a supply of it. It is now formally in Christ as a Man, and it is there in abundance. It is to be drawn upon so that it may be in us -- the most important necessity, for it is said, "but if any one has not the Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him" (@Romans 8: 9). Whatever he may be, he is not of Christ; and so he is shut out from Christ. Whatever his profession may be, whatever place he may secure in this world, or society he may keep, however successful he may be in the pursuits of this world, or honoured in it, he is shut out from Christ. He has elected to shut himself out. "If any one has not the Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him". And in the final reckoning under God, one who has not the Spirit of Christ will have no place, no place in Christ -- a most solemn consideration, for all in God's world are to be filled with the Spirit of Christ.
God had indicated in the creation how the Spirit, His own Spirit (which indeed is identical with the Spirit of Christ, for it is the Spirit of God, only the Spirit of God taking up this relation of the Spirit of Christ), garnished the heavens. He is the Spirit of God, He is the Spirit of the Father, He is the Spirit of God's Son, and the Spirit of Christ. It is the same Spirit always under God's hand in His operations, so that we may apprehend Him as garnishing the heavens. "By his spirit the heavens are adorned", we are told in @Job 26: 13. The heavens evidently were formed before the earth. Angels, too, according to the book of Job, were formed before the earth, because they shouted with joy as its foundations were laid: "all the sons of God shouted for joy". So that literally the heavens that
{248}
we see in all their varied glories were garnished by the Spirit of God. What we see is the fruit of His workmanship. Such was His place in the work of creation.
And then, as sin came in -- destruction, dislocation, and general ruin ensuing -- He is seen hovering over the waters, as if He would bring order out of chaos, which He has done. Later He is seen striving with men, for a limited time. The garnishing of the heavens would be for a limited time; it was not continuous. The hovering over the waters was not continuous, nor was the striving with men. "My spirit shall not always plead with Man", God says, (@Genesis 6: 3). His days were to be one hundred and twenty years. God would strive with him during those years. That was the work that God took up, having a suitable workman, one in whom the Spirit of Christ could operate, namely, Noah. He is honourably mentioned in the Scriptures, as we know. Noah, Daniel and Job are mentioned together -- a remarkable trio of men; the Spirit having operated in all three.
Noah is said to have been a preacher of righteousness. It was a kind of preaching that was needed in his time, because unrighteousness abounded. God always meets current evil by what is effective, and has His instrument or vessel to use. So that Noah was available to God, but was to be used by the Spirit of Christ.
And so the passage I read in @1 Peter 3 alludes to that: a comparatively short period of one hundred and twenty years, seemingly, at the end of the antediluvian world. At the end God would give this fine testimony, not simply in gift that Noah may have had from God (he surely was endowed for his service), but in the Spirit of Christ. And that is the first point to be noted, dear brethren. We are now at the end of a period, of the greatest of all periods in the ways of God, either before or after. I am not, of course, alluding to the eternal state of things, we cannot call that a period, we cannot measure that by time at all, it is *final*. Time must cease
{249}
from necessity, so that we cannot include that in the periods or dispensations of God. This is the greatest of them all, "upon whom the ends of the ages are come" (@1 Corinthians 10: 11).
Now Peter alludes to Noah in relation to the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ must have a vessel suitable, and Noah was that vessel. As I said, he is called a preacher of righteousness by Peter in his second letter. No one has any moral title to preach righteousness who does not practise righteousness. That is clear enough. Noah did both. He was a practiser of righteousness, and he became heir of it, as we are told, as if he would be thus constituted for time and eternity. He became heir of the righteousness which is by faith; and as a practiser of righteousness he was qualified to preach it. We have to be exemplary of the thing we preach, or our preaching must fall short in effect and representation of God.
So it is said that Noah was perfect in his generations. That is to say, he was there as representative of God. Persons who knew him, his relatives and acquaintances, could say, There is Noah, the preacher of righteousness. But he was a practiser of righteousness too, and this involved the saving of his house. "By faith, Noah, oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house" (@Hebrews 11: 7). No result of righteousness is more important than the saving of one's house. The devil is specially attacking the young in this present time. The states of the world are laying claim to the young, even reaching over the heads of their parents. It is most important, therefore, dear brethren, to have them under our hand so that the state has no need to search for them. It is humbling that the state has to come in between God and our children. The mediatorship between God and the children is the parents.
So that Noah was a practiser of righteousness in
{250}
preparing an ark for the saving of his house. You may say, he saved the cattle as well. So he did, but the ark is definitely said to be for the saving of his house. So the world had evangelical testimony borne to it, in the Spirit of Christ, by this man during the period of his preaching. The link with the present time is very beautiful and strong, and points to the universal domination of the Spirit of Christ: "for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, in which also going he preached to the spirits which are in prison, heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah" (@1 Peter 3: 18 - 20). Disobedience did not begin then; it had been going on hundreds of years before, but to be disobedient in the days of Noah was more serious; and so it is that disobedience today, when God is furnishing special light for His people, is most serious. As we come under its power and continue in our disobedience, it is most serious. These were "heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing". So that it is not only a matter of the practising of righteousness and the preaching of righteousness, but of the building. Anyone could see the building all those days and years of that wonderful vessel called "the ark". It was a testimony in itself, "by which he condemned the world" (@Hebrews 11: 7). However men might jeer at what he was doing, Noah was condemning them. And so it is that those who seek to go on with the preaching and the building and the practising of righteousness, however weak and obscure, they are condemning the world. Let us rise to the magnitude of the position of Noah! What the population of the antediluvian world was, who can say? It was, I believe, very large. But there they would come during those years to examine what this great servant of God was
{251}
doing. He was preaching righteousness. And he was not only preaching the terms of righteousness, he was doing it in the Spirit of Christ: "in the Spirit, in which also going he preached to the spirits which are in prison", verse 19. They have been in prison all these thousands of years and they are in prison tonight. They had this service rendered to them, but still they did not accept it, and they are now in prison.
But I am stressing that it was in the Spirit of Christ that Noah did it. And if we are preaching, this is the line to take: the practising of righteousness, the preaching of righteousness, and the building of the ark -- "by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith" (@Hebrews 11: 7). That is our work, but it is a question of doing it in the Spirit of Christ. This Spirit of Christ is the Spirit in a moral sense, working out in a man in holy feelings of sympathy, compassion, longsuffering, etc. It worked out in Christ as He entered into death: "who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God" (@Hebrews 9: 14). It was His own act in the power of the Spirit, and it was "in the Spirit, in which" (that same Spirit) "also going he preached to the spirits which are in prison". Those spirits that are now in prison. Well, you cannot compassionate them. They have had this wonderful testimony in their days here on the earth, and so the Lord says of them, "For as they were in the days which were before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day on which Noe entered into the ark, and they knew not till the flood came and took all away" (@Matthew 24: 38, 39). Can you compassionate them? I would compassionate a man whilst his breath is in him, but after he dies, having heard the testimony of Noah or the testimony of the Spirit of Christ, whether through Noah or anyone else, I would not compassionate him. His doom is sealed and the righteousness of God enters into it.
{252}
They carried on without Christ and without God, and perhaps jeered at the building of the ark and the preaching of Noah, for there is not any evidence that any single person was saved through his preaching. Such was the condition of things, the hardness of heart in that day. And the Lord Jesus says with His own lips that all these things they were going on with continued until the very day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and drowned them all. Very summary, but how terrible!
That is the first point I make, and it applies to our meeting in this town, and in hundreds of other towns and cities of the world. What magnitude of importance attaches to them in the sense of carrying on patiently, but always in the Spirit of Christ! No mere religious effort, but always in the Spirit of Christ, by vessels who are practising righteousness, preaching righteousness, and building the ark. That is the example; and it is a question of love, that love is in the circle where the preaching goes on. That is the exemplary side of it that is intended to affect others -- the Spirit of Christ working out in the preachings and in those who listen, and in those who support the preaching and would have persons come and hear. It is in this sense all a question of the Spirit of Christ.
Now secondly, we come to the Spirit of Christ in the prophets. That is in @1 Peter 1: 10, 11: "Concerning which salvation prophets, who have prophesied of the grace towards you, sought out and searched out; searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these". This is a question of prophecy. I have spoken of the gospel services, may God bless them and increase them, increase the zeal they evince! If not in hired rooms, let it be under the canopy of heaven that this work is carried on,
{253}
trusting in God to use His word, for the word of God is not bound. It must have scope in the universe. Let each voice carry as far as it can go in the testimony of Christ in the gospel.
But now we have the prophetic meeting to consider, which is number two, and these meetings are represented in the prophets of old. It is said by Peter, or by the Spirit of God through Peter, that they were "searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out" (@1 Peter 1: 11); that is, they searched as they ministered. We cannot just tell how many prophets there were; God is said to have risen up early to send them, one of the most touching words you can get. He fitted them to serve and gave them the Spirit of Christ. The prophets were not exactly indwelt, but they were imbued with power by the Spirit of Christ. They were not nearly so intelligent as those of us who have redemption, those of us who are sealed with the Spirit. It does not say they were sealed. One of them says, "take not the spirit of thy holiness from me" (@Psalm 51: 11). No intelligent christian would say that now because we are 'sealed for evermore'. He who has called us has sealed us. He that "has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts" (@2 Corinthians 1: 21, 22). It is an eternal matter. There is no possibility of the Holy Spirit being withdrawn from any one of us and I would appeal to anyone who is not sure if he has the Spirit, to get to God about it and make sure. Do not be without it.
But the prophets had not the Spirit of Christ in an indwelling sense, in a sealing sense, because redemption had not yet come. Even Balaam was acted upon by the Spirit of God. The Spirit took hold of Balaam and used him in a most remarkable way. Others too, unconverted men, were used by the Spirit of God. Even Judas performed works of miracles. Paul says, "Lest
{254}
after having preached to others I should be myself rejected" (@1 Corinthians 9: 27). That is possible, but it is not possible for one who has been sealed to lose the Holy Spirit; and, as I said, that is one of the most important matters, because we cannot truly serve God or His people unless we have the Spirit. Now the prophets were used by the Spirit of Christ and testified "before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these". What a theme they had, the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these! "Searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out". And so Peter goes on to say, "To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things, which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, which angels desire to look into", verse 12. These words speak for themselves and one feels one's own shallowness in speaking of them, the things which were ministered to us through Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and all the others. It was expressly told them that what they were ministering was not to themselves. It is a question of the gospel that is now preached to us by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.
Well, all this enters into the ministry meeting. They searched out "what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out". Now if we search out we shall usually find out. If there is a ministry meeting in this town the first in mind to be ministered to are the saints who reside here. When the apostle laboured in Corinth his first consideration was the people residing there. The Lord had told him He had much people there and he stayed for eighteen months preaching to them and teaching them. The first concern of those who rightly minister is to minister to the persons who are in the town in which they are
{255}
ministering. These have the first place. And in view of ministering what is needed the Lord would have the minister to know something of the characteristics of the place. Undoubtedly the Lord Jesus informed Paul more about Corinth than is mentioned in Scripture. The city had notoriety for profligacy, and the Lord would direct His servant in ministry to meet this, and so Paul says to them, "I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified" (@1 Corinthians 2: 2). Do you not think the Lord laid that on his heart? Paul in preaching to them would go into the presence of the Lord, and would get his impressions from Him. What is the history of this city and what is the history of the saints meeting here? Like towns, meetings are apt to have traditional characteristics. I have known this city for fifty years, and I do not think there is anyone left that I met when I first came; but then certain traditional conditions may remain, and they may need attention. We must be on our guard against a mere traditional outlook. It is sure to be inimical to the truth. Paul at Corinth evidently observed this and the Lord helped him.
So that the ministry meeting involves the prophets searching, as Peter says here, "Searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these. To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things". Isaiah ministered in the days of Hezekiah, and other prophets did, too. But he would say, I must not confine myself to meeting Hezekiah's position, I must be thinking of the future, perhaps thousands of years from now. It is Isaiah who tells us that Cyrus was selected by God before he was born. Well, if he was selected before he was born to do a great service, then Isaiah would have in mind that
{256}
some little bit of his ministry must slip along the line down to Cyrus. I am only citing that as an illustration. But look at what John says about Isaiah, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him" (@John 12: 41). Christ's glory! Isaiah was ministering in the power of the Spirit of Christ, and he saw beyond the current moment. He saw the glory of Christ. It was a question of the sufferings and the glories. So that John says, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him". That is a good example for any little effort we put forth in our prophetic meetings: not only to take account of the present -- though we must take account of the present, as I was saying -- but then, let us be in the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ has a long outlook. He is thinking of Christ; He is thinking of the coming generations in relation to Christ. So that as the testimony proceeds, it will be found that the Spirit of Christ has provided what it needs; and it is largely that the young might take on the truth and carry forward the witness of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.
What a wonderful theme we have, dear brethren, in the Spirit of Christ! So that our meetings should take on the character of *searching*. No one will ever be effective unless he does search for the truth. And who is the Searcher, really? The Spirit of God. He "searches all things, even the depths of God". And if we are to minister at any given time, at any given place, as in us, He knows the hearts of the saints who are there. There is a link between the saints and the depths of God. "Man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the inner parts of the belly" (@Proverbs 20: 27). There must be the searching of the inner parts; so that the Lord in preparation for the prophetic ministry would have in mind on the one hand the depths of God, the wonderful possibilities there are to be brought forward, and on the other hand, the measure of the saints. Then, also,
{257}
God has an inlet into our inner being by His Spirit, so that He searches out the inward parts and knows what to bring out of the depths of God into the depths of our souls. How wonderful! From one Source, an everlasting reservoir of spiritual things, something brought into the depths of the saints of God! And it is that we might be formed inwardly, embellished, garnished, as we might say, for the testimony as it proceeds! Hence the great importance, as I have been saying, not only of the gospel services, but of the prophetic services; the importance too of how the prophets¬ searching affected what they were doing, as to whether what they were ministering applied to the then present time only or to the future. It was to the future. Think of Isaiah ministering to us here at this time! Let us rise to the greatness of what we are dealing with, the greatness of christianity: "but to you they ministered those things, which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven".
Then, thirdly, there is this matter of the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. That is spoken of in Philippians. The assembly there was the door into Europe, as we have often noted. The testimony rolled westward through the great vessel that God had provided for this service. He was called into it. Indeed, he saw the man of Macedonia in a vision calling for help, and the Philippian assembly was formed, leading into the western world. The western world involves this city that we are in now, this country and continent. This continent is the western extremity of the western world, and the Spirit of God had in mind through Paul to bring forward here this thought of the Spirit of Christ, the supply of it. Most of us who have come to this country came to better our temporal circumstances, not that there is any discredit in that. Some have not, but most have. God's mercy is seen in the wonderful
{258}
physical provision in this continent. But what God would do now, and what He has been doing, is to fill a people with the Spirit of Christ; and surely everyone here would be affected by this great thought. The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God, but taking that character. And He is in us in that form, so that there may be the reproduction of Christ in us and through us in this great continent. Think of the greatness of God's thoughts! Let us get into the current of them. The assembly in Philippi started by a river. Women went out to pray by the river-side. It suggests the current of life started in Europe and spread out to these countries in the west and south, and what is it but that that same Spirit should be in us. In these vast countries, or continents, far away from Philippi, the Spirit of Christ is expressed and operative.
And so we get one person in Philippi to exemplify what I am saying in a special way. Her name was Lydia, and she was a seller of purple. Mercantile employ is not out of order. It marks this country in an extensive way. Farming, of course, is a great industry, largely so because everything depends on the field. "The king himself is dependent upon the field" (@Ecclesiastes 5: 9). The cities cannot supply the country, the country supplies the city. "Prepare thy work without, and put thy field in order, and afterwards build thy house" (@Proverbs 24: 27). So that if Lydia were to come over here she would probably find a market for purple. The Spirit of God opened her heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul. She would have to pay her bills when she bought the purple if she were to be like Noah and be righteous, for when you are paying your bills you are attending to righteousness. That is quite obvious, and she would pay her bills, you may be sure. But the Lord opened her heart to attend to other and greater things -- more important than selling purple, farming, insurance work or whatever it may be. I do not like
{259}
to use that word 'insurance' much, as applying to material things, because it really belongs to God. The great insurance institution belongs to God and depends solely on Him. There is none of any value morally outside of what is in God. It is quite apropos that I should use the word 'insurance' in speaking to the brethren here -- because we are apt to forget that the word belongs to God and is only borrowed. The fire or the bomb will destroy any material, but not what is in God, what is in Christ. We are established up there. So that there is not much in the use of that word in industrial things. Lydia is not called a merchantess, she is called a seller of purple, as I said, meaning that she had selling transactions, and if she bought the purple she would have to pay for it, and she would expect her customers to pay her, which no doubt they did. But the Lord would say, Now Lydia, you have been doing all this, but I want you to attend to something else. There is a man in this city who has been out to your prayer meetings by the river-side, and he has things to tell you that far excel anything you have. They are eternal. They never perish, nor shall we, as having them, ever perish. It is said that those who believe on Christ should never perish but have everlasting life. So the Lord would say to Lydia, You attend to the things spoken by that man. He did not say, the things spoken by Silas or by any others; but the things spoken by Paul. That is what she did. There is no suggestion that she should give up her business. She had a household and she would need to provide for her household, but she attended to the things spoken by Paul.
That river may be regarded as a symbol of the Spirit of Christ. It is what has run over to this continent and the Lord intends to keep it here until He comes for us. He has intended that our children should carry on what we have got, that they should be possessed of the
{260}
Spirit of Christ and carry on as their fathers did, or better, because the generations should certainly improve. One generation passes away and another comes, and the generation that follows has the advantages of what could be learned from the one passing away. So that dear brethren, this is the word -- the Spirit of Christ in Europe and its outgoings. Whatever be our earthly callings, do not forget the things spoken by Paul. The depths of God are involved in the things spoken by Paul and we must attend to what he says, take it into our souls and make use of it. It is a truth that you can trade with, that is, getting returns by working it out. So that you prosper as your soul prospers. If you prosper in any other way you will be in danger of being caught by the world. But if you prosper as your soul prospers there will be perfect balance, and you will be found with the Spirit of Christ, and in the testimony of God while you are down here.
{261}
READINGS ON THE SPIRIT (1)
@Acts 1: 6 - 9; @2: 1 - 4
J.T. In view of these meetings I was thinking of the Holy Spirit as viewed in an *objective* sense in the book of Acts. We may be enabled to see how He is thus presented in connection with various features of the truth in this book -- a divine Person operating here. It is important to apprehend the Spirit as in the inauguration of the dispensation. It is, in a certain sense, His dispensation. He has come in as a divine Person according to what the Lord had said: "I will beg the Father, and he will give you an other Comforter" (@John 14: 16). It is thought that these two chapters will afford us material to work out that side of the truth. The apostles, inquiring from the Lord as to the restoration of the kingdom to Israel, were told, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you" (@Acts 1: 7, 8). The matter is thus stated; the Spirit here was the great fact in which they should rest.
The Spirit would be present with them in power for testimony, and they should be trustworthy. He would unfold things, and open up the truth as needed. The first point to see is that the Spirit has come in and formed a dispensation and taken charge of it, as it were; so that the apostles were to be restful. Times and seasons were in the Father's hand; the truth as to them would come out in due course, but not yet. In the meantime the depths of God would be brought out, a greater thought than times or seasons. The Holy Spirit, in perfect knowledge of all, would be with the
{262}
disciples, and He would unfold the truth as needed, and regulate everything. So that the first point is to rest in the sense that a divine Person is here as Christ was here, and here in relation to God. Chapter 2 brings out the state of the brethren, the apostles and others that were there, showing how unified they were, and fit for the Spirit to take on and use, so that they moved in relation to Him. That is the great general thought in this beginning in the early chapters.
Then I thought that we might look at chapter 5 to see Him acting in relation to discipline in the assembly, and then at chapters 8, 9, and 10. In chapter 8 He is seen in relation to evangelical service, sovereignly taking charge of the service in Philip; and in chapter 9 He *comforts* the saints. In chapter 10 He sovereignly takes over the gentiles. There are other features that will open up later.
R.W.S. The restoration of the kingdom was not on lower ground than what the Lord had in mind.
J.T. The Lord does not say anything about it, save that as included in times or seasons it was in the Father's hand. The point is the Spirit. You are impressed with the great fact of the Spirit who was about to come.
A.E.H. "The depths of God;" do you look upon that as connected with the objective side of things? You have suggested that it stands related to the full outshining of the revelation of God.
J.T. "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God" (@1 Corinthians 2: 10). That is largely what is developed, so that the point is to make room for the Spirit. He is here as a great Commissioner; a divine Person sent here, and He operates as such.
T.A.T. Do you think that those whom the Lord was addressing knew much about the truth of the Spirit?
J.T. Their understanding as to Him, and as to all
{263}
things, was relatively meagre until the Spirit Himself came, but much had been said, by the Lord, of His coming. All the gospels, especially Luke and John, indicate this. The Lord went so far as to say that they should get the Spirit from the Father by asking Him. John stresses much the Spirit and His coming. He alone speaks of Him as the *Comforter*.
S.J.H. Does the Lord's remark, "It is not yours to know times or seasons", suggest that it was theirs to know what is in the Spirit and in His realm?
J.T. That is what I thought. The apostles, no doubt, would inquire together as to what He meant. Why does He not say more? Let *us* be impressed with the great fact that He has come, His presence here is the great characterising fact of the dispensation. Let us seek to understand and appreciate the immensity of it.
A.N.W. I think your use of the word 'restful' is interesting. We might be worried about the times and seasons, but there is enough to keep us restful.
J.T. That is the great point, to keep "in the Spirit".
W.L. In both of these chapters the thought of the Holy Spirit being *upon* the disciples is emphasised. Would that suggest that He is to be in evidence in an objective sense?
J.T. Yes. He is here in the saints and others may take account of Him. He can be taken account of even by unconverted people; that is what comes out in @Acts 2: 15. Peter says, "these are not full of wine, as *ye* suppose, for it is the third hour of the day". Then he goes on to tell what it was -- what they saw: the Spirit is to be taken notice of in public testimony. Previously it says, "there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them" (@Acts 2: 3). It is the external side too in Luke; and again, "he that ... has anointed us, is God" (@2 Corinthians 1: 21). It is what is observable. That the Spirit of God has come in, is a wonderful fact.
{264}
A.E.H. Does the sitting on each of them suppose there was work to be performed in them, to make it possible for the disciples to take up a position of that kind?
J.T. He came on Christ as a dove and abode upon Him, but here He appeared as parted tongues of fire, and sat upon each one of them.
A.N.W. "And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high" (@Luke 24: 49). Is that an outward evidence of His presence?
J.T. Yes, it is public. John represents what is inward.
A.H.P. Is there any correspondence in Pentecost with what had been seen in the Lord personally in His public service here, in the gospel of Luke especially?
J.T. Yes. The Holy Spirit came *on* the Lord Jesus, and He was *on* Simeon. It was a public matter, and the greatness of it is stressed. What could be brought into Jerusalem to compare with it? All the happenings of the world would pale into insignificance as compared with this great event. We are to be occupied with the great thought of the Holy Spirit come in. We should be greatly impressed by it. As we see here, it is not a question of the times or seasons; but I fear that, if you announced you were going to give an address on times and seasons, you would get a much greater hearing than if you were giving an address on the Holy Spirit. "But the rumour of this having spread, the multitude came together and were confounded, because each one heard them speaking in his own dialect" verse 6. Why had not the apostles inquired from the Lord about this great coming event? If they had been observant they would have inquired about the Holy Spirit, but in their minds it was a question of the kingdom being restored to Israel. But God was working and what was evident in the disciples caused a great stir in Jerusalem.
{265}
J.R.H. The word for *power* in verse 7 is interesting. It evidently gives the idea of the right to exercise power. What would you say about that?
J.T. That is what it is. It is not the dynamic idea, but authority. In @Acts 1: 8, "ye will receive power", it is dynamic power. The former in general is made effective by the latter. The apostles had authority from the Lord, but active power (ability) was needed to make it effective. The latter is the Spirit, "But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth" (@Acts 2: 14). What is conveyed is that he had authority, but concurrently there was, in him and with him, the Spirit of God. Hence the great practical result on that great day -- three thousand added. A supporter of the Jewish system might have challenged Peter as to his authority to speak, and asked him, What authority have you to stand up and preach? You are not the high priest, nor of the priestly class, nor even a Levite. Well, the actual power of the Spirit was there manifestly -- universally felt. Thus the two ideas, authority and effective power, were illustratively present. Peter had the real power, confirming the authority with which he spoke. The activities of the Spirit accompanied the public services of the apostles at the beginning; and, through humble dependence on the Lord, this will in measure mark the service now.
J.R.H. There is no right representation of God without that authority.
J.T. There should be authority. Positive representation of God does not have a mandate from any college. The Spirit operating carried His own credentials with it. "Never man spoke thus, as this man speaks" (@John 7: 46).
A.N.W. Does it show itself differently in the conveying of power by the Lord Himself? In @Luke 9 He gave them "power and authority". How would that show itself?
{266}
J.T. The former would be the actual power of the Spirit; the latter a mandate. The Spirit confers authority too, as well as being the power to make it effective, which is illustrated in @Acts 13: 2 - 4 "And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go. They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed away to Cyprus". That is, the authority is there, and the actual power also as seen in the blindness brought upon Elymas in verse 11; so that anyone coming in contact with them would see it. It is a question not only of dynamic power, but of something that indicates authority behind it. The Spirit of God is God, and He *sent* them *forth*. His stamp is on them.
T.A.T. Of course He would express His mind through some brother?
J.T. "The Holy Spirit said, Separate me now". We are not told *how* it happened in detail. Undoubtedly it would be through some brother, but the sending forth was by the Spirit of God.
R.W.S. Is this the side of the Spirit coming Himself? He comes in to carry on the work that the Lord had started. "These things I have said to you, abiding with you; but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, *he* shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you" (@John 14: 25, 26).
J.T. Yes. The facts of His coming are given in the beginning of @Acts 2: "And when the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, they were all together in one place. And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting". These are the facts
{267}
of the transaction. Was there ever such a transaction? The incoming of Christ was not thus signally marked. There was no public manifestation at the Lord's birth, but here there is a "violent impetuous blowing". That is heaven's way of coming in. It is not wind in the ordinary sense, it is *breathing*, meaning that the inner parts of God, speaking reverently, are active themselves. It is how He is coming in by His Spirit.
J.D. Say a word on @John 14: 25, 26, "These things I have said to you, abiding with you; but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, *he* shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you". Would the sending of the Spirit by the Father underlie what is in your mind?
J.T. Yes; and the Son sends Him too. But it is now the fact of His coming, the actual transaction; enlarging on what the Lord had said; "ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you". It is His action, and so we have the accompanying facts as to what they heard in the house; what filled the house: "there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting". What was that for? What is anything that is happening on earth compared with it? There were persons there *sitting;* the word is used particularly. They are restful and composed, and now this happens. Those present would say, We shall never forget this! It was intended that they should never forget; it would go with them in all their activities. It was mighty power, not a storm, but, as it were, God breathing; and the very inwards of God expressing themselves in this most significant way.
H.B. Would you say that this is a much deeper thought than is seen at the end of Exodus where everything is anointed after the gathering together of the material?
{268}
J.T. This is a deeper thought. It is God's powerful breathing. Scripture speaks in several connections of the breath of God, but this is the most unique one. The sound of it filled the house where the disciples were sitting. The apostles would say, We understand now what the Lord said as to authority and the power that goes with it.
J.W. If we are concerned about the times and seasons we are apt to be selfish; looking for the restoration of the kingdom would imply that we are concerned as to what belongs to ourselves.
J.T. Quite so, turning aside from the divine thoughts and purposes, and the means by which they are effected -- the Spirit of God. The times and seasons have their place, as Paul says to the Thessalonians: "ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 2). Christians come to know these things through the Spirit of God as here. The main thing is His presence among us. He guides us into all the truth, (@John 16: 13).
R.W.S. He fills the house. Is it the thought of filling whatever He comes into?
J.T. Yes. We are to be filled with the Spirit. Coming in, He commands attention. What else do you want? If you brought in all the radios in the world -- and they afford only the most wretched matter -- it would be only to interfere with this work and service of the Spirit. Do I want a radio to fill my house? Normally the believer's house is already filled.
A.H.P. Would what we see here, external power and authority, indicate a divine Person here to carry the testimony through?
J.T. Yes. It says, "there appeared to them;" it was to impress them. If we are divinely impressed we shall impress others. Peter stands up on that principle; he was in this sense impressed as he arose to speak on the day of Pentecost.
{269}
R.W.S. Anything less than being filled is short of the divine idea.
J.T. Yes; the general idea is being filled with what is presented. It is a heavenly sound of impetuous breathing. Saul breathed out "threatenings and slaughter", but this is opposite; this is God breathing, as giving to His people and affording to all men, as they value it and seek it, the gift of His Spirit.
W.L. They were all together. Would that be the 120?
J.T. Yes. All who were there heard it. It is a heavenly sound, as the passage says, "suddenly a sound out of heaven". They evidently knew the sound. What am I going to listen to? The whole house is filled with this precious sound.
W.L. It was not specially for the apostles.
J.T. There were more than the apostles there; the 120 were there. "They were all together", it is said; that is, those mentioned in the first chapter.
J.D. Your allusion to the inwards of God expressed in this way is very sweet, I think; as it reflects on the whole service of Christ and what He accomplished. The Spirit can be identified with that.
J.T. Assembly features were there. The persons there were suitable; *all together*, not an absentee, which is a principle that runs through. They were in one place when the wonderful breathing sound from heaven filled the house. Morally there was no room for anything else.
A.E.H. The wonderful feelings of it are typically suggested in the account of the feast of Pentecost in @Leviticus 23: 15 - 22. There is instruction regarding "thy field", the corners were not to be reaped, but left to the poor and the stranger. There is infinitely more than enough in the Spirit for the apostles and those gathered at Jerusalem. It reaches out.
J.T. There is no time limitation to the feast of
{270}
Pentecost. All that fits in here. It is left open. In a sense we are shut up to the Spirit; it is His day. There is no limit to His activities; nor is there a limit to what He may open up to the assembly. He searches all things, even the depths of God. Prophecy had much place with the brethren in the early days of the revival over one hundred years ago, and God helped much in the inquiry; opening up the dispensations, also the territory in view in the prophetic scriptures. The ministry rendered was most precious and instructive, clarifying the whole outlook, and thus making way for the ministry relative to Christ and the assembly which the Spirit has kept before the saints ever since.
J.T.Jr. "As the Spirit gave to them to speak forth" (@Acts 2: 4). Is that administration in the Spirit's hands?
J.T. That is what is prominent in this chapter. The Lord had been preparing the apostles for it.
J.T.Jr. Is that what you had in mind in the objective side of the Spirit? In a certain sense the Spirit has charge of the position.
J.T. Yes. Even in regard of detail in service: you are concerned for instance, about giving an address to the brethren; you feel very feeble, but presently something suggests itself to you, and you are assured. The Holy Spirit is always ready to do that. Your mind is thus clear, and as you proceed you are supported. The word to note is, "as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth". Whatever your main thoughts are, you are concerned as to what the Spirit gives, and the general help He renders.
A.B. Does the apostle have in mind in that connection the reference in @Isaiah 64: 4: "who acteth for him that waiteth for him"?
J.T. That passage is quoted in @1 Corinthians 2 where we have the truth relative to the Spirit enlarged on. Isaiah says: "Never have men heard, nor perceived by the ear, nor hath eye seen a God beside thee, who
{271}
acteth for him that waiteth for him". Let us allow the Spirit to enter. He is a divine Person regarded here objectively; let Him in and He will "speak forth".
T.S. What difference do you make between the filling of the house and the filling of them?
J.T. The *sound* is what fills the house -- heaven calling attention. Thus we must let heaven speak. It fills the house. Then it says, "And there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak". The *parted tongues* are for your eye; the *sound* is for your ear. It sat on each of them. You cannot just say *the tongues* sat on each of them, It sat on each of them; each one has It. That means we have to think of one another in relation to the Spirit. We have to think of heaven, of course, as regards the sound; but according to what appeared, the Holy Spirit came on each one, so that I have now to learn to think of the brethren as thus affected; anointed by the Spirit.
W.L. These features were carried forward.
J.T. Yes. These brethren were impressed and I am sure they would never lose the impression, they would pass it on. The lame man of @Acts 14 heard Paul speaking and was impressed.
A.N.W. "We hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God" (@Acts 2: 11).
S.McC. "And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed" @Acts 14: 1.
J.T. That chapter, as already noted, illustrates what is before us. They "so spake", and the impotent man "heard Paul speaking".
T.A.T. Peter was impressed when Cornelius received the Spirit. "Can any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as *we* also did?" (@Acts 10: 47). The Spirit was the gift of God.
{272}
J.T. Quite so, we will come to that. These parted tongues, as the passage says, "sat upon each one of them". Individuality is stressed in this.
J.R.H. What is your thought of parted tongues of fire?
J.T. They imply the overthrow of the language barrier set up at Babel. The Holy Spirit gave them power to speak the languages of those present from many countries.
J.R.H. Does *as of fire* allude to what is drastic?
J.T. Yes; the destruction of what is of the flesh in those who speak. This includes mere natural eloquence. They speak "the great things of God" (verse 11); that is the kind of thing you will be able to do; speak of the great things of God.
J.T.Jr. "To-day, if ye will hear his voice", the voice of the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so.
C.R. "The breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding" (@Job 32: 8). Does this relate to something like that?
J.T. The breath of the Almighty is a great thought. The first allusion to it is in @Genesis 2 where God breathed into Adam the breath of life. It is the same breath that ignites the lake of fire, as said in @Isaiah 30. What God can do! What He can use to ignite a fire He can use to make a man live; He can change things in their use. This scene in @Acts 2 is to impress the disciples. They were going to serve in the testimony in the power and character of that of which they are being made conscious.
A.N.W. What is this "it"?
J.T. It refers to what appeared to them, pointing to their speech -- the power and universality which would mark it. "Peter, standing up ... lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them. Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words".
{273}
J.C. "There appeared to them:" how does this power work out?
J.T. It works out so that we have right thoughts about one another; we have mutual esteem for each other as in the Lord's service. God is thinking of us all. It promotes mutual feelings. I am glad of another brother's prosperity in the service. We see how God qualifies His servants, and we have joy in each other's success. We see that "each one of them" was in God's mind. I think we do well to occupy ourselves with the saints, and especially with those qualified to serve, as the objects of God's care and blessing. You say, We are not much; but we love the brethren more and more as we pursue this line.
J.R.H. Is it a question of taking account of the place each of the saints has in divine favour?
J.T. Exactly. Look at them here. These tongues as of fire are on each one of them. This would promote unity in their service.
W.L. Would that be one reason why Peter could say, "Look on us" (@Acts 3: 4)?
J.T. Just so, they are worth looking at. Peter and John were heaven's best in testimony. These in the house as the Spirit came in were all to be looked at; as there your eye would be affected by what *appeared*. It was for those inside.
J.T.Jr. Would it be exemplified in Moses and Aaron in their great speaking before Pharaoh? All that came out in testimony in Egypt was known in Israel. Later Miriam spake against Moses; it was really taking issue with the great speaking of God in Moses.
J.T. Yes. Aaron was a great speaker; God says, "I know that he can speak well" (@Exodus 4: 14). In some Egyptian drawing-room, doubtless, some would have listened to Moses, because he had been instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and deeds. I do not think Aaron was, but God says,
{274}
"I know that he can speak well". Moses now is thinking that he himself cannot speak well, but God would use him according to the ability he had. If subject, we progress in the right thought as we cease to say we cannot do this or that.
R.W.S. The Lord had grief over the man in @Mark 7 "who could not speak right". He is just one man whom He touched; now it is many.
J.T. The whole of humanity is in view for blessing. We have that suggestion here. All men are to be reached by the speaking inspired by the Spirit.
T.S. Does speaking originate with God? Is it something that stands out as original with God? I was thinking of Adam giving the animals their names, and calling his wife's name Eve; his mind having prominence.
J.T. I think the greatest creative work of God is the art of speaking, the vocal powers God has given man. God says to Moses, "Who gave man a mouth?" (@Exodus 4: 11); and as we see here, it is most efficient in the hands of God. Well, this appearing implies that God has made man's mouth; these tongues allude to that. The word *tongue* predominates in the idea of language, indeed it is used as a synonym for language. Therefore, the idea is that as they looked around on one another -- because this is visible, it says "there appeared to them" tongues as of fire -- they were to see on each one this wonderful means of communication. The point is what they were to see; how they were to be impressed.
H.B. The epistle to the Galatians says, "but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision, (for he that wrought in Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles), and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John ... gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship" (@Galatians 2: 7 - 9). Is that a similar principle?
{275}
J.T. Quite so, the ministry of the uncircumcision given to Paul, that of the circumcision to Peter. Evidently they were both good speakers. Peter is very impressive here: "But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them, Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words". What authority there was in his voice! and his enunciation must have carried well too, for he calls attention to his words, not simply his voice.
J.T.Jr. What was there about the speaking that caused the listeners to perceive that they were unlettered and uninstructed men?
J.T. They were not college men, but, nevertheless very effective in what they were saying.
R.A. Speaking of Rebecca it says, "And the maiden ran and told these things to her mother's house" (@Genesis 24: 28). Then it says, "Laban ran out to the man, to the well. And it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's hand, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister", verses 29, 30. Is it what Laban saw and heard?
J.T. Quite so. He was impressed.
W.L. Would you say in that way that speaking forth is stressed as the Spirit came, not merely speaking? "As the Spirit gave to them to speak forth" (@Acts 2: 4).
J.T. That would mean that the pitch is to go far afield. 'Speak out', we say sometimes. The idea would be that these speakers were full of the things they were speaking about, we can hear them speaking. I suppose these comments went on while Peter was speaking: "And they were all amazed and in perplexity, saying one to another, What would this mean? But others mocking said, They are full of new wine", verses 12, 13. Peter takes up the words of the mockers, which is remarkable. He says, in effect, I will address *them*. Why should he pay attention to mockers? It is the
{276}
sense you have that you are greater than they are, and can overpower them *with what you have to say*.
A.H.P. Would the appearance of fire be for themselves personally, or enter into their service towards others?
J.T. It was for themselves, but it was intended to affect their ministry; in dealing with adverse things you must be drastic.
A.H.P. Peter remonstrates severely with Simon Magus.
J.T. When an emergency arises through the flesh working, the idea of fire comes in. It means that you go the whole way, dealing with it effectively. So with Ananias in chapter 5; we shall see later how the Spirit is treated of in that chapter.
A.E.H. In the book of James we have a contrast: "the tongue is fire, the world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body, and which sets fire to the course of nature", (@James 3: 6). Man has used the tongue to set on fire the course of nature, but the Spirit uses it to give authority and guidance to carry divine things through.
J.T. We are told that God is a consuming fire. That bears on what is before us.
T.A.T. As to ministry, there is a time to stand up and a time to sit down, (@1 Corinthians 14: 30). Peter had been sitting down, but now he is standing up with the eleven. Are the eleven standing too?
J.T. Certainly. I do not think the apostles are exclusively alluded to in the Spirit coming in, because parted tongues sat on each of them, but Peter and the eleven were the appointed ones; appointed by the Lord Jesus to preach. Later, other servants, as we are told in chapter 13, were appointed by the Holy Spirit, but these twelve were appointed by the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit takes them on. They do not lose their commission. Paul is added later, also Barnabas, but the status of the
{277}
twelve is immutable so that they appear in the heavenly city.
Ques. Is the greatness of the position to be seen in these men who are to be for signs and wonders? Like this mighty blowing, are they not to be taken account of in this way?
J.T. Quite so. When Peter stands up the twelve are involved. Verse 4 is a general description: "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them to speak forth". This does not mean formal addresses, but what characterised the disciples. Those that heard them say, "how do ... we hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God?" Then verse 14 says, "But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them, Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words". This is a formal address to set out what had happened, a most remarkable gospel testimony with great results. There are no specific results from the general speakings, but three thousand were added through Peter's address. It is to suggest to us the advantage of formal preaching in the power of the Spirit by those fitted for such service.
T.W. Is it right to say that the Holy Spirit is no less on earth now than then, in spite of what might appear outwardly?
J.T. The Spirit is here in the same sense, only there are great limitations because of the great breakdown in the assembly. He is hindered by the condition of the public body. He uses that vessel, but He is hampered by the condition of it.
A.N.W. By *vessel* do you mean the persons or the assembly?
J.T. Persons who have the Spirit bear witness severally, especially those specifically gifted, but collectively, as in @Acts 2, they form the assembly, which is
{278}
the great anointed vessel of light and testimony, in which God has set the gifts, as stated in @1 Corinthians 12: 28.
R.W.S. The assembly is still the place where the Spirit operates.
J.T. Thus all should attend the meetings of those who recognise the truth of the assembly. Scripture contemplates an unbeliever entering the assembly as prophesying is proceeding, and, as convicted by the Spirit, he falls down worshipping God, (@1 Corinthians 14: 24, 25). If I am really subject to the work of God I shall not fail to attend the meetings of those who own the assembly. That is where the Spirit operates.
W.L. The idea of coming together is immensely important.
J.T. It is indeed, and we may thank God that the saints value it increasingly. We are proving the gain of it. But, alas! the many do not even know of it, and a good proportion of those who do, neglect it.
E.F. It requires state for distinctiveness in divine things to come to light.
J.T. It comes by the Spirit. You find in the history of the brethren that distinctiveness in brothers comes out when we are together. Brothers say things in the assembly which they cannot say elsewhere. That is where divine thoughts come out most freely.
A.B. Is that why the apostle in writing to the Corinthians says, "But concerning spiritual manifestations, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant. Ye know that when ye were of the nations ye were led away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led. I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 12: 1 - 3)?
J.T. Therefore we need not only to be present, but also to listen to the speakings in the assembly. That is where we really learn the truth accurately and fully.
{279}
The Spirit guides us into all the truth, @John 16: 13. In the assembly we must listen to the speakings -- *how* things are said.
W.L. Do you think that the eleven here added to Peter's power in his address?
J.T. Yes, the Holy Spirit was in them in the same sense as He was in Peter. They are gifts. In @1 Corinthians 12 we have the human body used to illustrate the assembly as composed of all saints, but the gifted ones are said to be set in the assembly: "God has set certain in the assembly" (verse 28), not in the body. The first mentioned are apostles, and other gifts follow. The word *assembly* has a more distinctive character as in relation to specific testimony.
J.R.H. This is in view of the Lord speaking to them as seen in the first chapter. He does not say of all the 120: "the Holy Spirit having come upon you ... ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (@Acts 1: 8).
J.T. That is what Peter represents as seen in chapter 2: 14. In the whole of his address gift is in evidence, not simply that he had the Spirit of God. Persons are set in the assembly as gifts, so that if preaching is to be done, it is not assumed that every brother in the meeting can do it; it is not that at all. Preaching should only be by one that has ability for that purpose. Of course we must find out if he has it; if he has, it comes to the notice of the brother looking after the preaching. Such a brother can preach as representative of God in some sense.
J.D. As to the rest of the disciples here, they would be in full accord.
J.T. Yes. But the converts took account of the *eleven*, not especially of all the other christians that were there. It is said, "And having heard it they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles,
{280}
What shall we do, brethren?" (@Acts 2: 37). These are the ones that convicted persons will especially notice.
A.N.W. Inside would it be more like @Acts 1: 15: "Peter standing up in the midst of the brethren"? That is how the prophetic word is given.
J.T. That is right.
S.McC. In chapter 15, in the care meeting, there was much speaking that did not effect anything; then James says, "Brethren, listen to me", (@Acts 15: 13). Peter also refers to his *mouth*, "that the nations by my mouth should hear", verse 7.
J.T. Peter and James are the two who speak with authority there.
Well, the point is to observe how this great matter is dealt with in @Acts 2 and 3, because these are inaugural chapters. They convey the general idea, which we may follow up and see developing later. The Lord would give us a great impression here of the scene at Pentecost. We get the distinctiveness of each in the parted tongues as of fire which sat on each one; then the speaking forth; then the gifted men and the apostle Peter standing up with them -- the other eleven apostles -- and speaking formally in testimony as to the great general facts relative to Christ exalted and the Spirit here. This sets out the dispensation so far, as established in the power of the Spirit of God. The assembly is essential to this, formed of those to whom the Spirit had come; those receiving the word through the preaching being added to it. To what the Spirit had formed, the Lord added "those that were to be saved". We can but see the dispensation set up as God would have it, the Holy Spirit dominating it and operating generally in it.
A.B. @Acts 2: 41 says, "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised", showing how the Spirit had been operating relative to Peter.
J.T. "His word", not what the others were saying. It is what he said, "his word" showing that in his
{281}
ministry he especially represented God in this great position.
W.L. Yet they are not added to Peter!
J.T. No indeed. "And there were added in that day about three thousand souls;" the Lord added daily to what was there, it was a *daily* matter. In all this evidence of grace and power we can see how the dispensation was set up. These chapters, as we have said, are inaugurative of this great and blessed dispensation.
A.E.H. Would verse 29 suggest that the one speaking would be so conscious that what he was saying had divine authority that he could refer to it as having a voice? Peter says, "Brethren, let it be allowed to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David".
J.T. There is liberty to speak about Old Testament personages. That patriarchal position of David relates to Christ, for Christ was the offspring of David. He is also the *root* of David.
J.R.H. This objective view of the Spirit is carried forward in Peter's address: "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" (@Acts 2: 33). Christianity as a dispensation of God is in view.
J.T. It is a public matter, and God is stressing it before the authorities today. It is emphasised that christianity is a reality -- "that which ye behold and hear".
There is another thing to be noted here: "this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel" (verse 16). Then he quotes, "And it shall be in the last days, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream with dreams; yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy",
{282}
verses 16 - 18. The suggestion in this quotation is that the *youth* are to be specially taken into account. The apostles were at this time comparatively young men; and Joel is cited as stressing young persons, both men and women, as in the mind of heaven to be taken on for service as the Spirit was poured out. And if the testimony of God is to be continued, the young will be employed by the Spirit. The Lord is taking up young men now, and there may be further space given for testimony. At any rate the Holy Spirit is still here, and He is sovereignly taking up young persons. Let us all be available to Him. There is more work to be done and He is taking on those who are available.
A.N.W. This should be a definite voice to young men now -- a peculiar opportunity given for testimony.
J.T. Quite so, and for young women too. Why should they not be brought in? The four daughters of Philip the evangelist prophesied.
J.T.Jr. Joel refers to the old men too; elders are mentioned.
J.T. Yes; but you are struck with the stress on the young -- "and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your elders shall dream with dreams; yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit".
{283}
READINGS ON THE SPIRIT (2)
@Acts 5: 1 - 16
J.T. Our subject is the Holy Spirit as He is presented objectively to us in the book of Acts. He is presented as a divine Person down here, as Christ was here, only as in the assembly. The relation in this book between the Spirit viewed objectively, and His operations in a subjective sense, has to be made clear. Coming in according to what we had this morning, He formed the assembly; this involved subjective operations. The result of these operations is seen in the end of chapter 2 where the assembly is really formed, although not actually named. In the Authorised Version, @Acts 2: 47, the word *church* appears without question, but in the New Translation it is in brackets, indicating that its existence in the original is doubtful. That the assembly was actually formed is, however, evident, and it is that in which the Spirit operates and in which He is to be apprehended objectively, making way for another great feature of truth, that is, the Lord's relation to what is presented. It is said that "the Lord added (to the assembly) daily those that were to be saved" (@Acts 2: 47). *He* added to what was there. So that the dispensation proceeds and enlarges, the divine Persons being brought into it and seen as operating in it. The result of Peter's address, recorded in chapter 2, is seen in verses 42 to 47. Then we are told, "the Lord added (to the assembly) daily those that were to be saved". Conditions had been effected by the Spirit in relation to which the Lord is seen adding "those that were to be saved;" adding them sovereignly. They "were to be saved", and He is putting them into the assembly. I think it is important to carry these thoughts with us as we proceed into chapter 5. The dispensation is developed in relation to the assembly, and divine Persons are all operating in it.
{284}
J.D. Why is it the Lord added instead of the Spirit? Is it that the Spirit was already objectively known in the assembly, and that was His sphere? The Lord would add from the outside, as it were, whereas the Spirit would work as in the assembly.
J.T. I think that is how the truth stands. The Spirit has effected the state of things which enables the Lord to act sovereignly in taking care of certain persons, and they are known as "those that were to be saved". There are those that are not to be saved, of course, they are out of what God is doing; and there are "those that were to be saved", and the Lord is looking after them. He rules over the dead and the living, (@Romans 14: 9). He selects those that are to be saved and places them in the assembly. Later He will place them elsewhere, but He is placing them now in the assembly. That brings out what we were alluding to this morning, the relation between the lordship of Christ -- Christ above -- and the Spirit operating here. So that in chapter 5 we have first "the Holy Spirit" in verse 3, that is the Spirit by Himself, as it were; then we have "God" in verse 4, which you may say is the Father; then we have "the Spirit of the Lord" in verse 9. So the three Persons are in mind in this attack of the devil through Ananias and Sapphira. Now we are in the presence of the economy of God set up in the assembly and attacked as such, because that is the point particularly, the Holy Spirit in it; He was specially lied to. The liberty of the apostles is striking in this new sphere; it is said that "many wonders and signs took place through the apostles¬ means". It is to stress their position, because they represented the authority of Christ. Then we are told, "all that believed were together", meaning they would be together in spirit, even if not always in body. They were together in body as seen in the beginning of chapter 2, but at the end of that chapter the idea is characteristic. Generally speaking that is what marked them.
{285}
A.N.W. "The apostles¬ feet" would indicate a place of authority.
J.T. Yes, that is what is meant; those that represent the Lord have their full place where the Holy Spirit is operating. So today where the Spirit is operating the authority of God and of Christ is recognised; where it is not recognised it is doubtful whether God is working there at all. Then chapter 2 goes on to say they "had all things common, and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as any one might have need". That is, there was perfect care for the bodies of the saints as well as for their souls. And then, "every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart". It is the general character of the saints as viewed in this external way; a remarkable product, and God has His place, for they praise Him. They had favour with all the people; so far things are as they should be, as the Lord Jesus was here "in favour with God and men" (@Luke 2: 52). Persecution had not come. It would come, but in the meantime this is a beautiful thing being set up by the work of the Spirit. The Spirit having come in, the Lord added to what was there.
J.D. We can understand what takes place immediately in the end of chapter 4; the devil was standing by to corrupt the whole thing.
J.T. That is what we have to look at now. The work proceeded immediately after chapter 2 and the economy was set up in a most palpable and desirable and acceptable way. Peter and John go out and there are results, and then persecution comes in. The servants come back to their own sphere, to their own company and narrate what had happened, and then we are told that "when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.
{286}
And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one, and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them; and with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all" (@Acts 4: 31 - 33). Then as to giving: "For neither was there any one in want among them; for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to each according as any one might have need". Then Joseph, surnamed Barnabas, a Levite, came in, who, "being possessed of land, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles".
We are struck with the place that external or temporal matters had with them. How practical they were: but the devil is now ready to corrupt them, to get a man and woman who were in the light into an untruthful condition. Thus the objective position of the Spirit is at once in evidence, the attack is against Him.
A.N.W. Verse 32 says "*not one said* that anything of what he possessed was his own", including these two, I suppose, up to a point.
J.T. Remarkable! It is to bring out the practicalness of the conditions; they were balanced. The stress is on the temporal needs, which are so perfectly met on the principle of sacrifice; not yet by persons well-off, as in chapter 11. 29, but in the general attitude of all.
J.W.D. What is the difference between divine Persons acting in Their own prerogative, and doing things by One Another's power? The Lord said He used the Spirit of God to cast out demons instrumentally, @Matthew 12: 28.
J.T. It is good to bring that up. One of the first things stated in this book is that the Lord "by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen" (@Acts 1: 2). The gospels tell us also that the Lord said,
{287}
"If *I* by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you" (@Matthew 12: 28), meaning that an organised system had come in. If He were operating by another divine Person, that would mean that one divine Person is subject to another. The economy is established, called the kingdom. The relation of divine Persons to each other in the economy is of extreme importance. The Father is supreme, He reserves things to Himself. The Son tells us that, and then the Son tells us about the Spirit; the Spirit is coming and He would do things. The Lord says to the disciples, in effect, Keep that before you; do not do anything for the moment; times and seasons were to be left with the Father. Now from Pentecost onwards in Acts the Holy Spirit had come and the apostles were to make room for Him. In chapter 2 we see how particularly effective His service was when He took one of them, Peter, and effected through him a wonderful result in the conversion of three thousand persons. Today the governments are saying, Think of the war, let everything else be subservient to that. But the answer is: Think of the Holy Spirit! Think of the marvellous things He is effecting! Coming into the present world conditions He is working out the greatest things. The greatest thoughts are being developed through the presence of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; and that is the great point.
J.T.Jr. When the apostle says, "he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 6: 17), does that bring out how close we are to the Lord?
J.T. Just so. In @Ephesians 4: 2 - 6, the apostle says, "with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love; using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all, and
{288}
through all, and in us all". That is, he puts the position of the economy in its concentric circles. The fact is stated at the outset that there is "one body and one Spirit". That is the great *central* thought, and the great result of the presence of the Holy Spirit here. "One body:" we are to come into all we have been speaking of. We are to learn first to take account of the saints: has each one got the Spirit? "Parted tongues, as of fire, ... sat upon each one of them". Consider what is in mind, watch them, see what is coming out in each one, and let him see what is coming out in me. Let us learn to respect and love one another and see that we are worthy of each other. The Spirit has for Himself suitable material to work out the truth of the body. Then we have "one Lord", which is an outer circle; and then "one God and Father of all" is the outermost circle, taking in all.
J.R.H. Would @Ephesians 4: 22 - 25 link on with this? "Having put off according to the former conversation the old man which corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts; and being renewed in the spirit of your mind; and your having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness. Wherefore, having put off falsehood, speak truth every one with his neighbour, because we are members one of another".
J.T. Yes; the new man is essential to the whole position. The old man would corrupt the whole system. That is what the devil is aiming at here: "the old man which corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts". It is seen in the deception which marked Ananias and Sapphira.
J.T.Jr. "If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy" (@1 Corinthians 3: 17). That is the idea in this chapter, is it not?
J.T. Yes. Here the devil would corrupt the assembly by this man and his wife. They had no other distinction;
{289}
we know nothing of them except what is stated in this chapter. They had "agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord", and to "lie to the Holy Spirit".
R.W.S. The point of invincibility seems to have been reached in verse 31 of chapter 4: "The place in which they were assembled shook". In this line of persecution the devil is completely defeated, so he tries a different method of attack -- from *within*. Is that what he has been doing ever since? In the attack on the apostles before the tribunal he was unsuccessful; now he comes through persons inside to bring in deception.
J.T. It is a frontal attack in the fourth chapter; the leaders say (verse 17), "that it be not further spread among the people, let us threaten them severely, no longer to speak to any man in this name". And in verse 18, "having called them, they charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus". In verse 7 they are questioned; then Peter replies, and they see his boldness and that of John; then they threaten them, verse 17. In verse 21 they "having further threatened them, let them go". I suppose the attack there was as far as the authority could go. It was frontal, as remarked. This movement must be stopped -- that was what was in their minds. But what they met was too much for them -- in the boldness of Peter and John, the way they spoke, with no effort to disguise their lowly origin. The result was the consolidating of the position. Chapter 4 is the attack and the consolidation. The question then was, whether the position had been damaged by the attack, but the fact was it had been consolidated. So we have the resultant things described from verse 32 to the end. Satan sees it is futile to proceed on this line; he is not succeeding. Now what is to be done? He will try to corrupt the position. What Satan cannot destroy he will corrupt, that is the great principle of satanic warfare. But the Spirit of
{290}
God is in power in the assembly and the matter is dealt with summarily.
A.N.W. By what power would you say Peter discerned the lie? Should we have that power?
J.T. The facts mentioned are to bring out what the apostles were. They were the direct product of the Lord, of His patient working with these men; they were the Lord's own handiwork. Peter is put forward in these chapters, he is the leading apostle. @Matthew 10: 2 says, "first, Simon, who was called Peter". He is equal to every emergency. This is a most serious one, it was the devil working in two of their own. It brings out how needful it is to be on the alert, as the Lord says in @Mark 13: 37, "But what I say to you, I say to all, Watch". If I do not watch, I may become an agent of the devil.
J.W.D. Do you think it is possible for anything like this sort of deliberate deception to operate amongst us today?
J.T. Yes; it may become true of any of us unless there is watchfulness. I may become an agent of the devil to damage the position, to corrupt it. Suppose these two had been allowed to continue -- it would have been said, This company is not what it professes to be, there are liars amongst them. The Spirit of God saw to that. It is difficult to say anything as to the immediate details of their death; there is no evidence that Peter did anything, but they died. "Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired".
A.E.H. Would it be right to say that the fact of the Spirit having operated in me would not be sufficient to save me from a collapse of this kind? I must understand something of the objective presentation of the Spirit in the economy to save me from this.
J.T. Yes; if the Spirit is apprehended as a divine Person operating personally amongst the brethren it is more serious, because one thought connected with His
{291}
presence is first-hand knowledge. Of course God has that of everything in His universe. He made the universe; but at the same time He came down to see when men were building the tower of Babel. And He came down to Sodom, "to see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it". That is the way God would assure us of His righteous judgment. The presence of the Holy Spirit here implies first-hand knowledge of what is going on in our souls, in our circumstances; nothing can go for long undetected if He has a place.
A.B. Do you think there is a wonderful tribute paid to Peter and John in @Acts 4: 13? "They recognised them that they were with Jesus". It is not exactly that Jesus was with them, but that they were with Him.
J.T. Yes -- "with Jesus". The work of Christ in them remained, a primary feature, because their names are to appear in the heavenly city. They are not directly the product of the Spirit, but of Christ's own handiwork. The Lord had said to them, "the Spirit of truth ... shall bear witness concerning me; and ye too bear witness" (@John 15: 26, 27). They are viewed throughout as distinct. His own handiwork, "because ye are with me from the beginning".
A.B. Would that link on with @John 20: 22, where it is said, "he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit"?
J.T. Yes; they had a special advantage; no other men had or ever will have the advantages they had. And that brings out this very thing we are speaking of. What immediately follows in @John 20 is the forgiveness of sins by the assembly, or the saints. "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained" (@John 20: 23). That comes into our present-day circumstances. There is much evil arising among us, some of it hidden for years, and yet eventually it comes out. I suppose the length
{292}
of time in some cases indicates how weak the position is, but still it comes out.
A.N.W. Had Ananias and Sapphira lied when they made the arrangement? The position was challenged when they placed the money at the feet of the apostles.
J.T. Yes. They were doing what others were doing, but not with the same sacrifice, and they covered this with a lie, affording Satan an opportunity to discredit the whole position. It is said that "Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, ... being possessed of land, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles", verses 36, 37. These two persons would act similarly. Evidently it was pride of heart; but it gave Satan an advantage. Covetousness entered into it, leading them to lie, Satan tempting them. It was the old man working; but it was the new man in Barnabas. It was the old man in Ananias and Sapphira; but it was the work of the Spirit in Barnabas.
R.A. Does Peter discern by the Spirit that Ananias is not what he should be, only bringing half the price?
J.T. He discerned that evil was there. It is a question of the power he had. He was an apostle of course, and the Holy Spirit was in him. He was operating by the Holy Spirit. Peter evidently discerned the state these two were in and the sin that was being perpetrated on the Holy Spirit. He said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?" He discerned their course was deceptive and thus corrupting, and he challenged it.
J.W.D. Do you see anything in the expression that Satan has *filled* in contrast to the filling idea of the Spirit in the Acts?
J.T. Just so. It is a terrible thing to be filled by the devil! And it was with a purpose, that he should lie to the Holy Spirit; and put aside for himself a part of the price of the estate.
{293}
J.R.H. Your remark as to evil being hidden for a long time is a humbling matter. Do you think that we should be able to detect evil much more quickly than we do?
J.T. It was detected quickly here. It was important to bring out what the economy was, how fortified, the Spirit being apprehended in it objectively, not just working in one and another, but generally operating, a divine Person in charge, as it were. It was He that brought out the guilt of Ananias and Sapphira.
R.W.S. It would be hidden more effectively between man and wife than between man and man, naturally speaking.
J.T. Collusion is easier; it would have taken place in their home. The Holy Spirit would have first-hand knowledge of that. He knew what had happened in the house -- collusion to deceive. Peter says to the wife, "Why is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?" That did not happen in the assembly, but elsewhere.
A.H.P. Would having the Spirit promote the idea of transparency amongst the people of God as bringing about correspondence between what we say and what we are? The Lord said He was altogether what He said. Ananias was not that.
J.T. Quite so. What an object that Man was for heaven! Here there was that which immediately discerned and resisted the corruptive element. Corruption is a weapon of the devil. Violence is too, of course, but corruption is more subtle. The antidote to that is in ourselves: "Watch", the Lord says. We are to be true in our household relations and affairs because the issuance of very much is from the house, the place of family responsibility. Ananias and Sapphira took counsel there to bring this into the assembly. The product of that house is over against the two wave loaves brought out of the houses of the Israelites on the day of
{294}
Pentecost. What they brought out of their houses was not a dual lie, but what represented the new man. The loaves were baked with leaven, but the leaven was rendered impotent, the fire being applied.
Ques. What bearing does this lack of transparency have upon the question of practical unrighteousness amongst brethren?
J.T. It was unrighteous, but more, it was an act of pride; they would act like Barnabas, that is the outward setting of it. The devil would say to them, Now you be like Barnabas. The brethren are taking account of him, giving him a title. Why should not you have that? Besides, they were covetous. They said, We would like to have that, but we do not want to give up all the money. Added to the motive of pride there was covetousness.
W.L. Why does Peter act alone?
J.T. It is to bring out what Peter was. The Lord put him first, and in moral power and wisdom he *was* first.
W.L. In regard to Barnabas all the apostles act together.
J.T. It is to bring out what he was. The Lord had him in mind for great services.
J.W.D. Is there not a formation answering to Peter's ministry which would be very serviceable if true amongst us now.
J.T. You mean the power of discernment?
J.W.D. Yes, in household matters; the peculiar kingdom line that Peter seems to have had committed to him.
J.T. Peter was a married man himself. In this case he waited for the wife to come, he did not send for her. "But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit, and put aside for thyself a part of the price of the estate? While it remained did it not remain to *thee*? and sold, was it not in thine own power? Why is it that thou hast purposed this thing in thine heart? Thou has not lied to men, but
{295}
to God. And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired. And great fear came upon all who heard it ... . And it came to pass about three hours afterwards, that his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in". Peter did not send for her, clearly. "And Peter answered her, Tell me if ye gave the estate for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much". There are no witnesses called, no papers of evidence sought for. It is to bring out the spiritual power that was there through the presence of the Holy Spirit, and especially in Peter. What a man he was! He is the handiwork of Christ. Indeed he himself in his own experience had known what it was to have the devil operating in him. What triumph is witnessed in him now as acting in the assembly in the power of the Holy Spirit in defeating Satan's efforts there!
A.N.W. I think you have said this is to be considered as a special case and might never be repeated. It is to have its effect as shown in verses 11 to 13: "And great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things. And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch, but of the rest durst no man join them: but the people magnified them".
J.T. It is the beginning of things, and there is outstanding judgment executed; never to be forgotten in the history of assembly discipline. Here, we are dealing with the Spirit viewed objectively in relation to assembly discipline. There is a great deal hidden among us, things that should be brought to the assembly; some assuming that things can be settled without the assembly, that capital sins can be settled with God without the assembly, but God will not have that. The assembly has a great place in discipline. The fact is stressed in Matthew, "tell it to the assembly", not, 'Tell it to the Lord', but "tell it to the assembly".
Ques. What are capital sins?
{296}
J.T. An action such as this is one, an act of collusion in pride, the desire to have reputation; or it may be some evil conduct extending over years. The devil is endeavouring to set aside the great fact of the assembly. It exists, very feebly now, but God would have us walk in the light of it. Whatever happens that should be, as it were, taken to the door of the tabernacle according to @Leviticus 4, take it there and settle it there.
J.W.D. How do you apply the scripture, "ye who are spiritual restore such a one" (@Galatians 6: 1)?
J.T. All these scriptures have to be taken contextually. "If even a man be taken in some fault;" what the apostle says about it shows it is not a root matter and spiritual persons can deal with it. But still, the principle of the assembly is involved in that, because @John 20: 23 does not say the Lord was speaking of the assembly; He spoke to the disciples: "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them". It is a question of confidence, and heaven would recognise the judgment of spiritual men in certain matters. Priesthood is involved, and the priests will act in relation to the assembly. It is a question of how the restoration takes place. It cannot be regarded as independency for it is according to Scripture, the special circumstances being understood.
J.D. If the conscience of the assembly has not been disturbed by the action, and spiritual persons having become acquainted with it, they can settle it.
J.T. You would have to allow for the magnitude of the sin.
J.D. Whether it was simply "taken in a fault".
J.T. *Even* if a man be taken in some fault. Do not pounce upon the man and make much of it, rather look into it and see whether it is a root matter. Is it characteristic or not characteristic? The person is taken or found in it. The priests know what to do and the assembly has confidence in them.
{297}
T.W. In the assembly the penalty depends on the *state* of the persons, not exactly on the crime.
J.T. We do not make the penalty fit the crime; we are dealing with persons, having their recovery in view.
A.N.W. There is a point in his being given his high title, "Satan".
J.T. He was not known as Satan in the early days of Genesis, the serpent is the only designation used, suggestive of the degraded position of Satan. That is how he came into the present creation. Later he is called devil, Satan, old serpent, so there is no doubt as to who he is. In @Genesis 3 the allusion is to cattle; he is not viewed as an angel or operating through a man. He is a serpent. The title given to him is in accord with the moment. He is the form of a serpent. According to @Ezekiel 28: 13 he had been a great being: "every precious stone was thy covering". He is seen in Genesis as degraded and attacks the woman. You just wonder about it, how she could listen to such a creature. How much could be said of that! Adam had probably given him his name. Her husband called him serpent; why should she listen to him? But she did. Eve was in the transgression, Paul says, not Adam; that is not to be forgotten. The spearhead in this case was Ananias; the devil was in the man and incited him to do what Barnabas did. But Eve was in the transgression and Adam came into it. She was in it without him, she was the sinner before Adam, a very solemn consideration; in this way the woman has more experience of sin than the man. He came into it. Now here it is said that Ananias "put aside for himself part of the price", he did it and "having brought a certain part, laid it at the feet of the apostles".
J.V. Why do you think the three divine Persons are brought in; he lied "to the Holy Spirit", he lied "to God", and he tempted "the Spirit of the Lord"?
{298}
J.T. The three Persons in the Godhead are there. The Spirit is made more prominent than the Father and the Son; He is viewed by Himself, and then God viewed by Himself, and finally the Spirit is spoken of as the Spirit of the Lord. The attack was directed against the Spirit in the assembly.
J.W.D. In regard to the devil in @Ezekiel 28:17, "Thy heart was lifted up", Peter must have discerned an affinity between that and these two.
J.T. That is exactly what is said in @1 Timothy 3: 6: "not a novice, that he may not, being inflated, fall into the fault of the devil", which is pride. That is what Ananias was suffering from.
F.K.C. In dealing with this matter in discipline, not only is the sin of the thing spread out, but the great dignity that attaches to the saints as having the Holy Spirit is emphasised. Peter said, "Thou hast not lied to men, but to God;" and then they had tempted "the Spirit of the Lord". The great dignity of the position is set out by Peter's word.
J.T. That is a good way to put it. The enemy is attacking the economy, divine Persons all seen in it. It is the enormity of the sin -- not just a matter of a lie and pride in *any* setting; what was there on God's part is what the enemy was attacking; so that it is an enormous sin.
J.Deb. In contrasting this with the sin in @Joshua 7, the young man with the Babylonish garment; what is the difference?
J.T. There is similarity. The young man hid the Babylonish garment and the wedge of gold. And it was also an inaugural time; the people were entering into the land. It was a Babylonish principle, theft and deception, brought in in a subtle way as this was.
J.Deb. Joshua said, to Achan, "Give glory to Jehovah" in connection with it. How do you look at that?
J.T. Seeing he confessed it.
J.Deb. In doing so did he give glory to God?
{299}
J.T. Yes. So here: God is glorified by what happened, not only in the exposure of Ananias and Sapphira, but also in the judgment meted out, in the power to deal with evil. What comes out in Corinth is that there is one very bad case selected. There was fornication among them, a specified case which was a very bad one. It was the only one apparently dealt with at that time, whereas Paul says later that there were others that had not judged themselves. Why should that be? Why should evil continue without being judged, just as it often is today? It was the weakness at Corinth in dealing with it that admitted of all these things continuing. Here the thing is met, dealt with as it comes in, and hence no corruption resulted. That is the thing to have on our consciences, to make room for the Spirit so that there will be detection. There is much corruption because many things are unjudged among the brethren and many think we cannot deal with them. The Lord would say, I want the assembly to be recognised in these matters, the Holy Spirit is in it and the Lord is in it. The Holy Spirit must be honoured, fear must be with us as in relation to the assembly.
J.R.H. Would it show the great accuracy of Peter's discernment that he brings out the inception of the matter as being with the man when he says, "Why is it that thou has purposed this thing in thine heart?"
J.T. Sapphira entered into it, but he took the lead in it.
J.D. Do you think Peter would remember the "parted tongues of fire" that sat upon each one, and would exercise his judgment as having that in mind?
J.T. The word *fire* enters into this; the severity of the judgment, because the Spirit is God. God is amongst us, and really through the Spirit. "A habitation of God in the Spirit" (@Ephesians 2: 22); that is what the assembly is.
T.A.T. Is there any instruction in the way the
{300}
young men acted in connection with this discipline?
J.T. They were available; it connects with @Exodus 24, where the youths of the children of Israel were available to Moses; he sent them, and they acted as priests. Here the young men buried Ananias and his wife. Possibly their youthfulness may mean that they were persons characteristically ready to serve among the saints in a physical sense. It is remarkable that they are called "young men" in verse 6, not "devout men", as it is in the case of Stephen -- "devout men carried" him.
S.J.H. There are no documents in this case, but remarkable power to deal with it. That should help us in a case difficult to prove. So often cases are too difficult to prove and they go on through weakness. How can we meet that?
J.T. That is a good point to bring out. We must have proof. The Lord said in @John 18: 23, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil;" and we know no proof can be brought up that is not really truth. So it is very important to have evidence. Then there is *light*, which makes all things manifest, (@Ephesians 5: 13). As in the assembly it forces out darkness. When Judas went out it was night, the light of the Lord's presence among the disciples forced him out. That is the thing to have before us, the scope of the situation, for the Spirit is not simply viewed as working in us, He is viewed objectively as a divine Person. You are impressed that there is something wrong. The thing is not to work up anything circumstantially, but to wait. Something will happen. The Holy Spirit is there with first-hand knowledge of everything, of what goes on in our houses and businesses, and something will happen to expose us. I do not see anything else, but to take up this line. Persons with the Spirit count on God and on the Spirit to expose the thing. You are conscious something is wrong, and you want help to bring it out so that it may be dealt with,
{301}
and you *wait* on God who through His Spirit will act -- perhaps also using governmental circumstances.
J.H. The filling of the house would mean that what is contrary would be expelled.
J.T. That is right. You see how Judas is exposed in @John 12, when the house was filled with the odour of the ointment: "why was this ointment not sold ... and given to the poor?" How utterly incongruous! He dealt just with what was relative to himself, how he was regarded in the position. We are to regard Christ supremely in the assembly, but Judas is bringing in this commercial matter. It was "not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief", that is the judgment of the Spirit of God stated long afterwards -- "he was a thief and had the bag". The light exposed him.
A.N.W. @John 8 is an evidence of that.
J.T. The light forced the woman's accusers out. The Lord wrote on the ground and this exposed them.
A.B. It is the same principle with Mary of Magdala out of whom went seven demons.
J.T. That is true, the position is rendered untenable.
Ques. Is there substance in Peter?
J.T. Just so, that is what is seen here. The effect of this action comes out afterwards as the position is again consolidated: "great fear came upon all". Applications for fellowship were fewer, but their quality would be improved.
A.H.P. These features are carried forward to the address to Philadelphia. The Lord says, "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee" (@Revelation 3: 9).
J.T. They are made to worship at the feet of the assembly. It is very remarkable. God must be working in view of this, for the reference is prophetic. Indeed
{302}
in the testimonies before the authorities God is bringing out what He has here.
J.W.D. In regard to the thought of proof in cases of discipline, what about proof covering reception?
J.T. There should not be much difficulty there. I think we spend too much time in dealing with souls; the point is, Can they establish a right to the tree of life? "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city" (@Revelation 22: 14). That is the point; if they establish that right then there is no more to say, they have the same status as any of us.
J.W.D. Do you think a state of spiritual uneasiness amongst the brethren is sufficient warrant for keeping a person out?
J.T. I would be afraid of a person if the assembly normally is unsatisfied about him. He has not established his right. If one in the meeting is unreasonably opposed, that is another matter. Here the point is that the persons that would join are easily detected. It says, "of the rest durst no man join them, but the people magnified them; and believers were more than ever added to the Lord", meaning believers in the true sense of the word. I think the action of discipline cleared the air. I always observe more liberty and power in meetings immediately after the Lord's rights are asserted in discipline. And then this matter of Peter's body, the shadow: "so that they brought out the sick into the streets and put them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter, when he came, might overshadow some one of them. And the multitude also of the cities round about came together to Jerusalem, bringing sick persons and persons beset by unclean spirits, who were all healed" verses 15, 16. It is a remarkable consolidation of the position, with increased power publicly for the apostles.
{303}
READINGS ON THE SPIRIT (3)
@Acts 8: 29 - 40; @Acts 9: 31
J.T. Yesterday afternoon we considered the Spirit in chapter 5, seen there as active in the assembly, Ananias being charged with lying to Him. We were encouraged, I believe, in looking into the matter of discipline exercised in the assembly and the result of it in the apostles being brought into greater evidence; "but of the rest durst no man join them" (verse 13), but multitudes believed and were added. It was as if the attack had failed, the presence of the Spirit being recognised as in the assembly, fortifying it.
Now chapter 8 brings Him in in a very distinctive way, acting personally in relation to those who serve, especially those who preach the gospel. The Spirit in verse 29 speaks directly to Philip as having been already directed by an angel. In the earlier part of the chapter he is seen as serving with no form of direction mentioned, but later he is seen as directed by an angel, and in verse 29, by the Spirit: "the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot". Philip immediately responded and ran. It would seem as if progression in acceptance is needed with him, so that finally he is seen as "caught away" by the Spirit, as if peculiarly liked by the Spirit in his service. This comes in in what we may call the Stephen section of the book, a section affording much pleasure to God, because of men who developed in it and purchased to themselves a good degree. They made themselves extremely acceptable. Stephen and Philip are outstanding. The lesson would be how the second attack which was made had been met. Certain persons were neglected in the daily ministrations: "But in those days, the disciples multiplying in number, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews because their widows were overlooked in the daily ministration" chapter 6: 1. This was another working
{304}
of the flesh in the assembly, but the position is clearly consolidated again through Stephen's faithfulness. The apostles arrange deaconship, so that the attack is effectively met, and as I said, one great result is seen in these men, Stephen particularly, and then Philip. The section ends in chapter 8: 40. And then the attack through Saul is narrated, also his conversion, following which it is said, "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 9: 31). It is as if the Holy Spirit is especially seen as comforting, exemplifying the import of the word that is related to one of His names -- the Comforter. This section is full of this thought, the Holy Spirit as here in a personal sense in regard to service, especially that of evangelists, and then coming in to comfort after the assemblies had been disturbed by the attack of Saul. So that the assemblies, we are told, were increased.
The application now, of course, would be to the gospel service, of which there is great need, and in which there is considerable ability too. It is as if there is an incentive here to acquire a fuller knowledge of the Spirit, for He shows special interest in those who preach the gospel, and do it in a subject way; as Philip, who began first according to his own desire and ability without any special commission, and then qualified so that the angel noticed him; then the Spirit of God Himself spoke to him, personally directing him, finally rapturing him. There are three Persons in the Trinity, to whom we are baptised. We are baptised to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. We usually stress the Father and the Son, but it is necessary to bear in mind that the Spirit has affections too, and interests. We read of the love of the Spirit and the communion of the Spirit, and it is especially interesting in the service
{305}
of the gospel to become acquainted with Him in this individual way.
J.D. Would there be a touch of the governmental ways of God in bringing this man from Ethiopia to a sphere where the Spirit of God was operating?
J.T. It is remarkable that the evangelist, for such he is, is said to join him in his journey. What a wonderful man he is! This great servant is sent there first by an angel, and then directed by the Spirit as he comes near. The eunuch had been up to Jerusalem and apparently did not come into contact with the brethren, but it was his own want of attention to what was there, because there had been great activity among christians. However, he came into contact with Philip.
A.N.W. Would it be right to infer that a vessel is so pleasurable to the Spirit that He Himself uses that vessel as a vehicle to convey the word?
J.T. Heaven now has a special man, but the Holy Spirit is given particular prominence because of the increasing evangelical features and results that are developing, and is viewed as possessing first-hand knowledge of everything. A fact to be noted, too, is that the Holy Spirit did not seal Philip's converts immediately; none of them received the Spirit immediately. When the question came up, the apostles at Jerusalem took the matter in hand and sent down Peter and John, and they prayed for them that they should receive the Spirit. Then Simon said he would like to buy that power; he would degrade the Spirit. That certainly was an attack, but it was met by Peter in a solemn and overwhelming way. And heaven honours Philip now, the angel directing him to go down to the desert. He did it without a question. Immediate obedience in those who serve is called attention to; and then the Holy Spirit directs Philip.
A.E.H. Is there anything significant in the fact that he is one of seven who were selected from a quarter
{306}
where there had been murmuring? He was one of the group from which the murmuring arose, so that there seems to be a suggestion that these men being full of the Holy Spirit would themselves be free from the element of murmuring in that quarter. Some of them were Hellenistic Jews, were they not?
J.T. They were not local Jews, but from Greece, or others who spoke Greek, a sectional matter, but the Holy Spirit still had control in the assembly. These men were full of Him. The Spirit is in control, and so much in control that Stephen develops into a great martyr and Philip into a great evangelist. Stephen becomes a victim of the hostility of the Jews -- the first martyr. So that we are in a section of the greatest interest. The apostles are very little in it, save to go down to Samaria and confirm Philip's work; it is developed directly by the Spirit.
J.W.D. It would seem as if the Lord took the initiative in this. There is the angel of the Lord first. Is this the way the Holy Spirit operates in connection with the Lord's service?
J.T. It is more suggestive of distance, I think, that the angel should direct one. The Spirit is here really in relation to the gospel, which, as Peter says, is preached to you "by the Holy Spirit sent from heave", but here the angel is active. It would seem as if there is some distance, something that has to be corrected, because the Spirit immediately speaks to Philip when he is in the place to which he was sent. Immediate obedience is the point.
J.D. Do you think the angel would have in mind what is said in @Acts 8: 13, relative to Simon? "Simon also himself believed; and, having been baptised, continued constantly with Philip". It would look as if Philip was lacking in spiritual discernment not to see the kind of man this was. The next step brings in the angel of the Lord, suggesting distance and a need to obey.
{307}
J.T. It looks that way. There was something questionable there, but it was corrected. It looks as if Philip is a type of younger men who have no special commission, and yet have ability and are proving their ability; but the result does not go the whole length of what God is doing, it comes short. There is a difficulty somewhere. Other things, of course, might be said as to Samaria's rivalry of the Jews. In any case, Philip was in a somewhat questionable position; this man Simon kept on, and Philip did not seem to detect that he was unreal.
R.W.S. So that the next great man that Philip meets he does not leave until he introduces him to another world and the Man who fills that world.
J.T. Yes. Here he does not speak of "the Christ", but of "Jesus". In Samaria he preached "the Christ" and his service was accompanied by power. It says, "And Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, preached the Christ to them; and the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he wrought. For from many who had unclean spirits they went out, crying with a loud voice; and many that were paralysed and lame were healed. And there was great joy in that city" (@Acts 8: 5 - 8). Then Simon is introduced and he also believed: "But when they believed Philip announcing the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women. And Simon also himself believed; and, having been baptised, continued constantly with Philip", verses 12, 13. Did Philip go down into the water with *him*? Later he did with the eunuch, and the Holy Spirit caught him away after that. It would seem as if the Holy Spirit specially liked his way in his service to the eunuch; as if Philip was being perfected in his service.
T.S. Do you think it is important that distance is
{308}
not conveyed in the Spirit's work? "Approach and join this chariot", the Spirit says to him. Distance from the convert must be removed. The Spirit was indicating to Philip that *nearness* to one to be helped is a necessary feature, he was to join the eunuch.
J.T. Yes. It is said that he was reading the prophet Esaias. It does not say that Simon was reading any prophet, or the Scriptures at all; his business was detrimental. It is said that he was in the city using magic arts and astonishing Samaria, saying that himself was some great one. The eunuch was not saying or thinking anything like that. Evidently he was a good subject. Why did he not come in contact with the brethren in Jerusalem? Evidently he did not, and yet the Scriptures had a place with him and he is noting that they speak of a Man. "And the passage of the scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in presence of him that shears him, thus he opens not his mouth. In his humiliation his judgment has been taken away, and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth". Then he says immediately to Philip, "I pray thee, concerning whom does the prophet say this? of himself or of some other?" He was interested enough to read @Isaiah 53 and to note what was said about the Sufferer. There is nothing like that with Simon. He would not read @Isaiah 53; it would not interest him. He was occupied with his own greatness, whereas the Messiah, Jesus, as on earth was a Sufferer. The eunuch noticed this. He had never heard such a description of a man before, nor could there be any such description of any mere man; never was there such save the Lord Jesus, there was no life before or after like this.
W.L. Do you think this would also come in as help and instruction to Philip himself?
J.T. I am sure it was a help to him. If in such circumstances the preacher is not helped there is
{309}
defectiveness in him. The preacher surely should be partaker of whatever blessing there may be. Did he ever use the prophet Isaiah in his preaching in Samaria? If it was now suggested to him for the first time, you may be assured he never lost sight of it afterwards.
W.L. I was wondering if it might be possible to preach the glad tidings just as a matter of gift, without recognising the Holy Spirit? Here Philip is brought to recognise the Holy Spirit and the One of whom the Spirit would speak.
J.T. No doubt the Spirit affected him in directing him to join the chariot. We may be sure his evangelisation was in the power of the Spirit now.
J.D. Do you think he is a true son of Abraham at this point? I like what you say about his obedience. Abraham went out not knowing whither he went: "By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and went out, not knowing where he was going" (@Hebrews 11: 8). The angel did not tell Philip about the Ethiopian, he simply said, "Rise up and go southward on the way which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza: the same is desert. And he rose up and went". The angel just gave him directions where to go. The moral element would enter into it; he arose and went and found the Ethiopian.
J.T. That is right; the angel's part suggested the providential circumstances of the servant. Sometimes servants have to change their businesses on account of circumstances and that is providential, and they can be used in the new field. But usually our changes in business are grounded on personal gain. The service of the Lord is hardly first in such circumstances; the angel of the Lord could not take on that. Here it is desert, nothing at all to minister on natural lines, and I am sure that it was pleasing to God that Philip went unquestioningly.
A.B. How would the Spirit speak thus to one?
{310}
Does it involve a state of sensitiveness on the part of Philip?
J.T. I should think so; the Holy Spirit could address him. There would not be anybody else there. He was by himself, but indwelt by the Spirit, and the Spirit would speak to him in that way.
S.R.McC. The eunuch admitted that he did not understand and that he needed someone to guide him. Would that be the work of the Spirit?
J.T. It is a very good sign. He would not join the modernists and the higher critics. Notice too that he is from Ethiopia, which is remarkable; he is of the race of Ham. Would that be any check to Philip? He is evidently a great man, sitting in his chariot -- his own not the queen's. Also he is an affable sort of man, and does not resent a stranger approaching him. It says, "And Philip, running up, heard him reading". Evidently Philip was quiet, not flustered or afraid. What caught his ear was the reading of the prophet.
R.A. Would you say he was not only in the good of @Isaiah 53, but acting according to @Isaiah 55: 1, 6? "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters;" and "Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near".
J.T. No doubt he had the Spirit's word. The point here is immediate contact with the Spirit, how the Spirit can direct us.
J.W.D. Perhaps we have been considering too exclusively for the Lord's personal service in connection with the preaching of the gospel. You suggest that we take account of the Holy Spirit too, objectively?
J.T. Just so. That is what is seen here. The Holy Spirit is speaking directly to Philip. Why not be exercised about referring to Him? It is quite right to refer to the Lord, but the Spirit answers too; He is here and speaks directly to Philip and then catches him away. It is a remarkable thing that He caught him away.
{311}
J.T.Jr. Does verse 16 show that the Spirit does not act automatically? "For he was not yet fallen upon any of them". He acted Himself, not in an automatic way.
J.T. Quite so. He takes His own time. "And the apostles who were in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John; who, having come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for he was not yet fallen upon any of them, only they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus", verses 14 - 16. The allusion there is to the action at Pentecost, and is in keeping with chapter 10 where the same form is used in verse 44. He is acting, as it were, Himself, but He had not done it at Samaria and that is a remarkable thing. Why was it so?
T.A.T. Do you think the Holy Spirit fell on the eunuch?
J.T. Scripture does not say. We are in the section of lovableness, the section in which the Spirit is affected by what is transpiring. Personalities are in view, and He is showing what a place Philip had acquired with Him. I think God would expect us to read, as it were, between the lines. John says of the things which Jesus did, "the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written" (@John 21: 25). But all that is needed is there. We have to learn; as relying on the Spirit, to understand and enlarge on them. The mind of God is thus apprehended in them. In this section the Holy Spirit is peculiarly in charge, watching things, and we may be sure He would not delay in sealing the eunuch any more than the Samaritans. In due course, the Spirit was received by those among them who had believed, and we may assume that the eunuch received Him also. He was a lone believer going back to his own country and remarkably well attended to so far; and thus we may be assured that he was sealed by the Spirit in the
{312}
perfect ordering of God. He would be taken up and linked on with the great work that was proceeding at that time. The spiritual suggestion is that as Philip was taken away from him the Spirit took charge of him.
W.L. Do you think the thought of *rejoicing* would indicate that he had received the Spirit.
J.T. I do.
A.E.H. I had supposed that one was to get his directions from the Lord and that he was to utilise the Holy Spirit in the way of power to answer to the Lord's directions. Now you speak of the Spirit being in charge. This is a rather new thought to me. Would you say something about how one is to distinguish between directions from the Lord and directions from the Holy Spirit?
J.T. It is not easy to define, but it is clear that the Spirit spoke of Himself in the statement that "the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" (@Acts 16: 7). How did He convey to them that they were not to preach in Asia? And then a man of Macedonia appeared to Paul, and Paul uses the word "concluding" in connection with his request. "And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings", verse 10. Here there is no "concluding" at all; it is definite, as if another Person spoke to him: "the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot". Notice the words, there must have been some distinct articulation. Why cannot the Spirit do that? "For we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered" (@Romans 8: 26).
A.B. Do you think that as hearing the inquiry in verse 31, Philip is assured in his own soul that there is One who is available?
J.T. Yes. He does not hesitate, he becomes a guide at once, and the position becomes adjusted. The eunuch
{313}
begged Philip to come up and sit with him. This great matter has to be talked over in a sitting posture, Philip and the eunuch in the same position. Philip hears him reading and inquires as to whether he understands and the eunuch says, "How should I then be able unless some one guide me?" He wished to have a guide, and that comfortably; if you want to be helped make the person that is to help you comfortable. That is a good point. If the person is to help you, do not let him stand on the step of the chariot, invite him in. That is what the eunuch did, showing that he was a subject of the work of God; he begged Philip to come up and sit *with* him. We are told what the passage of the Scripture was, and then the eunuch answering Philip said, "I pray thee, concerning whom does the prophet say this? of himself or of some other?" Everything is now arranged for Philip to speak without distraction. It is clear that God was arranging the matter. It is arranged divinely that this man should be actually reading the Bible at that particular time; and then Philip's movements are arranged, first by the angel and then by the Spirit of God Himself in view of his joining him. The whole matter is evidently from God and hence the result.
W.L. Do you think the facts given would suggest a certain affinity between the preacher and any who are to believe the glad tidings?
J.T. It is a great matter in helping men, to remember that they are men, and that you are related to them in that way; they are always to be regarded abstractly according to the relation in which they stand to God. The word of the Lord to the apostles was, "Go into all the world", -- that is a hostile scene -- "and preach the glad tidings to all the creation" (@Mark 16: 15). Abstractly, each of us is one of these. So that the Lord says to Job about the Behemoth, "See now the behemoth, which I made with thee: he eateth grass as an ox" (@Job 40: 15). I made him with you, God says. That is, these cattle
{314}
were made on the same day as Adam and furnish a link between domesticated cattle and man, so that abstractly the preaching of the gospel should be to man as fellow-creatures, not as opposers or enemies. It is as Paul says, "for in him we live and move and exist", (@Acts 17: 28). Thus we are alongside of them. The eunuch made the way for Philip to thus draw near, and Philip did not hesitate; he sat down with him and took the opportunity given to explain the scripture, and he was helped by the Spirit of God.
A.N.W. Mr. Darby's note to that word "Ethiopian" is, 'Literally, a man, an Ethiopian'.
J.T. That is important.
A.B. Philip may have been looking for features of bondmanship in the eunuch in connection with his being a descendant of Ham. Bondmanship was evident in Philip; he was serving the man in relation to the glad tidings.
J.T. The Spirit says, "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus" (@1 Timothy 2: 5). It is a matter of God and men; whatever the race, they are all for God.
Ques. Would you say all this should encourage us to be available to men, to be on the look-out for them; not necessarily publicly preaching the gospel, but going after the individual, especially in the days in which we are living?
J.T. Quite so. You would not view anyone as necessarily hostile, but speak to a man as a man, a creature of God. Your circumstances are better than his and you would like him to come into them. Peter says to Cornelius, "*I* myself also am a man" (@Acts 10: 26).
J.C. I was wondering whether the direction of the Lord in connection with the preaching of the gospel would be found more in the Scriptures, and the direction of the Spirit would be more in the line of promptings.
{315}
I would take my directions therefore from the Scriptures, the Spirit prompting in that way.
J.T. Here the Scriptures are an evidence that it is the Spirit who directs Philip to join the man, and the point is that he is reading them.
E.F. Is not a question serviceable? Philip asks a question and then the eunuch does.
J.T. Philip asks a question first as to what he read, and then we are told what he was reading. Verse 32 is the writer of the book telling us: "the passage of the scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in the presence of him that shears him, thus he opens not his mouth". This is what Luke tells us by the Spirit of God, a quotation from the Septuagint, according to the Note, not from the Hebrew. When the narrative is finished the eunuch says, "I pray thee, concerning whom does the prophet say this? of himself or of some other? And Philip, opening his mouth ..." That is a remarkable verse, as if his time had come, and he started to enter on his spiritual service. Then he, "beginning from that scripture, announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him;" an excellent model in our service, not simply to exhaust a particular passage we may read, line by line, word by word. We should not read much in our preaching and ministry. We begin with something, and then the Holy Spirit adds and helps us to bring in other things if we give Him scope, things we had not thought of.
A.B. Does Philip have this in mind when he asks the question, "Dost thou then know what thou art reading?"
J.T. Yes, it is well put. He asks the question at the start, but is not going to confine himself to that. It is an excellent scripture for the moment. We are not told what scriptures he used in Samaria, but here it is definitely about "Jesus". Therefore it covers the Ethiopian, the Hamite. It is a question of *man*.
{316}
A.E.H. Is that one of the reasons why you do not use many Scriptures because you thus leave more scope for the Holy Spirit?
J.T. You may be hampered by too many Scriptures. You may want to get them all in. You are not preaching the Scriptures, you are preaching Christ, or Jesus. If you have too many you may not be able to treat all of them enough.
T.S. Obedience to the Spirit's word would be like gathering up substance before opening the mouth. Philip would be gathering substance as he went along. Before we go to preach we should be exercised to *have* something, some substance in the soul.
J.T. Philip had. The position in the chariot is clear. If you change the chariot to a house, or an office, with a person whom you would serve, it means that you make allowance for him. Give him some scope. It is not all your matter, it is a matter between you. So let him show himself, whether he is hostile, or whether he is ready for what you have to say. It is a matter of two persons instead of one. A man is a creature of God with reason and intelligence, which God has given him, and you recognise that.
A.N.W. Here one man shows evidence of new birth and the other has the Spirit indwelling him.
J.T. To whom am I going to speak? What is he? Let him say something. We shall see more of this in the case of Cornelius. God is not telling us that He had to do with this man before, but there is something in him that is observable. The first point is that he is reading the Scriptures. If I went into a man's office and found him doing that, it would be a fine start. God over-rules such matters, so that we shall know what to do. One great point in a Levite is to know how to do things, and Philip knew.
J.D. What place has the mind of the Levite in relation to the Spirit?
{317}
J.T. He must have a mind, or he cannot be a vessel.
J.D. A vessel is usable. Does the Spirit work through the mind?
J.T. Surely. The idea of a vessel goes back before conversion. If God intends a man to be a servant of His He has him in mind before he is born; He goes a long way back into history in view of the man being what He intends him to be. So that the kind of mind he enters into it, and all the features. God takes account of them all, and indeed provides them. When the Spirit said to Philip, "join this chariot", He was not telling him what to say. It is a question of preliminary arrangements, which we should always keep in mind; how far back preparation can go. The angels "prepared themselves" to serve (@Revelation 8: 6). This is all preparatory, and preparation is an important matter. The Spirit told Philip what to do; He spoke to him in regard to his physical movements, which implied that he had a mind, and knew what the Spirit meant. He ran, it says; that is to describe the vessel.
A.B. Is this a question of the Spirit managing our affairs?
J.T. That is the point we are getting at here, His management in a superintending way. We are to learn to be spiritual. He speaks to us through our minds. If He says, Join yourself to that chariot, it may be that the chariot is going fast; but it will have to slow down. The Spirit did not tell Philip to run, but he knew well enough that he had to run; and he had his ears ready to hear what was going on in the chariot. If there were two persons talking about politics, or the newspapers, or magazines, one would not be encouraged to address them, but this man was reading the Bible.
A.B. It would be further encouragement to find one inviting you to come into his chariot.
J.T. This would all be encouraging to Philip. The man was interested in him.
{318}
A.M. Preparatory arrangement goes on before Philip opens his mouth. You were drawing our attention to the appropriate moment at which Philip speaks. Do you think in our eagerness to present the truth there is a tendency to speak before the moment arrives?
J.T. Quite so. Philip acts as a vessel ought to act. By his mind he understands the speed of the chariot and how to get on to it, and before he actually sits down he is keen enough to notice what is being read. Then he asks this question, he knows what to do. It is all preparatory. It is not simply that I get a Scripture for my address, but I am spiritually prepared, having been to the Lord about it, and I make room for the Spirit before I actually open my mouth.
J.T.Jr. Apollos began as a good speaker, eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures. He arrived in Ephesus and was taken aside by Aquila and Priscilla, as in need of certain adjustment. A good speaker might need certain adjustments.
J.T. Quite so. The wisdom of Aquila and Priscilla is evident too. How skilfully they acted with Apollos! It does not seem as if they spoke to him where he had been preaching. It would not do to talk to a brother like Apollos in the meeting-room with a view to adjusting him. They took him to them. They would, no doubt, take him to their lodgings so that they could have a free hand with him.
R.A. It says in @Isaiah 53: 7, that the Lord "opened not his mouth". Philip opened his mouth, but the Lord did not open His. He says, "If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true" (@John 5: 31). Would this link up?
J.T. The point there is the sacrificial side of the passage, that He was a Sufferer, led as a sheep to the slaughter. It means that the Lord Jesus did not resent the treatment of His captors. They took Him and led Him to the slaughter, but He was subject, instead of
{319}
using the sword as one of His disciples did. "Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into the sheath" (@John 18: 11). But the answer to that is in ourselves. Paul says, "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (@Romans 8: 36, 37). We do not resent the persecution. That is what is meant by the Lord not opening His mouth.
T.A.T. When Philip was at Samaria he understood the Scriptures. Why was his work not perfect?
J.T. Why was it not? There was the fact. He did not discern Simon, and the Spirit is not seen as acting upon him, or directing him until in the desert. It may be that he needed the experience which the facts stated afforded. At any rate it is clear that as he proceeded he became more and more pleasing to the Spirit in the way he spoke of Jesus. The Spirit Himself presents Jesus: "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming. He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" (@John 16: 13, 14). Philip preached *Jesus* to the eunuch.
J.D. The opening of the mouth seems to be an important point in divine things. In this regard, do you think Philip answering to the Spirit would be something like the Lord in @Matthew 5: 1, 2? "But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth he taught them". The same is said of Peter in @Acts 10, and of Philip here.
J.T. Quite so. And in @Acts 15: 7 it is said, "Peter, standing up, said to them, Brethren, *ye* know that from the earliest days God amongst you chose that the nations by my mouth should hear the word of the glad tidings
{320}
and believe" -- "by my mouth", as if the believer's mouth is of special interest to the Spirit.
J.W.D. Peter "stood up" when speaking in Jerusalem, as recorded in @Acts 2.
J.T. Gift has power whether one stands up or sits down. There is power in it; I believe that is what is meant. An ordinary person could not act like this. Gift is of value to enforce the truth.
J.V. Does the action of the Spirit go further than the vision in the night? It says, "And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a certain Macedonian man, standing and beseeching him, and saying, Pass over into Macedonia and help us" (@Acts 16: 9).
J.T. Yes. It is more direct and nearer to the person addressed.
A.N.W. It is a personal matter. The Spirit would impress Philip in a personal way at this time. He quotes the words. "Approach and join this chariot". These are the words of the Spirit.
J.T. Verse 35 says that Philip "announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him". Doubtless that brought out what Jesus was to *him*. How long the preaching continued we are not told. And then it is said, "as they went along the way, they came upon a certain water, and the eunuch says, Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?" There is a man who, as going on, is hearing, taking things in and learning. He does not want his life here. The facts given here imply that he would die with Christ in view of living with Him. The Spirit was operating in his heart as the glad tidings of Jesus were being presented to him so that he would die with Him.
S.R.McC. This would show how much Philip had improved in his preaching. Simon was not prepared for this.
J.T. No. The eunuch evidently took in the truth, but Simon did not. Simon was baptised, and tried to
{321}
get power for himself, but he was not changed inwardly, while this man was. He observed water; Philip did not even propose it.
J.D. The question of baptism is reached. "And he commanded the chariot to stop;" it is not said to have stopped before.
J.T. It is just as if Philip got on to it in some way while it was going. Now "he commanded the chariot to stop. And they went down both to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised him", verse 38. We do not know who baptised Philip's Samaritan converts. Here it is a particular work, and it was done well. They were both under the power of the ministry.
A.E.H. Is there a suggestion that I might preach the Christ and leave out of my preaching the distinctiveness of the heavenly Man which fits in with the service to the Ethiopian? "His life is taken from the earth", but it did not cease to be; it is heavenly now.
J.T. The passage really means that it was His life here, what He was here in the uniqueness of that life. There never was a life like it before or since, and never will be. Of course we are brought into a new life with Him which is His present life and state, but what is alluded to in Isaiah is what was here on earth in flesh and blood. There never was another such life. It is taken from earth and it is finished. I mean of course its character including flesh and blood.
A.E.H. Philip did not go so far as to speak of the heavenly Christ to the Ethiopian.
J.T. I suppose he kept to "Jesus". Perhaps the passage would convey that he kept fairly well to the text, but enlarged on it, bringing in what happened at Jerusalem, as Peter did in chapter 2, how Jesus was put to death.
A.E.H. Ephesians refers to the sealing of the Holy Spirit, chapter 4: 30. Your suggesting that the Ethiopian
{322}
must have received the Spirit would involve the full presentation of Jesus.
J.T. He preached unto him Jesus, the glad tidings of Jesus. How could there be glad tidings unless redemption had been preached? The glad tidings of Jesus involves the gift of the Spirit. Whether Philip announced it in the gospel before I do not know, but a few years ago a good many brethren said that the Spirit of God was not a subject, or part of the gospel at all. Yet the preaching of the gospel involves the gift of the Spirit: "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 2: 38). That is part of the gospel. If Philip spoke of the Holy Spirit the eunuch did not pass that by, nor should I. I want to go the whole way and get all there is in the gospel.
A.H.P. Do you think we should understand the part that the Holy Spirit has in the matter of obeying the gospel, and in the redeemed person? It is evidence of a truly converted soul if a person obeys the gospel and receives the Spirit on the principle of obedience.
J.T. That helps with what we are saying. God gives the Holy Spirit to those that obey Him, @Acts 5: 32. You may be sure the eunuch got the Spirit.
C.R. It says he was "a man in power", in verse 27, but in verse 39 it says, "But when they came up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no longer, for he went on his way rejoicing".
J.T. "For he went on his way rejoicing", notice that. He was not downcast about it; the matter was settled. The Holy Spirit was enough for him. Christianity means that I can get along without a preacher, in that sense.
R.W.S. Is the holiness of the Spirit emphasised in Samaria? There He is called the "Holy Spirit" four times, but when Philip moves into these conditions it
{323}
is "the Spirit" twice. Is there something in that?
J.T. There is. Here it is the Person distinctively. In verse 29 "the Spirit said to Philip", but in verse 39 it is "the Spirit of the Lord;" in the original the article is left out with both Persons. In the latter verse the Lord is brought in. Still, the Spirit is the dominating thought and Philip is raptured, caught away by Him; he is affected physically by the action of the Spirit. So that he is not to be found, and the eunuch is not at any disadvantage, because the facts would show that the Spirit is in the eunuch. We must have the Spirit to come into the gain of christianity. The light would soon fade if we did not have the Spirit. It is remarkable that Scripture says, "*for* he went on his way rejoicing". He was occupied with what he had. He could not keep Philip; he could not, even if he wished to, hire him for a chaplain; the point is that he is fully furnished now. The preacher can only go so far; the Spirit goes all the way and makes him in that sense independent.
J.T.Jr. It is "his way" now, in verse 39; the individual side is stressed over against "the way" in verse 36. The preacher has to see that there is water in the way when he is preaching.
J.T. I suppose "his way" would mean that the eunuch is still the minister of the queen. He pursued the same way he had started on, and he is still to be a minister of the queen, but he is to be a christian. That is the point. He is now a righteous man, an independent man, a delivered man, not dependent even on Philip. He would understand; he does not say, Cannot you come along with me? There is nothing of that kind. The Spirit of the Lord is doing something. Philip belongs to Him, not to the eunuch. Philip belongs to the Spirit, and He indicates how pleased He is with him. There is the product of the ministry going off in his chariot, and that way is now to be illuminated by
{324}
what he has acquired. That is christianity. He has, we may say, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, @Romans 13: 14.
W.L. Would that take in our whole responsible pathway?
J.T. Yes. That is important. "Go thy way", @Daniel 12: 9. You have your matters to attend to, but you are illuminated, set up in a spiritual sense, and the whole position is illuminated. The eunuch would go back to Ethiopia taking the truth of christianity with him; we cannot think for a moment he would be allowed to go back for things to fade away. The Spirit of God would continue with the work.
F.R.C. Is there some parallel in @Luke 8: 38? "But the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying, Return to thine house and relate how great things God has done for thee. And he went away through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done for him".
J.T. That is the idea.
T.A.T. Have we evidence to show that a local assembly was started when he got back?
J.T. We have none. As I was saying, it is a question of reading into the facts, because we know that results would be even greater than are spoken of here. What our brother quoted from the gospel, the Lord telling the man to relate the great things that God had done for him, is the full thought. Christianity is what God has done. As Peter says, "Jesus who was of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went through all quarters doing good, and healing all that were under the power of the devil, because God was with him" (@Acts 10: 38).
C.R. Then "The wilderness and the dry land shall be gladdened; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose" (@Isaiah 35: 1).
J.T. Quite so. What a delightful time! What the
{325}
full resulting circumstances of the eunuch's conversion were, we are not told. Notice this word *for*, in verse 39; it is a sequential word. It means that he is going independently, fully furnished.
J.A.T. Is this to illustrate a right conversion? Sometimes souls are converted under a poor kind of preaching and they are at a disadvantage all their lives.
J.T. Yes; they never make good assembly men. @Acts 13: 52 says, "And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit". That is what the Spirit of God effects for them; that is normally what is effected. It makes good assembly men. If we are not cheerful and bright amongst the brethren we need help, the Spirit of God would make us cheerful and buoyant. Then I hope we have not forgotten the idea of being caught away. It is a remarkable thing, there is nothing else just like it. The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no longer, but he "was found at Azotus, and passing through he announced the glad tidings to all the cities till he came to Caesarea", verse 40. We are not told just how he worked, but we next find him in Caesarea: "And leaving on the morrow, we came to Caesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was of the seven, we abode with him. Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied" (@Acts 21: 8, 9). The Holy Spirit is still there, He has scope in Philip's house. It is a remarkable family side of things, four virgin daughters who prophesy. Joy and the Holy Spirit had a great place in that house. Philip never would forget that rapture. And then there is the matter of the comfort of the Holy Spirit in regard to the assembly: "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 9: 31). That is further evidence of sovereign action in view of what the
{326}
assemblies had been through, a terrible ordeal, the persecution of Stephen and Saul's attack on the assemblies throughout the whole of Galilee. Now the word is that they "were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit". That is a very important matter, to see how the Lord comes in, after we go through trial assembly-wise, to comfort us so that we should go in peace.
{327}
READINGS ON THE SPIRIT (4)
@Acts 10: 1 - 23; @Acts 44 - 48
J.T. Pursuant to what we have been saying as regards the Spirit, we may look at this chapter as presenting Him superintending the incoming of the gentiles into the economy set up at Pentecost.
A distinguished personage is in this section, as in chapter 8, which we considered yesterday, but he is distinguished, not so much because he is a Roman officer, but because he is pious. There was piety among the gentiles. This would show, without naming it, that the Holy Spirit had had to do with him. According to John's presentation of the truth, we have had nothing of new birth so far in this book, but we have to regard its presence here: "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit" (@John 3: 8). The result of the Spirit's work is clear, here, as the chapter says, "But a certain man in Caesarea, -- by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic, pious, and fearing God with all his house, both giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually" (@Acts 10: 1, 2). So that the incoming of the gentiles is not presented as though they were raw material, but as material already affected by God. We could not otherwise possibly have such a man as this; no Roman culture, tuition, or influence could effect it, but indeed the contrary.
So that we might dwell a little on the sovereign action of the Spirit seen here, not in word, but in effect, to make way for His active service in verses 19, 20 where He spoke to Peter, and told him, "Behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because *I* have sent them". The Spirit now is in charge of conditions with which He has already had to do, which indeed He had effected.
{328}
Nothing could be more interesting, for we, that is the gentiles, were, as represented in Cornelius and his company, admitted, not as crude raw material, but as persons described in this chapter, affected by the Spirit. On the other hand, viewed apart from any divine operation we were dark and without God. Indeed, @Ephesians 2: 12 says, "ye were at that time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world". But God is letting us know that He is the God of the gentiles, and that He has already been operating. Indeed as far back as the deluge, as far back as the distribution of the race in the sons of Noah, I believe God was operating in view of the western nations coming into the economy which is set up now in Christ by the Spirit. That is, Japheth denotes *spreading* in the political developments in the west, and God undoubtedly had to do with them providentially to make way for the gospel; not the everlasting gospel, but the gospel which had the assembly in mind, for that is the gospel today. Cornelius was a household man; you would hardly get such a man in the east.
A.N.W. Had you any thought as to why the Ethiopian should have heard the gospel outside of his own country and received it in a foreign land? Is it related to the movement of the Spirit at that time?
J.T. Yes. Actually the Ethiopian and Cornelius received it in the same territory, only that the eunuch was said to be one "who had come to worship at Jerusalem". I should think he was a proselyte, such as many who were at Jerusalem when the Spirit came; that is, he was in religious relation to the Jews. Cornelius is one who fears God; but he is not viewed just in this way, but also as a military man, "a centurion of the band called Italic". I think he represents the Roman system.
V.C. Why does the Spirit take up a man who is a
{329}
centurion, a man who carries the sword? How would it work out as to current world conditions?
J.T. Well, a man took up the sword earlier and was told to put it back into the scabbard; a man that was not a soldier took the sword and cut off the ear of the high priest's servant. The Lord told him to put it back where it belonged. He did not tell him to destroy it or discard it, but to put it into its place, meaning that in our dispensation we are not to use it. It is held in abeyance. This man was already a soldier and we are not told he had to give up his sword. If a man is already a soldier we are to have consideration for him; but the man who has not been a soldier, that is, Peter, is told to put the sword into its sheath. I think that is our position, an extraordinary position. We have no status at all and men generally do not understand us, but it is very plain that we are to have a certain judgment about the sword. The Lord conveyed the idea when He said, "My kingdom is not of this world". It does not belong to the world, or even to Israel; it is a heavenly thing. Therefore the Lord says, "if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence" (@John 18: 36). As those belonging to that kingdom, it is not the fighting time for us, except with the sword of the Spirit. I do not know of anything plainer than that in the Scriptures.
V.C. What about one who is a soldier before his conversion? How could he put up the sword into its place?
J.T. The Spirit of God does not pursue the subject as to what Cornelius did, but I think the military institution of the Roman Empire is recognised by Him. If a believer has part in it before he is converted, well, the matter is just left. Not only is this man mentioned as being a military officer, but one who was "constantly with him", and whom he sends with others
{330}
for Peter, is said to be "a pious soldier". Such a scripture would apply as @1 Corinthians 7: 21: "but and if thou canst become free, use it rather".
A.E.H. If you were in a country where there was no allowance for conscience, would you still maintain a conscience in regard to the sword?
J.T. I do not like to answer the questions theoretically, because we are not in the place. We are thankful God has made it different for us. Our position in the British Empire and the United States is clear. The governmental dealings of God are allied with His direct action. It is clear God had acted directly with this man and He is acting directly with us throughout these countries. He is using the governmental side, He is opening up doors to us through governmental conditions. But when you are not in the territory to which these conditions apply, it is not easy to say much. God is very considerate, and if you were in the circumstances He would make things clear for you.
J.D. Do you think the character given this man in verse 1 was the sovereign action of the Spirit of God apart from his hearing the gospel, so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the gentiles?
J.T. I think so. I think God was making a way, softening the dividing line between Jew and gentile; weakening it. He went over the wall of partition, as it is said of Joseph, "his branches shoot over the wall" (@Genesis 49: 22). It would allude to Christ's present position among the gentiles, how the wall is broken down, but overcome by God. @Ephesians 2 contemplates it completely done, and Jews and gentiles reconciled in one body to God by the cross.
J.R.H. As to the previous history of this man, it would appear he knew something of the gospel according to verse 36, "The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (*he* is Lord of all things), *ye* know".
{331}
J.T. He must have. The glad tidings had gone out. Indeed @Psalm 19: 2 - 4 says that their line went out "through all the earth". "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech and there are no words, yet their voice is heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their language to the extremity of the world. In them hath he set a tent for the sun". That is an allusion to the gospel, that it could not be hid. Paul appeals to Agrippa on the same line.
But our subject is the Spirit as superintending this matter, so that it is not a mere general report, it is personal. That is, there is a man ready to represent the gentiles; God has been working with him so that he is not raw material. He is material which God has fitted for this matter; he is a soldier, and he has a pious soldier in his household. God would say to us, You must be careful about this military matter and follow what Scripture says. One of the greatest things in such a matter is to be of one mind about it. If we are of one mind God can act for us more easily.
T.S. You were saying he was a *household* man. Would that be prominent in him rather than the soldier character?
J.T. Quite so; he was, under God, anticipating what he was coming into; he was pious. Why cannot the gentiles be pious? Can we not detect that there have been pious persons throughout the ages before christianity? Even the Jewish economy provided for strangers, involving God's sovereign work.
J.R.H. Would you get remarkable examples of that in Melchisedec and Hiram, king of Tyre?
J.T. You would, and in the magi of the east. God is the God of the gentiles and has never ceased to be that.
W.S. The household setting is important at Philippi; you have the household of the jailor especially referred
{332}
to, and the household of Lydia, and in connection with these households baptism is introduced.
J.T. Quite so. It is clear that the household was in God's mind in relation to christianity, but it did not come into evidence so much until we come to Cornelius. I believe Paul's ministry is in mind as developing the household, which should contribute to the assembly. This man is anticipating that. Our subject is the Spirit viewed objectively. We have to view Him objectively as operating in new birth, according to John's way of presenting Him; and now He is clearly operating in view of Paul. The household has a great place under Paul.
A.E.H. Is the word "pious" an allusion to the presence of the Spirit? Paul tells us there is a great mystery attached to piety, and being used in connection with these men I wondered if it was an allusion, although not named, to the presence of the Spirit there.
J.T. The word would allude to God being apprehended in some way, but it is greatly strengthened by the additional phrase, "fearing God". In fact, piety involves the fear of God, it really means that you are letting God into your circumstances. The additional word, "fearing God with all his house", is remarkable; the house is not moving without him. In @John 4 we have a household brought in with a somewhat different wording; it is said that the nobleman believed, "himself and his whole house", verse 53. That is, he himself believed first, which is the right order; and then the Spirit of God seems to stress the household by itself, as the wife and the children, and they believed also. It is not that the nobleman believed *with* his house, but "and his house", which, I believe, conveys somewhat more than we have here. What is stressed here is the influence of the centurion over his house; it is put, "Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic, pious, and fearing God with all his house". That is, it is his
{333}
matter, but they are in it with him; they are not viewed as fearing God by themselves.
R.W.S. Would the Spirit observe that he was not a careless man about early spiritual impressions received? It says, "... both giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually" (verse 2), as if he did what he could without having the Spirit of God in him.
J.T. What he needed therefore was the gospel. There was something there. God had come into his circumstances and I think the Spirit of God is putting before us this question of material already affected by God for this great matter.
J.R.H. You said that God takes account of any good there is in a man, instancing Abimelech in his integrity of heart. Would that be in line with this?
J.T. Yes. Wherever you get persons favourable to God and His people, God takes account of it. The gentiles are not so inclined naturally. @Romans 1 tells us what we are by nature; therefore if any different condition exists, it is the result of God operating. There are many instances throughout the Scriptures of persons who were affected by God. Take Oman, the Jebusite, and his attitude as to the site of the temple, something had been divinely effected in him; and there are many others like that, Rahab for instance. We must always take account of God's universal activities. Abimelech should be noted. God acknowledged integrity in his heart; he had at least the idea of fearing God, (@Genesis 20). God drew very near to him and spoke to him feelingly, saying He had withheld him from sinning against Him. He seized the opportunity of speaking to the king, telling him that He knew of the integrity of his heart as to Sarah. "And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and bondmen and bondwomen, and gave them to Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife" (@Genesis 20: 14).
W.M.T. What about Nebuchadnezzar's testimony in @Daniel 4?
{334}
J.T. That is a genuine case.
L.K. What would you say about Cornelius supplicating God continually and never having heard the gospel?
J.T. He was doing well, showing what the work of God may be without the gospel. But God says, This man must have the gospel; he must be delivered, he must be in the liberty of christianity. The case is remarkable, because it is while the assemblage was listening to Peter that the Holy Spirit fell upon them. How much the Holy Spirit must have liked that man and those gathered! He did not even wait for Peter to finish his word; He fell upon them while Peter was speaking.
J.W.D. The Lord Jesus in His own work seems often to select persons like the woman in @John 4, who was a noted sinner; but the Spirit in His sovereign, special work seems to operate in connection with material made suitable through formation having already taken place.
J.T. I should think that in the woman'' case it is to bring out the matter of wholly unaffected raw material. Hers was a long-standing case, but it brings out what can be done, how difficulties can be surmounted. Hence the Lord takes great pains with her. She is the very opposite to Cornelius.
A.E.H. I suppose in Nicodemus we find the Lord dealing with one similar to this man; new birth was evidently there.
J.T. I would say that, but not so active in its results as here. The centurion is *ready;* we do not get that in Nicodemus. It took a long time to get him out of what he was in; in @John 7 he is still seen as a member of the council. He did not move quickly, but this man is ready.
J.D. Are you stressing the importance of the work of the Holy Spirit apart from all other things, operating sovereignly in the introduction of the gentiles.
{335}
J.T. That is right, not letting anyone else in. It is clear Cornelius was affected by God because he feared Him, and not only so but he gave *much* alms, not a mere pittance: "both giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually". That is a remarkable evidence of the work of God.
R.A. Do you think his prayers would be on the line of the state of the people, and that God could take account of his prayers as one who had given much?
J.T. He is like God in giving. This is all-important; foundational in what we are dealing with, the incoming of the gentiles. The Spirit had thus created a condition in Caesarea to effect this great matter, that this remarkable incident might take place, and we should remember that. Philip too was moving in this direction; Scripture does not say he evangelised in Caesarea, but later he lived there.
A.H.P. Would this not remain in Peter's history? He would understand that he was not the initiator of the work, but God Himself.
J.T. Yes, but as to instrumentality, it is "first Peter;" Philip is subordinate. He was found at Azotus and worked along to Caesarea, but it does not say he worked in Caesarea. I suppose he linked on with Peter's work.
W.L. Is this a general principle, that the incoming of the gentiles still necessitates the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. That is what Paul stresses in Romans, that wherever God is working, whether among the gentiles or among the Jews, He recognises His own work. It is said, "If therefore the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision, and uncircumcision by nature, fulfilling the law, judge thee, who, with letter and circumcision, art a law-transgressor? For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither that circumcision
{336}
which is outward in flesh; but he is a Jew who is so inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God" (@Romans 2: 26 - 29). That is Cornelius and God is showing objectively that there is material coming into the assembly that is equal to what is among the Jews. It is a question of what is inward in a man, and what is inward in a man for God is effected by God.
J.W.D. Would you say this was special? Would you conceive of such an advanced state in connection with new birth today without the Spirit?
J.T. I would; there are many corresponding results.
A.N.W. Cornelius was not yet saved?
J.T. No, that is after you have believed the gospel of your salvation, "in whom *ye* also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise" (@Ephesians 1: 13). He had not believed the gospel of salvation, it had not been presented to him yet, but it is about to be presented through Peter. Clearly he and those gathered with him believed it, for, as the preaching went on, the Spirit fell upon them.
W.L. Would you say the work of the preacher links on with the work of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. Yes. The work of the Holy Spirit may take place in the gospel and persons be converted, as in Peter's case at Caesarea, and clearly the Spirit operated in those three thousand at Jerusalem; otherwise they would not have believed as they did.
S.McC. Do you view in new birth the action of the Spirit from the standpoint of His sovereignty as a divine Person, or as an instrumental power or agency, or both? I am thinking of the Lord Jesus in relation to creation. In Colossians He is alluded to in both ways, as acting in sovereignty in His power as a divine Person, and as the instrument, all things being created by Him.
{337}
J.T. I understand that the Spirit operates sovereignly in relation to the light. New birth is not presented as the effect of light, it is presented as the immediate work of the Spirit in a person. The Lord said to Nicodemus, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God" (@John 3: 3). The light stands in relation to the kingdom; new birth is an act by itself, so that without it "he cannot see the kingdom of God". That means he has no light at all. Before new birth he had no power to see, but now he has and what he sees is what the light discloses. Light contemplates the objective side of the truth, and the gospel is the full thought of it. So what Cornelius needed here was the gospel; he already, clearly, was the subject of the Spirit's work.
J.R.H. Perhaps that helps as to the matter of directions. Cornelius gets his directions from the angel, but Peter from the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so; with Cornelius distance is still there. He could not say, "Abba, Father", intelligently or feelingly, because he did not have deliverance. Light is necessary, too, but deliverance lies in the Spirit.
J.D. He was ready now, according to the quotation from Ephesians, for the word of the truth, the gospel of his salvation, through Peter.
A.N.W. So would new birth be indicated in the first day of creation, and the presentation of the gospel as light on the fourth day?
J.T. I think that is a good way to put it. The word is, "Let there be light", the light was caused to shine. I think the subjective work on the third day corresponds with that. We are not told what the light was on the first day. It is on the third day you have the subjective thought, that is, the earth brings forth of itself; the principle of bringing forth is there. Then on the fourth day there is the light from heaven, or in heavenly bodies regulating everything here below. I
{338}
believe it is on the fourth day you have the gospel, that is, Christ above.
S.McC. Do you view the source of new birth to be in God, as we know Him, as the power through which it is done, or do you look at the source of it as in the Spirit Himself?
J.T. The Spirit Himself, although it is God's work. One of the features of the truth which is before us is that the Spirit is God. He is no less than God: "in whom *ye* also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" (@Ephesians 2: 22). It is God here in Spirit, so that what the Spirit does, God does. Therefore when Peter gives the account in @Acts 11: 17 of what the Spirit had done, he says, "who indeed was *I* to be able to forbid God?" The Spirit had acted, Peter tells them that, which meant it was God that acted.
J.D. In our first reading you spoke of the indirect reference to the deity of the Spirit in chapter 5, which might be quoted here: "Thou has not lied to men, but to God", verse 4. Verse 3 says it was to the Holy Spirit they had lied.
J.T. That is right; and thirdly in verse 9 it is "the Spirit of the Lord", against whom they had sinned, so the three divine Persons are there.
A.N.W. The sovereignty of the Spirit is seen in the part of the verse you quoted in @John 3: 8, "The wind blows where it will".
S.McC. When the Lord says in @John 6: 44, "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him", does He have in mind new birth?
J.T. I think it is more, because it is the Lord personally set before the soul, which is by the gospel. So not only is there the work of the Comforter, but the drawing power of the Father to Christ; hence the three divine Persons are always operating in the salvation of one soul.
W.L. I was wondering how @John 16: 13 would
{339}
fit into this. It says, "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak".
J.T. The Lord is there presenting the Spirit as subject, but He is God, let us never forget that! We cannot define the Trinity. It is the Persons in relation to each other, but God is worshipped. If God is operating we cannot say the Spirit is not operating; it is by the Spirit He is doing things.
J.W. What is the force of the scripture, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work" (@John 5: 17)?
J.T. The Father is operating; I suppose that carries you back to Genesis. And now the Son having come He is working by Himself, as it were. We must always consider the context. We are reminded that divine Persons work severally, but when we have God we cannot say the Spirit is not there.
J.W. It does not mean the Father has ceased to work?
J.T. Not at all. "I work", the Lord says, but there is no thought of the Father ceasing to work.
A.A.T. In this chapter do we see the second key of the kingdom?
J.T. That is right; the first key is mentioned as used in chapter two. This is a very important transaction. There are primarily unspoken transactions evidenced in Cornelius¬ state and in the state of his house. But now the Holy Spirit comes in as a superintending Person and says to Peter, "Behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because *I* have sent them", verses 19, 20. The "I" is emphatic. We are in the presence of an operating Person, a superintending Person, but in conditions that He has already effected without announcing Himself.
H.B. Would you say how this direct speaking
{340}
compares with the ecstasy and vision in the early part of the chapter?
J.T. What things were happening! One might have said, Surely God is not in this place. But if you look at this account of Cornelius you see that God is in this place. He is not showing Himself, but the effect of His presence is there. Who effected this ecstasy in Peter? It is all preparatory. We are in the presence of one of the greatest operations of God, the incoming of the gentiles. And see what material He had! He is operating there also. So the Spirit comes in at the proper time and commands and directs Peter, saying, "*I* have sent them". Where did they come from? They came from Cornelius, but the Spirit says that He sent them.
J.D. Do you think it is possible to discern in our inward souls which divine Person is speaking and directing? Can you discern between the Lord's voice and the Spirit's voice and the Father's voice?
J.T. Very little can be said. The Spirit is the great mediatorial Operator here below. We have to allow for other things, especially the mutually relative positions the Persons have taken in the economy. The Father and the Son come down in the Spirit. He is the great subjective Operator down here, but He is more than that: He is the superintending Operator representing God, and yet Himself God. There is, however, much said in Scripture to indicate that in divine speakings the Person who speaks is to be apprehended by the hearer or hearers.
F.K.C. Is it not remarkable the amount of detail in connection with this matter? It is said in our chapter that Cornelius "saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day", verse 3. Then you get Peter lodging "with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea", verse 6; and then you get him going to the roof top at the sixth hour of the day. Do you think the Spirit works in connection with such details?
{341}
J.T. Surely; the Spirit says, "*I* have sent them". Externally Cornelius had sent them, showing the Spirit is working in an unseen way up to this point. Well, the thought for us is, are we cognisant of what we are connected with in the realm of the Spirit? He does not always show Himself but you feel His power. The whole scene here indicates it; He says, "*I* have sent them". You would not have thought it from the facts related. What do we know of this power? What has happened today? Can I trace what part the Holy Spirit has had in my history today?
J.W.D. Do you mean that you may be speaking to God or to Christ as to matters, but the outstanding way the Spirit has His place in the economy is before you?
J.T. Quite so. The Father and the Son are presented as the Persons to be addressed in the economy. At the same time the Spirit is here operating every day, and at night in the wakeful hours you can go back and weigh what has happened in your history. Our histories are recorded in heaven, and why not keep them ourselves? Why not keep our own histories? Paul says, "forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before" (@Philippians 3: 13), but he does not mean us to forget what the Holy Spirit has done in us. It is a question of going back with God and seeing what your history has been.
A.E.H. This is a remarkable thing: a man is upstairs and he gets word that there are three men at the door. That is quite definite. Are you suggesting that if we are spiritually sensitive enough we shall be ready to be used in such a transaction, as is in mind here?
J.T. Yes. Peter is presented to us here as a man available in this great matter. He was already designated as to it. The Lord says, "I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens" (@Matthew 16: 19); they are given to him dispensationally. He had said, "thou art Peter" (verse 18), meaning he could be regarded as a
{342}
spiritual individual; the thought was that he should be that concretely. In Matthew the Lord says, "thou art Peter", but in @John 1: 42, He says, "thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone)". He would be called that when the characteristic showed itself, but in the Lord's mind he was that from the outset. He is a great spiritual product, the leading man on earth at that time and capable of being used in this way. So we are on spiritual ground now and it relates to the spiritual forefathers of the gentiles. God is saying, I am having to do with the gentiles all the time -- and here is the great product of His work. He is going to take up this man to show how the keys were used by Peter; therefore what is subsequent to this brings out what a great man Peter was. It is in his own account in chapter eleven that you see how thoroughly he had come to understand it. He did not baptise these brethren, "he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord;" not *to* it, but *in* it, as if the Holy Spirit had come down. They are to be baptised *in* the name of the Lord, which involves the power of it.
J.Van. Do we not see obedience throughout this chapter? The Spirit is given to them that obey God.
J.T. It is an illustration of that. Peter himself had said, "and the Holy Spirit also, which God has given to those that obey Him" (@Acts 5: 32). These did so in a remarkable way!
L.K. What would be the character of the Spirit's special operations? It speaks of a "vision" with Cornelius, and of an "ecstasy" with Peter. What would the vision infer today?
J.T. Of course we cannot say very much as from experience, but it is clear that Cornelius was ready for the vision. He was not greatly perturbed, he did not fall down like Daniel. It says of him, "Cornelius ... saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming unto him, and saying to him,
{343}
Cornelius. But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God" (verses 1 - 4). So he is not rendered in any way helpless, he does what is just right. This is an arranged matter. When God prepared the heavens, it says wisdom was there, @Proverbs 8: 27. God has His man, He knows His man and the vision does not overwhelm him. It is right he should fear, but he is in a suitable state to take the words in and to act on them. Then the next thing is that Peter went up on the house to pray and he was hungry; "But as they were making ready an ecstasy came upon him: and he beholds the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as a great sheet, bound by the four corners and let down to the earth; in which were all the quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven. And there was a voice to him, Rise, Peter, slay and eat" (verses 10 - 13). That is, as being shown everything he also is prepared. Cornelius had been called by name, but now it is Peter, so that all the persons are suitable for this great matter. Then this great sheet is seen coming down -- what a wonderful thing! It happened three times. It is a determined matter in heaven and on earth, everything is in order so that this wonderful event should happen. The sheet comes down and goes up, comes down and goes up, comes down and goes up, and stays. Then this doubting of Peter's -- what does it mean? There was need that this vision should be pondered over. Then the Holy Spirit comes and says something to Peter.
J.T.Jr. These two men are going on the principle of what is individual. Each of them is alone in this exercise.
J.T. That is the way it stands. The two outstanding characters are Cornelius and Peter; both are being prepared for their part in this remarkable administrative
{344}
transaction. Peter had a great place, his very name shows this -- it is not Simon, but "Rise, *Peter;*" it is a spiritual name. So whatever agency and details there are, you can see it is all a divine matter; while the Holy Spirit comes in here openly, He has been in it all the time really. He is the great Operator here below, but now He is showing Himself.
S.McC. In connection with the thought of not addressing the Holy Spirit objectively in prayer, do you think we can have communion with the Spirit secretly, individually?
J.T. I think so. I think that is implied in "the communion of the Holy Spirit" (@2 Corinthians 13: 14). What is impressing me in all this is that, being in His realm professedly, we are in the realm of divine Persons; and it is stressed here what preparation there was for this great transaction. Well, now, to instance these meetings, what preparation has there been for them? God is operating in a wide field. Each of us, especially if we have to take part in them, can detect what has happened in his own soul in view of these meetings. Before such an occasion we are to be in relation to heaven day and night; not simply when we are here, but in view of being here.
A.T. Would the four days in verse 30 imply preparation? Cornelius says, "Four days ago I had been fasting". Then at the end of the chapter is there the thought of the continuing activity of the Spirit when "they begged him to stay some days" (verse 48) -- no definite period?
J.T. All that raises considerable questioning in your mind: what doubtfulness there was, and what of these agencies used, and how are days and hours taken account of? We are in time yet and God was the first to use time. He made it and He was the first to use it. We are reminded how we are to use time and what happens in time, what happens in each one in his own
{345}
history. That is a most important matter, that you follow up your own history and go back to the beginning of it. Then I suppose the end of the chapter would mean that Peter had acquired a great place in the house of this man. In the previous chapter it is said, "And it came to pass that he remained many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner", verse 43. Now he is begged to remain here. It would show the servant had acquired a great place, which was to be expected. If God is using a brother it is rare that those he serves do not beg him to stay.
J.R.H. I would like help as to the way the Holy Spirit is often mentioned with the article left out. For instance in verse 38, "How God anointed him with [the] Holy Spirit and with power;" then in verse 44, "While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word". What distinction is there?
J.T. The article is much more used in the original than appears in the Authorised Version. Mr. Darby's version usually indicates where it is left out. Its presence very often simply indicates a distinguished Person; but when it is left out before the title Lord or Spirit, this indicates what is characteristic rather than what is personal. (J.N.D., as to the Greek article, says, 'whenever a word, or combination of words, presents the *object* about which the mind is occupied, as objectively present to it, the article is used; whenever a word is merely characteristic, it is not', Collected Writings, Volume 13, page 46). So that here where it is left out it means that the anointing was the point. But in verse 44 the Holy Spirit as a divine Person is in mind; it is not God anointing them there, but the Spirit falling on them; *the* Spirit is stressed. "While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word;" our minds are directed to the Person of the Spirit, it is His action. He has been
{346}
watching the whole proceeding. The word *anointing* is not the point, it is that *He* "fell upon all those who were hearing the word", as the father fell on the prodigal. It is an energetic action which indicates His interest in them.
R.W.S. Chapter 2 speaks of Him as being *poured out;* in chapter 8 of His being *received;* but here He is *falling*. Is this the most emphatic way of the Spirit Himself coming?
J.T. I think it is. The Spirit is stressed here peculiarly; the chapter says, He "fell upon all those who were hearing the word", showing their state is in mind. Then it is said, "And the faithful of the circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that upon the nations also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out; for they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God", verses 45, 46. That is to say, the result is much the same as at Pentecost; our position in the economy is on much the same level as that of the Jews; the work of God here is similar to when they were brought in.
J.R.H. Chapter 11: 15 shows that the same expression is used, "And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them even as upon us also at the beginning".
J.T. Quite so; it is God honouring this great position that we are in. We are not a subordinate element; the full idea is among the gentiles.
V.C. Was it the action of the Spirit in two cases, those of Cornelius and the eunuch, but the direct action of the Lord in another case, that of Saul of Tarsus?
J.T. It was the Lord; quite so. There is nothing said of the Spirit in Paul's case until Ananias says to him, "And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name" (@Acts 22: 16). It is in Paul's second account of his conversion. It was in that connection that he received
{347}
the Spirit. The Lord would say, This is My man! not Peter, but Paul.
R.A. Thinking of Cornelius as an initial work of the Spirit and working around that, @Ecclesiastes 1: 6 says: "The wind goeth towards the south, and turneth about towards the north: it turneth about continually, and the wind returneth again to its circuits". Is that the way the Spirit works?
J.T. There is, no doubt, a link there with our chapter. This is one of the most important transactions in the Scriptures! Certainly the wind turned around here. Philip was in mind too, he came up in that direction; and a little while afterwards Paul was there for two years, a prisoner. It was a very important point.
V.de Z. You were speaking about the energetic action of the Spirit, as though the Spirit was waiting for Peter's words in verse 43, "To him all the prophets bear witness that every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins". It was a right moment, was it not?
J.T. Yes, *every one*.
J.H. Does the state of the subject have to do with the approach of divine Persons toward him? I was thinking of Paul, his state required the assertion of authority, to bring about subjection; whereas the eunuch and Cornelius seem to have been subject and teachable persons.
J.T. Yes; and then Paul's distinctive place: he was not first thought of just then, he was in the mind of God, separated from his birth for the service to which he was called. A light from heaven shone round about him! Did ever another man have such distinction in that sense, save the Lord Himself, who was addressed from the opened heaven at the Jordan?
J.T.Jr. When Paul went up to Jerusalem and spent fifteen days with Peter, they would, no doubt, discuss this great matter of the pouring out of the Spirit.
{348}
J.T. Fifteen days -- two Lord's days, I suppose. "I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days" (@Galatians 1: 18).
A.A.T. I notice Peter speaks of God definitely at the end, "who indeed was *I* to be able to forbid God?" verse 17. We were speaking of the Spirit having fallen upon them, but Peter brings God in.
J.T. It is God. The Holy Spirit is God down here. It is God's own action, but it is presented as the Spirit's action. It is a precious thought that we may be in touch with the Spirit in a personal way. "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (@Romans 8: 16). That is something we are to understand.
A.E.H. Is there not something to be specially noted in what these people heard? Mr. Darby gives a note in regard to "word" and "words" in verse 44; they are different. Peter was speaking certain "words", but they were hearing the "word". Does it not refer to the inwards of God, of which you were speaking earlier.
J.T. Yes. The first one in verse 44 is *rhema*, which is also used in relation to the framing of the worlds: "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (@Hebrews 11: 3). The other is *logos*, which means not only what is said, but what is in the mind of the speaker as to the matter spoken of.
N.B. "But the Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith, giving their mind to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons speaking lies in hypocrisy" (@1 Timothy 4: 1, 2). How would the Spirit speak thus?
J.T. There it would be a prophetic communication to Paul himself. We can hardly look for a word in such a definite prophetic sense now. It is similar to what is said in Revelation, chapters 2 and 3: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". But this is an *express* word.
{349}
READINGS ON THE SPIRIT (5)
@Acts 13: 1 - 4; @Acts 15: 28; @Acts 16: 6, 7
J.T. These scriptures call attention, first to the relation of the Spirit's activities to the universal service of God, the assembly being the basis or centre of operations; and then to the way in which the Spirit follows up the ministers as to the territory in which they are to serve -- or the great thought of supervision by the Holy Spirit. In connection with all this, we have the relation of the Spirit to care, the care meetings and decisions reached and executed in assembly. The Spirit is viewed in chapter 15 as operating: the apostles and the whole assembly operating indeed by themselves, but the Spirit joining in personally to endorse their action. There are other instances of the Spirit's sovereign activities in the book which we have not time to look into, save to call attention to the way in which He spoke to the apostle Paul about his own service, as it says, "the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and tribulations await me" (@Acts 20: 23). Also, when He made the elders at Ephesus, He constituted them overseers of the assembly. You can see, therefore, how wide the subject is and how it enters into every phase of the economy in which we are. It is needful to look at the assembly in chapter 13 as the centre of the Holy Spirit's operations, and to observe how it was formed, as the result of the services of Paul and Barnabas in the conditions described. "Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was there, prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" (@Acts 13: 1, 2). The service of God was progressing in the assembly when
{350}
the Spirit said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", and then they were sent forth. The expression, "They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit", shows very definitely the operations of the Spirit covering universal service, and centering in the assembly.
A.A.T. Have you any thought as to why it is "Barnabas and Saul", and not Saul and Barnabas?
J.T. I think the Spirit is speaking of conditions as they then stood. Barnabas evidently had the first place in the minds of the brethren, but Saul, or Paul, came into the first place very quickly. I think it is to show how brothers may be developed and excel each other in love and ability and energy.
R.W.S. All through, missionary service is from the assembly by the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Well, it is clear that this is the basis of it. This passage has a great place now, because it is wholly set aside in the public way of doing things. Missionary service in christendom is carried out on a different principle, so that we are helped in going back to this passage as to it.
J.D. Would this in any way affect the sovereign action of the Spirit in new birth? Does He still hold that place of sovereign work in souls before they come into the assembly?
J.T. I think so. The work as we have been touching on it in chapters 8, 10 and 11 is mainly carried on by persons who were scattered. The assembly is not much in evidence as the basis or centre of operations. I think the Spirit waited for the formation of Antioch to show what could be effected, how that in a gentile city there should be such favourable conditions, perhaps exceeding in this sense the conditions at Jerusalem. We have no such statement as this in relation to the assembly at Jerusalem. The selection, the setting apart of two men in the assembly as it is functioning in the
{351}
service of God, and then the sending forth, are to be carefully noted, remarking that the action of sending them forth was not by the assembly, but by the Spirit *in* the assembly.
A.N.W. You were pointing out earlier the mutuality of the services of divine Persons, and while emphasising that of the Holy Spirit, it is striking here that they are ministering to the *Lord*. I suppose that is the Lord Jesus. Would it be in ministering to the Lord that the Spirit speaks?
J.T. Yes, though it is a question whether the term *Lord* is not inclusive of God. It would be right to regard it as applying to Christ, but it is a question of whether the service is not Godward. Sometimes the word *Lord* is used in that connection, but in any case it would be right to use either.
J.W.D. Do you think the confirmation of any desire to serve in a special way comes to one as in the assembly rather than as individually before God?
J.T. Well, I think it is a question of what the Spirit is doing, whether these men had it in mind to be missionaries or not. I think they would have in mind what the Lord had said to Saul earlier, that he should "bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel" (@Acts 9: 15). Whether they had that definitely in mind or not, the Spirit of God is saying that He has two men there that He wishes to use. He is not taking them up in their own houses and telling them to go forth, but it is while the assembly is functioning, ministering to the Lord, that He says, "Separate me now", as if the time had come for such an action; that the assembly was in such a state that it could be thus used. Whether the exercises of Barnabas and Saul agreed we are not told, but no doubt they were both concerned about this matter. They had been working together, they were evidently fitted to work together, and the Spirit says,*now*. It is not at a care meeting, but at a meeting for
{352}
the service of God; the service is going on, as if the relation is very close between the ministers¬ going out and heaven.
S.McC. How could this take form practically in our day?
J.T. No doubt the thought would be that brethren who seek to serve in a general way might have the confidence of the assembly, that the Spirit might speak to the saints as to them. These brothers were serving before, serving here for a whole year together, but now they are sent out in a universal sense and the assembly is brought into it. I think the Spirit is stressing the importance of the assembly, what it was in the divine economy now becoming evident in a definite setting. We do not see it just so clearly heretofore; it is as if God waited for these two men to set out the thing as He would wish to have it set out.
J.R.H. Would the excellent condition of things in Antioch have a bearing on this matter? Evidently it was something like Corinth, enriched in doctrine and knowledge.
J.T. Yes, but it would be more than that, because they were actually functioning. Whether they had ever functioned in this way in Corinth is questionable. In the first two verses here they are proceeding in the service, and the persons are mentioned as distinguished in it. No doubt the secret of this is found in chapter 11 where it is said, "And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called christians in Antioch", verse 26. The service of Barnabas and Saul in this assembly was remarkable. The *crowd* would gradually merge into assembly formation. The word *crowd* does not denote such formation, but it is developed, so that they are spoken of as an *assembly* in chapter 13. The assembly involves real formation, and it became evident due to the work of
{353}
these two men; so that the Spirit is clearly honouring them in asking that they be thus separated.
J.T.Jr. Do you take it that these five were gifted men?
J.T. I would think so. It says, "prophets and teachers", and then the names are given, Barnabas being mentioned first and Saul last. I think the clause "as they were ministering" ought to be noted, as it shows that the service was proceeding, and was so pleasing to the Spirit that He intervened just then.
J.H.Sr. Please say a word on verse 3, "Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go".
J.T. That is the next thing, and after the Spirit had spoken it was a suitable attitude for those that were there. But I think we ought to rest in the pleasure that the Spirit had in the situation as it was. God is bringing in instances of His operations at the beginning and one after another is pleasing to Him, so that now there is assembly formation and it is functioning. It is not a special meeting called for the purpose of separating these two brothers, or a fellowship meeting for them, but the assembly is functioning and the Spirit is calling attention to it. How pleased He is with it!
J.H.Sr. It is not ordination, it is simply identification.
J.T. It is simply identification. Laying on of hands is just that; any ordination there is *by the Spirit*.
W.J.C. In what way do you think the Holy Spirit spoke audibly in this instance?
J.T. Through some brother no doubt, but that brother is not distinguished. The Spirit is calling attention to Himself as operating in this way, having conditions such as are stated. He is telling us that He takes note of conditions in a meeting like this; the local conditions are of prime importance.
W.L. Would you say that these two brothers had proved themselves locally at Antioch?
{354}
J.T. Surely. For a whole year they worked together.
A.N.W. Would the last statement of the Spirit in verse 2 -- "for the work to which I have called them" -- be a call of which they would severally be conscious?
J.T. I think so. It might refer back to some personal communication that they had had from the Spirit. It was already an existing fact, I should think, but now the assembly is called upon to separate them. It was to be an action of theirs.
A.E.H. No doubt the operations of the Spirit would be so smooth and accurate that the local conditions in regard to the service of God would not be seriously disrupted.
J.T. Clearly there were enough to carry on. The Spirit would not dislocate a local company by taking gifted persons from its midst; He would provide for that. There were sufficient to carry on -- an important matter. There were three out of five, and probably others.
A.A.T. "And as they were ministering". What meeting would that be?
J.T. The Lord's supper might have entered into it. Clearly it was service to the Lord, and whether service is to the Lord personally or to God, still it is Godward. At this point the Spirit interrupts. He had interrupted Peter's address too, in chapter 10. It is a remarkable thing, but He has a right to do that. I would not like to interrupt a brother's address, but the Spirit of God has a right to do so. He fell on the hearers as Peter was preaching. Now He intervenes and says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul".
R.W.S. In Philip's case we have the way of the Holy Spirit with a Levite, in rapturing him; then in Corinth we have His ways in household conditions; but this is the top note, His service in the assembly.
J.T. Just so. This is the most exalted position, the divine economy operating in a local company.
{355}
L.K. Is fasting necessary for the Spirit to have opportunity to operate in this way?
J.T. Well, that is the general thought. Fasting makes room in us for God. God operates to make room for us, but there is also this matter that enters into our inquiry, that we make room for divine Persons.
S.McC. There is an expression current amongst us, in referring to certain ones leaving their employment to serve the saints, that they have 'gone out in the work', as though it would be a distinguishing mark over against those who are still in business. Do you think that expression is right?
J.T. Well, it is likely to be too formal, because we know Barnabas and Saul did very well before they were formally sent out, and others did too. Even after Paul was *sent out*, as we say, he worked with his hands, so that we cannot be too set. He worked with his hands at Corinth. How long he did it, whether all the time he was there, we do not know, but in any case he did it; and he did other things of that nature too, as he tells us in @1 Corinthians 9. Paul went without things instead of saying he must be provided with everything he needed; he waived that right, although he claimed that those who preached the gospel should live by the gospel. We cannot insist upon the responsibility of the saints to care for us if we say we are out in the work.
J.D. The position seems to be guarded; it says, "Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go. They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed away to Cyprus" verses 3, 4. It would look as if the Holy Spirit would guard the sending; He was the Operator here.
J.T. That is good. We often assume that the assembly has properly supervision over the brethren in relation to their service. It should be repudiated. The assembly has not jurisdiction over a servant as
{356}
such; all that is said here is that they laid their hands on them, showing identification with them. But the Spirit *sent* them forth, verse 4.
F.K.C. In connection with Saul, the Lord says to Ananias, "Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings" chapter 9: 15. How would that work in with this matter of being sent forth by the Holy Spirit?
J.T. That was simply to adjust Ananias. It was not for Ananias to inform the assemblies that the Lord had said that to him. Ananias had no such place as that; the Lord was simply adjusting him so that he might be of help to Saul. The service alluded to is formally set out here, but Paul had been serving a good while before, though not separated by the assembly. This is properly the beginning of his service, a very important matter. Earlier his service corresponded with the Lord's service before John the baptist was cast into prison.
A.A.T. John went along with them, but he was not sent forth.
J.T. This is not John the apostle, it is John Mark. There was a company of them according to verse 13, "Paul and his company". That would hardly do now; still, it affords light for us.
H.B. Would you say why two are sent forth and not one?
J.T. That is another principle. One could be sent forth, but the general principle in service is two. The apostles were sent out two by two, and so were the seventy; and now Barnabas and Saul are sent forth together. @Ecclesiastes 4: 9 says, "Two are better than one", but the point is to get two men who can work together effectively.
R.W.S. Would this help in the question of the present restriction in the service because of conditions in the world? Would you bring the Spirit into the
{357}
restrictions, such as those of the services over the oceans?
J.T. I think that being here and subject, one would regard that as the government of God, which is another line of thought. God causes restrictions, but it is another of His departments, as it were; it does not belong to the christian economy. Regulation of the world is not part of the christian economy; God has reserved that to Himself, as we saw yesterday in regard to the times and seasons which the Father has reserved in His own authority. The Spirit is operating *within* that overruling providence of God. Therefore if there are limitations, as at present, it is on account of the government of God. The Spirit would give us to understand that we are restricted to a certain extent and He would be with us in what we are doing. The situation is just to be accepted; the Spirit accepts it. However, what we have in chapter 16 shows that in another sense the ways are open in these days. It seems there were not many wars from the time of the Lord's birth down to the apostles¬ period of testimony, and that the great Roman system which was marked by the roads or *ways* was available and the Lord took account of that. Therefore the Roman system was a provision in the ways of God for the gospel. In these days we have wonderful provisions, ships, trains, planes and motor-cars. Nevertheless we are restricted, especially as to oceans, and the Spirit would say to us that that is the government of God; in truth our intelligence teaches us that. But our way is not wholly shut up, He gives us scope. Paul was shut up by a prison for four years, but the Spirit was not limited; "the word of God is not bound" (@2 Timothy 2: 9), so that we are never driven to the wall.
S.J.H. Is there any reason why two brothers should not seek to move together in this way today?
J.T. It is a question as to whether you could work together in this broken state of things. The Lord has
{358}
chosen us and success is achieved by those who go out severally; but there is nothing to hinder two going together, we have seen it in our time; there have been many instances, but not lately. The point is for us to get light and to see whether we can conform to it, because we are limited and the limitation may prevent the light being carried out; but we are not tying our hands on that account. Whatsoever your hands find to do, do it. The lesson for the moment would be in local companies among which brethren are able to move about, receiving support from them, where there is support for a brother who is a comfort to them, and where on the other hand those of us who are labouring would commend ourselves in such a way as to deserve support. Evidently these two brothers had earned support in serving a full year in this way.
Paul is put first in verse 13, "Paul and his company", which would seem as if the Spirit of God had put him forward. But in @chapter 14: 1 we have, "it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue ... and so spake that a great multitude ... believed", which would look as if they both spoke well. They were together. So it was with Peter and John at the beginning, at the Beautiful gate; they could say, "Look on us". There was something there to be seen in these two brothers. Here the point is that they could *speak* well and the result was largely because of that.
J.R.H. I wondered as to the lead in speaking with two working together.
J.T. It is clear that Paul himself worked at Corinth with two other brothers, Silvanus and Timotheus; he says, "... the Son of God ... has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)", @2 Corinthians 1: 19. That is remarkable. Possibly Paul listened to these two brothers preaching.
W.L. Do you think more might be accomplished by two or three brothers going together?
{359}
J.T. I do not know. The present circumstances seem to warrant just one going alone. It is a small state of things and we are very limited. I do not know that they would stay long together as things are. Servants working in pairs were more needed in pioneering and inaugural times, because of the importance of *witnesses*.
W.L. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
J.T. That is a good point. The Lord said as to the law of witness that the Father bore witness with Him as to His service, @John 8: 16 - 18. I believe the exercise in our localities should be to make the current services more effective by support and fellowship extended to those who are serving. I think there is more than there used to be, but it is a prime thought. It is not a secondary thought to consider for what is current in the way of service; in the Scriptures the Levite comes before the poor in the distribution of material things.
E.F. Referring to our brother's remark as to those out in the work, sometimes there is more hesitancy in ministering to those who are also labouring at their own work than to those who are out altogether.
J.T. It is less so than it used to be. *Levite* is a word that relates to the assembly. The Levite should come first in our calculations; his needs are not a secondary thought, they come first. This passage is to show that they are a prime thought now in the minds of the assembly. The Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul". Two men are before the brethren in a first-rate way, and they go back to them after their labours are completed. It says: "... thence they sailed away to Antioch, whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled" (@Acts 14: 26). Evidently they did not lose ground among the brethren while they were away, for in the next chapter they were selected to go up to Jerusalem about the matter of circumcision.
{360}
A.A.T. Apparently *the work* to which they were called included only this one missionary trip, because later we find they did not continue on together.
J.T. But they *finished* the work, a final thought; "... the work which they had fulfilled", it says. That is, the matter is finished; that particular work is finished.
W.L. Would you say that the principle of laying on of hands is important?
J.T. It just means identification with the brethren in their work; but you would not think of brethren going out without it. It is for us to see that they have it; but if they cannot have it, then it is for them to look into the matter and find out whether they are really sent or not. But we must never assume to have control over the ministers.
A.N.W. Is the laying on of hands and letting them go on the part of the assembly as a whole, or only of the three pre-eminently involved in it?
J.T. I would think the whole assembly would be involved. It would be done representatively. They just *let* them go, implying that they did not *wish* them to go. Some might think, I am glad they are going because I shall have more scope when they are gone. But they "let them go" with their commendation and identification; the Holy Spirit is sending them out.
A.E.H. When you speak of the assembly in this sense, is it the local assembly?
J.T. Yes; that is the only way it can be looked at. The assembly at Antioch was never a metropolitan assembly. There never was a metropolitan assembly except at Jerusalem, nor ever will be until the new Jerusalem comes down, "our mother;" that is now the only metropolitan assembly.
A.E.H. It would be difficult to get the assembly in a broader sense to lay their hands on the brethren.
J.T. There is no need of that; but it is important to
{361}
have the light of the thing in whatever little way we can make it work.
J.D. Do you think the apostle would bring the Romans into this that we are speaking of now? He says, "I hope to see you as I go through, and by you to be set forward", (@Romans 15: 24). Would he be counting on their helping him forward in his service?
J.T. I think so; I think he would make Rome a basis for his operations in moving westward. That is the principle. He was then, I suppose, in the Corinthian region, but his settings out would not be all from there; the universal care of things would be in his mind. Rome would set him out again to send him forward to Spain, that is the way he looked at it. He never really reached Spain so far as we can see, because he was taken as a prisoner to Rome.
A.A.T. Do you think it is a good thing that the Levites report when they get home?
J.T. Well, we want to carry all this light, yet we have not got the assembly as the vessel of administration as it was at the beginning. The thing is to be humble and simple about it. Conform to the light as far as is possible with divine support. *We* have no such assembly as Antioch; but still, if you do come back from a long trip it is good to tell the brethren something of what you have done. God is showing us here the relation between the assembly and the ministers. They are universal.
T.S. Do you think such a report would work out happily, not only in contributions called forth, but in the meeting for prayer as to the work?
J.T. Just so. That is very important. This sending forth by the Holy Spirit is a beautiful matter. How effective the ministers were when the Spirit was brought in in any way, as in the last verse of chapter 13! The disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit. This is the fruit of their work. To follow up this thought in chapter 16, it says, "And having passed through
{362}
Phrygia and the Galatian country, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia, having come down to Mysia, they attempted to go to Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them", verses 6, 7. These are remarkable statements. First the Holy Spirit forbade them to speak the word of God in Asia, meaning the province of Asia, not the continent. The Holy Spirit would not let them: how can you work that out? It is to bring out the activity of the Spirit, His activity negatively, hindering you from going to a place, not simply by physical circumstances, but by the direct action of the Spirit Himself. Chapter 16 shows how.
J.T.Jr. Does Eleazar's position in Numbers and throughout illustrate the Spirit's oversight? That is the word used in connection with him.
J.T. Yes; he was the prince of the princes of the Levites. That sort of thing was working even in Aaron's time. It would suggest the Spirit as here; of whom Eleazar is a type moving down here amongst us -- operating amongst us.
A.A.T. The Spirit would know what was going on at Philippi.
J.T. Surely. The two restrictions here are to show that the Spirit is thinking of the assembly, and the territory which would yield most for the assembly. Persons pass over this matter as nothing, but, it is something. Why should the Spirit of God be occupied negatively in Asia, saying you are not to preach there? Later there were seven assemblies in Asia, but He is saying that Paul is not to work there just now; that is the first thing. "Having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia, ... they attempted to go into Bithynia", and they are blocked again; not by a world war, but by the direct action of the Spirit. So that we may be restricted by the Spirit Himself as well as by war conditions. That is a matter worthy of attention.
{363}
A.H.B. What distinction would you make between the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus?
J.T. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit Himself here, spoken of relatively in the presence of corruption. *Holy* implies that. But the Spirit of Jesus, as we were alluding to it earlier, would refer to manhood in Europe. Some might think that is stretching the thing, but I do not think it is. Manhood in Europe is an important matter with God. The disposition of the posterity of Noah is no accident; the book of Genesis shows that the distribution of the sons of Noah is under God. Japheth is in mind, his name means *spreading*. Japheth is the great colonising race extending westward, and I believe the Spirit of Jesus means that it is the man, Christ Jesus, that is to be worked out in the western world. I believe that is what is meant by this; that the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. He does not tell them what to do; it is a negative setting. Do not go there, He says; it is for you to find out where you are to go.
Then the next thing is a vision appearing to Paul in the night. There was a certain Macedonian man, notice that. I think he should be compared with "the Spirit of Jesus". The classics would say Alexander was that man, but it is not Alexander at all. It is the Man Christ Jesus who is in mind, and the men that He is sending are like Himself. So this man, it is said, is standing and beseeching Paul to pass over into Macedonia and help them. The Spirit is not saying this, it is a vision.
Now the servant has to sit down and pray about this matter. What does it mean? It says, "... we sought to go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings". "The Lord had called us", as if it were the Lord Himself now who was dealing with the matter. It was the Man, Christ Jesus; the Spirit of Jesus. It is the Lord with authority. He had called them, as the word is, "concluding
{364}
that the Lord had called us to announce to them glad tidings". So that "Having sailed therefore away from Troas, we went in a straight course to Samothracia, and on the morrow to Neapolis, and thence to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, a colony", verses 11, 12. The word "colony" is remarkable; the colonial idea is introduced and has had a great place in the whole history of Europe up to the present moment. The British system especially represents it.
A.A.T. The first person they come into contact with is a woman, not a man.
J.T. That is the next thing; but this is a definite matter, that the Spirit of Jesus disallows them to go to a certain place. Then there is the vision of the Macedonian man. Who that man was we have to consider later, whether the jailor or some other; but the Philippian assembly certainly bears the character of Christ. It is to that assembly that the apostle speaks of "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ". The Spirit of Jesus Christ would produce men like Jesus.
J.R.H. All the assemblies of Macedonia are well spoken of.
J.T. It is as you see today: in some places a great deal for God and in other places nothing. But we must be attentive to the Spirit, even negatively; there may be something going on in a provisionary sense in your mind and you might say, I never thought of that; and then it came to my mind to do so and so. Well, that may have a vague correspondence with the vision that Paul had.
J.D. Would the Spirit of Jesus be identified with the thought of manhood in these men?
J.T. That is what I was thinking; the Spirit of Jesus Christ; a good supply of that. What exercises Paul must have had! It was a very exercising time because they were passing over into another continent. The turning of a wall has to be strengthened; we get
{365}
that in the Scripture. Now this is something like that. It is remarkable what these ministers do as a result of the Spirit's forbidding, and then of the vision.
R.W.S. This is a large matter, not like the little book which I think you have alluded to as being the history of Europe. This great matter has to do with Europe and its outgoings.
J.T. I think it includes the colonies of the European countries, especially this country. Up to the last fifty years this country was under a certain amount of suspicion among the brethren, and perhaps rightly so, but I think God has come in and shown how the work will proceed in a small way on the principle of these verses we have just read. The Macedonian man is a man according to Christ, and such men being developed in this country, where the man after the flesh has had such a place, is a triumph for God.
J.D. Would a colony suggest the thoughts of equality of rights? The footnote reads, 'Where the citizens had equal rights with those at the capital'.
J.T. That is another consideration, they had citizen rights. We want citizen rights of a heavenly sort. Territory does not affect our citizen rights at all, it is a question of the calling of God wherever we are.
Now the final thought is in chapter 15, alluding, we might say, to the care meeting. Of course this is a very great thought, a metropolitan thought which we cannot have now. It is a question of the assembly at Jerusalem, (see verses 22 - 28). That is, there is a decision reached and now the question is whether the Spirit is with it; and He is. It is remarkable. "It has seemed good", it says, "to the Holy Spirit and to us". Undoubtedly the whole proceeding described earlier involved the Holy Spirit Himself.
J.R.H. How would you arrive today at the sense of the Spirit's approval in the care meeting?
J.T. It is a great exercise. This chapter shows that
{366}
the action is from the apostles and the elders and the whole assembly, the Holy Spirit joining in. Therefore it would be a question of how the brothers treat a matter in care; whether they see to it that a good spirit prevails, because, if there is a contentious spirit, you hardly realise that the Spirit of God is there at all. It is very important to have the sense that the Spirit is there, you would be sensitive to that; argumentation precludes that. If things are right we feel as we proceed that we have feelings in keeping with the Spirit of God. So here Paul and Barnabas were allowed to speak about the work of God among the gentiles, which would be a very encouraging matter. It would be most interesting to hear Paul tell of what God did through them in different countries, and Barnabas standing up and confirming it. The apostles and elders were gathered together to see about this matter, and after much discussion Peter stands up and speaks authoritatively, recalling what we had in chapter 10, that it was through him the gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and that God should obtain a people from among them. Then we have the narration by Barnabas and Paul, and finally James stands up and says, 'my sentence is ...' Is there a wise man among us? What can we do in the care meeting without a wise man? It is not a long argument here, but someone is able to say what carries the mind of God. He says, My sentence is ..., and then he quotes from the prophet Amos and his statement is accepted. Then the assembly is brought in and the Holy Spirit too. How can we tell that the Holy Spirit is brought in? It is by the feelings you have; you get impressions from the Holy Spirit that what is being said at the care meeting pleases Him as you make room for Him. It is the state of the saints that is involved.
A.H.P. Would James¬ action encourage the brethren to bring their Bibles to the care meeting?
J.T. I think it is good to have them.
{367}
A.N.W. Does the expression *seemed good* involve that the matter was not followed on too rigidly?
J.T. I think that is good to ask. It fits in with what we are saying about the state of our souls; it is when we are fasting, making room for the Spirit through fasting, that we get impressions as we go along. What the brethren said was right and they reached the right conclusion; then the whole assembly is brought in, and the Holy Spirit endorses what is done. I believe the idea is that the state of the brethren being right in dealing with a matter, we are made conscious as we proceed that the Spirit is with us.
Ques. Will you say a word as to fasting?
J.T. It is self-judgment, disallowing what interferes with the Spirit. It implies abstention from food or other things in themselves good, but abstained from for spiritual advantage. Ceremonial abstinence as to meats, and what is commonly called prohibition, have hindered christians from fasting in the true or scriptural sense, but disregard of it, or the spirit of it, causes spiritual damage. *Dwelling* means place or scope made for Him.
{368}
FATHERHOOD (1)
@Genesis 3: 20, 21; @Genesis 4: 25, 26; @Genesis 5: 1 - 5, 6 - 8
J.T. The apostle's remark to the assembly at Corinth, that there are "not many fathers", is in mind, also the thought that there should be more than there are *now*. So the proposal is to look at fatherhood as seen in the book of Genesis. The facts we have of fatherhood in the antediluvian world do not afford us as much material for our subject as those recorded as happening more immediately after the deluge, particularly those mentioned in relation to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Fatherhood has a leading place in the instruction of Joseph, too; but there is enough in the section before us now to help us as to the features of fatherhood which are always needed among the saints.
There are two ideas in the New Testament connected with this subject which should be specially noted: one in John's ministry -- fatherhood conveying growth in the family of God. John speaks of it in his first epistle; to it is attached the knowledge of "him that is from the beginning", meaning that they know Christ as seen from the beginning of His ministry, and so are mature; for the fulness of fatherhood was in Him. He is spoken of in this way, as the "Father of Eternity", or the 'Father of the age', (@Isaiah 9: 6). He exhibits fatherly qualities with His disciples. Then in Paul we have the second idea connected with fatherhood involving a model. He says, "For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers" (@1 Corinthians 4: 15). He goes on to say that he has begotten them in Christ Jesus by the gospel, meaning that he was not only an instructor, but the progenitorial idea was in him. He begat children. That is, there were definite results from his ministry, constituting him a father in that sense. I thought that Adam and Seth might be looked at now. Adam introduces the parental thought very definitely in
{369}
naming his wife Eve, "because she is the mother of all living". Fathers have that in mind, persons in the family who are living, marked by what is living; and now God takes account of that and clothes the thought in Adam and Eve. God is, as it were, encasing the great idea, the great thought in Adam and Eve by suitable clothing.
A.E.H. Do you think the prime requisite in connection with fatherhood is that there is subjectively that which is able to receive divine impressions?
J.T. That is, I am sure, a thought of great importance in the subject. So that divine thoughts come out from Jehovah Elohim to Adam; and Eve would have part in these thoughts, and hence the ultimate development -- a living state of things.
A.R. Would it be right to say that you get the historical commencement of creation in @Genesis 1, and the moral commencement in chapter 5?
J.T. I think so. Chapter 5 is worthy of that. It is a book -- "the book of Adam's generations". The time is now come to represent things, and Adam is set up on moral rather than on creative lines, although the latter is involved; it is a question whether a brother or sister has his or her name in what corresponds with this book; a very important matter.
C.A.M. Would you say Adam calling his wife's name Eve was a matter of faith based on what God had said?
J.T. Yes. God had said the severest things to Adam and Eve, as seen in the verses previous to this. He had said to Adam, "cursed be the ground on thy account; with toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken. For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return". You could hardly get a
{370}
severer statement, using the word *dust* as to the material out of which he is made instead of *clay*. Now immediately afterwards we have this statement, "And Man called his wife's name Eve; because she is the mother of all living" -- the seed out of which something is to develop; Adam referring here, not to what God had just said about himself, but to what He had said about *Eve*, that her seed should bruise the serpent's head. Adam selected, as it were, and received into his mind, the true seed of God indicated in what God had said to the serpent. Of course everything that He said, to the devil and to Eve and to Adam, was the word of God; but in the ministry of the word there are things that are especially intended for us and the point is to get them. "Accept with meekness the implanted word" (@James 1: 21). The word is received into the mind, grafted into the mind, received into honest and good hearts. Adam evidently received what God had said as to the woman's seed into his heart and he thought of that word instead of the dust that God had just mentioned.
A.E.H. The impressions he received previously from his wife and from what was around turned out to be only corrupting. I suppose the great lesson for him to learn was not to receive impressions from what was around; these things were to stand in a disciplinary setting, but he was to receive his impression from above.
J.T. Eve listened to the devil, and what the devil said to her she passed on to Adam, bringing about terrible results -- sin. But now God comes in and speaks and there is seed in the word that is spoken. So that we have to take heed as to what we hear; we hear from many, but if we listen to any that are on natural lines the result will be death. If God comes on the scene and speaks, there is the incorruptible seed of the living and abiding word of God. I believe that is the point; it is life. Adam took notice of what God had said about his wife and called her Eve. God did not tell him to do
{371}
that, he did it of himself, showing that he was affected by what God said.
C.A.M. Faith seems to grow on that principle, of the seed being true to itself. This seed being there brought forth from Adam this remarkable title, because he could hardly have judged by appearance in making this utterance.
J.T. It is clearly the word of God. This is a very important principle right in the forefront of our subject. In this matter of fatherhood very much lies in impressions received from God.
J.W.W. Would there be a link with the scripture Peter gives us as to "being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the living and abiding word of God" (@1 Peter 1: 23)?
J.T. That, as we already remarked, is the idea exactly. So that we have the thought of a "wholly right seed" which is the product of the word of God.
J.W.B. Would Job be helped by the Lord in connection with fatherhood in chapter 39? He speaks of the ostrich, referring to the feminine side in connection with her warming her eggs in the dust; with the eagle he speaks of the masculine side, alluding to his nest on high and his young.
J.T. Yes. God speaks to Job, using the lower creatures to convey His thoughts; so that the impression of the eagle would be very different in most minds from that of the ostrich. God Himself uses the eagle to symbolise His care for His people, saying, "I have borne you on eagles¬ wings and brought you to myself" (@Exodus 19: 4). In @Deuteronomy 32 He again brings the eagle in as making a nest for her young.
A.S.B. In @Genesis 3: 7 "they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons", but these afforded no covering for the guilt which God exposes from verse 9 to verse 19; and then in verse 20 we have the position which is answered to by God clothing them in verse 21.
{372}
J.T. Yes. The clothes involve suggestions that Adam and Eve were to receive into their hearts, not only the word in their hearts, but they were clothed. It says that God made them "coats of skin, and clothed them". There is the idea of tailoring, and the product is clothing so that we assume that the clothes fitted, not only in quality, but in cut. All that enters into the household, into parental thoughts.
H.B. Is it significant that the parental name of God is used in this matter?
J.T. You mean "Jehovah Elohim"? It is a covenant name that enters into this chapter. It appears in the second and runs through into the third. God has not relinquished His care for the race, for man. He is finding a way by which to maintain His relations with him, now His covenant relations. And that, I think, is the meaning of the fifth chapter where we have the book of Adam's generations. The word *generation* there is not exactly his descendants, but his origin, and into that we all come.
A.E.H. You referred to the implanted word in @James 1. Would that have any suggestion of the clothes that we are considering now? He ends that chapter by saying that "Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world". He mentions the Father there.
J.T. That is a very interesting link with what is before us.
R.W.S. In New Testament language, does that passage in James, just quoted, refer to new birth?
J.T. Yes, only it goes further. It is the effect of "the word of truth". That is what we are dealing with, what comes out from God. New birth is said to be a sovereign act of the Spirit, @John 3: 5 - 8, not especially stressing the responsibility of its subject; but here we have a fuller thought: "According to his own will
{373}
begat he us by the word of truth" (@James 1: 18). That is God begetting us. The word of truth in @Genesis 3 is in regard to Satan, in regard to Eve, and in regard to Adam himself. Adam is clearly affected by what was said to the serpent about Eve.
A.R. The standard is very high in chapter 5. God has created a man in His likeness: "Adam ... begot a son in his likeness". Is that what you have in mind?
J.T. Of course chapter 4 comes in as foundational to chapter 5. Chapter 5 involves the moral line that begins in chapter 3, and Eve is again brought into the position in chapter 4. She bore Seth and named him; and then Seth has a son and he names him. In Seth we come into the working out of the purpose of God on moral lines, so that an epoch has begun. The Spirit says, "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah". That ought to be linked with the verses in chapter 3 where Adam is evidently affected by the word of God. Faith is operating in his heart and God is clothing him accordingly, setting him up with clothes in keeping morally with what he confessed. Now we have in the interim the murder of Abel, so that a murderer is in the family. Chapter 4 deals with the murderer; his position is divinely fixed. Then, as we have noted, we have another son born to Adam and Eve and Eve calls him Seth, meaning that he is appointed. The names here are given for a reason, and the reason is given. Eve says, "For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him". The position is definitely recognised in her mind and stated in a name. Then it says immediately that Seth has a son and he calls his name Enosh. His wife does not name him, he does so himself, evidently coining in *Enosh* a new word, meaning *mortal, weak*. There is a want indicated in the word Enosh. If that is my name, then something is needed, namely, eternal life; because however long I may live down here, if I
{374}
die according to nature there is a want, and I think that the promise of life comes in there. So light is thrown in on the scene, not only expressed in the name of Seth's son, but others are affected by the light. The true light is now shining. Over against Cain's world, where Cain called the city Enoch after the name of his son, we have God's world, where people are calling on *the name of Jehovah*. So the two lines are clearly set out, the one in Cain and the other in Seth; and we have hope, the hope of eternal life.
R.W.S. We need alertness to listen because certain names in Cain's world are quite similar to those in chapter 5. It is a question of seeing which is really the "wholly right seed".
J.T. That is a good point, because the world does take on names from God's world; so I think the word *book* in chapter 5 is to *verify* things. You have a regular record. It is a question of Adam's generations; the book of Adam's generations. It is very like the book in @Matthew 1: 1, in fact it is almost identical in wording: "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham". Matthew is setting things out in definiteness because the assembly is in mind. We must be *sure* about people.
C.A.M. If you did not know about the book you might read the wrong Enoch into this.
J.T. Just so. Satan is ever ready to borrow names if it suits him. We must not be deceived by literality, we must get the *book*. The word runs right through Scripture. In the last chapter of the Bible we have, "And if any one take from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book" (@Revelation 22: 19). So that "the book" has a great place in the Revelation, involving records as to who persons are.
C.A.M. That is very interesting, because you have
{375}
been referring to the *voice* of God; but this stresses the matter of *writing* in making all these records permanent.
J.T. This is over against the Egyptian records dug up out of the earth, or from the tombs. It is the book of Adam's generations, but it is on moral ground; not simply creative. It is as though in chapters 3 and 4 the record is adjusted and things are sifted, and then we have the real thing in chapter 5, the book of life, really; persons that can come through the chaos, the crisis, and come out triumphant in life. That is what is in mind, and Seth is appointed. It is a man with an appointment, carrying with him responsibility. The Lord Jesus is appointed, everything is in His hands, all the books; our very souls are in His hands, so that all is secured in life.
A.H.P. Is there any suggestion that would correspond with this in Matthew's gospel when the Lord turns away, as rejected, from the unappreciated service and says, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes" (@Matthew 11: 25)?
J.T. He is rejected by Israel. A crisis had arisen. Chapter 11 of Matthew is a special chapter of crisis, and the Lord is showing that the things involved are all settled, the Father has taken them on. There is a definite turn in the course of events: at *that time* Jesus answering said, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes". The Father has taken on what the Son is doing. The Father and the Son are working together. There is complete adjustment in chapter 12. The brethren have come to light. The babes are viewed according to the work of the Father. He has taken them on and reveals things to them. Great things are brought out in chapter 12; the One greater than Jonah
{376}
and Solomon designates the disciples as His brethren.
E.F. Does your reference to the Lord Jesus being appointed link on with the thought of @John 17: 2: "as thou hast given him authority ... that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal"?
J.T. Just so. It is to give eternal life to all whom God has given Him. He is appointed, that covers the position of Christ officially. Everyone of us is to come into this idea of appointment.
J.W.W. Would the principle of this work out in the believer's history as seen in @Romans 6: 4, where we are "buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so *we* also should walk in newness of life"? Would the two lines be seen there?
J.T. That is like the book of Adam's generations. We are planted. The word in @Romans 6: 5 is *planted*, and there is a growth from it, and that growth is in newness of life, in which we walk. That stands out as a testimony -- newness of life. The end of the chapter says, "the wages of sin is death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord". The great blessing of eternal life is fixed.
H.B. Would you say the word *another* is most important if we are to be found going on with God's present operations? Eve says, "For God has appointed me *another* seed".
J.T. Quite, "instead of Abel". She speaks intelligently, but in the next chapter it is Adam who names him. He "begot a son in his likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth". This is now in the life line, the matter is settled; the appointed one is here. Notice another seed, not here *son*, although the Spirit of God uses the word son in verse 25. The word *seed* here must be linked with chapter 3: 15.
T.L.S. Was there light in Adam's soul in chapter 3
{377}
in saying, "the mother of all living", but the detailed working of it out in chapter 5 has the thought of fatherhood in view.
J.T. Yes. Chapter 5 has the principle of a book, the book of Adam's generations. Now we follow on with that book until we get other books. It is the principle of the book to gather things up officially and reliably so that reference may be made to it, and that we may know where we are at any given time in the testimony.
A.R. Would the idea of fatherhood be seen in Paul as he says of Timothy, "I have no one like-minded" (@Philippians 2: 20)? Timothy was taking on the likeness of Paul.
J.T. Quite so, and passing the thing down to us. "And the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men" (@2 Timothy 2: 2). They were to teach others also.
A.R. If the truth is to continue in our own day, it must continue on that line as it has from Mr. Darby's day on.
J.T. Yes, the line must be kept clear. There is a book, published by a certain independent body, with a great number of photographs of men, many of whom God had used, but some were far away from the truth. They are put into the book together as if all were on the same footing; a regular conglomeration. You are darkened by such a combination, but the generations in the book of Matthew would illuminate you.
S.McC. Would you say that in the constant recurring crises in our localities, and generally, there is great need for fatherhood asserting itself? We would like perhaps to be counted in officially in connection with the thought of fatherhood, but the need is for it asserting itself morally.
J.T. Yes. Chapter 4 is to show the moral element in Adam and Eve and in Seth, so as to qualify them for chapter 5. They are to have a place in the book. The book is the determining feature as to identification
{378}
according to God, not a book of all kinds of persons, some used of the devil. It is in a sense the book of life, the book of Adam's generations, but on moral lines.
S.W.P. Is that why it begins, "In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him", and then goes on in verse 5, "all the days of Adam"? Is that cumulative in the light of what has gone before?
J.T. I think you have to look at it in that way. Chapter 5 is the book of life. You might say of those listed there, that they all died, but they did not all die. This chapter verifies the Lord's remarks to Martha when He says, "every one who lives and believes on me shall never die", and again, "he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live" (@John 11: 25, 26). Enoch is the former and the others are included in what the Lord says, "though he have died". There can be no doubt, but that Methuselah is honourably mentioned in chapter 5. He did not go through the flood; he died before it came.
A.S.B. Would chapter 4 be something like the world's book you were referring to? Verse 20 says "Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in tents;" and then "Jubal: he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe". There is no mention of living conditions in chapter 4, but chapter 5, verse 3, says, "And Adam lived;" and verse 5, "all the days of Adam that he lived;" and verse 6, "Seth lived", etc.
J.T. That is the life line. Of course we are entitled to put much into it that is not in it literally, to put much into it from the revealed mind of God. We know that God is the same yesterday, today and for ever, so the thoughts of the New Testament are here.
J.R.H. Paul says to the Corinthians, "death works in us, but life in you" (@2 Corinthians 4: 12). Would that link on with Adam naming his wife, and Seth naming Enosh?
J.T. I think so. Enoch was the seventh from Adam; the matter is worked out to the seventh, which
{379}
would be like what Paul speaks of, the principle of death working. God is taking account of persons who are allowing death to work in them. "Death works in us", a remarkable thing, but what is accruing from it? At any rate, life worked in the Corinthians. It would seem as if the apostle had to furnish a good deal of the life side to keep them going at Corinth. Think of how he took the thing on, so that the more death he went through the more life would be in them!
A.E.H. Is the emphasis on what is moral seen perhaps in the fact that when it comes to the generations of Noah the idea of the book is dropped, but it says that he was "perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God"? Why is the word *book* left out?
J.T. There are several other generations that have no book. There are none of them in Cain's world. What are all these records worth? There is a book called *The Records of the Past;* that is to say, they have dug up some buried cities and otherwise acquired information, all of which is instructive as to the history of the human race in Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Canaan, etc. They are all records of the past, but they are not *living* records. These will come out in "that world and the resurrection". Enoch involves all this and he is *living*.
W.L. Would you say that Luke's record of the genealogies would show us their importance?
J.T. Yes; you get in that the records of the past. You see in the first book of Chronicles, for instance, verses 1 to 4 of chapter 1, those that are of value, "Adam, Seth, Enosh, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lemech, Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth". They are the ones. Cain is not in it.
A.R. The historical record in itself may include a breakdown, but God in grace effects recovery as in Adam.
J.T. A breakdown took place in Adam and Eve, but God found a way of recovery. You have them
{380}
mentioned in the life line in chapter 5. "This is the book of Adam's generations. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him. Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created". The basis of all is God acting through death in clothing Adam and Eve. Thus they are worthy of mention. God comes into the scene, and Adam's soul takes on moral impressions. He names Eve the mother of all living. Thus a basis was laid for chapter 5.
C.A.M. Is it not remarkable that when we come to the book of Daniel all the scribes and writers could not interpret Nebuchadnezzar's dream? It needed one who had the secret.
J.T. Quite so; it is very beautiful. "Go thy way, Daniel", is the word; "thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days". That is the principle of the book; the book of life is mentioned in the last chapter.
S.W.P. Would it be right to say that God puts His own preface to this book because of what follows? God puts His stamp of approval on it, as it were.
J.T. And the cumulative principle developing in Enoch is a great thought for us. We are to observe it. Think of the mass of literature there is now: what can you pick out that remains in your heart as living? Enoch is the cumulative product, the seventh from Adam; Jude speaks of him in that way. So that this section is linked up in the New Testament. Jude quotes Enoch as saying, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads". He is the finished product in this section and God says, so to speak, He will do for me. So that finally he is not found here. He may have been occupied in some practical work like Daniel, but one day he is not found; God has him. You have to go to heaven to find him; he is secured *there*. He was not found here, for God took him.
J.R.H. There appears to be a note of triumph in
{381}
this fifth chapter. The first chapter says, "Be fruitful and multiply". Do you think that on the moral side the great work of God in the souls of Adam and Eve -- He "called *their* name Adam" -- is shown in the way of multiplication?
J.T. That seems evident. And God took Enoch, which is the gathering up of all from Adam to Enoch. Enoch as thus developed in the truth. Now He has another man on the scene, namely, Noah, and he is a father. In order to get the thing clear in its present bearing we should note that he is one of eight. Where are we today? What about this book today? There are not many to write in it now. There are just eight souls mentioned in @Genesis 6; they are to be carried through the deluge in the ark. Who can tell us how many there were in the antediluvian world? How sorrowful, how distressing! Think of the number that were there! They married, and gave in marriage, and ate, and drank until the day that Noah entered the ark; and then the Lord just says, "the flood came and destroyed all of them" (@Luke 17: 27). But the book of life has the eight, and the ark has the eight, and they are going through; saved through water.
W.L. Would you say that shows the importance of arriving at God's positive thought in regard to the seed, as Adam did?
J.T. Yes. The positive thought was in Eve. Adam arrived at that. That was through the word of God, the ingrafted word which is able to save our souls. It was carried down to Enoch, the seventh from Adam; it was carried on in the exercises of these men enumerated. That result went up to heaven.
H.B. Why did Adam live such a long time before Seth was begotten? He lived 130 years, and the others generally lived long periods before their sons were begotten. Would it suggest experience with God, not a brief period matter?
{382}
J.T. It is said that Adam lived 130 years and begot a son and called his name Seth. We are not told how old he was when Cain was born. We shall have to count that 130 years back, I suppose, to the day of his creation. He was not created a boy, he was created a man; and Eve was created a woman. Adam would, therefore, if we add ordinary years of babyhood, boyhood, and manhood to him, probably be the oldest man. But he did not have those experiences. He could hardly say with the psalmist, "I have been young, and now I am old", He could hardly speak of childhood or boyhood. So that his experiences are the experiences of a full-grown man of 130 years before he begot Seth. But then, as we have noted, he had two sons earlier, Cain and Abel. The period of his experiences and exercises on the moral line I should think took place mainly after the death of Abel. We are not told. Adam and Eve are brought into the history less than some might have expected. God has not given us much detail, but enough to establish the physical and moral history. They had experience in bereavement in having one of their sons killed by another, but did they understand it? The experience from such events began with themselves; they needed time to work it out, because they did not have any models to go by. Evidently God gave them time to prepare for Seth. Eve so far has not forgotten that Cain slew Abel. She carried that thought down.
R.W.S. Would that be gathered up in Enoch; does not his name mean disciplined?
J.T. It does, and it is very appropriate because you can see that he is learning from experience. He had models behind him to go by so that he might say to his wife, 'Did anything happen like that before?' going in his thoughts right back to Adam. Terrible things happen amongst us and they might overcome us, but God would say, Other people have such things to bear. So God would, no doubt, come in to help Enoch
{383}
positively in these experiences, but you can see that in the early parts of their lives Adam had none and Eve had none. They had to learn everything at the outset without the help of models.
J.R.H. The fourth chapter speaks of Eve naming Seth but in chapter 5 Adam names him. Is that the result of experience with God?
J.T. I think God would have *the book* that way. It is a divine book. It would not do to have Eve outstanding as the parent who named the son *appointed*. Adam did it, but Eve named him first, she gives a reason for it. We can understand that Adam fixedly named his third son, designating him, perhaps, in prophetic light. Light comes in through Seth. "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah" (@Genesis 4: 26).
E.G.McA. Chapter 4 says that Seth *named* his son Enosh, but chapter 5 just says that he "*begot* Enosh". What is the difference? All the rest in chapter 5 simply *begot* sons and daughters, but Seth had the intelligence to name Enosh. Does that indicate that he was in line with his father's thought in the intelligence of naming?
J.T. I think that is right. It is clear that Seth had light in naming Enosh. We may almost say an epoch began, "*Then* people began to call on the name of Jehovah" (@Genesis 4: 26). After Adam the word *begot* is used throughout in chapter 5. It is proper as fitting into an official book. We have already alluded to @Matthew 1; there we have the same expression: "Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Juda and his brethren;" coming on down to verse 16, where it is said, "Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus". The Son of God could be begotten only by God. The Spirit of God is very careful about that. So what you say, I think, is very suggestive, that the progenitive idea must be in the book, because that gives each one there his status.
E.G.McA. I was wondering if the progenitive idea
{384}
is in keeping with the intelligence seen in verse 26 of @Genesis 4?
J.T. Exactly. Joseph was the reputed father of Jesus, but he could never have been said to have begotten Him.
J.R.H. Does the thought of image and likeness belong to the progenitorial idea?
J.T. Yes, it is the carrying on of the impressions of the father. Take Esau and Jacob: they were begotten by Isaac, but in effect Esau elects himself out of the book.
Baptised children are in the kingdom, and in a certain sense they are in the fellowship. If they elect to leave, they are in principle apostates, although other circumstances may modify this -- grace would afford time for repentance. But the progenitive idea is a very important one, the carrying on of the divine thoughts of the parents. You can carry down what your father stood for, and if you do the divine privilege into which you were born remains.
S.W.P. Is that why in @Exodus 12 it is "a lamb for a father's house"?
J.T. Just so. So in @Genesis 22 where Christ is typically seen in Isaac about to die, it was not a female sheep, but a ram caught in a thicket that was found. The ram there stands for the progenitorial thought, it contemplates the continuation of the line; it is going through. Isaac comes out of death, he is received back from the dead in a figure. It is through the power of God, witnessed in Christ's resurrection that divine progeniture is developed.
S.McC. Would you help us as to the two words used here, the idea of creation, and that of generation, and their bearing on ourselves? Chapter 5 says, "This the book of Adam's generations. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him. Male and female created he them".
J.T. I think the two thoughts come into the new
{385}
order of things. We have new birth which is the generative thought, and new creation which is the creative thought. These two words convey to us a new order of things, so that in chapter 5 you have the life line. Generation is something that God had in His mind, and He would see to it that His thought is fully carried out in creation. The idea of creation is not growth. In generation it is growth, but in creation the thing is fixed at once. Adam was not created a baby or a boy, he was created a man. He was created according to divine thoughts, as is everything else that is created. Take the vast system of the universe: God designed it in His mind before He did anything; everything there is worked out on the principle of design. So wisdom is called God's artificer, perhaps the artificer of His love, see @Proverbs 8:30 and the Note in New Translation. There is not a thing omitted in the result because wisdom is there. The primary design in the mind of God is carried through by wisdom. Therefore when the time comes, each one of us will be in his created position. Even our very works come into the matter, for @Ephesians 2: 10 says, "For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has before prepared that we should walk in them". That is, we are created for that. God has prepared these works that we should walk in them, that is the divine thought worked out. When Solomon was born, Jehovah loved him as a babe, pointing on to Christ. It is not a creation; it is a birth, and Jehovah would name what is going to develop. Of course both ideas attach to all but Adam and Eve. A birth involves love, but creation is fixed at the start. Of course God's creative works go on, but I am speaking now of the great general principle of creation and generation as seen in @Genesis 1 and 2; also new creation which is presented in Scripture as a fixed matter. "If any one be in Christ there is new creation" (@2 Corinthians 5: 17).
{386}
A.E.H. Is there a difference between creation and generation set out in the two words, *order* and *character*? Creation is an order of things, an order of being, but generation or birth has to do with the character.
J.T. Just so. The family is the sphere of life. Parents delight in their offspring; we must not deny ourselves that, nor God either. So wisdom says in this wonderful matter, as the artificer of God's love, "my delights were with the sons of men".
A.E.H. We could never have Christ spoken of as created, but when the creation is spoken of in Colossians, the delightful character of things as seen in Him, He is referred to as "firstborn of all creation".
S.McC. Is generation only connected with the ways of God in time, or does it link with eternity also?
J.T. I think so, as also new creation: "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation".
S.McC. It has been said that we are not sons by birth; we are children by birth, but sons by adoption.
J.T. That is right. But our adoption into sonship is more than the ordinary idea of being made one of a family. We have "received a spirit of adoption, [sonship] whereby we cry Abba, Father" (@Romans 8: 15). We have not only the light of sonship, but the *spirit* of it, which implies *consciousness* of it. The word *adoption* is really *sonship*, so that we are constituted the thing that is in the mind of God by the spirit of sonship. He has sent out the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba, Father". There is no idea of our being inferior.
J.R.H. What would be in the fatherhood exercises with Paul in this matter of image and likeness?
J.T. I think he must have observed in the Corinthians a great lack of likeness to himself and to God. He says, I am not coming myself to see you, but I am sending Timotheus; and if you look at the wording in @1 Corinthians 4: 17, you will see how Timotheus would be like Paul among them. "For this reason I
{387}
have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ". "For this reason", that is, that he would represent Paul among the Corinthians as his beloved child. He had Paul's features.
A.R. How is that brought about?
J.T. That is a good question, as to how we begin to apprehend God in Christ. Christ is said to be the image of God. We have to take on what we apprehend -- to take on the characteristics. I believe that is what Paul meant. Paul was so acquainted with God in Christ that he was like Him, and that was carried over in a young man like Timothy.
J.R.H. Is it right to say that the thought of likeness must underlie the thought of image?
J.T. Yes. Image is representation. It is what God intends you to be as representative of God in a certain sense; that is, if God anoints a man for a certain purpose. Satan was anointed, for instance, before he fell, and there would be some characteristic representation in him. Jehovah said of him, "Thou, who sealest up the measure of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, thou wast in Eden, the garden of God" (@Ezekiel 28: 12, 13). Michael reasoned with him, but did not rebuke him; God would rebuke him, @Jude 9.
A.R. One must be born again of water and of the Spirit; that would be by God Himself; and it would bring about likeness, I suppose?
J.T. Yes. That was the idea in Timothy, he was like Paul as his child in the Lord. He was in Corinth as the apostle's representative; that would be Paul's image. If he were not like Paul characteristically he could not represent him, but he was like Paul. God in all times took up certain persons who were equal to the position and made them representative of Himself.
J.W.W. In the Philippian epistle, Timotheus is said to be like-minded to Paul. Would that be the same
{388}
idea? And then further on it says, "But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings" (@Philippians 2: 22).
J.T. That carries it out. Take Judas: I think he was in some sense representative of God as sent out by the Lord, he was intended to be that. He probably was positively used, but he could not be *like* God; he must have put on a good deal to make himself seem like the others. They evidently did not see he was a devil.
T.L.S. Should a letter of commendation carry the same thought?
J.T. Quite so; as it contains just what is true.
J.R.H. Those persons you mentioned as bearing the image of God evidently should be regarded as a warning to us. You spoke of Satan and Judas.
J.T. Yes. They indicate how God may come in and commit something to a man, as in the case of Judas, who may not really be like God at all in the true sense of the word.
A.E.H. The reason that the apostle stayed away from Corinth was because he did not want to act otherwise than in his true character. He really was in love with the Corinthians, but he said, If I come I shall have to come with a rod; I will send Timothy instead, for you to see the Spirit of Christ in him.
J.T. A very beautiful thought!
J.W.W. In relation to the scripture, "I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau" (@Malachi 1: 2), would the line of generation come in negatively in the thought, "I have hated Esau"? He elected himself out of the blessing in that way.
J.T. Just so. The wickedness came out. That statement is in Malachi, and in order to understand it we must look at Esau's history in the prophets; there you will see good reasons for God hating him. It is a historic thing culminating in Malachi. When you go back in the history of Jacob you see that God had very
{389}
good reasons for loving him, because the lovable qualities were there. The Spirit of God tells us at the start that Jacob was a plain man that dwelt in tents. He valued the inheritance of God. Esau was the man of the field and did not care for the blessing; he had murderous hatred for Jacob. That is what God hates.
J.W.W. It develops as the years go on, culminating in Malachi.
J.T. God let it go to its full limit before He said that.
{390}
FATHERHOOD (2)
@Genesis 5: 21 - 24; @Genesis 6: 9 - 12; @Hebrews 11: 7
J.T. Enoch and Noah comprise the second feature of our subject. Later, God willing, we shall look at Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, thus covering the book of Genesis, having considered Adam and Seth in our first reading. In Adam we saw, amongst other things, the effect of the word of God as received into the heart and working out in an expression of life; he called his wife's name "Eve, because she is the mother of all living". Then a calamity entered his house in the murder of one of his sons by the other, but he recognised what God did to meet that calamity, so that he called the name of this third son Seth, meaning *appointed*. He evidently had light as to the idea of appointment, a great element in the administrative ordering of God.
In meeting a catastrophe God brings in this thought of appointment, fully seen in the Lord Jesus who was appointed, as it says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth" (@Matthew 28: 18). There is practical importance in a father discerning an adverse current in his house, feeling it as a disaster, seeing what God does to meet it, and naming what God does, so that it is understood. Then it says, "And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name Enosh", meaning *weak, mortal;* implying that Seth had light that, however long a man might live according to nature, ultimately he would die. This, under God, would make way for eternal life. We have the promise of eternal life in the Scriptures, God meeting the condition that is discerned by faith on that principle. Eternal life meets the mortal condition in which we are.
God did not allow Adam to partake of the tree of life as he was. Had he done so he would have lived eternally in a lost state, hostile to God; but God prevented this and affected man by His word, so that he was brought
{391}
to the thought of appointment. The Lord Jesus says to His Father of Himself, "thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal" (@John 17: 2). It is a matter of sovereignty, and counsel, and in that connection we have people calling on the name of the Lord, an important development in the testimony of God. People name Him, they "call on the name of Jehovah", the name of Jehovah involving His power, bringing in life, and that is what enters into the whole of @Genesis 5 -- the life line set up in Adam. So that we have in Enoch one who did not see death. The Lord said to Martha, "Every one who lives and believes on me shall never die" (@John 11: 26). Enoch represents that side -- eternal life. His fatherhood, therefore, becomes very interesting; a son is born to him and then it says, "Enoch walked with God". We need fatherhood in the light of purpose; the power effectuating the purpose of God is thus realised in the believer; it is not merely light, it is realised. Enoch did not see death. That is a testimony that enters very strikingly into the present time, and the possibility of not seeing death ought to stimulate our hearts. It is a very great hope within us.
H.B. Why should the walking with God follow on the begetting of Methuselah?
J.T. It shows how the work of God affected Enoch. It was important that Methuselah should have the testimony that his father walked with God. He was to continue on to the end of the dispensation, the flood came as he died; it was a great matter that he should have the light of a man walking with God. It is a family matter, and speaks to all young people as to whether they are moving in the light of their parents. We were saying this morning that baptised families are in *principle* in fellowship. The idea of begetting in this chapter is a feature carried down on the principle of exercise and experience, and if in the present dispensation
{392}
one leaves the circle of fellowship he is in principle an apostate. @Hebrews 10: 26 thus views those who "sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth".
S.W.P. What would be suggested in the period of sixty-five years before he begot Methuselah? "Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah".
J.T. We were speaking of the period preceding the birth of these sons in our first reading. Adam lived a hundred and thirty years and begot Seth, and Seth lived a hundred and five years and begot Enosh. Enosh lived ninety years and begot Cainan, Cainan lived seventy years and begot Mahalaleel, Mahalaleel lived sixty-five years and begot Jared, Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years and begot Enoch, and Enoch lived sixty-five years and begot Methuselah. There must be something in the age of the father and what experience he has. Evidently a father gains nothing by having married very young. The suggestion would be maturity in manhood.
J.W.B. Is this to be seen with Paul before Timothy is mentioned?
J.T. I should think so. I think the full thought of manhood spiritually was in Paul, and Timothy was his child, his beloved child. He met him first immediately after the departure of Barnabas; that separation between himself and Barnabas which must have been a very bitter experience, and that would qualify the apostle Paul all the more as a father. It is he that brings in the thought, "not many fathers" (@1 Corinthians 4: 15); but at any rate he was one, who had begotten the Corinthians through the gospel, and also Timotheus.
R.W.S. Is marriage and the begetting of children designed of God to produce spiritual fatherhood?
J.T. That is what is intended in it. Look at the great men of faith: how long Abraham had to wait for Isaac, and how long Isaac had to wait for Jacob. Then
{393}
the subsequent history in Jacob's family all points to the same thing, that God makes us wait for things if we are to be really according to His mind. We must value them. A family should not be looked upon as a hardship, but as a gift from God; God would not have it any other way. If what He gives becomes in the believer's mind a hardship, it is no testimony to God. We have to challenge our own hearts if it is so.
A.S.B. Would the Psalms help us in that? @Psalm 128: 3, in relation to the man that fears Jehovah, says, "Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the inner part of thy house; thy children like olive-plants round about thy table".
J.T. Yes. Surely God is the Author of the family. Of Him "every family in the heavens and on earth is named" (@Ephesians 3: 15). J.N.D.¬s note to this passage says, 'There is a distinct connection between the *words* for Father and family'. If it is objectionable to parents to have a family, there is no testimony to God in it. Joseph says as to his two boys, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here" (@Genesis 48: 9); and Jacob says of his family, "The children that God has graciously given thy servant" (@Genesis 33: 5).
W.W. The features of the assembly should be practically worked out in the household.
J.T. Quite so, because the assembly is the house of God.
C.A.M. The expression *walking with God* would involve the acquisition of feelings that God Himself would have in connection with fatherhood. There is another expression used by God to Abraham, "walk before my face" (@Genesis 17: 1). Would this be a great thing?
J.T. I think when God said to Abraham, "walk before my face", He meant him to understand how thoroughly He found pleasure in him. But walking with God as Enoch did is the inauguration of a principle
{394}
in one who had learned from others. It is clear that Enoch represents a believer who learns from others. He is "the seventh from Adam". If I am a parent I ought to be ready to learn from others. I think that is why God gives us so much about the family in the Scriptures. When Enoch walked with Him we may be sure that God would let in light as time went on, as to His own feelings and affections as a Father; so that, without calling Himself Father, the thought was there, and Enoch might well get inklings of the divine fatherhood. When we come to Abraham the truth is out, and God sees to it that he gets a name that qualifies him to be a father. Abraham is named father before he has any children. Evidently he is qualified to have them; they would be no burden to him. He looked after them, even Ishmael and the sons of Keturah, but he took particular care of the one God gave him in a special way.
J.W.D. Should we not seek to understand the feelings of the heart of God in fatherhood? The kind of children that would be given to us might reflect that idea. Sovereignty in relation to the personality of the child, linking on with how we understand fatherhood, and how we are prepared to work it out, do you not think?
J.T. You begin with the thought that the child is a gift. Eve's first thought about Cain was that she had "acquired a man with Jehovah". She did not yet have a man, but she called him a man, and it is rather suggestive that he is so called; the babe is potentially a man, so that is a question of God, and I have to view him from God's standpoint. He becomes valuable from that standpoint; not that his birth is a mere natural incident, but something with which God has had to do. God has to do with the potato as it grows out of the earth; how much more with the children that grow up in a family! Heaven would impress us with their value,
{395}
as it says, "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father" (@Matthew 18: 10); and the Lord took them into His arms and blessed them. These scriptures show how God looks at the matter of parents with a family, and particularly at fatherhood.
E.G.McA. The fathers in Colossians and Ephesians would have the features of Enoch; they would please God. Evidently Enoch means *disciplined* or *devoted*. We are to bring the children up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord, according to @Ephesians 6: 4; and @Colossians 3: 21 says, "Fathers, do not vex your children, to the end that they be not disheartened".
J.T. Yes. Your thought is that Ephesians and Colossians afford teaching on this line, reflecting what God is, and how a father should care for his children, bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. That is a very good line of thought for us, because there are not many real fathers even in the ordinary sense of the word, but how much less as to development in the assembly in the exercise of fatherhood among the saints!
J.R.H. Enoch's prophecy mentioned in the epistle of Jude shows that he had a definite judgment as to evil; he would have that as walking with God.
J.T. Noah also had to do with evil; the testimony took that turn under Noah. We have the secret of the evil in @Genesis 6, but it was there previously; and although Enoch may not have had to suffer from it he certainly took account of it. So that Jude can quote him as speaking of it: "And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also as to these, saying, Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads", verse 14. I suppose Enoch might say, 'I am the only one walking with God, and I am trying to preserve my wife and Methuselah in the same path', but he learned that there were holy myriads and that the Lord was coming with them.
{396}
E.G.McA. Would you say that Enoch who walked with God, and God took him, would be morally the father of the man that lived the longest on the earth?
J.T. There must be something in that. How exemplary he was! What Methuselah was we cannot definitely say; there is nothing said of him in this respect, only it is clear that he represents the side of God's patience, for the flood was stayed until he died. There is ground for regarding him as some kind of a witness to God. I understand his name may arise from the fact that after his death the flood came. There must have been *something* for God in him.
A.E.H. What would you say about a case like Jotham, the king of Judah, who turned out so well and yet had a bad father, a presumptuous father? The Spirit is careful to tell us that he did not do as his father did.
J.T. This was also true of Jeroboam's son, and that son was required to die; God said he was the only one in the house of Jeroboam in which there was any good. That is God's side, taking him away from the evil. It shows that God takes account of good wherever He sees it.
A.E.H. I was thinking of the remark you made about learning from what we have seen. I suppose that Jotham would have seen his father presumptuously going into the house of Jehovah to burn incense, but *he* did not do it.
J.T. He learned negatively, you might say. In Enoch's case we have a man who had great advantages in the persons with whom he was acquainted in the testimony of God. He was the seventh from Adam and lived with many of the seven. He evidently learned from others. Although he walked with God he would take account of the persons whom he knew, and I think we ought to follow that example. We are to consider our leaders, who have spoken to us the word of God and
{397}
"considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come" (@Hebrews 13: 7). The principle of learning from others runs right through Scripture.
H.B. Would @Philippians 4: 9 fit in? "What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you".
J.T. That is a good Scripture to support what we are saying. Paul was a father and was to be followed.
J.W.D. It says in @Hebrews 11: 5, "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death". Do you think his intercourse with those that preceded him would turn on the question of life, and that the thought of faith in relation to translation might come into his heart?
J.T. Yes. However vague the learning might be, certainly he had the idea of the holy myriads that the Lord had. One is struck with the brevity of the account we have of the ancient world. It is all contained in these few chapters which we are considering, but we cannot imagine for a moment that the Spirit of God was not operating during all those antediluvian years. What times these men must have had in meeting one another! Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years, we are told; it would be easy to see how far down that went. And then Seth lived nine hundred and twelve years and Enosh lived nine hundred and five years; and so the length of years continues through Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, etc. How these lives overlapped or interlaced we cannot say, but we may assume that if God was working in them they would be drawn to each other and value each other. So that it was a learning time and it was a time of *life*, and I believe Enoch indicates the full culmination of it, in that, after Methuselah was born, he began to walk with God for three hundred years.
R.A. John says, "I write to you, fathers, because
{398}
ye have known him that is from the beginning" (@1 John 2: 13); and then the young men come in as overcomers.
J.T. We were remarking on that in our first reading; the fathers know "him that is from the beginning". The principle of this chapter is that what is from the beginning runs through it, and Enoch evidently profited by it, because he was a learner; as his name signifies, he is a student through discipline.
J.W.D. He must have had some understanding of the name 'Eve', in a world full of corruption and violence. Do you not think that by faith he sensed that another world must come into existence in connection with that name, meaning *life*? So that that was the light in which he walked with God, faith in that connection having opened up to him.
J.T. I think that is right. When we get to glory, to heaven, we shall be looking for these men. We must not restrict ourselves to the mere letter of Scripture, we must read it with understanding, knowing that it gives us suggestions. For example, what can we see in Enoch, the man of accumulated understanding and instruction? He would belong to a family by itself, a family of God that would be characterised by what is from the beginning, carried down in their knowledge and in their feelings and emphasising what part God had in it. So that here is a man who is said to be a learner, an instructed person who embodies the whole matter, being an exemplification of the antediluvian work of God. It comes under a family by itself. It will be most interesting to investigate these matters by and by. What a time we shall have moving about, seeing in all the families the history of Scripture! We were speaking this morning about what men do scientifically, recording their research, as instanced in a book called, *Records of the Past*. But in Enoch we shall see records of the past in a *positive* way. There is nothing said about Enoch having any warfare or any particular
{399}
suffering, that side of the truth is not brought before us in connection with him. It is His own work in him that God likes so well, and so "he was not, for God took him".
A.S.B. Would it help us to see that the reference to Enoch in @Hebrews 11 links on with that to which you have been calling attention? It says, "But without faith it is impossible to please him. For he that draws near to God must believe that he is", verse 6.
J.T. That is the way to get at it. He had faith. It is by faith Enoch was translated. He had the testimony before his translation that he pleased God; meaning that God gave some witness to him that he pleased Him; and God is saying, What pleases Me I am *taking*! I am taking it to Myself, and all that is left is going into the flood. What good is the present world or its records? None whatever! It is what pleases God that is of value, and that is going to be taken up. With Noah another testimony comes in, to do with things that are going through. But Enoch, as we have said, is not a suffering man, he is not a working man even; he is not a man like Noah that *does* things, but he is a man who has faith and he pleases God, and God takes him.
P.G. There is nothing specific mentioned in the life of Enoch save that he walked with God.
J.T. Jude says he prophesied of the coming of the Lord. He would represent life; the life of God, in the antediluvian world. We have the expression, the "life of God", in @Ephesians 4: 18, that men were alienated from it. In Enoch's time also they were alienated from it, but Enoch was not. He was in it. If you asked Enoch, he would say, 'I walked with Him three hundred years. I know something about the life of God'.
J.R.H. It must have been delightful to Adam to see the end of all his exercise, all the experience that he had with God, summed up in Enoch. The figures here would show that he died fifty-seven years before Enoch was taken.
{400}
J.T. That is what we should observe. There is an overlapping, and, we might say, an interlacing of the lives of these men. They were in touch with one another and they represented the life of God. Those in whom God wrought before the flood would, I believe, form a family by themselves.
R.W.S. In this life line, would it appear from the constant allusion to sons and daughters that there is an extension in the antediluvian world of what Enoch represented?
J.T. We are entitled to assume that God gathered up much in those days. We hear very little until we come down to Noah, but we cannot say that there was only what is written, because all the sons and daughters of these families would get divine light. The names given of the heads of the families indicate light, the light of life, we may say.
J.W.B. You referred to learning. In Kings and Chronicles we frequently find the phrase, "David his father". Would David thus be the standard?
J.T. He is a sort of model for all that followed, which would enter into what we are speaking of. Adam is the beginning, and represents what was from the beginning, and @Genesis 5 would show that it is the beginning of a moral line, not the creation line, although that is recognised too. So that we have Enoch brought into it. If you were to meet Enoch one day and converse with him, you would find that he had been walking with God all that day. Perhaps he met Adam or one of the others and got some light from their experience, for it is all cumulative, and it makes that period very interesting. I believe that Enoch represents something of what it will be like in heaven, -- the product of that world, as it were, eternally seen there. All these men, doubtless, will be there. So that the fifth chapter is "from glory to glory". One of the names, Mahalaleel, refers to glory; in fact each of the names I believe refers to some feature
{401}
of that world. God has had Enoch with Him ever since -- He *took* him.
A.H.B. Does the name *Enoch* suggest a life of close, personal contact with God?
J.T. That is the way it works out; God's discipline promotes holiness. We have the case of the house of Stephanas, whose members addicted themselves to the saints for service. The name Stephanas means *crown*, implying glory. Thus the point reached in Enoch morally was that of a crown.
R.W.S. Would an Enoch today discern that God is taking assembly materials from what He has now in the families of the saints, and not going outside for it very much? Fatherhood would involve training in view of the assembly.
J.T. It is very interesting that they all begot sons and daughters. God has not said anything specific about these sons and daughters. With some of those antediluvian daughters it is doubtful whether or not they belonged to the life line; I do not believe they did. They were fair, but they evidently did not have veils, they did not conceal their beauty, but were open and brazen, so that they were seen by those fallen beings, spoken of as in the ancient world as "the sons of God". The context shows plainly that they were agents of evil; and they "took themselves wives of all that they chose". It is a very strong warning to sisters now as to exposing themselves openly, whereas the life line would imply that they veiled themselves.
R.W.S. @Genesis 6: 2 says, "the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and took themselves wives".
J.T. Where did they see them? They must have gone where they could have been seen by these beings. They were not sheltered in their fathers¬ houses in a godly way, nor did they cover themselves with a veil.
J.W.D. It is something akin to your suggestion as
{402}
to Mary Magdalene. She made room by her ways for the possession of evil spirits.
J.T. Seven demons were in her. How did they get there? By giving evil a place, the devil gets in. So that when the Lord came into contact with her they went out of her. They were not cast out according to Luke, they *went* out. She was so affected by the Lord that they simply had no room.
J.W.C. Is there a difference between the idea of children being given to us, and the thought in this fifth chapter of those that are begotten?
J.T. It is just two sides of the same thing, this being a progenitive thought, the stamp of God on man, on the human race. The word, "Be fruitful and multiply", was for the propagation of the race. The progenitive idea is stamped upon it. That is the principle that runs through this chapter and is maintained in life. We can assume that, if Enoch had such a sense of evil that he said, "the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads, to execute judgment" (@Jude 14), he would do his best to preserve his children, and the fact that he began to walk with God when Methuselah was born is proof that he would be attentive to his family.
C.A.M. You were connecting Noah with the number eight?
J.T. Yes. It is remarkable how much is connected with him in the New Testament. Then chapter 5 ends, "And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth". It is a very good ending too. Then it says, "And it came to pass when mankind began to multiply on the earth, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and took themselves wives of all that they chose. And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not always plead with Man; for he indeed is flesh; but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years. In those days were the giants on the earth, and also afterwards,
{403}
when the sons of God had come in to the daughters of men, and they had borne children to them; these were the heroes, who of old were men of renown". We can see the old world developing into the grossest kind of evil. They were not affected by the preaching of Noah; in the face of his testimony this awful evil developed. Noah and those like him were in a very great minority. Evil had become so developed that there were only eight saved, and there is not much said of any of them except Noah himself. This is most important in view of our times, we having come to the greatest development of evil that has ever been. How is it going to work out?
S.W.P. These "men of renown" are the product of fatherhood on negative lines. Mr. Darby's note says, 'who had a peculiar and known name on the earth'. There is no link with heaven. Is that suggestive?
J.T. Quite so. "These were the heroes". I suppose Greek mythology and the like might have been derived from this evil. It all shows the terrible descent of the race under these influences. But Enoch stands out as representing the cumulative instruction that could be gathered from his forefathers who had faith, and God liked him so well that He took him to Himself. It was not a crown for any great service that he rendered, but he *pleased God*.
J.W.D. With regard to womanhood, there is a full grown development of wickedness in @Revelation 12, but the woman there fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of God; thus womanhood is connected with God as over against this wickedness.
J.T. That is a good suggestion. How comforting it is that there should be "a place prepared of God" for her; and what glory is attached to her, "clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet"! We should follow that up a little more if we have opportunity because of the great lesson it is for us at the present time.
Now we come to Noah. God took account of him in
{404}
the midst of all these elements. First we must observe what God thought of the existing conditions. There was "only evil continually" on the earth. "And Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart. And Jehovah said, I will destroy Man, whom I have created, from the earth -- from man to cattle, to creeping things, and to fowl of the heavens; for I repent that I have made them" (@Genesis 6: 6, 7). Let us stop to think as we read this scripture of what a God is ours, what a feeling God He is! Fathers and mothers should thus learn to be feeling about the corruptness around, and the danger of their children coming under the power of it. "But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah". This is God's judgment of him, God now has another man in whom He can rest. Then verse 9 says, "This is the history of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God. And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth". Here we have fatherhood in Noah. Notice the word *generations;* it refers in verse 9 to his own immediate circle of relations, sons and daughters, uncles and aunts, whoever they might be. In that setting he was perfect.
R.W.S. Was this one hundred and twenty years within the antediluvian period?
J.T. I think so. I take it to be the period from the time that God made this pronouncement up to the flood.
R.W.S. This would be the most wicked and difficult time of all, and would compare with our day.
J.T. That is what I was thinking, so that God judges the condition and brings Noah into it, depositing in him the testimony so that he may be constituted a preacher of righteousness.
A.R. Is Noah's name, meaning *repose*, significant?
J.T. It must be, because his father said, "This one shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands, because of the ground which
{405}
Jehovah has cursed" (@Genesis 5: 29). The current conditions are met, and then in the end of chapter 8 we have the sweet odour. In connection with Noah's offering, @Genesis 8: 21 says, "And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour. And Jehovah said in his heart, I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man". *Sweet odour* might also be rendered *odour of rest*.
C.A.M. Would you say that the new order will be equal to this matter of eight? I was wondering whether it would be right to link it with the heavenly side of the truth, in connecting it with Enoch?
J.T. I think that is right. The *eight* is another order of things developing out of the first, and Noah is said in the New Testament to be one of eight, which number is said to be *few;* there are not many, but there are enough to make another world; God can go on, that is the point. He has a man that not only pleases Him and walks with Him, but he is a testimony among his generations, his relations and acquaintances. He is a man that God can use, he has courage and ability to do things according to His mind. It looks as if there will be a change when the church is taken up to heaven, as if God will have men able to do great things and to go through the terrible tribulations coming on the earth. We are hardly called upon to go through the fringe of what is coming; prophecy anticipates awful happenings. Men will need to be prepared of God to go through them, and I think Noah represents that.
G.W.W. Why does Enoch say in Jude, "The Lord *has* come"?
J.T. It is a set matter. It is a prophetic way of speaking.
J.R.H. Would it suggest too that he reached it in his own soul?
J.T. I think so. It would suggest that God was already operating against the wickedness spoken of.
J.W.W. Is it instructive that God brings the *father*
{406}
thought forward, "thou, and thy sons, and thy wife", in connection with going into the ark?
J.T. Yes. It was "for the saving of his house". The Spirit of God says that he was moved with fear, because he was oracularly warned. He was a real man according to God, a man that God could use to carry out His mind amid great difficulties; to go through them successfully, so that being moved with fear he prepared an ark for the saving of his house. It is credited to him that he did it, and that is a great word for us as fathers, to see to it that our houses are protected.
A.R. It is said that by doing it he condemned the world. Jehovah had cursed the ground, but here is a man that is free from the evil and living in the light of another world.
J.T. Yes. So that God takes one man up to heaven, and the other one goes through the deluge, and you can see clearly that Noah must have been a sufferer at least on moral lines, because of building an ark when there was no water at all in sight.
J.W.D. What will be the nature of the ark that the remnant will have? I was wondering whether it would come out in the third and fourth books of the Psalms, the power and glory of God anticipated by faith.
J.T. I am sure that God will begin to work in them very rapidly after the church has been removed, and the godly Jews will begin to revert back; they will surely look back on history, and the word ark has a great place in the history of the testimony. This is the first instance of its use; the next is in the last chapter of this book, where Joseph's bones are said to be put into an ark (see Note to verse 26). The ark into which Moses was put is very interesting. Moses was "fair to God". He was worth protecting, and that is what we have to see as to children. They are worth protecting. The final thought is *the* ark into which the testimony was put. It suggests what is infinite. I suppose that the
{407}
Jewish remnant will begin to look into the Psalms and the prophets; thus they will learn values, what is worth carrying through. Great lessons may be learned from Noah. The ark illustrates his ability. The ark that held Joseph's bones would be comparatively small. We know the measurements of the ark of the covenant. Noah's ark was a large-sized ship, four hundred and fifty feet long, I should say. In divine things there are large thoughts and small thoughts. Large things usually involve less preciousness than small ones. The ark of the covenant is much greater morally than the ark of Noah. The fatherhood of Noah is seen in the ark built by him. What a time he must have had there, he and his wife and three daughters-in-law and three sons! The Spirit of God makes a great deal of the three sons, Shem is mentioned first here; it does not seem as if he were first historically, but God puts first what is morally first, and Shem, in view of Israel, is morally first.
J.R.H. Would it instruct us to see that the ark helped Noah as to his fatherhood? I refer to the instructions as to the cells he was to make. These suggest opportunity for individual contact with God for each member of his house.
J.T. Quite so. Also there were first, second and third stories in the ark with the *light* at the top. They had before them all the time in the ark a great variety of life, it was there every day before their eyes, so that at any time Noah could instruct his family and call attention to this creature or that. Adam called that creature so and so, he might say; Adam meant to convey that that creature exhibited some particular feature of life. Another thing to note is that he is mentioned with his family as being in the ark before the animals began to go in, suggesting that the ark was more attractive to them with Noah and his family in it. We read, "And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth. And Noah went in, and his sons, and
{408}
his wife, and his sons¬ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowl, and of everything that creeps on the ground, there came two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth". Noah is seen there, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons¬ wives. You will notice that Noah and his sons come first; the male side, the leading side, but they are all there and the animals come to them *there*. All these things are of great importance as to the working of life. What a man Noah was in his own circle, for he is viewed much in that connection; the man who prepared an ark for the saving of his house!
R.W.S. It is all the more remarkable because apparently for one hundred and twenty years nobody came to him.
J.T. While he was building no doubt many came to jeer at him.
E.G.McA. Why would such a man as Ham be carried through, in connection with whose family there was a curse by Noah? And why should there be any unclean animals there?
J.T. God in His government can use all. In that connection we have a prophetic word from Noah in chapter 9, in relation to Canaan. We all know the history of the vineyard that Noah planted, and the conduct of his son. He is called the youngest son and it is evidently a prophetic announcement in verse 25: "and he said, Cursed be Canaan; Let him be a bondman of bondmen to his brethren. And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem, And let Canaan be his bondman. Let God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, And let Canaan be his bondman". It is a prophetic word that covers the history of the Canaanites.
{409}
J.R.H. It would show clearly too that the life line was continued through Shem.
J.T. That is the point; in spite of the failure, Noah is a man of God. He is not drunk as uttering the blessing; he is recovered, and he is able to convey the mind of God. Shem is blessed and Canaan is cursed. It is in view of Israel.
A.R. Do the three representatives go from there right on to Revelation?
J.T. This particular family is cursed. We have to find that family. It cannot be found by colour, you know, it is a spiritual matter. It refers to the seven nations of the land of Canaan.
A.E.H. It would look as though even such an element as Canaan would be made to contribute to the great things of God. Shem's name means *renown*, and Japheth's means *enlargement or expanding*, and Canaan would contribute to that as a bondman.
J.T. God meets disaster with victory at all times. How wonderfully He comes in and meets it here, and triumphs in opening up His mind through Noah! The Canaanitish woman, @Matthew 15, is a bright testimony to grace in the family of Ham, and there are many others. In Nimrod, a rebel, however, we have also one of the family of Ham. He represented the lawless elements of the world.
A.R. He is the head of Babylon. I suppose that is the idea that will go right down to the end.
J.T. Yes. Making use of the creatures of God for sport, as he did, is abominable to God.
{410}
FATHERHOOD (3)
@Genesis 17: 1 - 14; @Genesis 24:1 - 9; @Hebrews 11: 8 - 10
J.T. Attention was called yesterday to the apostle Paul's remark as to fatherhood, that although the Corinthians had ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet they had not many fathers. Also that he had begotten them through the gospel, therefore he was a father, not only in stature, but as begetting a spiritual family. Now in the second letter to Corinth he appeals to them as a father to his children, to become enlarged. His heart had become enlarged towards them, repentance having been wrought among them in regard to certain things; and then he proceeds to say, "Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers" (@2 Corinthians 6: 14); going on to the promise of God, that He would be a Father to us and we His sons and daughters on the ground of separation. It seems as if the second letter to Corinth should be viewed as entering into our reading today; the fatherhood of God known by us in a practical way here below on the ground of our separation.
Abraham represented this great principle of separation, and hence the great truth of the family comes into his history, especially the matter of fatherhood, for that is what is alluded to by the Spirit in @Hebrews 11, that he, "being called, obeyed to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and went out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he sojourned as a stranger in the land of promise as a foreign country, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise". That is, he carries the thought of fatherhood to his own son and to his grandson; showing the idea is to run down as far as we may have power to exercise it. So that we have in Joseph the principle as to how long a father or a grandfather or a great-grandfather may exercise influence for good in his descendants. Of Joseph it is said that he lived
{411}
110 years, "and Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph's knees" (@Genesis 50: 23).
So that it would appear that we should have 2 Corinthians in mind, as showing how the thought of fathers continued in the apostle Paul in regard of the family at Corinth, and how it culminated in the promise of God to us as christians, that as we are separate He would become a Father to us and we be His sons and daughters. The apostle justly adds in the words that follow: "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear" (@2 Corinthians 7: 1).
R.W.S. Does the failure to exercise that principle of separation hinder Abraham earlier? He is told to move, but is hindered by his own father from moving.
J.T. He was influenced by his father unduly; and there can be no doubt that the lessons learned through other members of his family coming with him had in mind his own discipline, so that when Isaac was born he should be a disciplined father. He was a father developed under God's discipline so that he should know how to look after his children, which he was able to do, because it is stressed in Hebrews that he "dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise". Esau is not mentioned, nor Ishmael, showing the holy discrimination against evil in our children that enters into fatherhood.
A.R. That came in the first chapter we read: there was another product in the household, Ishmael.
J.T. That is important. It brought out further traits in Abraham, that whilst he was a real man of affection and loved Ishmael his son, yet in relation to his house he had in a particular way to go through exercise to learn righteousness, and it worked out through his wife. He learned to submit to what was right, to own that he himself was wrong in allowing
{412}
natural feelings to rule him contrary to the mind of God. Sarah's word to him, "Cast out the maid servant and her son" (@Galatians 4: 30), is highly honoured in that it becomes Scripture.
J.B. So that what the Lord has said as to separation is to mark us, is it not? Abraham moved in relation to what the Lord said.
.J.T. Quite so, and in his case it was accompanied with great incentive, because it was the God of glory that appeared to him; not yet the glory of God; in our chapter it is the glory of God; at least, there is glory in Jehovah's appearing to him, but in calling him, God is spoken of as the God of glory. That would indicate it would be worth his while. And he obeyed.
H.G.H. Are not these promises to Abraham on the line of encouragement, and similarly those to which you have referred in 2 Corinthians, an encouragement to holiness?
J.T. They are. The idea of progression in Paul's own mind in regard of a father is seen in the second epistle, as if the family of God is viewed as a refractory family to a great extent in Corinth, but yet care for it persists; and a great incentive to separation is added in chapters 6 and 7, that makes it worth while: "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty". The allusion is clearly to Abraham, because that is the name taken by God in this passage in @Genesis 17: "I am the Almighty God: walk before my face, and be perfect".
J.W.D. Why do you think Terah called his son Abram -- *High father*? Do you think he had a conception of God as Father, of fatherhood apart from that which had to be judged?
J.T. Well, I think the naming was under God. Whatever Terah may have thought, the term *High father* would refer to moral elevation, that is elevation morally above what was current either in Mesopotamia,
{413}
or in Canaan. Terah was not called, but the generations of Terah have an important place in the book of Genesis, because of public history, just as certain others have, like those of Ishmael. In chapter 11 it says, "And these are the generations of Terah", alluding to a stock of people whence sprang several that were connected directly with the testimony, especially Abraham. The sisterhood in Israel or among God's people sprang also from Terah; so that, whatever Terah may have been personally, under God, he evidently was somewhat of a father, and had in his mind that Abraham should be one, calling him by his name.
R.W.S. Is there a moral link with Noah in Abraham?
J.T. I think so. Noah is said to be an heir of the righteousness which is by faith; an heir of it. The righteousness which is by faith came, in I think, through Abraham. Of course, righteousness was there in Noah, but this is the righteousness which is by faith; that principle belongs to our own dispensation. Noah became heir of that, and so comes into the line of Abraham. It is a very important matter that we have not simply righteousness by itself; Paul says, "not having my righteousness, which would be on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ" (@Philippians 3: 9), that kind of righteousness. We must have that kind of righteousness to be in the line of Abraham.
C.A.M. I would like to ask you about the covenant in the early part of chapter 17. Would you say that to make advance in this matter we should have some special understanding with God?
J.T. Well, we have come now to the chapter especially in view for this reading. What we have been saying is preliminary and disciplinary, because Abraham had to be brought into this through a long and painful history, especially as to his family according to the flesh. He had to learn that God's aim in taking him up was a family after the Spirit, "a wholly right
{414}
seed", and discipline entered into that; so that the *High father* is developed and now his name is changed into Abraham -- *Father of a multitude*. It is due to him morally that he should have a multitude as a family because of his qualities. These qualities are largely built up through discipline over a long period. Hence in this chapter God is speaking to him as a man speaks to his fellow; in verse 3 He says to Abram, "It is I". "And Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him, saying, It is I: behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of a multitude of nations. And thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of a multitude of nations have I made thee". The chapter is full of the thought of the covenant. I think it is brought in here because of Abraham's reliability, his moral worth, that God would secure him on the ground of covenant.
C.A.M. Recent ministry has drawn a distinction between covenant relationship with God and the family relationship. This chapter links them together.
J.T. It does; and the idea of the covenant is important for us, not that we are brought into covenant exactly but in principle we are; that is, each believer is to have an understanding with God and God would say, I want to have an understanding with you. "It is I" -- He is saying that He Himself is speaking to you, no other, no less. He would say, 'I am speaking to you Myself. I want to be on terms of assurance with you; I want to commit Myself to you. I know what you have to contend with as bringing up a family in this world; and I want to assure you of My committal to you', because -- as it is said later regarding Abraham, "I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him" (@Genesis 18: 19). God watches us as young men and young women in view of this relation, and He knows what we have to contend with in it and would assure us that He is standing by us.
{415}
A.B. Is that why the apostle in @2 Corinthians 1: 21 says, "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God"?
J.T. That is the principle in that chapter. The Corinthians in their naughty attitude were questioning the veracity of the apostle and he brings this in, that God is faithful to every promise: "For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us" (verse 20).
H.G.H. Do we get the same principle here, where He reveals Himself to Abraham as the Almighty God?
J.T. That is it. If He has entered into covenant with you He is saying, 'I can stand behind it, I can support it; it is sure that you will get great benefit from it'. That is the point in 2 Corinthians. He is God Almighty. What can He not do? Hence the idea of discipline proceeds. There can be no doubt that Abraham was contemporary with Job, or nearly so. It was a peculiar time of discipline in relation to the thoughts of God; He called one man out of the gentiles, but He did not call Job out, He left him where he was, but disciplined him and Job arrives at the thought that God can do everything. God promulgates this Himself, that He is God Almighty, and Abraham is set up on covenant terms with God. There is a connection in this with every young father and young mother. God would say, 'I know what you are going through, I know the world you have to contend with, and I am ready to enter into covenant with you. It is I, the God you believed on in the gospel, and I have had you in mind in that; but it is not only to be a question of sons eternally, I am going to be a Father to you as my sons and daughters here'.
C.A.M. The idea of covenant seems to be largely in the first part of the book of Genesis. The great thought of fatherhood is developed fully towards the end.
{416}
J.T. That is so. There is very little thought of covenant in the antediluvian world; the only word as to it is what is said later, that Adam transgressed the covenant, meaning that he was set in Eden to guard and keep it; he thus was there in responsibility. He was specifically commanded not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. That is all. But the principle of covenant is there nevertheless; and in the section we are in now, that is, the postdiluvian era, God's relations with Noah are full of covenant, and they are relations that extend out to the family of Japheth particularly. God entered into covenant with Noah and his sons and with the earth itself and with the creation, and that runs right down to the present dispensation. Then when we come to Abraham, it is a call out of that world. According to Romans it had become corrupted just as the antediluvian world had become corrupted; so the epistle to the Romans teaches us as to Abraham, and how he came into covenant.
S.McC. Is it not touching how this is referred to in @Hebrews 6 over against the apostasy that was current? The apostle says, "Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath" (@Hebrews 6: 17). It is wonderful the way that God moves to confirm the heirs of the promise in these matters.
J.T. Especially in apostate conditions, as you say. According to that chapter the Jewish believers were in danger of drifting back into apostasy, into the old system, and the point is that we might have a strong consolation, "by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible that God should lie" (verse 18). That is, there was an oath attached to the position, and a promise. The oath involves the covenant, so that we are set up; whether it be in our natural relations as parents with children, or as brethren, we find that God stands by us, and I think that is how it works out in Corinth. Paul developed
{417}
fatherhood in relation to the Corinthians and brings out this great thought of God the Almighty.
A.E.H. That seems to be the carrying out of separation on the inward side, whether in the natural relationships or in the assembly. We are not so much tested in relation to baptism in our houses when our children are small and we can keep things out and keep them separate; but when they get older it is more difficult. So the principle of circumcision comes in and the declaration of God Almighty.
J.T. Quite so. Thus the flesh must be rendered powerless, and this can only be by the Spirit. We do not rely on the power of the flesh any more. Our side of the covenant is, as it were, in our flesh, that is, the evidence of circumcision. Paul says, "for when I am weak, then I am powerful" (@2 Corinthians 12: 10). You do not rely on natural effort in the exercise of parenthood, it is the power of God. Our side is circumcision; God says it is to be in your flesh; a present thing all the time.
J.B. The end of @Exodus 4 helps us in connection with this. Immediately after God speaks of Israel as His son, His first-born, Moses has to deal with circumcision in his own son.
J.T. His wife was not with him, that was the great difficulty; whereas in Abraham's case his wife was with him, and he was the failing one. Zipporah was not much in it, indeed she reproves her husband because of it. But we have the great fact here that God sought to kill Moses because of failure in the execution of circumcision -- one of the most remarkable things in Scripture! The mark of circumcision was in himself and why did he not carry it out in regard of his son?
J.H. What link is there in this matter of the covenant with what we have in the previous chapter?
J.T. The previous chapter is a contrivance after the flesh. God is not going to set us up in that. It is after that had happened that we get this chapter, because in
{418}
chapter 15 Abraham is seen troubled over this matter. He says to the Lord, "what wilt thou give me? seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus. And Abram said, Lo, to me thou hast given no seed, and behold, a son of my house will be mine heir. And behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, saying, This shall not be thine heir, but he that will come forth out of thy body shall be thine heir. And he led him out, and said, Look now towards the heavens, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them. And he said to him, So shall thy seed be! And he believed Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him as righteousness" (@Genesis 15: 2 - 6). Here he comes into the righteousness which is by faith. He was distressed over the want of an heir, that he must go childless. This scripture in chapter 15 is the first in which we have the actual expression, 'the word of God'. The word of God enters into the chapter twice, which is remarkable: "After these things the word of Jehovah came to Abram", verse 1, and again in verse 4, "behold, the word of Jehovah came to him". But as seen in chapter 16 he went against the word of God, because God had said, You shall have an heir; and he ought to have relied on God; whereas Sarah proposes something else and hence the deviation from the word of God, which brings in an Ishmael that had to be cast out. Now in this chapter we are on the platform of the word of God, and not only that, but Jehovah appearing and entering into covenant on personal grounds, as if God were saying, I have followed your history, and I know I can trust you now. This is a great chapter. The time had come for it.
A.R. Is there a suggestion that if God has taken up any one of us He will never give us up?
J.T. Yes. When He takes one up definitely He says, so to speak, That is my work. That is the principle now. Jeremiah is told to go down to the potter's place and see what is going on. Well, the potter was working
{419}
away; God was working, and He made a vessel and it was marred. It was thrown away, not repaired, but thrown away, and He made another vessel that pleased Him. That is christianity. So that what God is doing now is pleasing Him; He is not casting it away. That is most encouraging. If God takes me on He will hold me; the Lord says, No one shall pluck My sheep out of My Father's hand, nor out of My hand.
S.W.P. Is that why He changes Abraham's name here? As He proceeds in the development of His great thoughts towards him He gives him a name which would develop personality.
J.T. That is right. It is the God of glory that is speaking to him, the God that had begun with him according to what Stephen says. And now Jehovah is appearing to him with a view to the fulfilment of His purpose concerning Abraham. The counsels of God entered into this matter; that He had had Abraham in His mind. He had waited for this period so that Abraham might be reliable, consciously brought into reliability, so that God might speak to him as one individual to another.
A.R. His history after he is called would lead one to think that God might change His mind and take up somebody else. He went down to Egypt and acquired an Egyptian handmaid and as a result had a mongrel in his house. In spite of that God says, I am going on with him. It is really very remarkable.
J.T. It is very encouraging, so that God says later, I called Abraham alone and I blessed him. However small we may be we cannot be less than we were when God called us. God says, I called him alone and blessed him and made him a father of a multitude of nations, (@Isaiah 51: 2). So that the bigness of the result as in the mind of God is to be before us.
S.McC. These elevated thoughts should help us in the various practical issues that we are having to
{420}
face in these parts, the thought of the covenant imparting a measure of stability to the soul in relation to God, so that we go through things as steadied under the influence of it.
J.T. Quite so. I think that God has greatly helped us in relation to the authorities in this country. That it should be so is remarkable, because it is a country of independency from the outset; but it looks as if God would say to us, 'It is of Me, in My government of the world, that this country should be opened up and peopled by such as are here, and now in the present crisis it affords what is needed'. So that in our prayers we do not think of the matter of great wealth on this continent as an accident, but that it is a question of government. God has had His testimony in mind and knew what would be needed in these last days, so that He had this great reservoir of resources; and not only so, but also a certain sort of favourableness with the government towards God's people. That is not accidental at all. It is a deliberate arrangement of God in the way of foresight, so that the Spirit of God has a measure of liberty and we can go on. It is a very great matter that this country and the British Empire are favourable to God's people at the present time, because if they were not we should have a very different situation from what we have.
S.McC. It is important that we should regard what you have said, the history that enters into the matter rather than the mere existing situation by itself.
J.T. It is well to take up the history. In our consideration of Noah we must bear in mind that, whilst it is Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the order of the names is from the standpoint of the counsels of God; that is, Shem has the first place in the counsels of God. But in the government of God Japheth has the first place since Nebuchadnezzar, and he has the first place now, so that we know how to regulate our prayers accordingly.
{421}
Japheth's name means enlargement, but it is enlargement in certain directions, the west and the north. When Paul was exercised about where he should go to serve, the Spirit of Jesus said to him, You must go this way. Paul says, He suffered us not to go that way, but this way, that is, towards Europe. And presently the man of Macedonia appeared saying, "Pass over into Macedonia and help us" (@Acts 16: 9). That is the voice of God. It was a man, and yet it was women that the apostle met first when he went over. But in due course the man appeared and has stood in Europe ever since. The point is that he should stand there now.
J.W.D. Do you think that is involved in the word to Philadelphia as to the opened door? There would be the key of David and the idea of opening and no one shutting, and shutting and no one opening. Would you put all that into what you are speaking of?
J.T. I would. The opened door has been in this direction; we are a witness to it. Why are we here? It is under the government of God we are here, and as here we are not forgetting God. God has followed us up, but still there is the idea of a covenant.
S.R.MacC. "And a rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald" (@Revelation 4: 3). Would that enter into what we are saying? Is that the covenant idea?
J.T. Yes; that covenant stands. So that when the Lord comes down according to @Revelation 10, and puts His right foot on the sea and His left on the earth and roars like a lion, He has the sign of the covenant round His head. You can see what a place the sea has in modern times. The Mediterranean always had a place even in the ancient world, but think of how much depends on the seas today! In the government of God those who hold the seas hold the power, and if they are protecting the rights of God, God will give them the power. God is asserting His rights in the testimony in that way.
{422}
A.R. When you say Shem had the first place in the counsels of God, do you mean in relation to God's ways?
J.T. In relation to Abraham. You can see in chapter 10 of Genesis that Shem came in in relation to the other two sons of Noah, but in chapter 11 he comes in by himself. There it says, "These are the generations of Shem", verse 10, and the generations are carried down to Abraham. That is the reason I think that Moses speaking from the standpoint of Israel and of God's testimony puts Shem first; because he is morally first.
A.E.H. Would you say that the first surge of spiritual development reached out towards Europe, and that the records of decadence and apostasy also find their place there; and the seeds gradually grow?
J.T. Yes. Let us not forget it. How quickly things may turn around! The seeds of apostasy are there; that is the basis of the book of Revelation -- the apostasy of Europe.
A.R. Have you in mind that God has counsels in relation to heaven as well as to earth?
J.T. Yes; quite so. It is in relation to earth here, for in chapter 15 God leads Abraham out and says, "Look now toward the heavens, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them. And he said to him, So shall thy seed be! And he believed Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him as righteousness" (verse 5). That is the great universal thought. And then in chapter 17 the word is, "And thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of a multitude of nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee", verses 5, 6. So that it is more the earth that is in mind here.
R.W.S. Is the lack of fatherhood on this continent because of its newness, or because of the material at hand?
{423}
J.T. I think the idea of experience with God has little place, and even the idea of fatherhood in the ordinary sense has little place, because the importance of youth is so greatly stressed in this country. Those who immigrated here were young people and were usually able to do things, and when they came to this country they thought there was no limit to what could be done. That is what developed, great universal independency in youth and great feminine independency. Japheth is called 'the elder;' I believe he was the eldest of the three, which would mean he had fatherly qualities in the ordinary government of God; but in immigration that thought became greatly attenuated, because there was no need to refer to the parents at all. Those of us who have lived only in the last quarter of a century can hardly realise what immigration there was previously from Europe to this country. About a million people came into New York harbour every year, mostly all young people, and each set to make money and be something. The idea of a father and mother was in the mind of those who would send a gift to parents left in the mother countries, but in them authority was but little recognised. Let us not forget that that condition still exists in some measure.
S.McC. Is it not remarkable that, in the genealogies in Chronicles, that of Japheth is developed first? The order is given in verse 4, "Shem, Ham, and Japheth". Then it immediately proceeds, "The sons of Japheth", verse 5. Do you think there is in mind in the Chronicles the expansion at the hand of David?
J.T. The Chronicles were written in the light of the captivity, and of the gentile monarchies coming in; but David is brought in quickly because he represents direct authority from God. Nebuchadnezzar did not represent that. He represented indirect authority from God, and this country comes under that; but David
{424}
represents direct authority. And as our brother remarks, it enters into the word to Philadelphia, that the Lord has the key of David, that *kind* of key. We are relying for the moment on the external government of God in the four monarchies, and we pray for them; but the key of David is in the hand of Christ, that is direct government from God, and presently it will come in here. *We* want to be under the key of David now. If it were not for that I would want to put in the best man possible in Washington. It is a question of the key of David; we are concerned about that.
R.W. S. Has the assembly what results from that key?
J.T. Yes; we come into that; the power that shuts and opens. It is the power that keeps things in check, the spiritual power that restrains antichrist. That is the key of David.
A.R. At the end of Revelation the Lord says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies. I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star" (@Revelation 22: 16).
J.T. It is remarkable how David comes into the book of Revelation. In the passage quoted it is the Lord asserting Himself, because it is more than the key now. He is "the root", meaning that He is God; and "the offspring", that He is Man. You come into the light of the Person of Christ, the Son of God, who He is. He exercises divine right. He is God, but He is also in manhood, He is with us. The assembly of course enters into all that, because the Spirit and the bride say, Come.
J.W.W. You have alluded to the four monarchies. Would you be prepared to recognise them, but above all having the Son of God paramount?
J.T. I think that is the thought; because in figure the Son of God appeared in the furnace. The position of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in the furnace is the general position of the testimony today. But
{425}
Nebuchadnezzar sees a fourth: the fourth is Jesus. He comes out of heaven according to @Revelation 19 as "King of kings and Lord of lords", the very title that Nebuchadnezzar had; King of kings. So that we see the Son of God and how everything hinges on Him. Hence the importance of what we have had in recent years -- the truth about the Son of God. He is going to take up the reins of government.
J.W.W. I was thinking about the saints in Zechariah's day: would the chariots and horses in chapter 6 be similar in character?
J.T. It is the same thing, only there it is the four spirits of the heavens that stand before God, and that gives them a very great and peculiar place.
A.R. What you say is very interesting. Publicly we recognise indirect government, but in the assembly we recognise direct government, and that is what is regulating us.
J.T. Yes. The Son is over the house. And so He says to Thyatira, "These things says the Son of God" (@Revelation 2: 18). He will presently take up the whole government, but He has to do with the assembly now.
T.S. Are the authorities in some measure seeing now what Nebuchadnezzar saw in his day?
J.T. You hope they see something like what Nebuchadnezzar saw in the three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. One has often called attention to that chapter. These three men are mentioned together thirteen times in that chapter. The Spirit of God delights in them, these sufferers, and the Son of God joins them in the suffering. The young men are coming before the authorities today -- in what manner? Is it in the Spirit of Jesus? If it is, then you may be sure the Fourth will be there, the Son of God will be there.
A.R. Is that why Peter says, "God must be obeyed rather than men" (@Acts 5: 29)? As christians we are under the direct government of heaven.
{426}
J.T. That is a very important matter in our care meetings and the like. It is the Son of God that we have to do with. Paul said to the Corinthians, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea is in him" (@2 Corinthians 1: 19). That bears on the state of Corinth. They had to do with the Son of God. God had called them into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
J.W.D. Why do you think that government in Paul's time was not favourable to the testimony? He speaks of the lion's mouth in regard to the Roman monarch in his day.
J.T. Well, that is true, but that would be because of a certain personal incitement; but abstractly the Romans were in favour of fairness, indeed the empire was constituted on the principle of fairness. But it was largely Jewish influence that brought in persecution. The lion was there, however, capable of being stirred up. Even Pilate was at first in favour of the Lord.
S.McC. Is it not remarkable that in the book of Acts, which gives us the economy of the assembly, the last seven chapters should be devoted to details in connection with one man in relation to the authorities? From the 21st to the 28th chapters it is really Paul in relation to the powers that be.
J.T. That is an interesting fact and I think it brings out what we have been saying about discipline. We get the best results from disciplinary history in the apostles, in what comes down to us in the Scriptures. The discipline the apostle Paul went through must have been to bring out in him the very best that God had. We must take account of God's feelings; in Noah's day He says, I am grieved in My heart about things, and He says of man that, "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart" is "only evil continually" (@Genesis 6: 5). God had much in his heart. And we see in the latter part of
{427}
Acts that things were so turning in the history of the assembly that Jewish elements were becoming more and more pronounced. Paul went to Jerusalem, which was the very centre of christianity; there was the appearance outwardly of christianity, but no care for Paul. They let him go! They did not help him against the authorities, nor did they help the authorities against him. It was his nephew that helped him. That is a sorrowful situation, displeasing to God, and God would say that Jerusalem is apathetic; the doors of the temple were shut just then, that situation is finished. Well, what is to become of Paul? Here is a man with all the thoughts of God in his heart, and what became of him is long imprisonment at Caesarea and two years in Rome. God says, I will get the very best through this vessel now. It is wonderful in the ways of God how things are carried on through discipline. We get the very best through Paul while in his imprisonment. Nero represents the lion in the Roman system. Paul says, "But the Lord stood with me, and gave me power, that through me the proclamation might be fully made ... and I was delivered out of the lion's mouth" (@2 Timothy 4: 17). That is the position, extreme weakness and yet the very best coming out from God for His people. That is very encouraging for our times. If we accept the discipline of God He will let His heart be known to us, and we want to have part in the disclosures of His love.
J.B. Do you get in @2 Corinthians 2 the feelings of Paul as under discipline, under grief and so on; and then in the third chapter joy in relation to God and His glory?
J.T. The second epistle shows how God came in in answer to repentance. It is a question there of repentance. Whatever is wrong, if you repent of it God will come in for you; and that is what happened in Corinth.
A.R. I like what you say about getting the best under such circumstances. I suppose we get the best
{428}
from Paul, as he writes to us as a prisoner of Christ Jesus and a prisoner in the Lord in his letter to the saints at Ephesus.
J.H. Do we see that in Abraham? Do we get the very best faith in him through discipline, illustrated in @Genesis 18, 22 and 24?
J.T. That is all constructive; chapter 17 being the basis in the covenant. Circumcision, the word to Abraham, is carried out, and God appears to him again as seen in chapter 18. Then, in chapter 21, he casts out the bondwoman and her son, under the influence of Sarah. Sarah comes in here in chapter 21 as a type of the assembly now, Jerusalem above; Jerusalem above has great influence. She influenced Abraham to cast out the bondwoman and her son; she is 'free', Paul says. Then we have in chapter 22 the beautiful type of the Father offering up the Son. It is the very top note of our subject, bringing out the place the Son has with the Father. It is a very touching chapter, having its counterpart in @John 1: 14: "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth". The Father and the Son come before us here in the truth of sacrifice, and the assembly comes into view in Rebecca at the end of the chapter. Then in chapter 24 we have Abraham's desire and concern as to a wife for his only-begotten son. Hence he selects the servant, the eldest of his house, whose name is not given. We have the name given in chapter 15, but not here; it is the eldest in his house, we are dealing with fatherhood. This one is not simply a superior servant of the house, but the eldest in the house; it is a question of experience. He is a type of the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father; meaning that He issues forth from God in that relation, knowing as the Spirit did, when the Son was down here, the movements of the Father's heart towards Him at the Jordan and elsewhere.
{429}
J.H. How would this work out practically in putting the servant under oath?
J.T. It works out in the Spirit, the infinite reliability of the Spirit. That is what is meant in the type. There is no deviation; there is wonderful accuracy in the Spirit's movements in regard of Abraham. And how skilfully He links up the mastership of Isaac in the end of the chapter, bringing out the Deity in the three Persons.
S.R.MacC. Does the Spirit now do it mediately through His servants?
J.T. That is how He is operating now. "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul" (@Acts 13: 2). He had been working in others earlier, but the time for them had come now.
A.B. In chapter 17 the covenant would be from God's side; it is God speaking to Abraham. Here in chapter 24 Abraham is taking the thing on and is covenanting with the Spirit, so to speak.
J.T. That is the way you might look at it. @John 15: 26 brings out the Spirit from this point of view; He proceeds from the Father as having been with the Father. It is remarkable phraseology: "who goes forth from with the Father". The Lord stresses that as showing what a witness should ensue, involving Paul's testimony and the testimony right down to the present moment where the Spirit speaks to the assembly. But then He says to the apostles, "ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from the beginning" (@John 15: 27). They were witnesses of the Father's voice and of sonship, but the Holy Spirit came out as from "with the Father", knowing perfectly the Father's feelings for the Son.
A.R. It says in @Ephesians 3: 16, "... strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man". Is that confirmatory of what you have been saying.
J.T. Yes; the Father's Spirit is before us.
{430}
A.R. Does the Holy Spirit operating develop those features?
J.T. That is what I had been thinking in view of all that is to be developed in the assembly. That doxology in @Ephesians 3: 21, "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages", is one of the most significant in the Scriptures. It is "in the assembly", and the assembly as affected by the Father's Spirit operating in us.
A.B. What is in mind in putting the hand under the thigh?
J.T. It was some form of an oath, but I suppose it would mean the full strength of Abraham. I suppose the thigh is a symbol of strength.
R.W.S. The crying in @Romans 8 does not go so far as in Galatians, "the Spirit of his Son ... crying, Abba, Father".
J.T. I think the word 'cry' in Romans would be urgency. You have the same expression in @Galatians 4: 6. The Lord was in great urgency in Gethsemane when He used that expression, and I think it ascended to heaven in that way; and now the Holy Spirit in us is governed by the same impetus or feeling of urgency, the sense of reality. It is not simply saying it, but crying it. The Lord Jesus Himself is said to have cried: "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink" (@John 7: 37). It is urgency, so that we should not be behind in the expression.
T.U. In dwelling on the thought of fatherhood on the ground of separation, I was wondering whether chapter 24 would carry that through and find its expression here in Abraham?
J.T. Yes. It is very beautiful as you go through this longest chapter in the book. The Spirit, in the servant, brings in the thought of master in Isaac: "That is my master", he says, putting Isaac on the same footing as Abraham. That is what the Spirit
{431}
would do, ever maintain the deity of Christ, so that this chapter would teach us to make much of Him.
And then finally to speak of the reference in @Hebrews 11 -- the dwelling of Abraham in tents with Isaac and Jacob is a feature of fatherhood. It is very practical that fatherhood extends down direct from grandfather to father, great-grandfather to grandfather, as if God would carry down whatever good there is in the way of fatherhood and preserve it. "By faith he sojourned as a stranger in the land of promise as a foreign country, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise" (@Hebrews 11: 9), a very beautiful thought. He links up his son and grandson as heirs with him of the same promise. Can we afford to leave our fathers¬ houses, forsake them, abandon the inheritance that comes to us in that way? Esau did that. He was in no way sharer of the inheritance. He is not mentioned here at all. It is a sorrowful suggestion that a son or a daughter in a father's house may become apostate.
C.A.M. I suppose the making known of the Father's name is not in a moment. You have to dwell on the thing to take in the wonderful love shining out. I was thinking of @John 17 in connection with what you were saying as to the Spirit coming from with the Father; while the Lord when He was here made the Father's love and the Father's self known, yet it seems to greatly stress the blessedness of it that the Holy Spirit, knowing all that transpired during the Lord's life, is here now to make it good in us.
J.T. That is very touching.
{432}
FATHERHOOD (4)
@Genesis 25: 19 - 21, 27, 28; @Genesis 27: 1 - 5; @Genesis 28: 1 - 5
The term *fathers* which runs through the Scriptures, alludes to this book, the book of Genesis. It alludes to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and sometimes to the twelve tribes, so that the book has a great place even from this point of view, and especially in view of the present need of fathers. God entered on the matter especially in Abraham. There were other fathers, but God entered on the matter definitely in Abraham, having in mind to work out fatherhood in his family especially, as we had yesterday, in His promise that He would be a Father to those who are separate. "Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not what is unclean, and *I* will receive you; and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty" (@2 Corinthians 6: 17, 18).
The truth comes directly to us from God Himself in the New Testament and is worked out by Paul. John alludes to it first from the standpoint of growth in the family, and then Paul from the standpoint of one who would beget a spiritual family, represented in Timotheus and others. Now it is a question of what Isaac represents in this subject, and it will be readily observed that in the passage read it is the real Isaac, not the typical one, and shows the actual kind of man that he was. Each father acquires a place in the testimony from the standpoint of this book, and Isaac has a great place from that point of view. We have to look at the real Isaac, the actual person, in order to see how the work of God is developed in him and particularly how fatherhood is worked out in him. One thing we should notice is that he is given a place amongst those who have *generations*. Abraham is not mentioned in that way, but Isaac is. "And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son" (@Genesis 25: 19);
{433}
and then, "Abraham begot Isaac". There is to be no mistake about who his father is. That is the point. The inquiry now is to see how fatherhood worked out in him. It shone in Abraham, is it going to shine in Isaac? Is it running down from father to son? It is said in verse 21, "And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren; and Jehovah was entreated of him", an evidence that he was exercised on this line. Fatherhood involves that there should be a family and God is to be sought about it. He is ready to consider all parental feelings and exercises.
H.G.H. Is the thought of fatherhood continued? Abraham stressed it when he sought a wife for his son; and now Isaac is concerned that the thought of fatherhood should be continued in himself.
J.T. You can see that he is moving in the light of his father because the Spirit of God mentions Abraham so definitely: "And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son;" and again, "Abraham begot Isaac". He was the one in whom Abraham's seed should be called, "for in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee" (@Genesis 21: 12); hence the importance of his taking notice of his father and developing features of fatherhood as seen in him, even to the extent of seeking a wife for Jacob when the time came.
J.R.H. Was Isaac moving in the spirit of his father when he entreated Jehovah for his wife, and also gave her a lead? It is said afterwards that she inquired of Jehovah.
J.T. Yes; both were actuated by right family principles. The Spirit of God goes on to show the spiritual equality between Isaac and Rebecca. There is often great inequality between husband and wife, but here, like Aquila and Priscilla, you have definite spiritual equality between Isaac and Rebecca. After her inquiry she gets a prophetic word from Jehovah, "Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated
{434}
from thy bowels; And one people shall be stronger than the other people, And the elder shall serve the younger" (verse 23). She gets a prophetic word from God about the family. Isaac gets an answer to his prayer and she does too, but hers is a prophetic word.
W.L. Do you think the principle of the tent spoken of in @Hebrews 11: 8, 9 would come in with Isaac here? There it says, "By faith Abraham ... dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob". Isaac takes the matter up for himself in bringing Rebecca into his mother Sarah's tent.
J.T. He is in the position now. Abraham is dead, and he occupies the ground in the testimony. So that it is a new section in verse 19, "these are the generations". There are ten of these sections in this book, and he fills out one of them. What is seen at once is this fatherly quality, because the promise depends on having seed: "In Isaac shall thy seed be called" (@Hebrews 11: 18). He is evidently exercised on this line.
J.W.D. Do you think where the Abrahamic idea of fatherhood in local meetings is beginning to work itself out that the young people are governed objectively by right thoughts, working things out in the light of the counsel and purpose of God?
J.T. You mean that the young people take note of the older ones?
J.W.D. They are right in the Genesis setting of the truth, where the qualities of fatherhood as seen in Abraham more or less dominate as light. The subjective problems work out afterwards.
J.T. You mean that Abraham sets out the idea?
J.W.D. Yes, and Isaac starts in full light and energy, but the subjective qualities have to be brought in afterwards.
J.T. The Spirit of God gives him the full place here. As older brethren are removed the testimony nevertheless goes on; this is the result of the younger
{435}
men taking up the position. It is a question of how they do it. Isaac is a model here; he has to wait twenty years without any family. In a local meeting where there is no growth, what shall be done? Clearly the meeting should not die out. It ought to be one of the greatest concerns with us if a meeting is dying out. How is it to be met? Isaac is a type for us here; he entreated Jehovah and Jehovah was entreated of him.
A.R. There should be no such thing as the local personnel of a meeting, those that remain, agreeing to let the meeting die out.
J.T. I have heard of a local meeting coming together "in assembly" to disband itself! It is a most distressing thing for a meeting to pretend that it has the power to disband itself. The thought is to entreat God for its continuation. Isaac is now sixty years of age; what can be done? There must be no subterfuge about it such as we get in @Genesis 16. Entreat God about it! If anything is to be done God alone can do it, He alone has the power of life.
J.W.D. What would you say about small towns which the young leave to go to larger cities on account of circumstances, employment, etc? Many small meetings are affected in this way. Should we count upon God in His indirect government to come in in local meetings for the young people if they are prepared to accept smaller circumstances in relation to the testimony?
J.T. That is a very important suggestion. It is worked out in Nehemiah in the opposite direction. Instead of going to the large cities they were going from Jerusalem to the country, so that a premium is offered for anyone who would dwell in Jerusalem. The matter was solved so that Jerusalem was maintained, for it was not simply a great city, but it was where God had placed His name. Are we going to let that die out for the sake of a few dollars? That is the challenge. We shall come to the matter of wages in Jacob, it does not
{436}
enter into Isaac's position. The possibility of a meeting dying out should cause exercise to everyone in it; if I move away it will die out to *that* extent.
W.L. Do you think that every local meeting, no matter how small, should maintain the preaching of the glad tidings?
J.T. Yes; "proclaim the word; be urgent in season and out of season" (@2 Timothy 4: 2). Of course divinely given ability is needed.
E.G.McA. Is there any suggestion in the thought of genealogy that the elder brethren should see that the meeting is maintained along the lines of life? I was thinking of what Isaac was as Abraham's son. He entreated God. We might try to carry on the meeting in a formal attitude without the spiritual good behind it. On the line of what he was as Abraham's son he could appeal to Jehovah for his wife.
J.T. That is the position here, and the result is twins. The test that comes in under these circumstances brings out the quality of Isaac's fatherhood, and the position is very striking here. In verses 19 to 21, in fact in the whole section, how he appeals to Jehovah, and how Rebecca appeals to Jehovah is touching and instructive. And God answers Isaac and Rebecca and gives her a prophetic word. So that the principle of outlook is furnished in connection with what is going to be.
J.H.Jr. Would you say that Simeon's attitude was one of fatherhood in receiving the Child Jesus into his arms? He was prepared not to go any further. "Now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation" (@Luke 2: 29, 30).
J.T. Fatherhood was there in Simeon. Of course he had the word for that test; it says, "according to thy word", it was not of his own option. No one should seek to leave this world of his own option; although Paul
{437}
said, "having the desire for departure and being with Christ" (@Philippians 1: 23), yet he did not have the word for it. But Simeon had the word, and he said that what had been indicated by God would happen. I think that at the present time it is a question of the brothers continuing on because there is no idea of replacement or superannuation in the house of God. A brother goes on to the end, but the point is for him to keep his eyes clear. It is said of Moses, "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated" (@Deuteronomy 34: 7).
A.E.H. Would you think that Rebecca's love for Jacob would take colour from Jehovah's answer to her supplication? He was not only thinking of her bearing children, but of all the subsequent history.
J.T. She had the prophetic word. It is a great matter in a local meeting to have the prophetic word, and if any brother is concerned about local conditions and gets to God about it, God will give him an impression. The impression here is suggested in the conception, and there is the accompanying matter with Rebecca that she gets the prophetic word. *Rebecca* gets it. That is a wonderful thing, because then we know the end in the beginning. The responsibility is taken on, we know just what it means; Rebecca gets two boys to look after. She knows what conditions are going to be, she is going to have difficulty. "And the elder shall serve the younger", that is sure to bring in friction, but God fortifies us if we are with Him in such matters.
T.U. Does the alacrity with which God answers this exercise relative to Isaac encourage us to be persistent in our exercises as to fatherhood?
J.T. Yes, that is the word for the moment. It is a question of being persistent with God with regard to the need. Here the need of Isaac is outstanding; he is the man in whom the seed is to be called and he has no child.
J.W.B. Would Paul's fatherhood be seen in @Acts 20: 17?
{438}
"But from Miletus having sent to Ephesus, he called over to him the elders of the assembly". He was seeking to continue what was at Ephesus.
J.T. That is right: "shepherd the flock of God" (@1 Peter 5: 2). What was there should continue.
A.R. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob all faced barrenness in their wives. Would that draw out fatherly feelings before their children were born?
J.T. That is a great matter to consider in connection with the family. Abraham was heir of the world, and his name was changed to mean *father of a multitude*, and not only a multitude of persons but of nations; yet he and his wife had to face this exercise of having no children. The lesson is that the children that God has in mind in His promise are spiritual in character and they must come about from God and not by nature, therefore we are dependent on Him. There can be no going on in the testimony unless by dependence on God. That is the teaching that Isaac and Rebecca represent here -- dependence on God.
A.R. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob all have conflict with nature, and we come into the assembly on the same basis.
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of the power of God. Isaac and Rebecca recognise that.
S.McC. This prophetic word is most important in its bearing on local conditions, knowing as we do the two lines and how they develop. Often there is much sorrow resulting from not having the mind of God in regard to these two lines.
J.T. That is what comes out in connection with Isaac. The word was, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called". He is shut up to that, and yet here he is childless for twenty years! What does this mean? What has Isaac to learn in all this? What have *I* to learn in it? That is a question from God. Paul says, "that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us" (@2 Corinthians 4: 7).
{439}
The Lord saying to him at Corinth, "I have much people in this city" (@Acts 18: 10), implied the power of God. In the Lord's mind this really meant *much*. Evidently there would be a large number, but how were they to be secured? Paul was an able man, an evangelist, and he had great power in preaching, but he would say, It is to be by God's power and not mine. That is really the basic thought in all service, it is a question of the power of God.
A.E.H. In the case of Jacob's wife who was barren, the cry that came from her was, "Give me children, or else I die" (@Genesis 30: 1). Jacob, at the point of despair, says, "Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
J.T. He took the right attitude. That is the lesson we are to learn in this section relative to the generations of Isaac. You must have God, or you have nothing, or worse than nothing. Isaac is upright in this matter, and pure. According to the word of the Lord later, the wholly right seed must come in, and if there is to be that there must be right marital relations. That is the idea of Christ and the assembly, so that there is a wholly right seed; people must not be allowed to come into fellowship through any sinister motives. We must be pure in our efforts to enlarge the family -- the meeting.
T.L.S. Power in prayer is much needed.
J.T. That is exactly what we get here. We are not told whether Isaac prayed several times, perhaps he did. All that is said is, "Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren". That is not mere prayer, it is like Elijah's prayer; he "prayed with prayer" (@James 5: 17). That is, he earnestly sought it; compare @1 Kings 18: 42. It is as if I said to Jehovah, It *must* be. It must *indeed* be, from the divine side, because God has said, "in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee".
J.W.W. How does the principle of election work out in connection with the exercise or prayer?
{440}
J.T. I was remarking that it *must* be, that is the position. Isaac knew something of the counsels of God about this matter. If you look at @Romans 9: 6 - 13, which deals with this very point, it says, "Not however as though the word of God had failed; for not all are Israel which are of Israel; nor because they are seed of Abraham are all children: but, In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee. That is, they that are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed. For this word is of promise, According to this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah. And not only that, but Rebecca having conceived by one, Isaac our father, the children indeed being not yet born, or having done anything good or worthless (that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works, but of him that calls), it was said to her, The greater shall serve the less: according as it is written, I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau". Now that covers the position we are considering. It alludes to this very section with which we are dealing. It is a question of God, and Isaac's prayer would undoubtedly enter into it, in the word 'entreat', the matter of divine obligations, in that God was committed to this matter; and God likes that. Elijah said to Elisha, You have asked a hard matter, but you will get it under certain circumstances, showing that we must be alert as to God's answers to our prayers.
C.A.M. So that Isaac's word *entreat* would be counting on the prophetic word. Rebecca's word *inquire* would perhaps be answered by prophetic ministry as to what the struggle meant.
J.T. I think she would pray that the result might be a continuing matter following her husband's entreaty and her inquiry. And God granted her light as to the future, showing her what she would have to contend with and what He was going to do.
H.G.H. Verse 28 says, "and Rebecca loved Jacob;"
{441}
was she moving in the light of the prophetic word she had received?
J.T. Yes. The point now is, after these two prayers, How are we governed? Are we governed in our attitude of mind according to what we have prayed? In the conception I form, what do I think of Jacob and Esau? Divisions of mind come up amongst us one over against the other, but we can see that Rebecca was governed by the revelation, by the prophetic word, and she loved Jacob. No doubt he was lovable, but she was undoubtedly governed by the prophetic word.
J.V. Verses 27 and 28 would test as to the thought of fatherhood: "And the boys grew, and Esau became a man skilled in hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob was a homely man, dwelling in tents. And Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste; and Rebecca loved Jacob". They show what Esau became and what Jacob became and Isaac in relation to them.
J.T. It is a question of development. What will these two boys be? They are before their father and mother day in and day out, and it is said that Isaac loved Esau, and we are told why: "And Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste". Rebecca loved Jacob. Why did she love him? It is not stated, but we cannot help assuming that she was governed by the prophetic word.
J.R.H. Is there not the moral side? Esau shows himself to be on the Nimrod line and Jacob on the Abraham line.
J.T. Why did Isaac love Esau? By his preference for him his fatherhood is marred and discredited, and that is a solemn fact. If I am given to tastes that discredit my fatherhood I must renounce them. Isaac failed in this.
E.G.McA. Is that to indicate that we should not, in our local meetings, go along specially with those who have similar natural tastes?
{442}
J.T. That is good. We do not affiliate with persons who are likeable because their tastes or point of view agree with ours. That is what comes out in Isaac; he had a taste for venison, and this influenced him unduly.
J.W.D. Esau must have inherited the weakness in Isaac's fatherhood. Where weakness develops in local meetings, do you not think we have to humble ourselves in that relation?
J.T. Natural preferences are very prevalent in gatherings, certain ones drawing to one another, involving cleavage. Suppose we picture Isaac and Rebecca conversing about the two boys when they have gone out. The parents are not of one mind. They cannot go very far because there is no communion together on this point. You may say that it is not very much, but it is a matter of the prophetic word of God, and Isaac is veering away from it. It is beautiful to see how intelligent Rebecca is in regard to it. The next section shows how humbling this matter of Isaac was when the boys grew up. If Adam had been there with his ability he would have named Esau in accord with his propensities and Jacob in accord with his. The Lord as the true Adam named Peter according to what he would be; He called him "Cephas". Here the boys grow, and from Isaac's point of view Esau is a lovable man, though a despiser of the promise, a man of the field, a football player, one who goes in for everything worldly with no interest in the things of God. He despises his inheritance, and yet his father, the most godly man of the moment, loves him instead of the other. You wonder how it happens, excellent brothers turned aside on certain things.
S.W.P. Paul has a like-minded son in Timotheus: "For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on" (@Philippians 2: 20). Timothy could think along the same lines as his spiritual father, the apostle.
{443}
J.T. Paul could confide in him and could trust him.
J.W.B. Would Barnabas seen at the end of @Acts 15 be marked out as having the same tastes as Mark so that he did not continue with Paul?
J.T. Yes; there were natural links between the two.
J.W.W. Would the Rebecca line be maintained in the house of Chloe at Corinth and the Isaac line be seen in what was partisan? "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" (@1 Corinthians 1: 12).
J.T. Yes, I think so. What a name Chloe had! She had thoughts loyal to Christ.
J.W.W. "For it has been shewn to me concerning you my brethren, by those of the house of Chloe", verse 11. Would she not be in the preservation of the Jacob side?
J.T. Clearly. That shows where she was, she had right thoughts, that there should be no division amongst the brethren. We should be of one mind. It is the first thing that Paul himself enjoins in regard to what he heard from that sister, that there should be no divisions amongst them.
T.L.S. In the case of Timotheus, it is said that his father was a Greek. That would make the ministry of Paul as a father all the greater.
J.T. Yes, he evidently overcame that disadvantage in Timothy. He became his true father, overcoming the Greek element in him. The Greek element is very strong, especially in these war times, and natural feelings are very distressing, even going to the extent of evil in identifying ourselves with wicked national conduct. Evidently the Greek element is overcome in Timothy as he comes under the influence of Paul, but the right line also runs through the mother and the grandmother.
J.R.H. In the cases of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Abraham was greatly attached to Ishmael at first, but he got adjusted as to that; then there was this weakness
{444}
with Isaac that we have been considering; but Jacob comes into the gain of it all.
J.T. The humbling thing about Isaac is that the failure of denying his wife comes in as it did with his father. He did not go down to Egypt because God told him not to do so, but he did deny his wife. He did not profit by the negative side of his father. In the same way here, he did not profit by his father's attachment to Ishmael; in fact, it seems Abraham would have kept Ishmael in the full status of the first-born of his house.
J.R.H. I wonder if Jacob gets the gain of this in the fact that he loved Joseph more than all his sons?
J.T. Yes, and yet when we come to Jacob we shall see that he loved him "because he was the son of his old age". That is to be noted, but generally Scripture shows that Joseph was lovable in a personal sense and that this enters into his father's love for him.
J.W.B. If I as a father allow my children to go in for sports and other worldly features, does that bring out my tastes also? I am characterised by what I allow my children to do.
J.T. It may be so. What we want to bring out now is how fathers are to consider children. The boys grew before Isaac's eyes, and what was drawn out in him was love for a man of the field. "Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste". That shows clearly a defect in Isaac. Jacob loved Joseph, as we noted, because he was the son of his old age. That in itself is not much, but still he loved him, and Scripture shows, as remarked, that he also loved him because of character, because of personal lovableness. But here we have the greatest man of his day, Isaac, the depository of the counsels of God, and figuratively the object of them, and yet he is diverted by a man of the field and by a taste for venison. His wife got a different view and hence they could not have had much communion in conversing about their children. The position, therefore, was weak. That
{445}
should not be. Think of a husband and wife having diverse thoughts about the most important thing! because the family here was most important; the family was to be called in Isaac.
W.W. Why do you think the weakness was allowed to come out in the head?
J.T. It shows how any father may give way. What we are dealing with is to exercise all fathers as to how we allow things to develop unjudged in our children.
A.R. If such conditions develop in the natural family we may be assured that they are bound to creep into the assembly; if the responsible element is not in agreement with the spiritual there will be division, at least, division of thought, hindering fellowship.
J.T. We know something about that, wives and husbands not having the same mind. Why should it be? One of the most important features of the truth comes up and the husband and wife have not the same mind. Here Isaac is influenced wrongly and Rebecca is in the right, governed by divine principles as to her children.
H.G.H. Why was the prophetic word given to Rebecca and not carried on to Isaac?
J.T. She had right family exercises, as we have seen, and these were honoured by God. Isaac should have profited by the prophetic word to his wife. We may be sure she did not hide it from him. How much comes before us in prophetic meetings, ministry that we like, but we do not seem to profit by it! You cannot imagine that Rebecca did not tell Isaac of this prophetic word which she had from Jehovah. Isaac should have said at once, 'I must not, then, let my mind rest on Esau'.
P.G. In chapter 28: 1 "Isaac called Jacob". Do you not think that Isaac is quite recovered here in regard to the right man?
J.T. Yes; but it seems it was through his wife. He would have let things drift.
J.W.D. With regard to mixed households, what
{446}
great care was taken in relation to Rebecca's genealogy! If a man marries an unspiritually minded young woman what can he expect in after life in the government of God? Reference is made to who Rebecca was; very particular care was taken along that line.
J.T. Yes. If Isaac had an unspiritual wife, where would he have gone in this matter? She saved him, and no doubt that is why her genealogy is mentioned. She belongs to the feminine side, which represents the sisterhood that God provides for His people; so that it is said that she is "the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian", chapter 25: 20. There is no question as to who she is, the whole of chapter 24 stresses it. She was carefully selected on spiritual lines. Where would Isaac have been in this crisis with an unspiritual wife? Rebecca does not support him in loving a man of the field, she stands by the man of God's purpose.
C.A.M. Scripture speaks of husband and wife being "fellow-heirs of the grace of life" (@1 Peter 3: 7). One of the great wedges that Satan tries to get in is difference of thought in regard to the children, so that prayers are hindered.
J.T. Yes. You are referring to Peter: "that your prayers be not hindered". If Isaac and Rebecca prayed in the morning there would be a dark spot, because Isaac would be praying for Esau, ignoring his unbelief and worldliness. What darkness there would be in that!
R.A. Rebecca's father is the eighth son of Nahor, she is the product of the eighth son.
J.T. She is thoroughly qualified as to the sisterhood. She comes in immediately after we have Isaac raised from the dead, chapter 22: 20 - 23. She is thoroughly of the sisterhood that God has provided for His people, that is, spiritual women.
J.W.W. What are we to learn from the activities of
{447}
Rebecca in promoting the furthering of the prophetic word, and the subterfuge she used?
J.T. The point is that she is an exercised woman, a spiritual woman. She has had a revelation from God and is maintaining the effect of it. She is equal to it. The subterfuge is to be deplored, but she does take the ground of laying down her life for the truth, "On me be thy curse, my son" (@Genesis 27: 13). She is ready to take on the curse, ready to die, we may say, for the truth of God, so that the prophetic word might go through. It must go through, and that is what Paul means in @Romans 9: 11, "that the purpose of God according to election might abide". She would die for that -- "the purpose of God according to election". Every exercised sister or brother would stand by that at all costs.
E.G.McA. So Rebecca steps in when Isaac is going to continue in his failure in chapter 27, and saves the situation again. It says, "And it came to pass when Isaac had become old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, that he called Esau", verse 1. The situation is saved by Rebecca stepping in for God, telling Jacob what to do.
J.T. Yes. Chapter 27 shows how Rebecca's spirituality continues. She is not one who is spasmodically spiritual, but, in principle, continually so, and she saves the position and saves Isaac by her devotion to the truth. She hears what he says to Esau. Think of the speech Isaac makes to Esau! "And it came to pass when Isaac had become old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, that he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, My son! And he said to him, Here am I. And he said, Behold now, I am become old; I know not the day of my death. And now, I pray thee, take thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field and hunt me venison, and prepare me a savoury dish such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, in order that my soul may bless thee before I die" (@Genesis 27: 1 - 4). Think
{448}
of a man who is an object of the counsels of God speaking about the weapons of a sportsman, saying of meat, "such as I love"! It is very humbling. But verse 5 goes on to say, "And Rebecca heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt venison, to bring it". She was the saving element. Evidently she is on the alert and nothing passes her; "the spiritual discerns all things, and he is discerned of no one" (@1 Corinthians 2: 15). She provides against this situation, takes her life in her hands, as it were, and the blessing goes to the right man in spite of Isaac's dullness.
R.W.S. When fatherhood fails in a meeting the sisterhood may take it on.
J.T. That is the point here. There are other instances too.
T.L.S. Is Rebecca working this matter out for God according to what you spoke of as to the prophetic word in @1 Corinthians 14?
J.T. It is clear that she is on that line. It so far is a very fine picture. She is a godly person and goes right through. It is now long after the boyhood period of her sons, but she carries the matter right through and saves the position, and brings Isaac into real fatherhood in the end.
G.W. What would you say about the way she reaches the point by deception?
J.T. It is not to be excused, but it is a matter to be considered in relation to the dispensation they were in. There are other instances of this kind. The lesson for us is the result of the operation of her faith in the transaction. Of course literally it is out of accord with the true light into which we are brought.
S.W.P. Does it not seem to suggest that Rebecca is acting for God authoritatively? In the 8th and 9th verses she says, "And now, my son, hearken to my voice in that which I command thee. Go, I pray thee, to the flock". Isaac had said to Esau in verse 3, "And
{449}
now, I pray thee, take thy weapons". Rebecca seems to be acting for God when she commands her son, while Isaac speaks more in the way of request. Isaac says, "I pray thee", but Rebecca says, "I command thee".
J.T. Yes. It is like the epistle to the Corinthians. The matter is imperative, it must be so and faith acts on these lines. Verse 10 says, "And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, in order that he may bless thee before his death". She is talking about something that must be done and Isaac should do it. The will of God must go through, and if brothers are not going on that line it must be done anyway; but the principles of truth and transparency were not understood then as they are now. "And Jacob said to Rebecca his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall be in his sight as one who mocks him, and I shall bring a curse on me, and not a blessing. And his mother said to him, On me be thy curse, my son! Only hearken to my voice, and go fetch them". She is the saviour, the agent of the will of God. Let us keep that in mind. "And he went, and fetched and brought them to his mother. And his mother prepared a savoury dish such as his father loved. And Rebecca took the clothes of her elder son Esau, the costly ones which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son". She is in charge and she prepares the savoury dish. It says too that the clothes were "with her". "And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck; and she gave the savoury dishes and the bread that she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob". She carries everything through so that the blessing goes to Jacob, although Isaac is somewhat uneasy about it. But he says, "Come near, now, and kiss me, my son", He is doing it in spite of himself. Rebecca is the instigator
{450}
of this, but Isaac is carrying out the will of God. "And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelt the smell of his clothes, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed". Was that smell unreal? It was not. Isaac is now coming into the real smell, not the smell according to his taste for venison, but the smell of a field that Jehovah had blessed. If it had been Esau he would not have smelt like that.
A.S.B. It is remarkable that, despite the defectiveness in Isaac, verse 27 mentions smelling and seeing, suggesting that he is recovered and in his full senses too.
J.T. God is using Rebecca, and working with Isaac. He is a spiritual man now, and is with God. God has brought him to Him. Hence it goes on to say in verse 28, "And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of corn and new wine. Let peoples serve thee, And races bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be they that curse thee, And blessed be they that bless thee". That is in accord with the prophetic word that Rebecca had; Isaac is now thoroughly in it.
J.W.D. Paul says, "But be it so. I did not burden you, but being crafty I took you by guile" (@2 Corinthians 12: 16). Was it in the same way that Rebecca gained Isaac?
J.T. We have to look at this thing with a balanced mind, taking into account the dispensation. Isaac was examining everything Rebecca and Jacob did -- the clothes, the savoury dish, the skins. It is wonderful how everything fitted. If God were not in it they would not have fitted. The literal deception was not discerned, the right smell came into Isaac's nostrils at the right time, and he was able to bless; indeed he tells Esau afterwards that Jacob "shall be blessed". It is a remarkable triumph for a sister.
{451}
H.B. Her act was on the principle of the parents laying up for the children. She had in mind that Jacob should be blessed.
J.T. Quite so. She had a right thought. She had the prophetic word from God and she was in keeping with it. She maintained the thought for many years and when it came to the test she was ready to die for it, for it must go through.
J.W.W. The blessing is connected with the clothes and not with the weapons, the quiver and the bow.
J.T. That is good. The next matter for consideration is in chapter 28, passing over the blessing of Esau, though in that regard we may note @Hebrews 11: 20, "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come". There is not a word about Rebecca. God will put the faith where it belongs, and the distinction where it belongs. The spiritual distinction was with the sister, but Isaac "by faith" blessed them concerning things to come. "And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand, and I will slay my brother Jacob. And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebecca. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, comforts himself that he will kill thee. And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and arise, flee to Laban my brother, to Haran; and abide with him some days, until thy brother's fury turn away -- until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget what thou hast done to him; then I will send and fetch thee thence. Why should I be bereaved even of you both in one day? And Rebecca said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good should my life do me?" verses 41 - 46. These are the ideas which she
{452}
brings forward to Isaac, all to the end that Jacob be taken out of the way of murder. The purpose of God must stand, and she is determined it shall stand, she is still bent on the purpose of God. That is the point in @Romans 9. So that she has him sent to Padan-Aram. "And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go to Padan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take a wife thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. And the Almighty God bless thee, and make thee fruitful and multiply thee, that thou mayest become a company of peoples. And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, in order that thou mayest possess the land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraham! And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Padan-Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca, Jacob's and Esau's mother", chapter 28: 1 - 5. Isaac and Rebecca at last agree with one another in regard to Jacob. Esau has married Canaanitish wives and they are a burden to them, but Jacob is in the way of fulfilling the purpose of God.
A.E.H. Would verse 45 of chapter 27 indicate that while Rebecca is a spiritual woman she is not a woman without natural feeling? She says, "Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
J.T. She had him in her mind, but she knew he was not the object of divine purpose.
R.W.S. Esau makes a little move to make matters better by a compromise, but he is not really in the life line.
J.T. His opportunities are lost. He finds no place for repentance. It is only a sort of imitation to keep up appearances. It says, "And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-Aram, to take a wife thence, blessing him, and giving him a
{453}
charge saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan". Esau was not subject to his father and mother as Jacob was. Jacob was in subjection to both of them; he had now put his father and mother in full status, and he was subject to them. It is very beautiful to see how the father and mother are linked together in this movement of his.
A.R. On that basis verse 10 is very significant because under such circumstances Jacob went out from Beer-sheba moving in relation to the purpose of God, in relation to His faithfulness. God will be faithful to fulfil promises.
J.T. That is the next thing, Beer-sheba comes in, it is a symbol of divine faithfulness. Jacob starts journeying from there. It all links up beautifully here, father, mother and son are all moving in full unison; it is a full line of recovery.
R.W.S. Would it be like a care meeting when there are difficulties and diversities of view and finally the brethren come to a judgment about the thing and there is help and happiness?
J.T. Yes. We are on the highway now with these three -- father, mother and son fully in the divine thought.
C.K. Esau married outside the fellowship.
J.T. Just so. God abominates the idea of young people in the fellowship marrying outside of it.
{454}
FATHERHOOD (5)
@Genesis 37: 2, 3; @Genesis 46: 1 - 7; @Genesis 48: 10 - 22; @Genesis 49: 1, 2
J.T. We finished our previous meeting by reading the reference in chapter 28 to Jacob as moving under orders -- under the direction of his father and mother, a matter of which Esau took note. He took note of the fact that Jacob obeyed his parents. The prime thought for Jacob was that he should escape the murderous fury of his brother, and Rebecca suggested that he should go to her brother Laban in Padan-Aram and abide with him some days. He went, and remained many years, and became the father of a large family. We have to consider a little the circumstances of his marriage and the development of his family, that we may see how the light broke in at the advent of Joseph. For he began to move after Joseph was born, and Joseph was in a special position right through, as if he were the saving element in Jacob's soul and in his family relationships; implying that fathers and mothers in circumstances that are oppressive are only safe as they allow Christ a place in their minds -- a guiding place -- an influential place; otherwise there can only be disaster. So that we have to consider for a moment the circumstances; they were largely mercenary, though there was love; Jacob loved Rachel, but we cannot say much more; the circumstances were largely mercenary. He had to bring up his family as a wage earner. It says his wages were changed ten times, and part of those wages were his wives, a degrading element in itself. He had to purchase his wives by labour, as it says in @Hosea 12: 12, "for a wife he kept sheep". In all this there is a great deal of instruction for us, especially as in the great industrial, metropolitan cities in which the saints now nearly all reside. In such places it is a great question as to wages, and bringing up our families, and how we are to get through, whether we make room for Christ.
{455}
Joseph was born in Padan-Aram, and immediately Jacob thought of moving from there, but even then he did not go; he was hampered for a while because of wages.
A.E.H. Is there a danger of using our wages to attempt to establish ourselves in a kind of social status that will enable us to marry better socially, and thereby a social stratum of things springs up in the assembly?
J.T. Well, if wages have a leading influence and thought in our lives we may be sure that that sort of thing will develop, for with the rise of wages we have the increase of worldly possibilities, larger houses, larger and better cars, and so forth. So that the eleventh son of Jacob had to be waited for; before he came there was no movement. God would say, You have to wait for Joseph. It was not through the other sons that blessing came. They were born under very distressing circumstances, circumstances of fleshly feeling and rivalry.
S.McC. God raises this matter of wages with the remnant who were paying far more attention to their own houses than to the house of God. @Haggai 1: 6 says that "he that earneth wages earneth wages for a bag with holes".
J.T. A bag with holes is not a safe place for wages! But we have a large matter on hand when we talk about industrialism and wages, and how we are built up in a worldly sense; whether we bring the subject up in connection with this country or other countries; but especially so in this one. What difficulties the Spirit of God has with us on account of wages! So that we must have clearly in mind how Christ in type came into Jacob's mind and influenced him and delivered him. Look at @Genesis 30: 25, "And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my country". That was his first thought after Joseph was
{456}
born. Clearly Joseph had a special place, indeed he superseded the rest of the family. That is confirmed in chapter 33, where in the presentation of Jacob's family Joseph is placed in a safer position than his brothers. It says in verse 7 of chapter 33, "And lastly Joseph drew near, and Rachel". He is put before his mother, as if that was the place that Joseph had in his father's mind; he was the saving element. And so in our chapter we have the statement in verse 2, "These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old;" and in verse 3, "Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was son of his old age; and he made him a vest of many colours". It seems to me that there is a great lesson in this section in regard to industrial matters. How bound up we are in spite of ourselves and how Satan would hold us by legal influences in industry; that is, by unionism, and prevent the work of the Spirit of God in us, and deprive us of our spiritual liberty!
J.W.D. What do you think should be our attitude towards having to work on the Lord's day?
J.T. Well, the attitude would be that if we have Joseph clearly in our minds we should prefer not to do it, because it interferes with our service to God, and with our spiritual growth. The first day of the week has such a place and Joseph has such a place in our hearts, that, because it is Joseph's day -- the Lord's day -- we do not want to deprive Him of what He is looking for; He is looking to have *us*.
J.W.D. I was wondering whether if that were our general attitude, and pursued in prayer before God, the authorities would protect us in that regard. Do you think we could count on that? I mean, that they might bring in enactments that would set us free.
J.T. Just so. Prayer is the thing we began with this morning -- entreaty. Now this is a matter that interferes with Joseph; it is the Lord's day; and while there cannot
{457}
be a doubt that the early christians had to work on the first day of the week, yet now that this day is recognised, to go back to that has the character of apostasy. The rights of the Lord stand connected with the Lord's supper, and the service of God develops out of it, so that the Lord looks for us to be there. The danger of wages and income influencing us is what we must watch. The next question is, *How* are we to be there?
A.E.H. Do you think the love that Jacob had for Joseph, because he was the son of his old age, might suggest the thought of Christ getting the first place with us? We are disillusioned in our old days; other things have not been fruitful so that we then turn to Christ, whereas Christ ought to get the best of our lives.
J.T. That is the point. I think we are to learn from Jacob -- how he developed in his old age. He progressed in his old age because of the influence that Joseph had upon him after he learned that Joseph was in Egypt. There was a steady growth of soul after he reached Joseph in Egypt. The Lord does not care much for persons turning over to these things after they have used their best days to make money. Someone has said, 'Youth is a mistake, manhood a struggle, and old age a regret'. It was not so with Jacob, but it is so with men of this world. Youth is not a mistake with the saints; in youth we must begin to do what is right, the Spirit helping us. And why should we struggle in middle age? God will help us in it. So also in old age, God will help us, as He helped Jacob, to increase in power and in service toward God.
A.S.B. In relation to working on the Lord's day, there is an allurement in it. The authorities must recognise there is something in it, because they pay double time for that day.
J.T. Yes, the enemy would promote it so as to rob God. The day is recognised and it has been recognised m christendom since far back into early centuries. To
{458}
abandon it now is wrong, we do not want to do that. We want to make it clear that we recognise and respect the Lord's day.
A.R. In the days of Nehemiah when he saw persons buying and selling and trading with the men of Tyre in Jerusalem on the sabbath, he put the young men and Levites at every gate to keep them out.
J.T. Very good. When we come to the Lord's day it is a question of His rights. Let us at least give Him one day. We have working time for six days, but at the beginning of the week we lay claim to one day -- figuratively the sabbath, now the first day of the week -- for the Lord. We should be the first to recognise that day at whatever cost it may be.
T.L.S. Even to losing one's position?
J.T. It is hardly the place of legislation here, but it is a question of getting the principle as to where we are. What place has Christ in me, where is He in my mind? If He has come in only in our old age, there is not much in that.
S.McC. Do you not think there is great wisdom needed in the way this matter is approached, both with those under whom we work, and those with whom we work? Instead of arbitrarily refusing to work, should we not seek to lay down the position and our regard for the Lord and His day and His rights in a way that will cause them to see it is necessary that we should not work? Do you not think that is important?
J.T. I think it is a good way to put it. When Nehemiah appeared before the king, after he had heard about the desolation of Jerusalem, the king noticed his countenance and inquired why it was so sad. If I am pleased with the excess salary, my countenance will hardly be sad, but if my employers and superiors see that I am sorry, because I am missing the first day of the week, it may impress them and they may recognise me. The point at the present time is not *me*, but it is conscience,
{459}
and affection for Christ in me. We are not to have mixed motives.
A.S.B. Do you think that is in mind in @Zechariah 14: 21, in relation to Jerusalem? "And in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts". The footnote says, *merchant*.
J.T. Yes. Undoubtedly the character of the Canaanite was merchandising, and Joseph became a chattel in that world; he was bought and sold as a slave. We are to be afraid of that sort of thing; the Canaanite needs to be driven out. We can see that in Jacob's natural outlook as a young man, head of a family, he had that spirit to some extent, the desire to accumulate plenty of money, and so he became a rich man by the time he reached middle age. We need to scrutinise our motives; is it that I have a certain amount of conscience, but am willing to divert from it a little? Have I a thought of gaining some little advantage as long as my conscience is eased?
S.McC. It is a great test, is it not, as to the reality of our links with God, and with Christ? Take this industrial city -- some of us are aliens; also we cannot belong to the union, and we do not work on the Lord's day. All these things test the reality of our links with God and with Christ.
J.T. Yes, indeed; those living in this city are qualified to tell us about that. You may be sure that you, here where industrialism is so paramount, have the deepest sympathy of the brethren. What have such as we, a few christians, to say to that condition? The Lord would value the faithfulness shown in it, the place Joseph has in our hearts, and movement out with Him in spirit so as to be with the Lord on His day.
H.G.H. What bearing on our subject has this report that Joseph brings?
J.T. Well, we might proceed now in our subject,
{460}
and note that Jacob is an old man before there is reference to his generations. Chapter 37 says, "These are the generations of Jacob", verse 2, but reference to them in detail is deferred until we come to chapter 46, so that the Spirit of God might disclose some specific conditions in his family. Then we come in verse 8 of that chapter to the sentence, "And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt". Between chapters 37 and 46 eve have harrowing experiences; most sorrowful things occurred in Jacob's house. One thing to be noted in chapter 37 is that Joseph was with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives, and brought to his father an evil report of them. That is, mention is made of these brothers of Joseph, and that they were evidently of corrupted minds. Their mothers were not wives properly, though their position in the family is accepted; yet they are not the sons of Leah or Rachel. They have been brought up under poor motherly influence; that is one thing to notice, and Jacob is responsible in it.
A.S.B. Why is it that when Abraham's name is changed from Abram there is never a reverting to the use of the old name, even in the New Testament; whereas after God had said to Jacob in @Genesis 32: 28, "Thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel;" it still speaks in chapter 37 of "the generations of Jacob;" and when Jehovah speaks in chapter 46 He says, "Jacob, Jacob!"?
J.T. I think He is telling him that it is a question of his responsible position as not yet having moved out to Joseph in Egypt. Joseph in Egypt is now the object to be understood, and what comes out is that they all went down with Jacob, according to the paragraph beginning with verse 8. Then in verse 26, "All the souls that came with Jacob to Egypt, that had come out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons¬ wives: all the souls were sixty-six. And the sons of Joseph who were
{461}
born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob that came to Egypt were seventy". I think his responsibility is carried through and the nearer we get to the end the more apparent it is. The name Israel is there too, the spiritual side is maintained right through. Hence we have just read in verse 8, "And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt;" and then in chapter 49, "Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days. Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, And listen to Israel your father". So that the responsible and spiritual features are both carried through.
J.W.B. In chapter 36 we have the generations of Esau which are many, a large list which includes the whole chapter; but in chapter 37, the generations of Jacob, we have only one son mentioned. Is that in keeping with the line that goes through? With Abraham also there is only one mentioned -- Isaac.
J.T. Properly, Abraham's generations are not given. Isaac's are and Jacob's are, but Abraham's generations are not specified, because he represents the *heavenly* man. It is what takes place on earth really that is in mind in the word *generations*. So that here we have Joseph mentioned and nothing more until we come to chapter 46. Why is that? Clearly, it is that Joseph should be brought before our minds in all his greatness, both moral and official, and that Jacob, indeed his whole family, should go into Egypt in the full light of Joseph, in the knowledge that Joseph is supreme. In chapter 37, one of the first things that comes out is Joseph's supremacy over his brothers, and then his supremacy over even his father and mother, seen in the sun, moon and eleven stars. These were his dreams and his brothers hated him because of them. His father complained about them, but he observed them, and he had to come into the understanding of them. As the greatness
{462}
of Christ grows in my soul other things become less and less. His position is to be my position, that is the lesson I must learn; I cannot make Joseph fit into my circumstances, I must come into his. Jacob had to come to this.
J.W.D. Do you not think that difficult brothers with whom we have had to do in our own histories have brought out God's infinite, merciful consideration for us, going on with us in grace? Should not that be our general attitude until Joseph is supreme?
J.T. Well, we cannot walk with them. They sold Joseph into Egypt, and they have to go through things. It is a question of experience now from chapter 37 to chapter 46. Joseph is only seventeen years of age in chapter 37, but he is going to be a father; how is he going to acquire the place that belongs to him? When the culmination is reached he says, "God ... has made me a father to Pharaoh", chapter 45: 8. What an immense elevation that is! He comes into fellowship as a young man, and he is to be a father; what a challenge that is to the hearts of our young brothers and sisters! They are to become real fathers in their youth, a powerful influence among the brethren even in their youth.
C.A.M. Would Timothy be a similar instance of prophetic suggestion as to *his* future? Joseph's dreams gave him a prophetic inkling as to what God was going to do.
J.T. Quite so. *He* had prophetic indication and the eleven brothers were also to have it. We have to take a long view here as to Jacob's wife, for Rachel had already died, and to regard the wifely position in an abstract way. The first dream is an agricultural figure. Joseph's sheaf standing up and the others bowing down, but the second is a heavenly and administrative dream. There is plenty of light conveyed in that dream. Let us walk in that light, in the power of it, and understand what it means. Joseph is not coming
{463}
into my circumstances, but I am coming into his.
W.L. Would you say that in that way he really becomes a father to his brethren and to his own father morally?
J.T. He does indeed. He says, I have become a father to Pharaoh. God had made him that, it was by divine appointment.
T.L.S. Does that regulate our attendance at the meetings? Perhaps we are inclined to regulate our attendance by our circumstances rather than regulating our circumstances by the meetings.
J.T. Well, that is the way to reach it. John was on the isle of Patmos, but he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, despite his circumstances.
R.W.S. Is the moral exercise Joseph went through in Egypt particularly important, in that he early developed in manhood so that he could become a father?
J.T. Exercise would characterise Joseph, and his development would mean in the antitype that Christ is growing in our affections. He is seventeen years old when he leaves home, and after this short period he is a father to Pharaoh, according to the message he sent back to his own father. He says, God has made me that to Pharaoh; and later of Ephraim and Manasseh, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here". He is a man who has learned to give God His place. The Lord Jesus has come here in order to give joy to God's heart, and He should be in our hearts; that is the lesson to be learned.
S.McC. This feature of fatherhood that you are stressing in Joseph would be very important in regard to government and administration among us, because the tendency is always that it should become arbitrary and academic, whereas fatherhood would bring some kind of feeling into it. @Isaiah 22: 21 says of Eliakim, "he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem". God committed the government to the one there.
{464}
Are government and administration tempered by the feelings of fatherhood in that way?
J.T. That is very good. The well-known passage in @Isaiah 9, "his name is called ... Father of Eternity", tells what a Father Jesus was. What influence He asserted! He was actually young here in a scene of evil, but He was a Father. It is well to take note of these things because we should as young men develop in fatherhood, and gain the confidence of the brethren. God will put us there if we are on these lines, and a man cannot be overthrown if God puts him into that position.
S.McC. I was thinking of the tendency of those of us who are younger to force issues through, whereas fatherhood would imply influence in any matter so that the brethren are carried.
J.T. Quite so.
R.W.S. Paul said to Timothy, "Rebuke not an elder sharply". Would you say a word as to that?
J.T. That is a good word for young men. Have respect for the elder brethren, *elder* in the sense of ruling persons. You have respect for such, you would not speak sharply to them.
A.R. After His resurrection the Lord said to His disciples on the sea shore, "Children, have ye anything to eat?" @John 21: 5 -- a fine example of the fatherly feelings of the Lord Jesus even to the brother who was leading the disciples astray.
J.T. You can see how they would understand that title, "Father of Eternity", conveying the great power of Christ. To refer to Joseph again, when his brother Benjamin comes Joseph says, "God be gracious to thee, my son", although he was only a few years older than Benjamin. Observe the greatness of Joseph; what God had made him, and what is laid open to us!
A.S.B. While Joseph had no influence with his brethren in chapter 37 because of negative conditions there, is it not interesting that when he goes into
{465}
Egypt he begins to exert great influence there? And it says he is "of a beautiful countenance;" a beautiful ornament in the house of Potiphar, a good influence in Egypt.
J.T. God did things for him. God is doing things now, wonderful things, if we could only see them and dwell on them.
J.R.H. Would it be right to say that the fatherhood of Christ merges in the fatherhood of God, that it has that in view in His dealings with His people?
J.T. The fatherhood of Christ can never replace the fatherhood of God, because there is only one "God the Father". The name *Father* is unlimited save that He judges no one, whereas "Father of Eternity" is limited. It refers to the Lord, and is simply to bring out His moral greatness here on the earth; His resurrection is to remind us of it, and the allusion in the name is to what there will be in the millennial day. How great the need is for it when we consider what there is now -- independency, men doing as they wish. When Christ comes in He does the will of His Father and He is an influence that cannot be set aside. Fatherhood is there. We often use the expression of brothers, saying, He is a real father. It is based on what the brother is. I do not know whether that is clear. I should not like in any way to minimise the statement that He is "the Father of Eternity", but it really means 'the Father of the age;' it is a limited thought, but it is one of the glories of Christ.
C.A.M. Would you think that new creation in the end of Isaiah hardly takes you beyond the millennium? Indeed the book hardly takes you beyond that point.
J.T. Yes. If you just confine yourself to what is in Isaiah it would not go beyond the millennium. "I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy" (@Isaiah 65: 18), that is what is in mind; but new creation in the New Testament goes beyond that.
{466}
W.L. Would you say that Joseph acquires the place of father through sufferings?
J.T. That is the way the facts are stated. Joseph in chapter 37 is the only *generation* of Jacob so far, and we have to wait for him to be glorified in Egypt before the idea proceeds. Then according to his dreams both Jacob and all the family go down into Egypt, in the light, too; so that they are going into his circumstances, he is not going into theirs. Joseph sent waggons to his father and brought them to Egypt, and as Jacob drew nigh his son Joseph went out to meet him and "presented himself to him".
J.W.D. This thought of Christ glorified in Egypt is not Christ glorified in heaven, is it?
J.T. No; the literal application would be to Jewish christians in early days, how they were to move out of Jewish settings to Christ glorified among the nations. So that the mystery is "Christ in you" (that is the gentiles) "the hope of glory" (@Colossians 1: 27), and all the Jews are to come to that. Jerusalem was destroyed and the faithful had to come out into that position. But in a moral way each of us has to learn to come into Joseph's position -- his circumstances. That is what happened to Israel as seen in @Genesis 46: 8 "Jacob and his sons" went to Joseph.
C.A.M. The land of Goshen would in type be the place of the assembly at the present time, would it not?
J.T. Just so, Joseph's provision for us.
A.R. In the beginning of chapter 46 Jacob "came to Beer-sheba; and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac", and God appeared to him as the God of his father. Typically he was moving from earthly circumstances to heavenly circumstances -- to the God of his father Isaac.
J.T. That is right. It is remarkable in chapter 46 that Abraham is not the point, but Isaac; that
{467}
is, Christ risen; so that now Jacob is in accord with that and God confirms it, and it is said that he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. That was the state of his soul at that time, he was recognising Isaac. "And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night and said, Jacob, Jacob! And he said, Here am I. And he, said, I am God, the God of thy father". God is confirming the light he had in his soul, and then He goes on, "fear not to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation". That is, the growth will be there. "I will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will also certainly bring thee up; and Joseph shall put his hand on thine eyes". Joseph is always in front -- "Joseph shall put his hand on thine eyes".
J.R.H. What does that mean?
J.T. It means that Jacob's eyes are henceforth to be directed by Joseph. What things we see among the gentiles according to the great epistle to the Romans! What glories have been opened up to us! Instead of Jerusalem, it is Rome. So Paul says, "the Lord stood with me, and gave me power, that through me the preaching might be fully made" (@2 Timothy 4: 17). I would take it that way, that Jacob's eyes are under Joseph's.
A.P. It is remarkable that this feature of consideration for the father should be brought out so much in Joseph's exercise as over against the jealousy of his brothers. In chapter 45 he says, "Does my father yet live?"
J.T. It is most interesting to keep before us at this point the fatherhood of Joseph. It is elected fatherhood in a young man; he puts his hands upon our eyes. And now when we come to the final passage in chapter 48 we have Joseph and Jacob together. A new lesson is opened up here, that the fatherhood of Jacob is greater morally than that of Joseph, for a son can never be greater than his father. Now the fatherhood of Jacob is seen in the remarkable power he has from God, what
{468}
God has given him in his old age to change the status of the families of certain ones, and that over the direct head of the immediate father of those two. So that we might say it is the only error of Joseph that we can find, as if God would emphasise how the faith is maintained in the three -- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Although Joseph was a father to Pharaoh, he could never be a father to Jacob, he could never be greater than Jacob. It was not the divine mind; the divine mind and God's plans can never be thwarted.
R.W.S. Will you enlarge a little on your remark that a son can never be greater than his father?
J.T. The very term carries the thought itself.
J.R.H. The Lord Jesus could say, "My Father is greater than I", @John 14: 28.
J.T. Well, ostensibly the Father must be greater than the Son. It is a question of the economy, not the abstract relation.
J.W.W. @Malachi 1: 6 says, "a son honoureth his father", carrying the same idea.
J.T. Just so. Some in recent years say you can transpose the positions of the Son and the Father in verse 19 of @Matthew 28; that you might say Son and Father are interchangeable. But it is the reversion of the truth. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit implies the truth of christianity. That is the relative position that divine Persons have taken, and you cannot interfere with that.
A.E.H. So that if a natural son moves ahead of his father spiritually, the son in reality would be the father. Would you go so far as that?
J.T. Well, he could never be in the mind of God *officially* greater than his father, because father and son is a fixed divine thought, a family thought. God has in mind the Father, Son and Spirit and that cannot be reversed. The status of a man as father can never be taken by the son, that is, while his father lives.
{469}
W.L. Is that why we get the name Israel in this connection and not Jacob?
J.T. Israel is seen here in his fulness of spiritual power, and God is bringing to our attention that the great man of Egypt has to be negated by Jacob. Let us listen to what he says: "When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it was evil in his eyes; and he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn: put thy right hand on his head. But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know: he also will become a people, and he also will be great; but truly his younger brother will be greater than he; and his seed will become the fulness of nations", verses 17 - 19. "His father *refused*", notice that word. It is a real altercation between Joseph and Jacob. There had never been one before, but there is one now. Jacob says, "I know, my son, I know". Can he change that? Jacob knows what he is doing as a father, as *the* father, and Joseph has to recognise that. Jacob does not alter his hands because Joseph wishes it; he goes on to say, "he also will become a people, and he also will be great; but truly his younger brother will be greater than he; and his seed will become the fulness of nations. And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh! And he set Ephraim before Manasseh". You see, he is doing it; let no one interfere. Morally no one can interfere. If it were an Egyptian, Joseph's word would be law; but not now; it is his father. God is asserting His own counsel, His own rights, and Jacob is the father; he is morally suitable. He says in effect, Your will in this matter does not carry; I know what I am doing and it must go through.
T.L.S. Have we not often been deluded by the idea that to be fatherly is to be nice to everyone? But I
{470}
understand that here Jacob is showing power in doing what is right.
J.T. Yes, power goes with the father. That is how the Lord is said to be "Father of Eternity;" His word stands. It is the moral power of what He is.
J.C. The eyes of Jacob being dimmed, and not being able to see, would show his superiority over what was natural, would it not?
J.T. Yes, he knew in spite of natural disability, what he was doing. It is a fine finish. Then the next thing is, "listen to Israel your father", chapter 49: 2. That chapter begins: "And Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days. Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father". Joseph could not say this; Joseph could not utter what we have in this chapter, it is Jacob. Joseph has to be among his brethren and answer the summons to "Gather yourselves together". Now he is attentive to his father and Jacob is going to tell them the history of the family in a prophetic word. He is not going to hide anything. The true father is here; he is not covering over anything that the children have done. Now the whole truth is told out; that enters into the idea of the father, the *real* father.
H.B. In @Acts 20 Paul calls the elders of Ephesus to tell them what would befall them after his departure. Would that be like this?
J.T. The fatherhood is very beautiful here. God would finish this great life of Jacob by stressing fatherhood at the end, even over Joseph; great man though he was, he has to hearken to Israel his father.
J.W.D. Do you mean that however much we develop in the idea of fatherhood we always have to maintain the idea of being sons as well; so that we should be constantly ready to be adjusted by the greater and more supreme idea of fatherhood?
{471}
J.T. Exactly. God graciously develops a fatherly condition among the saints, and whatever comes in, it is our wisdom to bow to it.
W.L. Is the same thought in @Matthew 24: 36 when the Lord says, "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens, but my Father alone"?
J.T. Yes, that is a good scripture. Everything is reserved for the Father. So the Lord speaks in @Acts 1: 7 of the times or seasons "which the Father has placed in his own authority".
J.W.D. That would deliver us from anything national in the idea of a father, a supreme brother in a country or continent, would it not?
J.T. Quite so. It is an immense thing to have a fatherly quality in any gathering. There are "not many fathers", says Paul. Where that quality exists it is our wisdom to bow to it.
S.McC. Is the thought that, however much fatherhood may develop in younger men, as in Joseph, it always has to make room for experience as set out in Jacob? It can never take the place of experience, the side that Jacob sets out.
J.T. Yes, that is it. Long experience in Jacob has developed into this. It is said when Joseph came to see him that "Israel strengthened himself ... . And Jacob said to Joseph, The Almighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me". He tells Joseph what he had gone through and goes on to say, "And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was yet a certain distance to come to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem". He is bringing out his experience. What experiences he had! And now the product of that experience is here and he is greater than Joseph, greater than any moral or any official
{472}
weight that the son could have. God sees to it that Jacob is *the* father in this circumstance.
H.G.H. Do these verses in chapter 49 remind us of the authority in connection with fatherhood?
J.T. The blessing of Jacob here is the blessing of a man of authority, though given as a father. He is appealing to his children and calls to them: "Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob".
A.R. "What will befall you at the end of days". He is not talking experimentally now in regard of his own experience, but covering their whole history. What he says has not been fulfilled yet, has it?
J.T. Well, I think it is wonderful that Jacob is the prophet. I might say he is the outstanding prophet in the book of Genesis. God said, "Do my prophets no harm" (@Psalm 105: 15). Jacob is included among them. What an opening out of the mind of God we have here! All this history is linked up with the twelve sons of Jacob and they are to hear it pronounced. In some cases their own shame has to be rehearsed in their ears.
A.R. You might say Jacob uses great liberty in crossing his hands in regard to Ephraim and Manasseh; but he is really changing the position of his hands in relation to his whole twelve sons, is he not?
J.T. Quite so. He is asserting the spiritual will, and that over against the suggestion of Joseph that he should change the position of those hands. If the position of those hands is changed we go back to the world, from the spiritual to the natural, but Israel says, "I know, my son". Jacob says in effect it cannot be otherwise, or the purposes of God will not go through.
Ques. Would not the record of chapter 50 show that Joseph has been adjusted? He ends the matter himself in regard of his sons and great-grandsons, putting Ephraim first, verse 23.
J.T. That is a good remark. It finishes our subject. I had thought of finishing with Joseph. In chapter 41
{473}
he tells us what God had done for him; he named his sons according to his own experiences and circumstances. Now he is 110 years old, and he is to die. He saw Ephraim's children to the third generation and you have in mind that he confirms all that we have been saying. Ephraim is mentioned first. Joseph is a real father; even to the third generation he is still a father.
J.C. Why dots this idea of fatherhood culminate with Jacob? This blessing of the family surpasses that of Isaac and Abraham.
J.T. It is because he was the third: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; three is the principle with God. It is the end of an exercise beginning with Abraham, so that the thing culminates in Jacob through most extraordinary experiences and exercises.
J.W.W. When Israel blesses Joseph in chapter 49 he alludes to "the God of thy father, and he will help thee; And from the Almighty, and he will bless thee;" and later, "The blessings of thy father surpass the blessings of my ancestors". Would that emphasise the thought of fatherhood as making room for Christ?
J.T. It has been remarked, and it is well to keep it in mind, that Joseph is now thoroughly in the truth. Chapter 50, verse 1, says, "And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him". It is a beautiful finish of the setting sun, of the father. What a glorious prospect is in view! What a day is to burst upon us! The light concentrated here will burst u on us in answer to it all, the great thoughts and purposes of God.
J.R.H. Would Paul's tears link up with Joseph's tears in his relations with his brethren in fatherhood?
J.T. Just so.
A.R. Is the lesson from these meetings that everyone of us should be concerned about making a way for the counsels and purposes of God among us, to see that they are going through?
{474}
J.T. Yes. To see that they should go through characteristically, that we are not holding the truth objectively, but going through with the Spirit. What came to my mind at the beginning of these meetings was that we are to be set in relation to a great mission. The Holy Spirit was sent from heaven and, as here on earth, He was commissioned; the commission was continued in the Holy Spirit, and we are to go through corresponding characteristically with the purposes and counsels of God; so that what goes into heaven is equal to what came out of heaven.
S.McC. The last word of Joseph is beautiful. It says, "And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will certainly visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence". That is the last word -- the ark with his bones.
J.T. Quite so. The ark with his bones was the constant testimony among Israel of things that were to happen later in relation to those bones. The framework would come out later, God will put flesh on them and breathe into them, and spirit will be put into them, and the whole mind of God will stand out effectively here.
{475}
FAITH
@Romans 10: 16, 17; @Matthew 9: 27 - 31; @Mark 9: 16 - 29; @Matthew 14: 26 - 31
I wish to speak about *faith*. It is an extensive subject and in selecting the scriptures read I had in mind to confine my remarks to certain features. It is a subject of great importance always. Although it is scarcely mentioned in the Old Testament, it *existed* from the time sin entered into the world. I have no doubt that Adam had it, but as to this the Spirit of God begins with Abel; but that is in the New Testament. @Hebrews 11 refers to Abel as acting by faith. The New Testament in @Hebrews 11 gives us a list of persons who had faith, but they are not the only ones; it is only a selected list, to illustrate the great principle. There were many more. We shall see them in heaven presently when the Lord Jesus comes and raises them. "The dead in Christ shall rise first".
So that whilst the word 'faith' is scarcely used in the Old Testament, the thing was there, and the word is used in Habakkuk. It is employed much in the New Testament. It characterises our dispensation. It is significant that the Lord says, "when the Son of man comes, shall he indeed find faith on the earth?" (@Luke 18: 8). It enters into the present time. The saints have been obtaining light and ministry, enjoying fellowship together; they like to come together more than ever, but the question is how far faith enters into all this: whether, for instance, I have come to this meeting on that principle, whether our lives are based on that principle. Another scripture is very searching, namely, "whatever is not of faith is sin" (@Romans 14: 23). And again, "he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him out" (@Hebrews 11: 6).
These scriptures apply to this moment and raise the question with everyone of us as to why he is here
{476}
tonight. What is the basis of his position in God's creation? Is it that he is merely born into it on natural lines, or is he in it on the principle of faith? It is one or the other. If it is not on the principle of faith, it is on a sinful basis and will not stand in the day of judgment, nor does it afford any fruit for God now. The divine thought is that the believer is pleasing to God. A reconciled person is pleasing to God at ALL times. Of Enoch it is said that before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God. One would not like to contemplate being translated to heaven unless he pleased God. Hence Enoch had that testimony *before* he was translated. And that immediately follows the statement that he had faith. By faith Enoch walked with God three hundred years. He afforded companionship for God. How can two walk together unless they be agreed? It is clear that God and Enoch had much communion (I speak reverently) during all those years. Enoch's life was based on faith and afforded pleasure for God.
Now, how does faith come about in a person's soul? @Romans 10: 17 says that faith comes by hearing. The word 'hearing' more properly here is 'report', i.e. faith comes by report, but it is the report of something. The word is from @Isaiah 53: 1, "Who hath believed our report?" It refers to Christ. It was something *to be* believed, or some person to believe *on*. Faith is an act on principle, but not alone, for "faith without works is dead". But in coming into a man's soul it is a living principle. It comes in by report, and the report is by God's word.
Now all this is most important for us, dear brethren, for we must begin at the bottom, and this verse directs us to past history, as to when each of us began to act on the principle of faith. Can you recall when you started? It is by report, the apostle says, but not simply any gospel testimony that you might have heard. It is
{477}
by God's word. God's word is living and operative, @Hebrews 4: 12. The great testimony to all in God's word is Christ. He is the Object set before your soul, so as to set it in movement. Let each one look back over his history and see when this began with him. Pardon the allusion to myself, but I remember very well when the light came to me. The word was, "whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved". I remember well when I began to think and to move in that way, calling on the name of the Lord. Faith calls on God. It never makes myself an object. It makes God in Christ an Object. It also makes Christ an Object for the believer.
Now this is a matter for young people here to look into. When did your mind begin to work in answer to the light, when you saw a Person who became your Object, who became an Object for your heart? It was through the gospel preached unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven. It is by this report that the truth is received in the soul. Faith becomes active as the report is received. You are active inwardly having found the Saviour, One whom you can love and serve. I wish now to illustrate how this works. In @Matthew 9 there are two men who are blind, and they know that others received their sight through Christ. Blindness is one of the greatest afflictions, it is worse than deafness. These men knew that Christ could heal them, they had heard of His miracles. Why did not the Lord open their eyes at once? Well, He did not. I want to call your attention to verse 26: "And the fame of it went out into all that land". What was that fame? There was a little girl, twelve years of age, who had died and was raised up by the Lord Jesus. His fame went abroad.
We all would have talked about that event if we had lived in the neighbourhood in that day. If you were not converted you might have said to a friend: 'Did you
{478}
hear about that girl? She died and Jesus of Nazareth raised her up'. But you might talk about the miracle and never accept the light. Or you might say, 'I would like to get the Lord Jesus to do something for *me*'. Well, that is just what is in mind. These two men were thus affected. "As Jesus passed on thence, two blind men followed him, crying and saying, have mercy on us, Son of David". Why did they call Him Son of David? Somebody else must have called Him that in their hearing. Normal conversations in christian households, bring out the titles of Jesus, and young people take them up; but is faith underlying all this? Is the movement of your mind towards Him? Is it that you have heard about someone who obtained blessing from the Lord, and *you* want to get something done? That is why the Lord is probing these two men.
He says to them in the house, "Do ye believe that I am able to do this?" Is this element with you, or is it only the fame you have heard that moves you? They called Him Son of David. It is always a good sign when a seeker of blessing says, "Lord Jesus". These men said, "Son of David". The Lord says, Are you governed by faith in this matter? Am I an object of faith in your souls? He says, "Do ye believe that I am able to do this?" They said, "Yea, Lord". Now they use the word Lord, an excellent sign, instead of saying Son of David. Is He merely Son of David to you? When the Syrophenician woman called Him "Son of David" the Lord did not even answer her. Why should the Lord be silent when somebody says, My daughter has an unclean spirit? The designation in her mouth was out of range. He was not Son of David to *her*. She was not a Jewess. But He talked to her when she called Him Lord, at the same time accepting her gentile inferiority, @Matthew 15: 21 - 28. He said, "thy faith is great". It is the faith that one has that counts in God's estimation. The blind men answered, "Yea, Lord", as the Lord inquired
{479}
if they believed, that He was able to open their eyes; but He was not satisfied with that, so the passage says, "Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you". If you have not faith, blessing cannot be obtained. All is on the principle of faith. Faith is the basic principle. It says, "he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it unto you. And their eyes were opened". These two men had faith. That is what the Lord wanted to bring out. And He said, Do not tell other people about this. He would not have his works made the subject of unhallowed conversation. They are on the principle of faith. He straitly charged them saying, "See, let no man know it". You say, Why? To prevent the mixture called christendom; the name of Christ put on millions of people who have not faith. God has no pleasure in that. If you get blessing from God it is because you have faith. "According to your faith, be it unto you".
Now to go to @Mark 9, it is a family matter. There was a discussion going on among the Lord's disciples, and one of the multitude said to the Lord Jesus, "Teacher, I brought to thee my son, who has a dumb spirit; and wheresoever it seizes him it tears him; and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he is withering away". It was a terrible description that may be applied to someone in a christian family. Matthew says he was a lunatic, one of the worst of all diseases. All of these terrible things mentioned happened, and Matthew says that the father said to the Lord, "I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him". That is to say, professing disciples of Jesus are powerless to help this man in his family matter. I cannot go into all the details, but @Mark 9, verse 19 says, "Bring him to me. And they brought him to him. And seeing him, the spirit immediately tore him; and falling upon the earth he rolled foaming". Satan outwitted himself there, he did his worst in
{480}
Jesus¬ presence. Bad enough to do it when Jesus is absent. What distress it caused the parents! Satan said, as it were, 'I will show Him the power I have over someone in a christian household'. He did the worst he could do in the presence of Jesus. He was inviting the defeat, which happened. The Lord always has power over the devil. The Lord had said, "Bring him to me". Satan said, 'Yes, and I will show you what power I have;' and so, "the spirit immediately tore him, and falling upon the earth he rolled foaming".
The Lord took great pains to do the work well, and He took time to do it; in such cases we have to *wait* for the result. Why did he not cure the child at once? There might have been something wrong with the father. This boy had been affected from childhood. It was not a governmental thing, because of the child's conduct. Childhood would mean infancy, for he is now called a young child, verse 24. The Lord said to his father: "How long a time is it that it has been like this with him? And he said, From childhood; and often it has cast him both into fire, and into waters that it might destroy him". It is a household matter; a great sorrow day and night. The father says to the Lord, "if thou couldst do any thing ..." You see the 'if;' that IF was not expressing faith. The father *thinks* the Lord may be able to do it. The Lord did not like that, yet He is very patient with the man. The man said, "If thou couldst;" the Lord said: "The 'if thou couldst', is if thou couldst *believe*". The Lord turns the *if* back on the man. It refers to the state of his soul. The IF applies to you and not to Me, the Lord says. In such sorrows the real difficulty often lies in the state of the parents of the household. "And immediately the father of the young child crying out said with tears, I believe". No longer 'if'. The Lord is saying, I want this man to be a man of faith. *He* needed help from Him, as well as his child. So verse 24 says: "the father ... crying out said with tears,
{481}
I believe". The 'if' is going out of his vocabulary, and he will not again use it in regard of Christ's power.
Faith is always certain. Even if we look at the heavens, it is by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. Men of science use 'IF' and 'IT IS ASSUMED', 'WE BELIEVE', etc., etc. Faith enables us to *understand* things. The father's faith is specially noticed here. He says: "I believe, help mine unbelief". To help him in his unbelief would be to take it away altogether, and that is what the Lord did. "But Jesus, seeing that the crowd was running up together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, *I* command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. And having cried out and torn him much, he came out; and he became as if dead, so that the most said, He is dead. But Jesus, having taken hold of him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose". That is, the father now has faith, and now his son is brought up from a dead condition. As I said, such sorrows enter into all our families. Satan invades a family to disfigure and dislocate the whole household. Here the father has acquired faith, and the Lord accepts it, and takes the boy by the hand and lifts him up. The Lord acting immediately, as He saw the people running together, was, it seems to me, to forestall another attack of Satan.
Finally we may look at @Matthew 14. This is not a matter of blind men, or a sick child, but a great servant of Christ, Peter. This matter of faith is *essential*, and supremely so with those who profess to serve the Lord, and, of course, all of us should serve Him. They are in the ship without the Lord. The Lord put them there. He compelled them to go there, and He went up into a mountain to pray; and we are told that the sea was tossed by the waves, and the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went *to* them -- the Lord allowed all of the watches to pass by until the
{482}
fourth. We have to be patient and not to become sceptical; we have to wait on Him. Why did He not come before? He wanted them to go through the first, second and third watches. Such experiences must be gone through, if we are to get the gain the Lord has for us in His ways with us. So it says, "the wind was contrary. But in the fourth watch of the night He went to them, walking on the sea". I would rather see Him walking on the sea than on the road. Wondrous sight! An impossibility to nature; a great miracle to the eyes of the disciples. He told His disciples about wars, in view of the last days: "ye will hear of wars and rumours of wars. See that ye be not disturbed; for all these things must take place, but it is not yet the end. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom" (@Matthew 24: 6, 7). *Do not be terrified*!
In the midst of current conflict we are apt to be thinking only of the physical side, but here we see the Lord walking on the water, and it is as easy for Him to do so, as to walk on the street. We have to learn what these things mean; what Jesus is capable of, and whether we have faith in His power. So that when we see Him walking on the waters in a spiritual sense we are not surprised, we *expect* it. This miracle was intended to bring out the progress the disciples were making. The passage says, "And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled". Why troubled? It was one of the greatest sights they could see. He said unto them: "Take courage; it is *I:* be not afraid". What I am saying should challenge every one of us here. Such an action is what we should expect in troublous circumstances. It proves that the Lord is superior to everything here. I should expect it, and not be surprised. We shall see Him presently doing it. Many see Him now as infinitely above the present storm.
They cried out for fear. They are exposed as wanting in faith in Jesus, whose miracles they had seen many
{483}
times. They did not have faith on Him as to this remarkable sign. "But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is *I*". Not "I, Jesus;" but "it is *I*", the One you have been acquainted with for years, whose miracles you have seen, whose teachings you have received, and whom you have professed to love. Peter said, "if it be *thou*". 'Ifs' again! Can there be any question? What am I using this IF for? It is not faith. It may be the Lord, or it may not be He; that is not faith at all. Peter said, "if it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters". He puts the IF on Jesus. He will risk that much. The Lord said, "Come". That is what He is saying to us now; are we ready to go without the *if*? God in His sovereignty, not the Lord, is governing these wars. God the Father is over these things. Presently Christ will deal with the nations with a rod of iron. He is *now* leading *us* in our spiritual wars: "Our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities" (@Ephesians 6: 12). The Lord leads in that war, but not in the wars of airplanes and the like, but providentially God has to do with them. The government is one of God's departments; @Romans 13. When Jesus is on His own throne He will take on these matters. He is now moving in relation to *His people*. It will occasion great relief, if I can walk on the water to go to Jesus. Verse 29 says: "And Peter, having descended from of the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus. But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me". That is, the strong wind was too much for him, and he began to sink. It is what he saw around that caused him to sink. His eye was off Christ. When you begin to occupy yourself with current happenings you give up hope. But still Peter said: "Lord, save me", and the Lord caught him and said to him, "O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?"
I want to just finish with that. I have said to the
{484}
Lord many times lately, 'Do not let that word ever be said to me -- "O thou of little faith"'. The Lord will help each of us as He helped the man with the sick boy: "... help mine unbelief". And this has in mind that He may not have to say, "O thou of little faith". He does not like to have to say it to any of us, but He must say it if we are unbelieving. He would tell us of many instances in which He gives us credit for our faith. He said of the woman with the issue of blood, @Matthew 9: 22, "thy faith has healed thee". And to the woman in Simon's house, "Thy faith has saved thee". It is *your* faith. That is the idea. The Lord is looking for faith, and He gives us credit for whatever measure we have. The disciples said, "Give more faith to us". The Lord said, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye had said to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you" (@Luke 17: 5, 6). If you tax the little you have, you will find it will grow. Faith increases as you use it.
May God bless the word.
{485}
THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST
@Philippians 1: 19; @Genesis 21: 29, 30; @1 Samuel 30: 20, 26
I wish to speak about the Spirit of Christ. It is mentioned in the epistle to the Philippians very significantly, for they were marked by it. The apostle's labours there were fruitful, not so much in the sense of numbers, as of quality. Numbers of converts are stressed elsewhere. The idea is not foreign to the gospel. We read of three thousand souls secured at one preaching in Jerusalem, both quality and quantity marked them. We have in @Acts 2 the number given of those that were converted on that day of days, and we also have a description of their quality in the closing verses, showing that good seed had been sown and hence a good harvest, which is what God looks for: seedtime and harvest, the harvest being in accord with the seed sown.
So that the goodly number at Jerusalem are also goodly in quality, affording the Lord what He could use; for if we are really converted to God and have received God's Spirit, we are usable, and we should be used, for God always uses His people as they are fit for His service. So that we are told about the goodly number at Jerusalem, and then we have a description of them, by the Spirit of God; that they were all together and had all things in common, and other beautiful traits which the Spirit of God effects; and it is said the Lord added to them such as should be saved. He had there a company that He could use in the sense of adding to them persons that were to be saved, so that they would be saved in a practical way from worldly influences -- a very important feature of salvation. All, especially young ones, are exposed and affected too, alas! by worldly influences. Thus the Lord added those that were to be saved to those brethren at Jerusalem, among whom they would find shelter; they would also find fellowship, for it was there in a peculiar way. It is
{486}
said, "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (@Acts 2: 42). Those added would attend the meetings, and find influences of protection in this remarkable result of the gospel. This is a most important principle, and it runs down the ages to us, the Old Testament having spoken of it, Jehovah saying, "I will give salvation in Zion, and unto Israel my glory" (@Isaiah 46: 13). Zion corresponds to the assembly. That is, He sets salvation where it is available in a practical sense.
Now, going on to Corinth, we have also "much people" alluded to as in that city. The Lord said to the apostle, "Fear not, ... no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city" (@Acts 18: 9, 10). They were not converted yet, at least only a few of them, but much *is* much in the Lord's mind. We are not told how many there were ultimately in the assembly at Corinth, but evidently a good many; but the quality was lacking. They were allowing there sectarian conditions: one was saying he was of Paul. You might say, Oh, that was not far out of the way. But it was; Paul repudiates it; he says, Was Paul crucified for you? He raises that question, which has its own answer. Another says, I am of Apollos; another says, I am of Cephas. All this was dividing, and damaging generally to the assembly there. That is, the material was poor: so that we might have many people of poor quality in one place and many of a rich quality in another. We are not told how many there were at Philippi, it does not seem that the number was large, but they were of good quality. The apostle speaks most appreciatively of them, with great affection, counting, as he says, that certain circumstances should turn out to his salvation through their prayers. "I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ".
We have to understand the word *salvation* in this
{487}
connection, because we must always understand Scripture contextually. The word *salvation* here refers to the working out of the truth of the gospel in a man's soul. Even Paul needed the gospel; he needed it right through. He tells the Romans, "now is our salvation nearer than when we believed" (@Romans 13: 11). That does not mean that any Roman or any Philippian christian who might die at any time would not go to be with the Lord; it means that the true believer is to go through to the end which the gospel has in view. And so in this epistle the apostle says, "work out your own salvation" (@Philippians 2: 12) -- work it out. Well, you inquire, am I thus depending upon myself? No, you are not depending upon yourself. There is a very large sect in this country which holds that at one time one might be *saved* through the death of the Lord Jesus and afterwards be lost, which is false. When the Philippian jailor asked the apostle how to be saved, he said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house" (@Acts 16: 31) -- believe on the Lord Jesus. That is salvation on the principle of *faith*. But then the salvation you have has to be worked out like a gold mine, if you are to obtain the full gain of it. It becomes yours through faith, otherwise you could not work it out. That is what Paul means here; he speaks of his own salvation. He says, "I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation". Even the prayers of the saints would help him. He tells the Philippians to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, for, he says, "it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure". So that, we have here, as I said, fruit from certain sowing by Paul and Silas that was good. Without going further on that line, he is able to speak in this way to them about their helping him in his salvation -- a most remarkable thing; so that the most spiritual man, as we might say, on the earth then, looked to the brethren to remember
{488}
him in their prayers, that their prayers might help him in his salvation; that is, in working it out -- not saving him for eternity, which is "not on the principle of works", but working out his salvation as a present thing.
And so he brings in this additional thought, that I have especially in mind; namely, "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" -- a very fine phrase; not that he would get all there was, because it is infinite, but he would get his part, whatever he needed. The Lord is always very ready to pour in a supply of His Spirit; it is an infinite reservoir in heaven, in Christ; each of us always needs a supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Do not forget the brethren. Some of you may be saying, You are making too much of the brethren; but I am not making more of them than Paul did; not any more than the Lord Jesus did. We cannot do without the brethren. As I said before, if one is converted, he is secured for God for ever; if God begins a work in my soul, it is going on to completion, but as to practical christianity, we need the assembly; we need the saints; we need their prayers; we need their fellowship; we need their example; we need their affections. So we cannot be isolated; we cannot be so many units; the idea is to be characteristically of and in the assembly. "To whom coming, a living stone ... yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 2: 4, 5). That is christianity; that is the practical working out of the truth. Individual salvation is an initial thought and runs on with what I have been saying. The jailor at Philippi felt the need of it, and hence his question, "what must I do that I may be saved", and the answer, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house". *Faith* is stressed in this side of the truth as affording one the unalterable possession of salvation in Christ Jesus. Possessing it in this way
{489}
the believer works it out according to what I have quoted from Philippians.
And now I go to Abraham, to illustrate a little how this Spirit of Jesus Christ is supplied. He takes seven ewe-lambs. Some of you may not have read this chapter; others of us have often read it and spoken of it and profited by it. The oftener you read a scripture and speak about it and pray about it, the more you get out of it. There is no possibility of exhausting the Scriptures; they are infinite; I mean they are of that character; they are "divinely inspired". As ministering to the saints, I regard it as most important to refer directly to the scripture or scriptures that specially bear on my subject, so that those listening may judge of the authority and accuracy of what I am saying. So I now call attention to the fact that in the epistle to the Romans we are told that Abraham "is father of us all" (@Romans 4: 16). He is the father of all who believe, and therefore, if God sets down traits developed in Abraham, they are intended to be examples for us, and especially now in war times.
The spirit of war is rampant, and God will have people on this earth with the Spirit of Jesus Christ, which is the very opposite to the spirit of war. Of the Lord Jesus it is said, "he was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers, and he opened not his mouth" (@Isaiah 53: 7). He said to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought" (@John 18: 36). "But now", He says, "my kingdom is not from hence". And the sword, the literal sword, has no place there. Peter would have used the sword, but the Lord says, "all who take the sword shall perish by the sword" (@Matthew 26: 52). There is now the sword of the Spirit for us, and it is the only one a christian should use. The use of the literal sword is not compatible with christianity. But presently the Lord Jesus will come out
{490}
of heaven as a great military Man, and then the sword will be used in destroying the wicked on the earth (@Revelation 19); but *not now;* as shown by the Lord's words already quoted, and the teaching of Romans and other epistles. Our path is the path of Jesus, who came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them, and it is in the Spirit of Jesus that we seek to save them, in so far as we may, as I have been saying, to influence them aright.
And so it was with Abraham; he had certain conflict, not with the sword yet, but with the Philistine king whose servants had taken away a well that Abraham had digged. The well, literally, is not of much account; artesian wells are quite common in this country; it is not of much account in itself; but it is of great account *as a type*. And so the well in Abraham's way of speaking would refer to the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus spoke of a well in this sense: "the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life" (@John 4: 14). That is what is meant, and we all should understand it. If I have that spring, I progress into eternal life; but if the influence of this world has damaged me and I am failing to judge this, and failing to use the water of purification, then I have lost for the moment my power and my joy and my practical christianity. You cannot have real practical christianity without the Holy Spirit. That is what Abraham, seen in the passage in Genesis which I read, means in type; he did not understand as we do, but that is the teaching of the passage; and therefore he reproved Abimelech, because his servants had taken away a well that belonged to Abraham. And Abimelech sheltering under ignorance, said, I do not know who has done this. But Abraham is making very much of this well; and in order to secure it he set seven ewe-lambs by themselves. The lamb is a type of the Lord Jesus as going into death. "He was led as a lamb to the
{491}
slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers and he opened not his mouth".
John the baptist speaks of Him as "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (@John 1: 29). That is Jesus. Here there are seven ewe-lambs: not rams for they are apt to be violent. It is a question of the state of the affections; yielding affections; we are enjoined to let our "gentleness be known of all men" (@Philippians 4: 5). That is what is in mind in this type. There are seven ewe-lambs. Abimelech said, What do they mean? You can well understand that he would ask that question. They were foreign to him; no doubt he had lambs and sheep, but never did he understand what was divinely intended to be conveyed in them as seen in the passages I have quoted; never did it occur to him that seven ewe-lambs should mean something in regard of Abraham's well. Abraham is connecting these seven ewe-lambs with a well that the Philistines had violently taken away from him. Were these lambs violent? No. Well, then, what do they mean? Abraham says, They are to be a witness to you; they do not represent violence. You are to have these seven ewe-lambs, and every time you look at them, remember me, that I dug this well; remember that this well belongs to me. But why was Abraham making so much of that well? It is the antitypical meaning of the well that is the point; that is, it is the Holy Spirit. Typically, Abraham is saying, I cannot do without the Holy Spirit, and if there is any christian here tonight who thinks he can do without the Holy Spirit, he is very foolish; he is not a christian practically at all. It is only by the Spirit of God that I can put to death the deeds of the body; it is only by the Spirit of God that I can fulfil the righteous requirement of the law; it is only by the Spirit of God that I can walk here according to God -- those that are led by the Spirit are the sons of God.
Well, you can see, dear brethren, that typically
{492}
Abraham was saying what I am saying, that I cannot do without the Spirit. And every time you look at those seven ewe-lambs, remember that I am not going to take a sword; I am not going to send a policeman after you; I am not going to hail you before the court. I want you to know that this is my spirit, and if I am to be maintained in that spirit, I must have the well; I must have the Holy Spirit. In order to have the Holy Spirit in a practical way, you must judge yourself, because you are enjoined not to *grieve* the Spirit, and we are enjoined not to *quench* the Spirit. If we do either we shall rob ourselves of our joy, our power for testimony here, and of ability to serve God in the assembly.
I now go on to David. This chapter in 1 Samuel which I read is a very crucial one: David had gone away among the Philistines; he evidently lost the joy of his soul and said, I will go to Achish, the king of the Philistines, and he did, and got into trouble. Anybody who goes to the Philistines is sure to suffer damage. Achish had given him Ziklag, and while he was away the Amalekites came to Ziklag and burned it and they carried away his wives and his children -- a terrible disaster. The position here, therefore, affords me an opportunity to bring out that when I come into disaster, terribly adverse things happening to me, if I am a real christian, I know where to turn. David turned to God. He "strengthened himself in Jehovah his God". Where else could he find real strength? He might have gone to the king of the Philistines and asked him to send down an army to retrieve the lost. No! he did not do that; he had learnt his lesson. He turned to God. As some of us were saying, the quality of a horse is seen in the manner of his recovering himself after he falls, and that is David. He knew how to get up. "The righteous falleth seven times, and riseth up again" (@Proverbs 24: 16). There is no license for falling seven times, nor for falling once, but if a real christian falls he will rise
{493}
again; he has power in his soul and he knows where to turn; he knows God and that He is not different from what He was when He converted him; he knows He loves him as much as He did then; His grace is the same as it was then. And so David turned to God, as we have noted: "David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God".
Well, I say all that of David as prefatory to what I wish to say as to the verses I read in @1 Samuel 30. David, through the great mercy of God, recovered all that the Amalekites had taken in their foray. A young Egyptian found in the field, who took part in the raid, but who had been left behind by his master because he fell sick, became, as revived, a ready instrument in David's great recovering achievement. All was brought back. And David went down and gained a great victory over the Amalekite army and recovered everything they had carried away -- not one thing lost, a very remarkable thing. It can only be true spiritually. You can hardly imagine an ordinary military incident of this kind without some loss, but in God's victories nothing is lost.
Now I go on to verse 20, where we learn that David makes a division between cattle and cattle. I take these cattle as types of christians; some are called David's spoil; there must be differences. We sometimes have trouble with young christians marrying unbelievers, or marrying christians that are worldly; and when the latter are in question some neutral persons will say, He or she is a *christian*, why do you object? In the minds of many it differs from the meaning implied in its use by the Holy Spirit. In @Acts 11: 26 it is said, that the disciples were first called christians in Antioch and *called* there has an oracular significance intimating that the saints had taken on the character of Christ. The Spirit of God says elsewhere, if one suffers "as a christian, let him not be ashamed, but glorify God in this name". If I am going to the theatre, am I glorifying God in that name?
{494}
I am dishonouring God; I am dragging that name in the dirt, and the devil knows it. That is just what he seeks to accomplish in causing believers to become worldly. A christian who is influenced by the world dishonours Christ from whom the name *christian* is derived. So one who intends to marry a worldly person and justifies himself, because he or she is a professed believer, is deceiving himself. The man who was put away in Corinth was a christian in that sense, but he was *unfit for fellowship*. He was delivered to the devil that his flesh might be destroyed and his spirit saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. In attaching the name christian to a worldly person, especially to conceal or justify my own unfaithfulness, is lowering it and hence dishonouring it. He is not deserving of it. If you are to marry, you are to marry *in the Lord* and that makes room for the word christian.
I am speaking now of the cattle in this verse I read (@1 Samuel 30: 20): "And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil". That is, there are other cattle besides those thus distinguished. Transferring the thought to nominal christians, they are David's spoil. Now the other cattle -- how many cattle there are! Let me just attempt to indicate the number of sects; they are more than I could count. I would not belong to a sect under any consideration; to belong to a sect is a dishonour to Christ, it is a dishonour to the saints, and it is a dishonour to myself. The Lord said: "all *ye* are brethren ... for one is your Father, he who is in the heavens" (@Matthew 23: 8, 9). Thus there are cattle *and* cattle. David says, The flocks and herds that are in the front are my spoil. There are others, not to be ignored, but they are not in the front. That is what he says: "David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil". We have to differentiate between the front ones
{495}
and those others, and you are not to make these others the same as those; there are christians and christians, as I said. I want to be among those that are called David's spoil; persons that have been turned aside (and who has not been?) but have been restored, recovered to God; that is David's spoil. I want to be amongst those. They go *before* others; it was David's ordering. *This*, he said, "is David's spoil". This incident is remarkable in this section of Scripture which treats of recovery. It is the principle of *grading* among the people of God which enters into the divine way. Looking on the cattle brought back in a general way, and the position of those *they drove before the other cattle*, David said, "This is David's spoil".
The next circumstance to be noted here is that there were two hundred men who were not able to go to the battle with David. He did not have a big army. He started with six hundred men, the most efficient soldiers that ever fought, but two hundred of them here were too weary to go on to the battle, to fight with these Amalekites, and they had to stay behind, which they did at the brook Besor. They stayed with the stuff; they were not idle; they looked after something. And now David is coming back with the spoil. And there are men here called sons of Belial, wicked men they are; and they would not share the spoil with those that remained at the brook. Verse 21 says, "And David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and whom they had left behind at the torrent Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and David drew near to the people and saluted them". That is beautiful: their great captain, saluting those who had been unable from exhaustion to join in the conflict, exhibits the Spirit of Christ. They were in David's eyes genuine people. The Lord Jesus in like manner honoured the women who had been at the
{496}
sepulchre, @Matthew 28: 9. He said "Hail!" How glorious it is to be saluted by Jesus! He regards us with dignity; He respects His people. With David, alas! there were those who were unsympathetic to his generous spirit. Verse 22 reads: "And all the wicked men, and men of Belial, of those that had gone with David, answered and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give then aught of the spoil".
Let us note this mournfully, because it is typical of what is current today. There are nominal christians about us who speak thus: they have no sympathy with weakness or weariness in the saints. We are enjoined to "comfort the faint-hearted, sustain the weak, be patient towards all" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 14). Failing in this spirit we are prone to think of ourselves only and thus fail of the characteristics of Christ's body as stated in @Colossians 3. And now, as I said, we get the Spirit of Christ in David. In verse 23 he says, "Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah has given us, who has preserved us, and given the troop that came against us into our hand. And who will hearken to you in this matter? For as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike. And it was so from that day forward; and he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day". In this fine statement we have a landmark in the history of the testimony; this is a great statute of grace, a fixed principle: That he that abides by the baggage shall partake with those that go down to the battle; they shall share alike. In the light of it, as a type, christians must renounce churlish selfishness, and put on the Lord Jesus Christ, making no provision for the flesh, (@Romans 13: 14).
Well, the inquiry that is now to be made is, Are we here partakers of the spoil? We read in verse 26, "And David came to Ziklag, and he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Behold a
{497}
present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah". This word *present* is *blessing;* look in the margin. It is not simply that I give something to you; it is a blessing, and that is what is stressed in the instructions as to giving in @2 Corinthians 9: 5, 6; that what we give to the Lord, and for the needs of the saints, is to be in the spirit of blessing. God's giving is on that principle. He gives us the Spirit -- the greatest of all blessings. And He gives us the great blessing of eternal life. God *commands* it. The word *command* there is to show that it is imperative; it is imperative on His side and on man's side. His love for men requires that they should live eternally before Him: He has pleasure in us as thus blessed, and we have eternal enjoyment in *living together with Christ* (@1 Thessalonians 5: 10). I am only referring to eternal life as *characteristic* blessing; there are others, for we are blessed with *every* spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ, @Ephesians 1: 3.
The blessing here is what the Lord Jesus has secured through His death and resurrection; that is what is alluded to. It is a blessing for you. If there is anybody here who has not got it, I say, It is a blessing for you. Do not be without it. The Lord Jesus says, "how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" (@Luke 11: 13). Why should I be without it? I do not say that we always have to ask, the Father gives the Spirit of Himself, but we may obtain the Holy Spirit through asking, and it is the most wonderful of all blessings, the Holy Spirit come down from heaven. The Son of God is given for us and the Spirit of God is given to us. If you read down the verses, you will see the large area covered by David's giving for David's *friends:* "to those in Bethel, and to those in south Ramoth, and to those in Jattir, and to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa, and to those in Rachal, and to those of the
{498}
cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites, and to those in Hormah, and to those in Chor-ashan, and to those in Athach, and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David and his men went about". Am I making room for Him now in the time of His rejection? He says, This is what is waiting for you, a blessing for you. Why should I be devoid of it? It is a blessing of David's spoil; victory has been acquired by David and he is dispensing the spoil from it to his friends. The Lord says to His disciples, "ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you ... I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you" (@John 15: 14, 15).
May God use this word.
