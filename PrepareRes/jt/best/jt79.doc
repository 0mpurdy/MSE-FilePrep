CHRIST IN HIS SERVICE GODWARD
@Hebrews 3:1,2; @Hebrews 10:19 - 22; @Exodus 28:5 - 30
J.T. The early verses of @Exodus 21, which speak of the Hebrew servant, might be linked on with the early verses of chapter 28, which introduce the subject of the High Priest, the Hebrew servant, according to what is stated, being a type of Christ in the exercise of love in service, showing the attitude of mind that He took in becoming Man. Love would go to the utmost limit -- although itself unlimited -- to exercise the service of love, His love to God, and His love to the saints -- the church, then the saints being the children, but in self-abnegation, self-denial, all would be accepted that the service of love required. On the other hand @Exodus 28 comes in and views the Lord -- the same Person -- in dignity, official dignity, so that He is rightly regarded in His service by the saints, by those He serves. That is why I read in connection with these passages the opening verses of @Hebrews 3, where the saints are addressed as "holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling". Then the passage shows that Christ is to be regarded in the light of the statement that He who builds the house is greater than the house. So that whilst He takes up the attitude of bondman in the service to show the lengths to which love will go, we are to regard Him in the house in His dignity as Son; His Person remains unchanged in the service. The garments in @Exodus 28 refer to Him in His service; what He was as Man in service is in mind in all these habiliments. The Person is really hidden, the cloak being the long covering garment; He has taken on these things as in service; they are to be known in part, each part representing some feature of Christ in His service.
{2}
The next thing to note is that He is not on earth, He has gone into heaven, and the service is carried on in that setting, "minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man". So that the service He carries on is heavenly, and views the saints as heavenly, partakers of a heavenly calling. Chapters 8 and 9 show how He has become minister of a better covenant, the first being set aside to make room for the second.
Ques. Then this service is Godward on our behalf?
J.T. That is the view we have to take of it here. In chapters 2 and 4, He serves us in the sanctuary, but the Minister of the sanctuary is clearly in the tabernacle; that is the setting.
-- .M. Is that the significance of the expression "Such an high priest became us" (chapter 7:26)?
J.T. That is to call attention to the greatness of the Person who is high priest. The beginning of chapter 8 is a summary of what He has been, and that "we have such a one high priest" who has set Himself down "on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens".
Ques. Is it representation Godward?
J.T. The saints are so great -- it is a remarkable way to put it. He has made us great, because we are of Him: "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren". Then at the beginning of chapter 8, "Such a one high priest" is the One "who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens". Who could do that but God? He has set Himself down. That is a very great position to get into our souls in regard to the Lord as the Minister of the sanctuary, and the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched and not man. He leads in the service Godward, I think.
Rem. If that thought were realised more fully what there would be in our meetings!
{3}
J.T. It would make room for it.
Rem. The nature of the service would be on account of that.
J.T. Yes, quite.
Ques. How would the Lord serve in that way?
J.T. "Such a high priest became us". "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling". We are a necessary part of the service according to chapter 2. He is Leader of our salvation, we are being led to glory. The great thought is the true tabernacle; the tabernacle is a figure of the heavens and the earth, but in the present time it is the heavenly side only; that is what is in view in Hebrews, going into heaven itself. So that the saints do not take on what is current, the character of earthly religion; they should be different. What is current in christianity is patterned after the old. The idea of the heavenly service is unknown in the Jewish system.
Ques. What answers to the holy places today?
J.T. We have to lay hold of the heavenly side of the thing. What is in mind is Israel's place and our place; all is worked out in the assembly in the light of the heavenly and the two merge in us. Israel is not in view yet. I think Israel's service will be outside the veil; ours is inside, that is "heaven itself".
Ques. Is it that our service should be in accord with the Minister?
J.T. We have to wait for the Minister; things must be regulated by Him. There are certain principles by which we are governed. To serve the living God there must be a living service, and we must wait for the Minister for He is in charge of the service.
But I think before we get to the service actually we ought to consider these features of the holy garments or habiliments for the priest, because they are to bring out what the saints are as viewed in relation to counsel; the breastplate is in relation to counsel. It is not the tribes viewed according to their birth, but
{4}
viewed according to the counsels of love. The order is not a mere automatic thing, according to birth, but it is according to the sovereignty of God, where He places His people. The two onyx stones on the shoulder mean the saints viewed as a family; we are sustained by the Lord as a family. But there is personal distinction on the breastplate, personal distinction of each one.
Ques. Would it be right to introduce the breastplate into @Hebrews 9:24, there "to appear in the presence of God for us"?
J.T. That is the idea of it. The priest was never to go into the holiest without these garments, and we are to be assured that we are never cut off. "He ever liveth to make intercession for them", as if He never did anything else. We know He does, of course, but it is to assure us of the place we have there.
Ques. What is the significance of the breastplate being four-square?
J.T. It is a universal thought; it takes in all.
Ques. What is the thought of its being doubled?
J.T. To bring out the importance of it. It is not going to wear out; it is going to stand; it was like a pocket really. The Urim and the Thummim, whatever they were, these two things were in the breastplate. You have to understand the principle of the thing is in those two things. It is first mentioned in the general list, "And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, ..." (@Exodus 28:4). It is the thing *par excellence* in the array of garments.
Ques. Would the sheet coming down knit at the four corners bear on this?
J.T. Yes, it is something like @Colossians 1:4, love "to all the saints". The breastplate shows the place we have before God; we need all the saints and we want to have them all in our hearts. These garments are very instructive and each part has its own
{5}
meaning. It is not so much to bring out the deity of Christ; that is understood; it is the Person covered up. The description in Song of Songs would hardly fit in with this because the actual form in detail is not seen here; it is a question of what Christ is in service. You have to go deeper to see His beauty portrayed, the lines and graces of His Person; they are not contemplated in this cloak. The holy Person seen in His beauty is an inner thing. What is before us now is what He is in service.
Ques. Why are instructions given first as to the two shoulder pieces and the onyx stones?
J.T. I think it is God beginning with us. You are going to be supported; I think that is what they show. We are taken account of according to our birth, and we are to be supported in this matter. We do not bring in human things; we are going to be supported and there is abundance of support in the sanctuary.
Ques. Would you get the same thought in Hebrews?
J.T. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 are in this, that is the size of the shoulder pieces. So that we come boldly to the throne of grace and get all the help we need. We do not need to rely on natural strength in the sanctuary or at any time.
Ques. Why are the names on the shoulder pieces according to their birth?
J.T. To bring out the family thought. In @Hebrews 2:13 we get "Behold I and the children which God hath given me". We are viewed in that light as under His care. Love is in the breastplate; the breastplate is what we are according to divine counsel. Without mentioning their names but according to their names, that is, what you are as the fruit of the work of God; you have your own distinction. Every christian has his distinction as the fruit of the work
{6}
of God. What he is in the counsels of God is the way he will appear before God.
Ques. Why do we have the details given of the holy garments and the materials of which they are made?
J.T. They refer to the various glories in which we appear, or in which Christ appears. If we take them up in detail we have a wonderful unfolding of the glories of Christ in service, the colour and quality of the material, all bringing the thing out in detail. We know in part, and what a lesson book it is to study by the Spirit these holy garments!
Ques. What is the thought of a span?
J.T. Something that is within your range. Measure is a great thing. It must have been a great matter with God. Accuracy is required in it so that we should know facts; we are too general in dealing with matters.
Ques. According to their names, does that suggest the colours of the stones?
J.T. The glory of the names is in the stones; it suggests great variety in the saints. We are the inheritance of God; that is, we shine on the breastplate of Christ. However little we may be in reality we are great in the divine thoughts; we have the most central place in the heart of Christ.
Ques. Would that correspond to the blessing of Moses in @Deuteronomy 33?
J.T. Yes, I think so. The names are not actually given here. It is supposed that you know them by name and what the distinction of each saint is. You do not go over their names literally. There is distinction: Mary Magdalene was different from Peter and every one of them had a distinction.
Rem. The tribes around the tabernacle were not according to their birth.
J.T. No, I think the tribes were placed round the
{7}
tabernacle according to the breastplate, in rows of threes.
Ques. Is the distinction the outcome of sovereignty or moral formation, or do they both go together?
J.T. They go together; that is, the moral formation is in agreement with divine counsel. When the Lord said to Peter, "Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone", in @John 1:42, that was in the mind of God for him.
Ques. Does the dignity referred to here come out in the heavenly city in @Revelation 21?
J.T. They are on the foundations there.
Ques. Would the bearing of this now be as taking account of one another as according to God?
J.T. That is the thought, to see what is in the mind of God. You may say, He is not like that now, but God will bring him to that -- you do not want to hinder God's work. The salutations in @Romans 16 indicate that this remains and abides. Paul mentioned the persons according to their qualities. Phoebe's name was Phoebe but really a name embodied in the quality of the person.
W.G. This is rather preparation for happy functioning in the assembly.
J.T. I think so, we learn in these things what the saints are. They are "all glorious within". Her clothing is "of wrought gold" (@Psalm 45:13); that is in the king's apartments, our place in the sanctuary.
Rem. These garments are for glory and beauty.
J.T. These are not the saints¬ garments properly. The saints are only spoken of as on the breastplate. These garments are the garments of Christ; the garments of Aaron's sons are mentioned later. No saint has these garments mentioned here, they are garments that Christ alone can wear. So that the subject really is what Christ is as the Minister of the sanctuary. We have to apprehend Him in these garments, they are just qualities marking Him in that setting, as in
{8}
service. And we are assured of our place because of the onyx stones on the shoulder pieces, and the breastplate. God is the object of His service primarily, it is "to serve the living God" (chapter 9:14); that is what we get in the section in Hebrews.
Ques. Would you say a little on the Urim and the Thummim?
J.T. The first is said to be light and the second perfection. In @Deuteronomy 33, the Thummim comes first because there it is the work of God in the saints, what God has wrought at the end of the wilderness; therefore the idea of perfection comes first. The light radiates perfection, light in its application to us. The action of light, what the light is, is the second thought.
Ques. How was that lost in Nehemiah's day? They had to wait till the priest came in with the Urim and the Thummim.
J.T. I think it would be the waning of the light in the appreciation of it amongst the people of God. How much the saints lost in the strivings of the wilderness!
Now @Hebrews 8 is the full setting of the service of God; it is not our need so much there. The service of God is in mind, and the Minister of the sanctuary. That is touched on in chapter 2.
Ques. Would it be right to say that if peaceful conditions are to be maintained with us locally, and God is to be served, the various features seen in these garments are to be understood?
J.T. I think so; God has given to us in part, and we are to learn in part and put it together in our souls; we are to know what each part is. We are to see how the Lord moves and follow Him.
Having introduced the great subject in the earlier verses, the apostle reverts to the covenant, down to the end of chapter 10:18. It is in view throughout, because this great Person's service required that we
{9}
should be liberated, and the covenant will liberate us. Perfect love casts out fear so that we may join in this great service. So that it says, "Let us draw near" (verse 22).
Ques. Would it be out of place to ask what is conveyed in the expression, "that this man have somewhat also to offer"? Is it the praises of His people?
J.T. I think it is that *what* He offers is of Himself; the idea of offering is not classified but the quality, that He has somewhat to offer. Even if you bring in the saints how much have we to offer? He brings it all in.
Rem. That is you would include the whole.
J.T. That is the thought I think.
Ques. Do we not come together with the holiest in our hearts?
J.T. The entrance into the holiest is just to bring it down to us. The Jewish believers were very low down. The apostle is endeavouring to bring them to the initial thought in verse 19 of chapter 10, and follows it up with directions as to the way to serve. The entrance to that is in the holiest. "Having ... boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus". "We have" is one of the leading phrases in the epistle. Each has right to enter by the new and living way, the blood of Jesus. How beautiful that is, coming down to the very youngest, "by the blood of Jesus". What has the blood of Jesus done for you? Washed away your sins. And you enter into the holiest by it, too.
Rem. I am not quite clear as to what it means when it says He must have something to offer.
J.T. I would not like to define it.
Ques. You do not view it as Aaron who offered what was brought to him?
J.T. Christ "by his own blood, has entered in once for all". That is the principle of having something to offer, the principle, the whole position is
{10}
marked by that. He "offered himself without spot to God". If you look at Aaron as he entered, it was not by his own blood, but Christ as High Priest entered "by his own blood". All that enters into it, what the priest is as offering, as serving in the sanctuary and the richness of what He offered. It is the great general thought that we have in mind.
W.G. Do not we come together in the assembly with the holiest in our hearts?
J.T. I think so. The holiest is rather an individual thing. That is why I thought it extends to the weakest and the youngest for every christian has a right to enter by the blood of Jesus.
W.G. This qualifies you for the spiritual order of things.
J.T. I think it does. We are able to see what is inside before God delivers us from an order of things outside.
W.G. The assembly convened tests us as to what we have got.
J.T. Yes. Like Asaph under a new regime under David (@1 Chronicles 25:2). Asaph may be taken as a sort of type of most of us, somewhat like @Psalm 73. I think that Asaph is a kind of lead for us.
The Hebrew christians had got down so low: they had reverted to the old things, as christendom has done. The apostle is getting them to draw near, to see what is before God. Jesus, whose blood had washed away their sins, had gone into heaven. Inside the veil is what Jesus is before God. I am not going on with anything else than Jesus *in heaven*, not what He was here on earth, but in heaven carrying on the service of God. The third book of Psalms (@Psalm 73 - 89) would be a great help in regard to these verses in Hebrews. Entering the sanctuary, I see what things are.
Ques. Would it be right to bring in the breakdown of Aaron? He was not able to wear the garments.
{11}
J.T. He is only a type; Christ does not break down.
Rem. It enhances the glories of Christ.
J.T. It does. We have His personal dignity set out in chapters 4, 5 and 7; they deal with the greatness of His Person. He is Priest on the principle of the oath, "a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec" (chapter 5:6). The summary is in the beginning of chapter 8, "We have such a one high priest".
Rem. I am sure we need to have an enhanced idea of the value of the blood of Jesus.
J.T. It is within the range of every christian. Everybody may understand the blood of Jesus, it is by the Spirit we have access to Christ, by one Spirit. The divine idea is Christ risen and glorified, and the Spirit in the saints. We have got to translate the language of Hebrews into the language of Romans, Colossians and Corinthians. I believe many christians are puzzled by the language of Hebrews because it is language taken up from the Old Testament; the epistles are written in our own language. The blood of Jesus is a beautiful term; nothing is more beautiful and touching than "the blood of Jesus".
Ques. What is the idea of the house of God coming in here (verse 21)?
J.T. The idea is that what is moral stands in relation to the house of God; we do not want to let in sectarian thoughts here; there is only one house composed of all christians.
Ques. Do you view the saints here as in wilderness circumstances?
J.T. It is spiritual, because it contemplates the saints getting into a spiritual realm. Many of the saints¬ children are in the wilderness; they cannot go to Egypt and they do not want to go to Canaan.
Ques. What is the thought of "consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh"?
J.T. It is the death of Christ. He goes through
{12}
the veil; the veil is still up for the Jew. It is a question of spiritual understanding. Christ having died and risen and gone into heaven, there is a way in through the veil. Christendom has put itself outside the veil. It requires faith and the Spirit's power, "a new and living way" by the Spirit. As we get in @Ephesians 2:18, "Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father". That is on a high level but it shows somewhat of what is meant. We go in, but we go in in that way through Christ.
W.H. If we are to have part in the service we are to move on that line outside of the ordinance of man.
J.T. That is the idea, it is by the Spirit, a living way by the Spirit. So here, "having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water", sets the heart at liberty, so "Let us draw near".
Ques. In chapter 8 when the Lord is spoken of as Priest, the throne is mentioned, but in chapter 9 it is not mentioned; why is that?
J.T. It is in the heavens in chapter 8, "the throne of the greatness in the heavens". There are four references to the throne in Hebrews: in chapter 1:8; chapter 4:16; chapter 8:1; and chapter 12:2, whilst in chapter 10:12 it says, "He ... sat down on the right hand of God"; they are like four great pillars -- "the throne of the greatness in the heavens". He is great enough to sit there.
Rem. I suppose the greatness in Hebrews is in contrast to the smallness of judaism.
J.T. Yes, that is the idea. There is no outward smallness about christendom and judaism. When we come to chapter 11, entering for us is suggested by the whole cloud of witnesses, brought into the realm of life. They have passed out of death into life. Their actions indicated they were living men, living in the light of another world, the living way, a living state of things, that is the idea.
{13}
DIVINE THINGS SHOWN
@2 Chronicles 3:1,2
"And Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah" (the meaning of the word 'Moriah' is said to be 'shewn by Jehovah' ), "where he appeared to David his father" (the words 'where he appeared' may be rendered 'which was shewn' ), "in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. And he began to build on the second of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign".
There are other scriptures that I may allude to briefly but this one sets out more definitely than any other what I had in mind to call attention to, that divine things are to be shown. God has graciously provided the instrumentality for this, and young believers are to note that things have to be shown. The Holy Spirit indeed is here to that end; He takes of the things of Christ and shows them, or announces them, to us. That is what He is doing, one of the greatest acts that He is doing, showing the things of Christ, showing things to come to the saints. No saint or christian can afford to be neglectful of this, for the end is that we should become acquainted with eternal things, things that enter into our eternal state, and we should be conversant with these things as having had them announced to us.
So that this is the end of a series of showings which I will call attention to briefly -- the foundation of the house. No one can be in the house save as seeing the foundation, no one can be in it intelligently save as understanding the foundation. The Lord says, "On this rock I will build my assembly" (@Matthew 16:18). And Paul says, "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus
{14}
Christ" (@1 Corinthians 3:11). The foundation of the house -- of the assembly -- has to be understood, no christian should be ignorant as to it. Sometimes we think ignorance is almost a virtue, but it never can be. People speak of themselves as simple believers, but there is a certain shame attaching to ignorance. We have to admit, of course, we know nothing as we should know, but one says I will follow on to know, "And we shall know -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah" (@Hosea 6:3). That is the characteristic attitude of a christian, he is following on to know. There is so much to be known that we need to devote ourselves to it and follow it -- as the apostle says to Timothy, "Thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience" (@2 Timothy 3:10). Timothy gave himself to these things, he is enjoined to do it, "Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned" (verse 14).
Now the first showing that I will call attention to is that to Abraham. I want to speak briefly of the great men of faith to whom things are shown as examples. The more spiritual you are the less you assume; you are always dependent, ready to be shown, ready to learn. As regards young christians the eunuch is an excellent example, doubtless a man of education according to this world, but he was reading the Scriptures as we know, and the Holy Spirit says to Philip, "Go near, and join thyself to this chariot". And he did, he joined himself to this man reading the Scriptures; he was enjoined to do it by the Spirit, and there was no doubt that it was the right thing to do. The first question is, "Understandest thou what thou readest?". And the man rightly and simply said, "How should I then be able unless someone guide me?" (@Acts 8:31). He had been up to Jerusalem where the scribes and Pharisees were, but they did not guide him. This guidance is by the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit says to Philip, "Approach and join
{15}
this chariot" (verse 29). It is the act of the Holy Spirit. The man simply and rightly says, How can I understand except some man should guide me? And there was someone to guide him. He takes the things of Christ and announces them to us, He brings them home to our intelligence and understanding.
Now Abraham was the first to be shown things, Moses the second and David the third. With Abraham it was the mount on which Isaac was to be offered up; that was not left to his choice. It was spiritually the greatest event you can conceive of, typically it was the offering up of Christ. It was no accident that the Lord Jesus was crucified just outside the gates, outside the wall. It was in Jerusalem though, in principle; it is spiritually "Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified" (@Revelation 11:8). That was no accident, that is where the evil was, that is where the hatred of God and of Christ is.
Now Jehovah says to Abraham, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of" (@Genesis 22:2); Moriah, as you will see in the note, takes its name from the idea of being shown. It was not left to Abraham to find. And nothing is rightly understood spiritually except it is shown to us. What you find with Abraham is implicit obedience. Although it was a test of the supremest kind, he set out with his son Isaac; he rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him. And he arrived there in three days, the three days having its own significance; in three days he came in sight of the place; there was no doubt about it, no hesitation whatever. That is a great matter in the things of God, to be assured, so that you do not hesitate; you are not doubtful. "If any one desire to practise his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine" (@John 7:17). It is a most important fact,
{16}
unfailing obedience to God and to Christ and the Spirit. Abraham saw the place and he knew it. He saw the place afar off. That is one of the features of faith; they saw the promises afar off and embraced them. Things are brought near to us by the Spirit; they are not far off now, they are near to us. Abraham leaves the young men there and he and Isaac ascended to the place. He offered up his son Isaac, one of the greatest transactions in Scripture spiritually; there is no greater transaction than that.
But I speak now of the showing, the gracious comment of God on His servant, that he should not hesitate. The death of Christ was plainly declared; not only the place of it but the kind of persons that were put with Him to death were recorded; the very grave in which they intended to put Him is mentioned beforehand; everything is accurately pointed out in the Scriptures, and when the time comes the Holy Spirit calls attention to that. How important to be definite in our apprehension of the place and time, the significance of the death of Christ.
Now as regards Moses, as he came out of Egypt with Israel they are complaining about thirst. There was no water to drink except brackish water, the waters of Marah which were bitter in taste. We have to apprehend the death of Christ in that way as set forth in the waters of Marah. The people come up out of the Red Sea; now they are made to drink the waters of Marah; the bitterness is in the taste. If we are to go into Canaan we must be in consonance with Christ. He tasted death for everything, that we might know what that means, what He endured, that we might have part in the suffering. And Moses was in that. And it says he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him wood. God never leaves us nor forsakes us. The great Mediator has to stand still; there is nothing but brackish water and the people complaining. Jehovah showed him wood. It is
{17}
Christ in relation to the wilderness circumstances; although apparently bitter, they are made sweet; the bitterness is wholesome and necessary for us. The worst thing that can happen to us will turn to our blessing. Christ in Manhood in that setting is typified in the "wood", spoken of so much throughout these typical books in the construction of the tabernacle. How important to be shown things so that we know what wood is. Then the second showing to Moses was just as he was about to die, the Moses of the book of Deuteronomy in the last mention of his life here. He wrote that great psalm in chapter 32 just as he was dying, but as still vigorous in mind and body. And so he goes up to the top of Mount Pisgah and Jehovah showed him the whole land; that is, He showed him heaven. He had been shown Christ as in the wilderness, what He is to the saints in the wilderness, and now he is shown the land. It was not an empty land, the heaven of purpose is an inhabited heaven. Heaven shown to the saints is an inhabited heaven. Abraham was told to go through the land, but we inhabit it. The Canaanites were still there, the land was full of Canaanites but Moses saw it with the Israelites in it.
In @Deuteronomy 34:1,2, "And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea". That is the land inhabited with the people of God, the saints. That is the land! Ephesians contemplates the land, but that is heaven with the brethren. Nor would anyone who loves the brethren be there without them. God's way is to have the brethren there. The inhabitants there will be the brethren, not the Canaanites and the Amorites and the Jebusites, the nations who were hostile to God; these are all to be ejected from the land; faith sees
{18}
heaven with the saints there. Those who love the brethren love this view. It is shown by Jehovah, He leaves nothing out; it is shown from His point of view. But the leading tribes, representative of the saints, are all there. How lovely to think of that, Christ the "firstborn among many brethren" (@Romans 8:29). That is the way Romans brings out the purpose of God -- firstborn among many brethren. Heaven will be inhabited by heavenly people.
Then finally David is shown the type or pattern of the temple. That is what is alluded to in this passage in 2 Chronicles. Solomon is conversant with it; it is Solomon's foundation. The church is not a haphazard sort of thing as the church in christendom. It is built according to God, the foundation is shown, and Solomon is conversant with it. It is his foundation in a shown place. They saw the foundation in @Matthew 16:16: "the Christ, the Son of the living God". That is what He is as known in resurrection, what He is in His Person as here, but known in resurrection, the Son of the living God. There is no other foundation that can stand than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ, it is a question of the kind of Man He is. And the structure will be like the foundation. In order to understand the place we must understand the foundation. Ephesians gives us not only the foundation but the top stone, Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone.
That is what I thought might help us to begin, if we have not begun, to embrace the idea of having divine things shown to us, and to understand that there are instruments in the power of the Spirit which God employs to show us these things.

@Exodus 17:1 - 16; @Numbers 20:2 - 13
J.T. Lately some of us have been looking at the water of purification in John's gospel, which alludes to the death of Christ as cleansing us from the state effected in us by sin, not as dealing with our sins, but from the *state* caused by sin. In John's gospel there is also the drinking of water, which is another thing, water viewed in another way, as a type of the Holy Spirit, which is always refreshing and vivifying. It is from this standpoint of the water in @John 4 and 7 that these scriptures in @Exodus 17 and @Numbers 20 should be considered. The water for drinking is a subject that is specially calculated to help young christians, because we are apt to be so general in treating types, so that the water of purification is not distinguished in our minds from the water of refreshment and life. There are two features of water running through Scripture.
Ques. Where does this come in, "Every one that has this hope in him purifies himself" (@1 John 3:3)?
J.T. That is the water of purification. So that John in his epistle speaks of the water flowing from the side of Christ before the blood, but in his gospel he speaks of the blood first. The water cleanses us from the practical effect of sin in us, it is the death of Christ viewed in that figure of water.
Here in @Exodus 17 it is a question of people thirsting and complaining in their thirst. Young christians are apt to be dissatisfied with what they are brought into though having christian parents and being brought up outwardly in the truth; they are like the Israelites here who all passed through the Red Sea, and were all baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and all ate the same spiritual meat and drank the
{20}
same spiritual drink, but still they were contentious and dissatisfied. Young believers may not always say so but there is dissatisfaction and I think this chapter would help to show how the Lord Jesus suffered that they might have the Holy Spirit.
Ques. How does Marah come in? It is earlier than this?
J.T. It is akin, a sort of combination of the water of purification and the water of refreshment. It was brackish but capable of being made sweet by the wood thrown into it, typical of Christ Himself. The wood in these early books is a type of Christ viewed as a Man here. So that the two waters coalesce in that way; the water of death was bitter and brackish, almost as bad as if they had not any, but it is capable of being made sweet. It is the cleansing effect of the water of purification, as we have it in @John 2, capable of being made sweet like wine, which maketh glad; it is stimulating. Generally speaking, the Red Sea is a figure of baptism; the drinking of it at Marah is a type of baptism. According to @Romans 6 we see that Christ's having been into death has changed its character for us; then there is what is sweet, the Spirit becomes that in our souls, sustaining us in our souls.
Ques. If a young convert gets a bad conscience as to something he is going on with, what is the remedy?
J.T. The first thing is to tell God that he is guilty of it. If it were my case or your case that is what we would do, get down before God and tell Him about it; tell the brethren too, that would be a wholesome thing. Then there is the application of the death of Christ. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins" (@1 John 1:9).
H.McM. What the psalmist says is, "Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his path?" (@Psalm 119:9).
J.T. Then the Spirit of God is so considerate of us that He furnishes a scripture to meet that person.
{21}
The cleansing of the leper in Leviticus helps. God takes very great pains where sin appears. Chapters 13 and 14 of Leviticus show how the soul is relieved and made clean. You will find in the types that sometimes a thing happens and you are not made clean till the evening. In other occurrences you are not made clean for seven days, and even for longer sometimes. So that God does not let us off, He chastens us so that we will not go that way again: "He that has suffered in the flesh has done with sin" (@1 Peter 4:1). We ought to see that God takes account of our weakness and inability to take things in, but He will give us to understand that if we do these things and there is the allowance of sin, we cannot escape. But as we go on and experience these things, sin becomes more and more terrible in our eyes; we begin to see how bad it is.
A.L. "He that has suffered in the flesh has done with sin". What is the character of the suffering?
J.T. I think there is suffering; you cannot escape. Where sin has to be dealt with on account of something you have done, there must be suffering. Christ had to suffer for it in the most excruciating way; to look at this is what tends to make us suffer and deepens our spirituality, that we have to do with God -- God who is not mocked. "Thy God is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12:29). It is love, corrective, not punitive -- but suffering lies there.
Rem. There is the other side, that those who do not indulge the flesh suffer.
J.T. Yes, no doubt that is true also. But a sense of having sinned, as seen with David and others, involves suffering.
Ques. Would the man who is unclean till the evening feel it?
J.T. I am sure he would. All that day he would be in a miserable state, although he might have had the word from God that he is forgiven, there is the
{22}
effect that has to be removed. It says here they "journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink" (@Exodus 17:1,2). Yet they had seen wonderful things. They were themselves witnesses of the mighty power of God present in the cloud. So that young people brought up amongst the saints see the thing, what God is to His people, yet they may complain.
Rem. I should have complained if I had been there.
J.T. No doubt you did in your youth and so did I, but that is why we can tell young people about it now and help them to avoid it.
H.B. It seems to have been taken up as a challenge as to whether Jehovah is among them or not.
J.T. It is a test. "Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?", Moses says. They complained against Moses, but Moses represented God. So that when young people begin to complain about the elder brethren, saying there is nothing much amongst us and so on, well that is complaining against God, that is what the enemy is aiming at.
Ques. Did Gideon raise a similar question? "If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?" (@Judges 6:13).
J.T. It is what you see ofttimes, as if God was not there. God does not like that. He is very patient however and there is no rebuke for the people here. God is very patient with the young, but the time will come when He will have to rebuke them, and there may be penalties. This complaining is met by authority in @Exodus 17. Moses is to take the rod with which he smote the river, he and the elders of Israel; it is a question of authority, and what is to
{23}
be noted is that although the rock is smitten, it does not say that the people drank. They are hardly credited with being able to drink, but the water is there. What is needed at this point is the authority of God, and the assertion that someone has to suffer if this case is to be met. I do not suffer, but Christ has to suffer. Moses was told to go on before the people and take the elders of Israel and the staff "wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go". A great matter; the rock is to be smitten, that is Christ had to be smitten.
Ques. Why is it Horeb?
J.T. It is the same range as Sinai but rather denotes grace. Somebody has to suffer, that is what we forget, this condition has to be met, it does not please God; the Sufferer is Christ.
Ques. Would this touch our affections as to the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. That is what I thought. If we are sensitive at all this ought to touch us.
Ques. Is there a word as to the elders; they go on?
J.T. Yes, they do not fall down to the level of the complaining people. But what a leader we have! Moses ought to be regarded as a type of Christ; it is the combination of authority, and yet there is suffering in mind -- a smitten Christ.
Ques. They were all there by the command of Jehovah. If this is done in the sight of the elders should they be intelligent as to what is being done?
J.T. That is the idea; they are the elders in the assembly -- "the assembly in the wilderness" -- to suggest to us that it is God's thought that they should know and reason with the young, with all those who complain. They are witnesses now of things that have happened before them. These elders can give an account of what happened. In @Numbers 20 all
{24}
the assembly is gathered, not only the elders; it is an advanced thought.
Ques. Is the truth of the Spirit's presence confined to a few at first?
J.T. That is right. It is a principle that God is witnessed to, "*ye* are witnesses" Paul says (@1 Thessalonians 2:10). That is the idea here: the complainers have to be testified to. If there be not this element of headship in any meeting, there is great weakness; it needs intelligence and experience to witness to what happened. That is how the assembly was inaugurated, on the principle of witness.
Ques. Do you not think many young people go on with soul difficulties because there is no one to meet them?
J.T. There is a need of elders. We cannot face these matters and have them adjusted without experience with God. These elders who went forward with Moses *saw* what happened. A most solemn matter! Jehovah was there, Moses was there, and the elders were there; the rock was smitten and the water flowed. But for the moment the point is not that the people drank; they are really not in a fit state to drink; when there is complaining like this a process has to be gone through. The Holy Spirit is given to persons; God gives the Spirit, but the point here is that it is given through the sufferings of Christ, not through His exaltation, but through His sufferings. When He is exalted to heaven it is not a question of smiting, but of speaking as in @Numbers 20. People are ready now to drink, and God says, "Speak ye unto the rock". Moses smote it, but that was in rebellion. In spite of his rebellious act the water flowed. That is to bring out the wonderful character of the dispensation, that in spite of the clerical system, in spite of rebellion, the water flows and flows abundantly, so that the people and their cattle drink; there is abundance of water.
{25}
Ques. How do you connect the conflict at the end of the chapter with what we have had?
J.T. That is to bring out the state of the people. In their complaining Satan had come in through Amalek, now they have got conflict, agonising conflict, because it is up and down, Amalek prevailed sometimes -- how serious that is! In these complainings we have not judged ourselves at all. The enemy is only too ready to attack, and he does attack. This prevailing has to be understood.
Ques. Would this be like the spirit of complaint seen early in Acts?
J.T. Yes, the enemy comes in there. He got in in chapter 5, in the sin of Ananias and Sapphira, which was dealt with summarily. Then in chapter 6 they complained because their widows were neglected, a convenient thing to say; it was a national thing, a question of the Hellenists complaining of the Hebrews, that a certain section of the saints were neglected.
H.B. Why is it "thy staff" in the first part of chapter 17 and the "staff of God" in the conflict?
J.T. Well, it represents experience, something to lean on. God says to Moses, "What is that in thy hand?" when He took him up first. What have you got in the way of experience? God says, 'I will use that'. It became the staff of God though it was Moses¬ really, as God said, "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh" (@Exodus 7:1). In principle every minister is representative of God. Experience is what makes an elder -- your experience with God.
A.W.R. God would encourage him as at the riverside (@Exodus 7:20).
J.T. He knew the power that was in the staff. That makes the thing all the more serious as to complaining against the elder brethren, because they represent God in measure. There can be no testimony here without representation of God, hence "ordain
{26}
elders in every city" (@Titus 1:5), or "assembly" (@Acts 14:23); it is a question of authority based on experience or qualification. You can have no testimony without that.
H.B. We find later that the nobles of the people had staves.
J.T. Quite so. John had one too. At Patmos he had a stave to measure things with.
Ques. What is the idea in verse 14?
J.T. Joshua is, I think, a type of Christ here, only in a small way, not yet as the great military leader. When the enemy is attacking, complaining having come in, I begin to see I am powerless, and then the Lord comes in. He is waiting for that opportunity, you acknowledge your weakness. The Lord is ready to come in then; He says as it were, '*I* am taking this matter up'; He gives you to understand that. Even if Joshua does take it up, it is dependent upon intercession above. God is on my side in this, in spite of my complaining spirit.
A.L. How would you bring in Aaron and Hur upholding the hands of Moses?
J.T. We have to take these things as negative, they come in to show the perfection in Christ, He does not need an Aaron and Hur. It is well that we should feel the position as weak: we have got to go through this now, and it looks as if after all I may be defeated. It is to make me see the seriousness of complaining against God, and the elders and Moses.
A.L. It fluctuates because of *our* weakness, and in seeking to do things in our own strength.
J.T. I think so. They complain, and the enemy gets in and they get into trouble. It looks as if you may be defeated. What comes out is that the whole divine system is in my favour, Aaron and Moses and Hur and Joshua; all that God has, the very best, are all in my favour. When I see that it makes a man
{27}
of me. I am connected with this great system that God has set up. The Holy Spirit is present now. Though it does not say they drank, the inference is that they did, the principle is there. So the first writing you get in Scripture is in favour of young christians.
Ques. Do you think this is an effort of the enemy to keep young people from drinking the water?
J.T. I begin to learn to be a military man now, all through my own folly.
Ques. Is this the beginning of the conflict that leads to spirituality?
J.T. "Choose us men", it says in verse 9, implying that you are to choose yourself. Young people are apt to have a critical spirit. Moses says to Joshua, "Choose us men". The principle is that the great divine system is all in my favour.
H.B. Does that imply that the whole position is at stake? Should the spirit of intercession mark us too?
J.T. I think it includes the saints¬ intercession too, although it is on high; all intercession is on high, that is our position morally.
Ques. Would it have in view that young christians should distinguish between the flesh and the Spirit?
J.T. That is how the truth is developed in young people. They begin to see power outside themselves. It is Christ known spiritually. I believe @Romans 8 gives you Joshua. In Joshua, the Lord Himself takes our place and becomes Captain of the Lord's host. Romans works this out.
A.L. Here it is Massah and Meribah. In the second case only Meribah.
J.T. It is taken up spiritually in @Deuteronomy 33:8, "And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive
{28}
at the waters of Meribah". I believe the priesthood comes out here.
A.W.R. Why does the altar come in here (verse 15)?
J.T. I think the thought is that it is worship. You see that progress has been made; an altar brought in is to remind us that some headway has been made. God is going to get something out of this.
H.B. Does the name Jehovah-nissi suggest a definite experience with God?
J.T. That is what is meant. You can put a name on it. That is the principle running through Scripture. When you have put a name on it you have learnt something. The war is to be carried on, Satan would put his hand on the throne. God will not have that. He wants to be on the throne of our hearts. Satan would get hold of you and slay you.
Ques. Was there an attempt of Satan in @Luke 10:17? "Even the demons are subject to us".
J.T. Yes, quite so. The Lord saw the full end of Satan. The first great conflict was with the devil himself. 'The Lord is my banner' is the one who has dealt with the enemy Himself.
Rem. You think this fluctuating experience is chiefly in the young?
J.T. I think not. The most spiritual of us may come under the influence of the flesh and Satan might get an advantage. But you would be recovered quickly. I know how to use the armour of God, whereas the young christian may not.
Rem. Every victory would build up a young believer.
J.T. It is a great thing to see that the Lord is here, that is Joshua. I think it is the first glimpse the young believer gets that Christ is a military Leader on my part against the enemy. Satan entered into Judas, and even Peter was turned against God.
H.B. Romans concludes "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly" (chapter 16:20).
{29}
J.T. That is the sort of thing. He is under Christ's feet now, but he is going to be under our feet.
Rem. Satan would hinder Paul coming to Rome.
J.T. Yes. Paul was greatly afraid that the devil might get in amongst the young christians.
Ques. Would "and his people" in verse 13 be spoiling his goods?
J.T. Well, just so. That indicates what this conflict is. The eye is directed to Christ. Our Joshua broke the power of Satan, He took away the strong man's armour in which he trusted. Then at the cross He annulled him who has the might of death.
H.B. Is @Numbers 20 more the thought of the assembly?
J.T. It is more advanced. Moses is there, of course, and Aaron too, but it says in verse 8, "Gather the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes". But in spite of the disobedience of Moses, as seen in verse 11, the water flowed to bring out the character of the dispensation. In spite of man's disobedience in the service of God the water flows. Otherwise we should not have so much ministry as we are getting now. In spite of the rebellion of the servants in the great hierarchical system, the water flows. God caused the water to flow. The principle here is speaking to the Rock. Why should I not speak to God? If I have need in my soul it is a time for speaking, a time for prayer. "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" (@Luke 11:13), showing the character of the dispensation, that it is a time of asking.
Rem. The assembly are able to drink here.
J.T. We are on a high level here, a state of intelligence contemplated in the assembly. You were saying, Mr. I., something about Elisha seeing Elijah go up; that would be in keeping with it.
F.I. You cannot come into the good of this in
{30}
your soul unless you are in the good of Christ in heaven.
Ques. Would you say that the action of the Spirit here is in accord with Christ in heaven?
J.T. The Holy Spirit really comes down. He is sent down, we are told. Sufferings are the prominent thing in @Exodus 17, whereas the speaking is the prominent thing here; there is no need of smiting here. Christ is in heaven; it is now a time of speaking. The staff contemplates that you are fit to be used; this staff can be used. Moses represents the ministerial side and he is qualified to be used. The staff represents previous experience.
H.B. Was the breakdown that he used the staff in the wrong way?
J.T. He was not to use it at all. It was to be Aaron's staff, which denotes the priesthood of Christ. It contemplates the whole christian position. Moses is the ministerial side of it. The smiting the rock was disobedience -- the whole hierarchy is included in this. In spite of that the water flowed, and flowed in abundance, God having His way after all. It was the priest's staff that had budded; that is resurrection. If He were on earth He would not be a priest, but He is in heaven and hence there is plenty of water. What follows is the brotherly spirit in Israel now. We have to do with brethren all round us, like Edom. Are we going to be sons of peace with them? "Thus saith thy brother Israel" (verse 14). We are speaking as brethren now. There are people around us, our brethren, but they will not listen to us. What are you going to do -- fight with them? No, it says, "Israel turned away from him". You do not want to quarrel with the brethren around, you have to leave them. Here they are in keeping with the mind of God. There are thousands of brethren around us; what we want to do is to go through. Israel were not going to take anything from them.
{31}
Ques. What would you say we get in the next chapter as to the springing well, and then the thought of Sihon and Og coming in?
J.T. That is another feature of the flesh also. They were speaking not only against Moses but against God, a terrible state of things. And what meets it is Beer, the digging by the princes with their staves. Moses is not the only one to have a staff now; the elders have got staves; authority is used now to bring in refreshment.
{32}
SONSHIP
@Luke 24:4; @Acts 1:9 - 11; @Luke 9:30,31
J.T. My thought was to look at the realm in which men are to be, that is, in the divine domain of sonship; and I thought it would be profitable to consider the kind of being, as we may, in which the thought is expressed, as to the resurrection, then of the ascension, then in the Lord Himself on the mount of transfiguration. Luke says at the outset that the angels were saying, a multitude of them, "Good pleasure in men" (chapter 2:15). That is what a multitude of them were saying according to Luke; he is the only one that tells us these things, showing that heaven is not one angel, but a multitude, and that they are conversant with this great thought of Christ, and very jealous as to it -- "Good pleasure in men". In the first passage they are seen as *men*, representing the thought; they are "in shining raiment", indicative of the lustre and glory of the order of manhood now brought in in resurrection. Then we have the shining in "white clothing" in @Acts 1:11. Then on the mount of transfiguration it is "two men ... appearing in glory"; their names are given, that is, they have personal distinction, showing that each one will have personal distinction in heaven. But the first thought is *men*, each having a distinction; each name indicates that. And they are there in dignity too: they are speaking with the Lord. "Lo, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elias".
W. Does "men" convey the thought of full growth?
J.T. It does not seem so in this passage, but is rather to bring out the order of being. When God made Adam, He made a complete man, to bring out
{33}
the order of being. God sets out His great thoughts in the creation; and so in Christ, there is no idea of development in what He brought in. Adam represents the order of being; he is that kind of being.
A.W.R. At the outset does He indicate the adequacy of the testimony to men?
J.T. That is right. Not 'good pleasure in man' but in "men". God has the plural idea in His mind. We have the thought of man too; John makes much of that. Pilate says according to John, "Behold the man!" (@John 19:5). John the baptist calls attention to Him, "Behold the Lamb of God" (@John 1:29,36). Attention is called to the Person of Christ, as pre-eminent in the divine thought. The counsels of God require *men*.
A.W.R. The tabernacle of God is with men; is that a cumulative thought?
J.T. Quite so. We are all "raised ... up together". The only single Man that goes into heaven is Christ. Paul goes in in testimony, the Lord goes in alone, but we all go in together. Israel went into the land together. There was no thought of anyone wanting there, of anyone absent. Though the two-and-a-half tribes elected to stay on the other side of Jordan, forty thousand of them went over, the whole of Israel was secured.
H.B. Does that principle apply, the going into the divine domain together?
J.T. I think so. You embrace all in affection. Some are not with us, but we have them in mind in the assembly; we think of them. We do not come together in assembly in remnant character, the whole assembly is in mind. The Lord said, "Why persecutest thou me?" (@Acts 9:4). That is, the whole assembly is in mind.
Ques. So the twelve men found at Ephesus receive the Spirit together?
J.T. You mean the twelve that Paul found; yes,
{34}
that is significant, it was no accident that it was twelve men, they all got the Spirit together, an important matter, suggestive of a good foundation there.
H.F. Is your thought men in contrast to angels?
J.T. That is what I thought. The angels are seen, in Luke, as serving without any feeling of envy, multitudes of them, representing the full angelic thought. They are so taken up with what has happened. "God was manifest in the flesh, ... seen of angels" (@1 Timothy 3:16). The first time they saw Him was in manhood.
N.F. What is in your mind as to the three passages read? Are they progressive?
J.T. The first, @Luke 24:4, is how manhood appears in resurrection; the lustre and glory attaching to that order in resurrection. Then in the second scripture, @Acts 1:9 - 11 the intelligence as to the ascension, the manner of it, "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven". The manner of the Lord's ascension is perceived, "as ye have seen him go". "If thou see me when I am taken from thee", Elijah says (@2 Kings 2:10). I think wrapped up in this is the manner that becomes us whilst He is away, what goes on in the assembly in the interval. So when they were selecting an apostle it was to be one that had assembled with them "all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us" (@Acts 1:21), I think that is what they would convey -- the manner of the Lord's movements -- "white clothing". Then thirdly, @Luke 9, those on high appear "in glory" -- that is a further thought. John says, "It doth not yet appear what we shall be"(@1 John 3:2) -- although he saw much, there is something more; but anyway they "appeared in glory". So that we shall have bodies of glory, the same persons not in bodies of resurrection merely, but in bodies of glory, "fashioned like unto his glorious body" (@Philippians 3:21).
{35}
H.F. They were perfectly at home in that scene.
J.T. That is what I thought. In heaven we shall be perfectly free to address the Lord; we do not wait for Him to hold out the golden sceptre. Heaven will be a place of liberty.
H.F. Had you thought that if we enter in spirit into these three passages, we should know something of it now?
J.T. I think it is to teach us liberty, to teach us the dignity, the liberty that the speaking would suggest. It is the greatness of the Person that is in mind -- the Lord is before us -- then these two men who were Moses and Elias, were the greatest men you could think of up to that time. They were there and talking to the Lord; they were talking with Him, not He to them. I think the talking was according to what they ministered here, what Moses had been engaged with, what he saw on the Mount, the pattern of the tabernacle; all that would appear to be without effect if this was not so. And so with Elijah.
F.I. Do you mean that the place of distinction they had here was greater than their service? Each one would be known in his distinctive character in heaven?
J.T. Our place in heaven will be greater than what we have here as men.
Ques. Does that link on with His receiving up in the same chapter?
J.T. "The days of his receiving up", corresponding with Man "received up into glory", the glory being beyond what was here in flesh, or even in resurrection. That is what we are to be conformed to, "His body of glory", not merely as One risen, but His body of glory.
H.B. Would these two men suggest the heavenly saints in glorified bodies?
J.T. Yes, they come out here according to the power of God, representing that He can bring them
{36}
out for this purpose. Elijah had gone up into heaven even without dying but he did not go up in a glorified body; all that was awaited. "Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming" (@1 Corinthians 15:23). These are what you might call provisional, to bring out the thought.
W. It is worthwhile laying this up in our souls, how we really stand.
A.W.R. What is the point here in men "in glory" -- these two men have their own distinction?
J.T. We receive our glorious bodies: "afterward they that are Christ's at his coming" would imply that all still await the consummation of it, even these two men. Although we read in @Matthew 27 that many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after His resurrection, we cannot say much about it; it is just a testimony of what God can do.
W.A. What is suggested in the suddenness with which these things take place?
J.T. It is suggestive of the possibilities that lie in the Spirit: "Two men suddenly stood by them". The Spirit in that way would present what is heavenly to us, so that we enter upon it immediately; there should be no need of delay.
W.A. Does it have any bearing on our present position?
J.T. I suppose the Lord is working and stirring us up in that way just now, in view of what may happen suddenly at any time. The Lord may continue in testimony. He *may* do so, but we do not know; the time is ripe in a way.
H.B. Would it be in contrast with the gradual transformation which is our moral experience?
J.T. The Lord may come as we are engaged with Himself. These women were looking for the Lord, you know. "As they were in perplexity about it",
{37}
though in perplexity, still they were looking for the Lord.
Ques. Is it in the same circumstances that the Spirit comes in in @Acts 2? It comes suddenly.
J.T. I think so. It says, "Behold, two men stood by them" as they were gazing toward heaven in @Acts 1. Then in @Luke 2 it says, "Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host", as the shepherds were caring for their flocks by night.
H.F. Did I understand you to say that Moses and Elias could enter into conversation with the Lord because they were intelligent as to what was happening?
J.T. I think that is what is meant to be conveyed. Their ministry would be futile aside from this that they were speaking of. The Lord was about to depart out of this world. Moses well understood what exodus meant, "His decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem". Aside from that, all their previous ministry would be ineffective; it would be futile. God brings these two men there. No doubt they were filled with intelligence at the moment so as to present a complete picture.
A.W.R. How would that apply to us?
J.T. Well, in all these three scriptures it is a question of personal dignity, for even John says, "It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him", although he was here and had seen this, he does not even know as to the whole thing! It is a question of laying hold of what we shall be *there*, of course; that enters into our service here.
The first thing in these scriptures is the *kind* of man, the radiant character of it, even in resurrection. This is what appears in resurrection; no doubt the heavenly thought enters into the shining of the two -- but it was there in resurrection. If the women were
{38}
equal to it, it was as much as to say, '*this* is what you are going to be'.
H.F. Is it significant that it follows on "They found not the body of the Lord Jesus"?
J.T. They were looking for Him dead, a poor thing in a way, and yet there were thousands of others that did not even look for that! You are thankful to see people going to the orthodox church, there is something in that, for there are millions that do not even do that. But then these women are looking for the Lord; they loved the Lord, but it was teaching they needed. Like thousands of christians, it is teaching they need, they really love the Lord, but they are looking for Him in the wrong place, they are looking for a dead Christ.
A.W.R. If room is made for affection, intelligence would follow.
J.T. Affection is the basis of education. These two men could not only tell them things, but they represent in themselves what the divine thought is; as any minister ought to represent morally what he is saying. They would come back to that afterwards. Paul's doctrine would unfold what the saints are going to be in heaven.
A.L. The angels rebuke them in saying, "Why seek ye the living among the dead?".
J.T. There are thousands of christians around us seeking the Lord but seeking Him in the wrong place. Our business very largely is to instruct them. I believe these angels mean that; the shining garments would indicate that the truth is to shine forth. You do not see much shining in what comes out of cathedrals, but what comes out of death enters into this. "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord" (@2 Corinthians 3:18).
{39}
Ques. Would it enable us to stand by them, as these two men did?
J.T. Yes, that is the idea in shining raiment. It is oil that makes your face to shine -- it would shine a bit on them.
H.B. The shining suggests something inside shining out.
J.T. It is the Spirit that shines, not merely on people outside, but as effective inside.
W. Aquila and Priscilla would instruct in the way of God more perfectly.
J.T. Yes, that is the kind of thing. I am sure Apollos would say something afterwards he had not been accustomed to say. He had come from Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, but the shining was needed, and I believe these two would furnish that. I think there is a lot of instruction for us as to the kind and order of man. Paul says, "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (@1 Corinthians 3:11). It is that kind of man. I believe the testimony of God today is more what the saints are, than what they say; what we are, the manner and spirit.
W. "They took knowledge of them [Peter and John], that they had been with Jesus" (@Acts 4:13).
A.W.R. The Lord said to the lepers, "Go, shew yourselves".
J.T. Yes, "Shew thyself to the priest, ... for a testimony to them", "Go, shew thyself". (@Matthew 8:4).
F.I. When the women saw these two men, they could really take their thoughts to heaven. If we are here as shining spiritually amongst the saints, our very contact with them would direct their thoughts to heaven.
J.T. Quite so, the shining is the point all through; do you not think that is rather more what we are?
F.I. Our thoughts would be more on what is
{40}
heavenly instead of occupying ourselves with circumstances here, and things of interest in this scene.
J.T. It says of Stephen in his introduction into heavenly things, "All that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel" (@Acts 6:15); he was a reflection of what was there.
W. The Shunammite woman perceived that a man of God passed by.
J.T. Yes, he passed by her door, and she saw that he was a holy man of God. When the Lord was here He shone; He is not here, but we are here. "Why persecutest thou me?" indicates that there was a reflection of Christ in the saints.
H.McM. Is that why it says "they remembered his words"?
J.T. Quite so. I believe that is how the church is formed characteristically. The apostles had opportunity to see how the Lord Jesus moved: "All the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us". The thought was that from the movements of Christ, there would be knowledge acquired of who He was. When the Holy Spirit comes down the thing is confirmed. That is, christianity is inaugurated; what they were was carried down as formative material in the church, carried down to the present time. Those in the upper room really refer to the kind of material there, even the Lord's mother, all is carried down.
A.L. When Peter goes to Cornelius he bears testimony that they had eaten and drunk in His presence, and in his epistle that they were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
J.T. That is a resurrection thought -- "eyewitnesses of *his* majesty".
H.B. What is the thought in "white clothing"?
{41}
J.T. I suppose that should mark us in view of the period of His absence, from the time He went up till His return. A simple suggestion, I think.
H.B. He has a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and "they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy" (@Revelation 3:4).
J.T. I think that is helpful; the characteristic feature of the garments is purity. Then they tell them that He will come back "in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven". Now He is ascending and coming down. The Lord says, "Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man" (@John 1:51).
A.L. Would you explain that, the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man? Do we see that?
J.T. The allusion is to Jacob's ladder. The passage we are referring to is in John, the other is in @Genesis 28:12. "Upon the Son of man" is a question of His Person; He is the beginning of the movement. The angels here are descending on Him. It is a question of the greatness of the Person that was there. I think it is a marvellous tribute to the Lord's Person.
A.L. To bear witness to what is now here on earth?
W. In Hebrews they are ministering spirits sent forth to minister to them who shall be heirs of salvation.
J.T. "On account of those who shall inherit salvation". They are not presented as coming down, though they must have come down; they are presented as going up first.
F.I. If He had not been here to ascend from, there would be nothing to go up. It is the same kind of principle before He comes down in the way of blessing, there must be the ascension, the going up,
{42}
the appreciation of Christ here; our appreciation of Him as having been here serving in blessing.
J.T. Just so; He was "seen of angels". It is a principle that runs through Scripture, ascending and descending, in relation to what is connected with the Lord. Ascending on Him implies that we should begin there; it would refer to His incarnation, He is here in that position.
W.A. Would the same thought appear in the sacrifices?
J.T. The going up there would be more typical of Christ.
F.I. Is there an alteration here? They are not looking into the grave now, they are looking up into heaven.
J.T. They needed this adjustment because the glory had received Him. They were looking up, that period had ceased. The glory had received Him, the natural sight was shut out.
Ques. What is the thought in the men of Galilee?
J.T. That is reproach. They were not men of Jerusalem; they were men of Galilee; Galilee was under reproach, Nazareth particularly; it was intensified reproach. That is really what the people of God experience. I think we ought to get the thought conveyed in their remarks, not only in their garments but in their remarks. You might say it was a right thing to look up; Colossians tells us to do that. It is not that faith had not existed before, for it had been present from Abel onwards. In the absence of Christ things are on the principle of faith. When He comes back again it will be a period of sight. The period of the cloud is ceasing now. Stephen looked into heaven, there was no cloud. Hebrews is a book of opened heavens, but not for sight, but for faith; "while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen" (@2 Corinthians 4:18). That is one thing. Here it says, "This same Jesus, which is taken
{43}
up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven". That is to be maintained in the interval, the *manner* of His going up: it is a heavenly thought. We are to go up too. It is one great thought to keep before us, the thought of going up. We have to understand *how* He went up.
Ques. Do you get the full effect of this ministry in @Revelation 4, in the twenty-four elders in white raiment?
J.T. Quite so, they are there. John was received up when he saw that. I think there is much in this; there is wrapped up in it the ministry of Paul, the idea of going up; there is the idea of coming down too. "I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven" (@Revelation 21:2).
Ques. Would that be like 2 Kings, mount Carmel and then Samaria?
J.T. Elisha saw Elijah go up. The children say, "Go up, thou bald bead", they ridiculed it, and bears came out and slew them. God would not have that, that the thought of going up should be ridiculed; it belongs to christianity.
W. When the coming of the Lord was revived sixty years ago, it was ridiculed. People said these christians will go up in a hand basket.
J.T. That gives you the idea of the ridicule; we do not go up in a hand basket.
A.L. He says to the two going to Emmaus, "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" (@Luke 24:26).
A.W.R. So the Spirit of God would call attention to Paul, to his manner.
J.T. I am sure there is a great deal wrapped up in that. Paul's ministry is wrapped up in that, in the manner of things. I believe that word 'manner' is bound up with what follows in verse 21, as to the way He "came in and went out" amongst them.
{44}
What are you going to do now? Every movement would be suggestive of something. The Lord is calling attention to the manner in which things are to be done. The Lord broke the bread -- how did He do it? What did He say? The Lord did it, and it is the bread which we break, not only which we eat, but which we break.
H.McM. What follows is "in like manner".
J.T. Just so, the order of the cup, "in like manner also".
F.I. When we see the meaning of the thing, the breaking of bread takes on a different character; there is a divine movement.
J.T. The way the clergy present the sacrament, and the whole service in any church is not the way the Lord gives us things. That is what is in mind here, how *He* does things. So that the assembly convened is a reflection of heaven; it is the same thing; He is "the minister of the sanctuary", you are there in a spiritual way. The Lord said to Nicodemus, according to John's gospel, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven" (chapter 3:13). That was implying not that He went, but that He is there characteristically as belonging to it. The fact that He came down here for a little while, does not alter that fact, that He is characteristically *in heaven*.
Rem. This takes place on the mount of Olives, near to Jerusalem.
J.T. Jerusalem was the place of testimony, and they went into it from the mount; Luke says it was Bethany which was a bit further back from Jerusalem, but the Spirit here says it was from the mount of Olives. Acts looks on to the assembly more; Luke finishes up with the Jewish remnant. So you have the Lord assembling with them almost immediately here, not simply in the same room as they were, but
{45}
"being assembled with them". So that the idea is He would continue to assemble.
Rem. Association with them would be an advance on standing by them.
J.T. Yes, indeed. This is suggestive of an innovation after He arose, not before He rose. So that the book of Acts is more a book of precedents, how the Lord did things, and how the apostles did things, as much as what they said. The Holy Spirit is here to bring things down to us. In other systems of religion it is more what is said, but in regard of christianity the Holy Spirit is here to bring things down, to revive them when they need to be revived.
H.F. Is there anything answering today to the Lord going in and out amongst them?
J.T. I think so, the Lord has promised to come to us.
Rem. David went in and out amongst the people of Israel.
J.T. That is right. He went in and out amongst them, and he led them in, and led them out. You may lead people out and not lead them in; many have done this; but David led them back; he led them into conflict, but he brought them back.
Now the last scripture, @Luke 9, is the heavenly. The Lord says in verse 27, "There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God". It is a very solemn thing to deny oneself, to take up one's cross, and be His disciple. It is not leisurely sitting down, but involves "standing". We do not taste death until we see the kingdom of God. Then about eight days after this, He takes Peter and James and John and was transfigured before them; evidently it was a spiritual transaction; a Person who is in heaven, and a picture of what is in heaven, that is what these two men Moses and Elias represent. We shall appear in the heavenly
{46}
city; we shall appear in glory. It is how we will come out, appearing in glory.
W.A. Qualifications are formed today.
J.T. Just so, the Lord's supper in the assembly is all educative in that way.
H.B. "The fashion of his countenance became different".
J.T. Just so. "As he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering".
Rem. "We shall all be changed, in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye" (@1 Corinthians 15:52).
J.T. The Lord is carrying on a great work quickly, all to bring us back to who He was and is, in view of His suddenly appearing at any time.
{47}
MINISTRY -- JOHN
@John 1:6 - 8, 19 - 37; @John 3:23 - 34
J.T. The subject of ministers and ministry has a great place in the Scriptures; it occurred to me it would be profitable to dwell upon it as involving authority in the presentation of the truth. In the types it comes properly in Exodus -- which may be touched upon tomorrow -- but it comes in there as affording divine sanction to what was in the divine mind to present to men. Therefore Exodus gives us the history of Moses, the great minister, from his infancy, Leviticus the priesthood, and Numbers the levitical service; the latter bringing out how ministers of the truth as presented to God become acceptable to Him, so that He increases their number. He reduced their age from thirty years to twenty-five with this in view. Humanly speaking the number of ministers is great, but God would increase their number as based on acceptability as presented in @Numbers 8.
All that has its place in the New Testament, which we may see later on; but I thought it might be suitable to look at John's presentation of the subject at this reading. He makes very little of christian apostles, of which he was one, as to their service, but makes a great deal of John the baptist. I suppose he had in mind that the assembly had failed -- indeed he records the failure in the last chapter -- so that he presents John the baptist to us as representative of the thought of ministry. He records no failure of John at all; he presents him as representative of the thought of ministry; that is, he is to be taken as an example.
F.W.B. John is spoken of as "a man sent from God"; does that go with the thought?
{48}
J.T. That is what I had in mind, the finished product of a minister is as sent from God. It has been given out that the servants of the Lord who are so accredited are only so called by courtesy; whereas John the baptist coming under that head, would be on other ground; it is really an apostolic suggestion.
F.W.B. Is that what you meant by authority?
J.T. Yes; "sent from God" is apostolic.
W.L. Do you make a distinction between power and authority?
J.T. I think you would agree to that. There are two words used, one is authority, and the other is more dynamic, that is actual power.
W.L. Would authority connect with commission and power with ministry?
J.T. He was filled with the Spirit from the outset. The history of John is given by Luke; Luke gives us things from the outset, and while John gives them from the outset too, he has the finished product in mind. John does not allude to what Luke does; he begins with this man as sent from God.
F.W.B. Did you say he was sent as having been with God?
J.T. That is the force of the original. Luke says he was in the deserts until the time of showing to Israel; there is something to show, something to be seen; John does not allude to that, but says he was "sent from God".
Rem. There is the thought that the testimony should be received, and that God is brought in in the testimony.
J.T. That is the end of our subject in that sense; "He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true" (chapter 3:33). I thought we might see that John leads us on to that, and the voice of the Bridegroom; he is one who "stands and hears" as a friend of the Bridegroom. That will link our subject on with Paul.
{49}
J.C. Is it not solemn that the apostle John alludes to the Baptist on account of the failure?
J.T. That is how we should take it, as coming in in the last days; the minister of another dispensation is representative of the thought. It is not that the thought is not in our dispensation, but it is a day of great failure, and a man of another dispensation is representative of the idea. Those who minister are really ministers; whatever others may have, the ministerial quality is present, and the first thing is to be sent from God. Let others have what they may, this is what John stresses.
F.W.B. Would he be representative of God?
J.T. That is what we should see. The principle of ministry might be illustrated by a royal commission from the king, or an officer in the army, he represents royal authority, his title represents the extent of his commission. John has title with limitations, as not being that great light, whatever he may be he has to recognise what he is *not*.
P.L. Has he derived that from the God of measure?
F.W.B. How does that apply to us in this day?
J.T. Everyone who ministers has to bear in mind as to being *with God*. As John pursues his subject, he brings out service that does not carry a commission outwardly; that is seen in the woman in chapter 4, she goes herself, not as sent from the Lord. John is sent before he qualifies. I believe the woman represents the way to what John presents, in that we qualify and thus are recognised as sent from God. We qualify in what we do.
R.D.H. There is a *man* sent from God; does manhood enter into it?
J.T. Quite so.
F.W.B. Is @John 4 a person just converted?
J.T. She is recognised as a result of the work of God; there is no commission, yet she is successful.
{50}
E.T.S. She is so full of the Person she could not help it.
J.T. That is a great matter among the sisters. She does not say anything about the well, or living water, but she spoke of what affected her immediately: "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done" (chapter 4:29).
J.T.S. Would there be a correspondence in the ministry of John and the woman? He came for a witness to the light and she says, "Come, see a man"; both call attention to the Person.
J.T. That is suggestive. Anyone who does not call attention to Christ, is no minister at all -- "We do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus¬ sake" (@2 Corinthians 4:5). There is a beautiful way to present what is in the *heart* of the minister.
F.W.B. Does that come from John the baptist, in "Behold the Lamb of God"?
J.T. Yes. The Spirit of God stresses *why* he was sent, "That all might believe through him". "John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me" (chapter 1:15). That is a very striking statement of one entirely free from himself. One that cries; he is enthusiastic about it; he does not whisper. This Person was before him; I think that is a fine testimony of John as free from himself and occupied with Christ.
F.W.B. The end of that is that they leave John for Christ.
J.T. That is the line of things presented in this chapter: the minister is free from himself, and the result is disciples become attached to Christ.
P.L. Is the Master Himself free from that -- "He shall not ... cry" -- do the servants do that?
J.T. John cries about it. The next thing is that
{51}
he is tested as to all this, for we may do very well in preaching or ministering Christ, but when people come from Jerusalem and give us the opportunity of being someone, what then? Jerusalem is brought in in verse 19 as representative of religious patronage; it would be a great matter to be recognised there. They would give him a title of some kind; the world is ready to give us titles if we distinguish ourselves; that is the supreme test of the servant.
F.W.B. Do you mean there might be a danger now?
J.T. I think there might be a tendency with brethren to be recognised. It is a gesture from Jerusalem, and the point is, Are people ready to recognise us?
P.L. It is better to be registered among the two living at Jerusalem; would they answer to the one hundred and twenty, the number of the names, in contrast to this religious patronage?
J.T. Heaven would recognise them. The "crowd of names" (@Acts 1:15) would mean that each had distinction; it would tend against it to be in a crowd, but it is there that it comes out.
I.R. How would Paul fit in; he took a long time to be recognised?
J.T. He says he did not go up to Jerusalem to be recognised (@Galatians 1:17). There are those who would distinguish you and make you something.
W.L. Would consciousness of having a commission from the Lord make the servant not seek recognition from others?
J.T. The commission from the Lord makes you proof against patronage; you need no such patronage at all. Those who are sent are of the Pharisees; they fully represent this sort of thing.
P.L. A man's gift makes room for him.
J.T. That is the idea. John acknowledged and denied not; he came out fully as he was. He says
{52}
nothing to that at all and it only served to bring out what Christ was to him.
E.T.S. What about his answer? he says, "I am the voice".
J.T. "Voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of the Lord". He is putting the wilderness against Jerusalem; he makes no allusion to training or experience or education such as the world can give him; he was a wilderness-man. It is in the deserts; they are not the place for human culture, and then he was but a *voice* in it; he falls into line with the prophet Isaiah, "Make straight the path of the Lord". He added nothing to the world and expected nothing from it.
J.C.M.W. Would that indicate that he expected nothing except from God?
J.T. That is the thought. You owe nothing to the world. The world will say, You have no qualification that entitles you to be a servant of the Lord, and you accept that. Your qualifications are in the desert from God.
E.T.S. It did not satisfy them; they question why he goes on.
J.T. "Why baptisest thou?". "I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". That was not saying much; he was just baptising with water, but he did not need to tell them everything; he told them what they saw him do every day, but the point is "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know"; the leading men of the christian world do not know Him, though He is among them.
F.W.B. Would 'standing' imply that he was ready to serve?
J.T. I think that is it, ready to be active but not active yet.
{53}
P.L. "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking" (@Revelation 3:20).
J.T. That is true.
F.W.B. It might be true in our meetings; He might be there ready to serve; are we prepared?
J.T. Quite so. It is withering -- One whom ye do not know! Certainly that ought to put us into movement as to Who this Person is; do I know Him? Am I taken up with the servant? He was among them; why did they not know Him?
J.C.M.W. John was not the light or the Christ, but brought both into evidence in his ministry.
J.T. Quite so.
J.T.S. Had they listened to John they would not have said, "How knows this man letters?".
J.W.S.W. John says, "I knew him not".
J.T. Quite so, but the Pharisees did not know Him; those with good titles religiously did not know Him; it brushes aside religious colleges and seminaries.
J.C. Would Simeon and Anna be further on, they knew the Lord, whereas John did not?
J.T. They were older. They knew Him, of course. John is addressed as a babe spiritually, "*Thou*, child", before he becomes a man at all. It is unique. God would see that he knew Him ultimately, but all that is outside of Jerusalem and its education and men preparing themselves to be ministers.
J.C. Is knowing the Lord qualification for ministry?
J.T. I think so. "He who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me ..." in that way we get a definite knowledge of the Lord.
J.C. That is a minister's qualification.
J.T. Yes. The minister sees a little more than the needs of his own soul; he is shown things.
Ques. He witnesses to the light of the Son of God; is that something further?
{54}
J.T. God saw that John got the vision, the Spirit coming down and resting upon the Son; he *saw* the Spirit, a wonderful thing! No other speaks of Him in that way, but he sees Him in relation to the Son. The Son baptises with Him.
F.W.B. Seeing the Spirit coming down is testimony to John, how do you apply that to us?
J.T. That is a great matter. John is not presented as a believer developing through the needs of his soul; he is addressed as a babe in view of the ministry. Even the babe unborn moves in regard of Christ, and his father addresses him, "*Thou*, child". He goes before the face of the Lord, and seeing the Spirit bears record; it is in that way a suggestion to the servants how they apprehend the Spirit. I can only understand this wonderful Person as the Spirit makes Him known to me; I learn in the way It came upon Him, that is, Christ, the Son of God. All that enters into the qualification of the minister.
F.W.B. He baptises with the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Yes.
W.A.S. The words "Come and see" are characteristic of John.
J.T. Yes.
W.L. Would the girdle of skins be the way to all service? I thought it might suggest the restrained power of death as applied to myself.
J.T. That is a good suggestion.
W.L. He was restrained by that which speaks of death.
J.T. Very good, the leathern girdle means death.
W.L. Elijah was girded likewise.
J.T. Yes, and Peter as in the house of the tanner has the same thing before him, all a voice to ministers; it is death coming close to us.
Rem. Every movement of the Spirit would distinguish the Son of God.
J.T. That is what we gather; we can only arrive
{55}
at the knowledge of the Son of God by the Spirit. John's impression would never leave his soul, the distinction put upon the Son by the Spirit; he is speaking now by the Spirit, this is the way he comes into the knowledge of the Son of God.
J.C.M.W. He was shut up to the Spirit.
J.T. He would look for that, and I have to look for it; it is *only* by the Spirit I apprehend the Son of God. We have the Scriptures, of course, but the understanding of this is by the Spirit.
J.G.M.W. There can be no effective ministry without it.
J.T. That is important. We must come to the knowledge of the Son of God in the appointed way.
Ques. Is that what Paul means when he speaks of God revealing His Son in him?
J.T. Yes, it is by the Spirit.
J.R. Is the appearing of tongues of fire in @Acts 2 in relation to what you are speaking of?
J.T. I think that is an important suggestion; attention is called to the saints in the sense that the Spirit comes in the way of power, "a rushing mighty wind", and it sat upon each of them. You can see the difference between those persons and this Person. If the Holy Spirit calls attention to me, it is that I need power, fire is there, to call attention to the fact of sin being in me; with the Lord it is different, the dove comes where there is nothing to judge, no fire is needed.
W.A.S. Do we see the action of the fire in Ananias and Sapphira?
J.T. If the Holy Spirit comes upon me it calls attention to the need of fire.
J.T.S. Are the words in @John 15, "*He* shall bear witness concerning me", and "He shall glorify me" (chapter 16) connected?
J.T. The Spirit would glorify Christ. Do you not think it is important to see the difference between the
{56}
saints and Christ? On our side it is infinitely great but He comes in the way of fire; but if He came on us as being raised from the dead and going into heaven, there would be no fire.
J.T.S. Would the result be seen in the word from John, "He must increase, but I must decrease"?
J.T. John felt the difference between himself and Christ. There is a great difference, He is anointed *above* His companions.
W.L. The giving of the Spirit without measure was there.
J.T. He gave Him without measure at Pentecost.
F.W.B. Does the idea of a dove suggest that God has what He desires in Christ?
J.T. God is working up to Christ. In @Genesis 1 the suggestion is perfection so far as what is in hand is concerned; but now God has reached His end in Christ.
Rem. The end of ministry is that God shall receive that.
J.T. Yes.
F.W.B. God has reached His end in Christ, and in the gospel it is that every one else should come to the same thing.
J.T. Quite so. He sees Jesus coming to him. That is another thing. That is important for any person to see the Lord Jesus coming to him; He comes to the saints, but the point here is he comes to the minister. The Lord singles him out for Him to come to him; it is unique, but there is the suggestion of His coming to the servant.
Rem. He comes to the man at the pool in chapter 5; to the woman in chapter 4 and the blind man in chapter 9.
J.T. He served them, but there is no instance like this in this gospel; John sees Him coming to him, that is something for us to apprehend, to see Jesus
{57}
coming to you; the bearing of that movement is in regard to what I am doing.
E.T.S. It must have impressed him as having seen the Spirit descending.
J.T. It would indicate what John's ministry was to be; there is more in it than that, but I am speaking of the effect on the servant.
W.L. Would the revelation to Paul be on that line?
J.T. "What I shall appear to thee in" (@Acts 26:16).
J.R. Is what John says in verse 29 an exclamation or testimony?
J.T. There is much in the fact that he sees Him coming; there is much to impress John as to his service. If I am to serve I must apprehend His service, the bearing away of the sin of the world, that enters into the service of all. It is a great matter.
Ques. When does John bear witness to the Son of God; he calls attention to Him as the Lamb of God; is it verse 34?
J.T. I think it is a general fact. John says he bore witness; he was not behind what he saw; it is the idea that you are not behind the light you get.
Ques. Was it the spiritual impression he got at the baptism?
J.T. We do not get the voice from heaven here, but it is that he is not behind what he saw. You go and preach the gospel and you think that is all you have to do, but you have to do a great deal more. You are governed by what you see in your ministry, John makes it clear that as he apprehended, so he spoke.
W.L. Is it John who says, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand" (@John 3:35)?
J.T. That is the evangelist; I think these two verses are the Spirit through the evangelist. John's
{58}
record enters into christianity almost; you can hardly tell where he ceases speaking and the Holy Spirit resumes the thread through the evangelist. He is full of the Person, seeing Him walking.
E.T.S. What do you suggest as to the night?
J.T. It gives time to think over; he has not altered his mind, he rather increased his thought of the greatness of Christ.
P.L. "Even in the nights my reins instruct me" (@Psalm 16:7).
J.T. Yes, and John sees Him sacrificially. It is not administrative, but he apprehends the Person coming in sacrificially; it is a sacrifice to serve; that should enter into ministry.
E.L.M. Would the reflection fortify me against the influence of those who said, "All come to him"?
J.T. Quite so. The saints do not always help the minister; the atmosphere was not too good. Reasoning does not help things; it was a low state among the saints; he was in danger of being affected by it.
P.L. Would the only way to be clear of the contention be to retire into the love of the bride for the bridegroom?
J.T. You can see how necessary it is. The thought of the bridegroom is an elevating thought. It is a matter of purification, and John is equal to the position. It is something for the servant to be full of the relation of Christ to the assembly.
P.L. Is the apostle above the party spirit in saying he had espoused them to Christ?
J.T. You can see that.
E.L.M. Would the receiving of ministry from heaven give character to the ministry today? He traces his ministry to heaven, and would that not be an element of ministry?
J.T. So much is made of the Baptist. John leaves that and leads to the great thought of He who comes from above, and the joy of the Bridegroom.
{59}
F.W.B. He seems to take delight in being a friend.
J.T. I thought it would allude to our subject tomorrow. Paul is minister of the assembly, not merely a friend.
Rem. John is a 'voice' to the Pharisees but a 'friend' of the Bridegroom.
J.T. It is very beautiful; there is nothing about the Bridegroom in chapter 1 -- John is getting on.
Rem. I wondered if it was suited to the company in question.
J.T. Yes, quite so.
{60}
MINISTRY -- PAUL
@Acts 26:12 - 18; @1 Corinthians 4:1 - 6; @2 Corinthians 3:4 - 6; @2 Corinthians 11:1,2
J.T. It was remarked yesterday that John's presentation of the subject of ministry, ignores or slights the apostles. Having the last days in view the Spirit anticipates the breakdown of ministers, those officially known as such; indeed, in the last chapter he records the sorrowful departure of seven of them, including the leading apostle, Peter, but records the recovery at the same time which points to the last days of the dispensation. So John brings in John the baptist, and enlarges upon him as minister, omitting any failure on his part; and pursues his remarks about Christ, until he reaches Him as the Bridegroom, John saying he is the friend of the Bridegroom, who stood and heard Him. That is a minister, who can stand when Christ is brought in, making room for Him. Ministry may shut Christ out; it may be so active and so official as to shut out Christ. So he records John standing twice; he stood as Jesus walked (chapter 1:36), and then, as the friend of the Bridegroom, he "stands and hears him" (chapter 3:29). He finishes by a most striking tribute to the Person of Christ as coming from above, linking all with heaven in that way. All that comes out for men is linked with heaven; it was thought that the link is established between his ministry and Paul's in the thought of the 'Bridegroom'.
In the three accounts of Paul's conversion we have his commission alluded to, he is appointed a servant, a word which, as the note in the New Translation shows, is the dignity of the official servant (@1 Corinthians 4:1). The verses in 1 Corinthians
{61}
show that in exercising his ministry he finds himself in troubled waters, and in both epistles he greatly stresses the thought of ministers and ministry; the troublous conditions amongst the saints indeed give occasion to stress the idea of ministry through the need for it, showing that what is needed is authority from God and the moral weight which should go with it.
F.I. There seems a difference in regard to John the baptist, in that John is prepared from his birth but not so with Paul.
J.T. So that John the baptist corresponds more with Moses; although Paul says he was separated from his infancy. God had him in mind, but he is not taken up spiritually from his infancy as John was; he is allowed to pursue a lawless course, though in it he had a good conscience and earned respect from God.
Rem. They were both sent ones, both John and Paul.
J.T. That must enter into all ministry. It is in principle the apostolic thought: "How shall they preach unless they have been sent?" (@Romans 10:15), and yet as we noticed yesterday in John's gospel, we find a woman testifying without being sent, that is the woman of Samaria. In the Acts we find Philip serving without being sent, and afterwards he is sent, indicating that brothers and sisters may serve according to what their hand finds to do, and as they serve effectively, they are taken on formally, and commissioned.
A.D.D. In what way are they commissioned today?
J.T. I am using the word, as I may say, in the abstract to make the position clear. It is not that brothers should assume to be commissioned in these broken days, but the principle of it must be there. It is a definite understanding with the Lord as to
{62}
their work, which would be acknowledged by those who are spiritual.
J.T.S. Would "The Levites are at their work" in a day of recovery be on that line?
J.T. I think so. A man's service as supported of God will be owned, so that it amounts to a formal commission; anointing is there.
S.B. Would the Lord confirm them in such a way that the brethren would recognise it?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. The apostle is challenged in Corinth by some there; he says, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me" (@2 Corinthians 13:3). Notice the expression, "Christ speaking in me"; they were his converts, and as such, a testimony to his commission and the effectiveness of his service.
F.S.M. Would it work in this way, that the love of Christ would create the impulse, and being found faithful in a simple way, the Lord would confirm that through the brethren?
J.T. That is how it works. The spiritual ones will discern what a man has, and give scope accordingly; but it is as facing troubled conditions that it tells. At Corinth the spirit of division had come in, and there were those who put themselves forward in the service as rivals of Paul. That is sure to happen in regard to everyone who is commissioned; he will be challenged and rivalled, so that he has to fall back upon divine power for his credentials; hence the apostle brings forward the manner of his ministry which was not in words of human wisdom, this was the case of those that rivalled him, "but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power" (@1 Corinthians 2:4). It is undeniable by all who are right-minded; the minister has to remember that. Paul has his commission from the Lord, according to the three records of his meeting with the Lord, and he says he was appointed "minister" and "witness".
{63}
E.L.M. Would the idea of witness be that what he ministered was livingly exemplified in him?
J.T. That is what we should see, so that in his absence from Corinth he sends Timotheus, so that they might see in Timotheus his ways in Christ.
E.L.M. The moral side would support the official side in this case.
J.T. That is the thought. There was no comparison at all between him and his rivals, they were not converted men; doubtless men of parts as we say, but men that would be accepted with non-spiritual people. He is compelled to bring himself forward, his sufferings and what he endured, to meet that condition. It was necessary, and it was well he had the things to bring forward, for the minister has to remember he is to be challenged, and he has to produce his credentials.
F.I. Is there any sense in which the official side is seen today?
J.T. In moral power, I think; the excellency of power is of God, it is equal to the anointing.
E.L.M. Would the sense of being sent be the secret support for the servant, but the credentials be on the moral side for others?
J.T. Yes. You know what transaction you have had with the Lord, but that will not be for others.
Rem. The apostle was proceeding to Damascus for destruction, but learnt authority and power from heaven afterwards.
J.T. I am sure he would. His position is very similar to that of Moses. I think the books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, bring out Moses¬ position officially and Stephen says, "This is the Moses ... who was in the assembly in the wilderness" (@Acts 7:37,38); that is where he gained his testing, where everything is adverse. How did he behave there? One of the severest tests was the envy of Miriam and Aaron; they are linked with him as leaders of Israel
{64}
and they envied him, saying, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only to Moses?". Moses never challenged that; he was justified in it, so that it was a sore attack but he had to face it. I think the position is very similar to Paul's at Corinth; he was in that sense in "the assembly in the wilderness", the jealous spirit rivalling him in those nearest to him.
Ques. Would you make any difference between challenging the ministry and instructing the servant as Aquila and Priscilla did Apollos?
J.T. That is another very beautiful side of the position; the brethren help you.
Rem. Aquila and Priscilla took Apollos to themselves.
J.T. Wisely avoiding anything open; they would not have gained anything that way.
E.L.M. Would you see the same grace in Paul going up to Jerusalem (@Galatians 2:1)?
J.T. That is where there are persons of repute to challenge privately, which involves the wisdom that is necessary in the position.
J.L. Does it always need the two things, authority and moral weight, in order that recovery should come about?
J.T. I think moral weight should go with the gift; that is all observers have to go by. What you are with the Lord privately they do not know; what you find in Paul in the wilderness position is that he thrusts himself into the position, so that he was one of the elements to observe. "I have transferred ... to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us". The tendency amongst ministers is not always to pull together; it is always a difficult matter. They may pull together in a right cause, but the apostle places himself in that setting with Apollos, to show they were not partisan or had any understanding on any given line, they were moving in the unity of the Spirit. He throws himself
{65}
and Apollos into the position of rivalry, so that the others might learn in *them* what is according to God in ministers in those conditions. That is the way out of such conditions. Jehovah said, "Come out ye three" suddenly, and the three came out to the door of the tabernacle. There Jehovah justifies His servant. There is a man God can point to; always a great matter in a trouble. Someone God can approve leads the way out of the confusion. "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ" (@1 Corinthians 11:1). Paul points to himself by the Spirit, a testimony to the power the man had.
E.L.M. Does Paul take that up in the second scripture in not judging anything till the Lord comes?
J.T. That is what he says. The idea is that anyone that thinks of him should think of him in this way; he is open, and says, Let them think of us as "ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God". There were mysteries and he was in charge of them, like the storekeepers of old under David. There were stores where dedicated things were kept; and the apostle is a steward. As regards ourselves we are yours; that is, the true minister is the property of the saints; he is servant of all.
S.B. In that way he was morally great enough to reach every condition among the saints to profit?
J.T. Yes. He was there in a very humble attitude, but on the other hand he had a great charge, and that is to be respected. There is a tendency unconsciously to belittle the one who serves, and that may be overlooking the fact that he is a steward of God. A mystery to look after is a great matter!
P.L. "And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it" (@Colossians 4:17).
J.T. That is it. He is really a custodian of a mystery from God; he has to be regarded in that light.
{66}
E.L.M. What is the difference in the thought of servants of Christ, and being in responsibility to the Lord; what would be the relative thought in the two titles?
J.T. Of course the word "Christ" is more familiar, pointing to the Lord as in the anointing. As Christ, He is anointed to carry out the divine will; but as "Lord" it is His authority by which He governs us. In the first sense you feel you are with Him; If ye seek proof, the apostle says, of Christ speaking in me, it will be by seeing God's power. It is a precious thing to be alongside of Christ.
E.L.M. You would be in touch with the fulness of that vessel, Christ.
J.T. So that the commission places you on the same platform as Christ, in measure, and you are towards all in the ministry.
J.C. So that the idea of the Lord breathing into the disciples in @John 20 is that the same power was to be theirs.
J.T. That is it. Saul was breathing out threatenings and slaughter -- what a different breath!
J.C. Does he come in later, on the line of Moses -- "Faithful in all mine house" (@Numbers 12:7) -- in the support of his ministry?
J.T. That is helpful. How Jehovah justifies His servant, and not only that, but He calls attention to the fact that he was faithful in *all* God's house, a remarkable thing when you think of the assembly in the wilderness. Think of a man set to be faithful in all that; and then, "the man Moses was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth" (@Numbers 12:3). In the exercise of his ministry the man shone.
P.L. Do we have in his standing before Pharaoh, what he is in the presence of an adverse world? Then in the assembly in the wilderness, in Deuteronomy, what he is in power in the contrary conditions amongst the brethren, loving the christian circle;
{67}
and then, on the mount of transfiguration what he is in heaven?
J.T. Just so. What a field is covered in those books, and it might perhaps be helpful to remark that in Exodus we are on ministerial ground. Genesis is a testimony to God's work, what results from the work as left to itself; but when you come to the ministerial books, Exodus to Deuteronomy, God is saying, Things must be according to My way now. You have a living picture of Moses from the time he was a babe in Exodus, a history going back eighty years before he began to serve; and what you find is, that he did not fear the wrath of the king. He was not influenced in that way. In New Testament language you are not concerned with them that kill the body. Moses fled, and sits by a well, as if he had learnt that ministry is dependent on the power of the Spirit of God. With that he is disciplined for forty years; what a protracted process of training it is!
F.S.M. Is the servant sent forth conscious of the dignity of the service on account of his training, and yet lowly in the way the ministry is carried out?
J.T. That is the way it stands. As actually in the service, the Spirit says, "This is that Moses" (@Exodus 6:27); he is the product of the discipline of God; that is what God needs in His servants.
E.T.S. "There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face".
J.T. I suppose each minister has some distinction. The pronouncement "This is that Moses", indicates there is only that one; other ministers might get a vision, but not so Moses -- "the form of Jehovah doth he behold" -- we have Jehovah's word for it (@Numbers 12:8). These appearances underlay the minister; the burning bush is the first one, so far as we can see.
T.T. Does every faithful servant count upon the appearance, and would the Lord confirm us by fresh impressions from time to time?
{68}
J.T. That is what comes out in Moses. Moses refers to the bush in the blessing of Joseph, "the goodwill of him that dwelt in the bush" (@Deuteronomy 33:16) -- the sense of it never left him.
E.L.M. Is the confirmation increasing as with Paul?
J.T. Think of the appearance to Moses, and the innumerable speakings; Moses could always enter the holiest and hear the divine voice, and that is open to us. What underlies ministry is seeing God -- "the form of Jehovah doth he behold" -- I think God is set for more excellent service; He needs servants, and there are a few, but we are enjoined to pray that He will send out labourers into the harvest; but then, He sends finished labourers.
J.C. Would that be a stay for Moses at the time of the golden calf, what he saw in the bush?
J.T. It would enhance his horror of the awful sin that had been committed.
E.L.M. Is there not an idea of continuity in the service, and the testimony that Paul gives in @Acts 26 was what he had gleaned from Moses? See verse 22.
J.T. Quite so. Then to move on to 2 Corinthians what may be remarked is that in the first epistle the apostle is speaking of his stewardship, but now as the competent minister of the new covenant. That is an advance in his service, so that he has something positive, not only the exercise of authority, but his hands are filled with something to minister to them positively. He has the love of God to minister; what a precious thought to bring God in in His love! God has *made* us "competent, as ministers of the new covenant", he says. "Not of letter, but of spirit"; that is a word we need; we are apt to get too literal about it. It is intended to broaden us spiritually, and enlarge us, so that our minds do not run in ruts in regard to the covenant. It is a question
{69}
of God's love; how can you minister that unless you have a broad outlook?
J.C. Would the competency be for the expression of the covenant?
J.T. I think so. He says, "Having this ministry"; he had it. He was the minister of the gospel to the church, but also of the new covenant, "having this ministry".
J.T.S. In speaking of abundantly loving them do you see something of that feature in Paul?
J.T. That is right; abundantly loving the brethren; if anyone challenged him he would say God knew he loved the saints. He loved the saints as Moses did.
S.B. Does the mention of Paul's conversion three times seem to enlarge upon it?
J.T. He mentions it twice, and the Holy Spirit mentions it the first time. He is able to speak of it according to his audience; he does not present it as repetition. In speaking to Agrippa he speaks of it as dignified; christianity did not put him below that. There is the side of dignity.
E.T.S. Might we have a word on chapter 11?
J.T. It was the thought of the Bridegroom and the bride. It will be observed he says in chapter 10:1, "I myself, Paul", there is someone like Moses, without a rival. There is no one like that. Elsewhere, it is "Such a one as Paul the aged" (@Philemon 1:9), it is distinctive, and as the servant gets older it is not a question of years only, but of entering into those years of service, being *such* a one, calling attention to the outcome of those years. I apprehend his life was very full, for there is no evidence that he was very old in years as David was; it is a matter of what was compressed into those years.
P.L. David's life was full of days, riches and honour.
{70}
J.T. Yes. "Full of days", and what days they were! You marvel at the life of David! war, victories, armies that had to be formed, led, fed, clothed and furnished; and the psalms he wrote, and all the things that entered into his life in forty years. Lives of servants are compressed lives; more enters into them than into the ordinary lives of men.
E.T.S. So that we can be sympathetic with those that break down.
J.T. It is important that they should not.
E.L.M. Is there a point in the meekness and gentleness of Christ?
Rem. Moses felt the conditions too great but not so Paul.
J.T. Indeed we have to own that with Paul too; but the correspondence is striking as to the men, what they were as having to do with the church in the wilderness.
E.L.M. Can you not think of Paul leading armies and sending servants out here and there, as David marshalled his forces?
J.T. Think of the "burden of all the assemblies"! If you go over the assemblies now, and pray for them, how onerous a matter that is; but "the crowd of cares" that poured in upon him, besides the five floggings and all that is mentioned in this epistle, is only a part.
E.T.S. Would the thought of what the Bridegroom would get out of it be a stay to the servant in all his conflicts and exercises?
J.T. "Would that ye would bear with me in a little folly; but indeed bear with me. For I am jealous as to you with a jealousy which is of God; for I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ". That was what was in his mind. John spoke of his joy being full in hearing the voice of the Bridegroom, how much greater to bring in the bride!
{71}
H.P.T. You have the idea in occupying us with the servant that it is to lead on to Christ?
J.T. That is what all servants are for, to lead the saints on to Christ.
F.S.M. Would the apostle be compensated as seeing bridal features in the assembly?
J.T. So also in the epistle to the Thessalonians, and how the apostle speaks of them!
E.L.M. Is the climax in the end of Ephesians "All them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption" (chapter 5:24)?
J.T. So that in this epistle, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha". The great point is love for Christ; and then in Ephesians "all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption". That is the end in view; and I believe Deuteronomy has that in view. Jehovah loved the people; Moses is victorious in Deuteronomy. Jehovah is angry with him for the people's sakes, never for himself.
E.T.S. So Moses sees the land.
J.T. He sees the land with the people in it, really. It corresponds with "raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" (@Ephesians 2:6); you see them there.
{72}
LIBERTY
@Galatians 5:1; @Matthew 12:1 - 8; @Revelation 21:9 - 11
I have in mind to speak of liberty, in a spiritual sense. It will be observed that in the passage in Matthew a particular time is stressed, and ministry of the word has to take account of time; so, I apprehend the thought of liberty is needed to be stressed at the present time. The epistle to the Galatians was written in regard to the conditions of that particular time and particular place, in order to assert the principle of "the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free". The enemy endeavoured at that time to snatch it away from the saints, for the apostle tells us that certain had crept in unawares to spy out the liberty which we have in Christ Jesus. That persons should trouble themselves in that way to enter clandestinely amongst the brethren to spy out their liberty, is remarkable, for it was not a commodity which they could steal and use; they could not seize it; but their object was purely to rob others, as we may say, of their inheritance. As a thing it would be impossible for them to steal it, but they spy it out, in order to deprive the saints of it, and destroy it as their portion. Such are the malicious tactics of the enemy always, to destroy for the sake of destroying what love has effected.
These are solemn suggestions as to what the enemy is constantly set for -- to destroy what we have, out of hatred; but against that the apostle stresses that Christ has set us "free in freedom" -- a remarkable expression -- and that we are to stand fast in the liberty.
Now my object mainly is to show how we come into this principle; for most of the brethren are not in it at all. Satan has succeeded in alluring many out
{73}
of the liberty with which Christ has set us free, and therefore the ministry of liberty has peculiar application in our times. Not only this, but those of us who have come into it are to stand in it, that others might come into it. For this, as in all else, we have to see it expressed in Christ. It enters into His remark to Thomas, "I am the way" (@John 14:6); He is a way for us, and that involves how He moved here. He leads in everything, not only in teaching but in example too; that has to be understood. He requests in the end of @Matthew 11 that all should come to Him: "Come to me, all ye who labour ... Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me". "Learn from me" is by His example, and the babes had to learn everything from Him. The Father, indeed, had revealed things to them, but had not become Man to be a leader for them, but the Son had. This is the way in which the expression "the way" is to be understood; that the Lord has to be understood as Leader in everything. God is leading many sons to glory, but has made our Leader "perfect ... through sufferings" (@Hebrews 2:10). The thought of liberty is thus extremely important for us, as first exemplified for us in Christ. It is doubly important that we should learn it, because it is through us as having been taught that others learn it.
We read of "the revelation of the sons of God" (@Romans 8:19), the whole creation looks for it; not perhaps with intelligence, but with instinct; it has been subjected to vanity, but it is to be released from the bondage of corruption "into the liberty of the glory of the children of God". You see how the saints of this dispensation are brought into the centre of things, in order that the whole realm of creation should be brought into liberty; that is, it awaits the revelation of the sons of God, and the liberty of the glory of the children of God -- a very touching thought! I believe that is bound up in sonship, in the peculiar way in which the saints are to be manifested by and
{74}
by, and when I say 'manifested' I allude to what we *shall* be. John, the apostle, says it is not yet manifested "what we shall be". We might assume that John knew what we shall be; he wrote long after the Lord was manifested in the flesh, but he says, "What we shall be has not yet been manifested" (@1 John 3:2).
I want to dwell a moment upon that: "What we shall be", the apostle says, "has not yet been manifested", but "we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him" -- that is enough. What He is *now* is the point. There is what He *was* in the days of His flesh; His flesh was a veil indeed; and there is that which He was from the morning of resurrection to the day of ascension -- that is, what He was in a *spiritual* way. He had taken on a new condition; it involved complete superiority to matter; the point is it was spiritual. He moved in and out amongst them, disregarding what was material, so that the stress is upon the spiritual; but there is more than that attaching to His position in heaven. His position *in heaven* transcends all that is approachable by the human eye; even transfiguration is not equal to what He is now. He was transfigured before them on the holy mount, and John saw that, and nevertheless says, it is not manifested "what we shall be". That is as conformed to Christ in glory. He is received up in glory, but then He is all glorious; there is infinite radiance and light from Himself; it is not what He takes on, but what He *is*. He is transfigured before them, but what He is is from Himself; the increasing display of glory and greatness is of Himself. When *He* is manifested we shall be like Him, "for we shall see him as he is", not as He *was*. There is no change in the Person but there is change in what we see. Think of the manifestation of the sons of God, and then the liberty of the glory of the children of God! Creation comes into "the
{75}
liberty of the glory of the children of God", but our liberty exceeds all this; it comes nearer to the liberty of Christ.
I wish to show how this came about in the Lord. He moved through the corn; that was deliberate. The point is not what He said, but what He did. For young people here it is important to notice what spiritual persons *do*. In the gospels we have examples set by the Lord; in the Acts it is what the apostles and others who are spiritual do. The term 'Acts' is appropriate, because it describes what is visible, the inauguration of a state of liberty and glory in a moral sense. The apostle that was selected to replace Judas, was one that had companied with them the whole time from the baptism of John until He was received up; not a moment of that time was to be missed. The apostle to fill the place should be one of those; it is a question of what they were, not only of what they said. So in the gospels, it is not only a question of what the Lord said, but of what He was: He says, "Learn from me", that is, how He moved; these circumstances have their present force, and from them we learn how to move.
It was inevitable but that this movement should cut across what was current in Judaea, and Galilee, and Jerusalem, what was generally accepted, the legal obligations that honour the flesh. The Lord selected the sabbath to set out the principle of liberty He enjoyed. He made the law honourable, yet it was the law given by Moses, not what they had made it. It had been added to and perverted and had lost its identity in other hands, and they would not lift a finger to carry the burdens. He brought in a principle from heaven that has more than magnified and made it honourable; He moved in the liberty and dignity of a Man out of heaven. It was a new thing, and He moved here for God, but in doing this He cut athwart what was current religiously.
{76}
What I want to show is that it was a particular time when these instructions were necessary; He was leading His own on to the footing of the assembly. Aside from this teaching no one can be in the assembly according to God; he is in it in self-occupation unless he understands what the Lord had in mind in this action. He entered into the cornfields, that is all -- *He led the way*. That is what I would say to any who need liberty. The disciples did more than that, but He intended them to do it. The Lord gives you a lead in the corn on the sabbath day. You are transgressing the law in the eyes of the religious world; they will not overlook this. Never mind; you are being extricated; you are coming out of bondage and that can only be said of the christian as the whole person, including the spirit, is in liberty. You have not received the spirit of bondage but the spirit of adoption. The apostle says we cry, "Abba, Father" by that Spirit. Maybe you are not doing that? That is, He takes us out of the religious world and gives us access to God. He cries Himself in the saints; the Holy Spirit does not cry aside from the saints; but He is here, in relation exactly to what the Lord did in this chapter. He cries, "Abba, Father"; it is urgent -- and He makes you feel it is urgent; and He points out to you in the gospel of Mark that the Lord Jesus did that, He cried "Abba, Father" by the Spirit.
"Ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father"; there is now an outlet to the Father, and the Holy Spirit is here in relation to what the Lord did to make it experimentally true in the christian, that we have access to the Father. You can appropriate also anything there is to eat for food. Many are restricted from reading and appropriating what God provides in the way of food.
The Lord Himself was the food. That enters into the passage. He Himself was the cornfield and the
{77}
grain, and He would lead them into the liberty of partaking of it. He does not pluck the corn, but He does enough to set their souls on the line of liberty. They saw it and acted accordingly; they got food. Many of our brethren are starving; the enemy sees to it that they do not reach such books as would provide for what their souls need to eat. The Lord would virtually say to us, I have come down from heaven to be food, and the enemy's business is to prevent your partaking of what is under your hand. He went into the cornfield. Christianity is not an order of things that is to be understood from the dictionary or concordance; it is intelligent and you know what you are doing. The business of the minister is to *be* what he teaches, so that the saints might see what is meant; it was so with Christ, and with Paul, and in measure is so with us today. The Lord says, I am "altogether that which I also say to you" (@John 8:25). He had in mind that they should partake of what was available in Him. His disciples follow Him, and rub the corn in their hands and that would be food for their bodies; but it is spiritual food for us, and it is for those who minister to show the way.
This brought out opposition, and if there are those who are stirred up by what I am saying, you are sure to find opposition. It may be from your family, or neighbours or work-fellows, but you will find opposition.
The next thing is, the Lord defines the position. The complaint is about the disciples; that is how the matter stands today; people profess to revere the Lord, but the attack is upon those who follow His example. These people are not following in the way of accepted religion, they say. It is a way of liberty; whatever opposition you encounter in the way, do not give up; Christ has set us free. The Lord defined the position, dealing with the situation by the
{78}
Scriptures. Many recognise the Scriptures today, hence the value of the weapon we have to use.
One loves to think of the Lord speaking of the great servant in this way. David was young, and fleeing from the murderous enmity of Saul, and the Lord says, "He entered into the house of God". Men say, Unless you are a priest you have no status; David was not a priest officially, but he was more priestly than Ahimelech! There are those today, moving about in their daily occupations, that are priests because they have the Spirit. David knew how to use the ephod; it belonged to the priests, and he knew how to use it; God honoured him and answered him. He goes to Ahimelech and enters into the house of God. People say, Who are you? We know who we are; we are part of the house of God. David entered into it. One would commend that to you.
How heaven looked down on that young man, fleeing from the enmity of Saul, and entering into the house of God! All he had was a few loaves, but it was not apart from the place. Ahimelech suffered and God will honour that; but he did not understand David.
That is the need for us: to know what is under our hand. We hear of meetings very small and isolated; the persons who visit them are few; there is no gift, but the point that David makes is, What have you got here? Look round and see what you have got. That is the priest. The liberty the Lord is seeking to lead His people into is seen in this, in the type. The Lord says this is only for the priests; but David explained what Ahimelech did not understand, that it is in measure common.
Then David says, Have you got a sword? In a small meeting some have no idea of conflict. The best sword there was was there, but Ahimelech was doing nothing with it. That is how it stands in the smaller gatherings, and sometimes in the larger ones;
{79}
it is a question of conflict. You may depend the enemy will not leave you alone if you are going on with God. Ahimelech says, The sword here is the sword you took from Goliath. The Edomite was there. Why did not Ahimelech use the sword there upon the brother who had come in to spy out the liberty? Why not use the sword against that Edomite? Ahimelech did not understand that there was an enemy right there in Doeg, a false brother who crept in unawares. Ahimelech had liberty to give David the loaves, but the liberty was not protected, he exposed the fact to Doeg. The best sword was there, wrapped behind the ephod; it would look as though the ephod and sword were not being used, and that is what it is.
You can picture to yourselves what a scene it was in @Matthew 12, the Lord defending the liberty of His disciples, the liberty He had brought in. The Lord was using the sword of Goliath, and thus put the enemies to silence; He then proceeds to say, "The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath". Condemnation of the guiltless marks our times, and it is because people do not understand the Scriptures. The Lord rises to the great height of the Son of man being Lord of the sabbath.
Now I want to say a word about the passage in @Revelation 21. I conceive the chapter to set out liberty in the greatest way. Revelation sets out great concrete, spiritual things, and the greatest of these is the assembly; we should keep our eye upon that. The Spirit of God does not forget what it has been, but dwells upon what it shall be; the latter glory is to be greater than the former. The greatest expression of liberty is there. I am not alluding to the Lord, but to what it is in believers.
One of the angels that had had the last plagues, one who had had to do with the false church, Babylon, takes John to see the wonderful vessel of liberty and
{80}
glory. I am speaking from the standpoint of liberty: "And he carried me away in the Spirit, and set me on a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God". The word, "from God" I would allude to in passing. John the baptist is said to be "a man sent from God"; it is not that he was called from a distance into the royal presence to receive a commission, and then to be sent forth; the idea is, he is sent as being *with* God. To be with God, and come from God, is not to be learnt when we go to heaven; the education of the assembly is now, we learn how to get with God now. This education enters into the spirit we have received, the spirit of adoption. What a difference from the spirit of Rome! "Ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear" (@Romans 8:15) -- the current spirit of Rome, but "a spirit of adoption", and christians characteristically cry, "Abba, Father".
I would especially urge young brothers and sisters to get to God, to have your soul flooded with the sense of the presence of God. I am speaking now of going in to God, and of coming out from Him, out of heaven. By that I mean practically, that one learns to turn to one's closet. One said, "Teach us to pray", (@Luke 11:1), and the Lord did it. Now, says the Lord, "enter into thy closet, and ... pray to thy Father which is in secret". That is the surest way to get the knowledge of the holiest; it is as you enter into your closet and speak to the Father in secret, that your soul becomes flooded with the sense of what Christ is before God. He is the One that is delightful to God, and the One who has done all His will. To see Him thus produces restfulness, and one comes out to shine like Moses. Moses¬ face shone with what is inside with God. That is what is in the mind in this allusion to the bride, the Lamb's wife "coming down out of the heaven from God". She had been with
{81}
God; she had been placed in heaven, but that she was *with God* is the point. What would heaven be without God? What would it be without Christ, or the Spirit, or the saints? The saints are essential to heaven.
Moses was shown the land with the people in it; he was shown where Dan was, and where Judah was; that is a wonderful sight! I am speaking of what it is to be with God; we are being fitted now to be with God. It is said indeed, of this wonderful vessel, the city, that "the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof".
Access is open for the christian to God, hence we come down out of heaven, from God. The assembly belongs to heaven as Christ does. The Father is of heaven, the Son is of heaven, the Spirit is of heaven, and the assembly also; it is our native place. We come down "out of heaven", not *sent* as Jesus was; she is seen coming down out of heaven "having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious", and she has "a wall great and high". In the holy liberty in which we are set now, as then, there is protection against evil; there are those who would break down the wall, but it is essential to the glorious liberty in which we are set. It has its counterpart now, in the maintenance of the fellowship in which we are set, and which secures the liberty which the enemy would spy out and destroy. The enemy is apt to creep in unawares; there is constant need of watchfulness so that the liberty should not be destroyed.
That is all I have to say, and I think you will see the applicability of it at this juncture, that we should stand fast in the liberty that Christ has secured, and in which He has set us free.
{82}
PERSONALITY
@Luke 5:12 - 14; @Luke 1:80; @1 Samuel 14:6 - 15
I have in view, dear brethren, to speak of personality as entering into the testimony as that which opens up to us opportunities of testimony; firstly, in the young believer -- personality as it shows itself in the believer at the outset, as the effect of the work of the Lord in him, answering his needs as accruing from the working of sin in him; secondly, personality as in the servant of Christ or of God, the servant viewed as in John the baptist; and thirdly, personality in conflict.
Under these three heads I propose to speak of personality as the result of the work of God in believers. Personality must, as with all else, be understood first in Christ; and as in Him, we see how the unregenerate mind is unable to take account of or rightly estimate the personality in man that is according to the mind of God. "When we shall see him", say the unregenerate Jews, "there is no beauty that we should desire him" (@Isaiah 53:2). In their view He was without form or lordliness such as the natural mind would esteem; whereas in the esteem of those who become subjects of the work of God amongst the Jews, he was regarded as "the chiefest among ten thousand" and "altogether lovely" (@Song of Songs 5:10,16). Such is the immeasurable difference between the estimate of personality according to God in the unregenerate, and in those who are the subjects of His gracious work by the Spirit.
David of old typifies Christ in this respect, above all others, and is especially presented to us according to his personality, including his appearance, not only in his moral traits, but physically. Over against him were such as Saul, a man of appearance according to
{83}
the flesh. He hid himself indeed, during the process of determination of the king which he was to be; Jehovah graciously performing this service for his people, and directing them to find him among the stuff. That is a very humiliating place to be found -- among the baggage! As found, he was an imposing man, but very much of Philistine character; head and shoulders above his brethren, a big man. So with the Philistines, they are those marked by this feature; whether it be physical or educational, the character of bigness was accorded current value then, as now.
Over against such personality we have David, of whom it is said he was a man that could play well, a valiant man, a man of war, and, according to the statement of the Spirit of God, a man with a ruddy countenance and a beautiful appearance. All this is noted over against Eliab, Saul and others, and as we have this description of his personal beauty and attractiveness, we have his name given; that is, his name covers all this. When the name David is given for the first time, it is said, "The Spirit of the Lord came upon David" -- meaning Beloved -- (@1 Samuel 16:13) that was his name; known already, even in obscurity, to heaven, and loved as worthy of love. That has always to be borne in mind; we are to be lovable if we are expecting to be loved. God, indeed, may love us otherwise, being God, but if we expect to be loved it is necessary that we shall be lovable; that is "David" as a name signifies the thought.
This thought, so presented, in such a distinct manner and with such detail by the Spirit, in David as a type of Christ in this respect as in others, is to begin with the believer as he comes in for the benefits of the work of Christ; as he becomes the subject of the touch, the identifying service of Christ; for that is the way we have to view this passage in @Luke 5; He identifies Himself with us in touching us. If He
{84}
identifies Himself with us to relieve us from the result of sin, it is that the hideous results of sin should be replaced by His own beautiful traits. It is most logical that it should be so. That we should come into relief of conscience, and retain the ugly traits of sin, taking on the ways of the world's fashion, is a poor answer to the touch of Christ, for His touch implies that He has had to enter into the depths of death and judgment that we might be relieved of these awful features of sin. What can be more abhorrent in that sense than leprosy? The man was full of it. The Lord touches him, saying, "Go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing as Moses ordained, for a testimony to them", not to the priest alone, but to the whole system. You see, therefore, dear brethren, this passage brings the idea of personality and testimony within the range of every believer, old or young; that at least he has *himself* to present as testimony. 'Yes', you may say, 'but what about Christ?' That is true if I am speaking, but the Lord did not send him to speak, He told him to *show himself*. Let that have its own significance, to the priest and to his class; here is a changed person, hitherto leprous, full of it, in a certain town -- now he is cleansed.
Let us suppose the priest knew him before, what a change now! How is it, dear young people, in this respect with you? You got light in your soul a few nights ago through the preaching, relief to the soul, joy came into your soul; but perhaps only momentarily and you have lapsed back a bit into your old ways, retaining your old appearance in dress, or your old manners in the office, or on the street, among your acquaintance. Where is the testimony? I am not speaking of what you say, but what you are -- a cleansed leper by profession, but with no appreciable change in your manner and, I may add, in your associations. The Lord would lay it upon your now,
{85}
that you are to be a witness because of what you are personally; that is to say, *you* are changed. Your old tastes do not remain in you. Moab had "not been emptied from vessel to vessel" and his natural taste remained (@Jeremiah 48:11); as professedly believing in Christ you may be sure you will be emptied from vessel to vessel. God has determined to change you. The change is from within, but it is not a mere automatic change, your intelligence is brought in. You have begun to reckon that these things are not in keeping with the light that is in your soul; thus we are all sent in testimony as evidence of the change in us.
Romans contemplates that the young believer gets a mind, and that that mind becomes dominant in him; he says, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law" (chapter 7:25) -- that is how the change comes about. It is intelligent, so that we present our bodies "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service" (chapter 12:1). If I present my body to God, it concludes that life, and I can turn round and present it before men, so that the word immediately is, "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (chapter 12:2). He says, "with the mind I myself serve the law of God"; the Holy Spirit enables me to retain that throughout my history here, and my personality according to God increases. You have in the last chapter of Romans a wonderful picture of men and women who had personality, as if the Spirit of God would give us examples. He begins with the sisters; there are many sisters in the list. They resided in Rome, the capital of the world, and they had the advantage of a testimony there; some were of Caesar's household, such is God's way.
"Shew thyself to the priest", says the Lord, "for a testimony to them". Every step of the movement
{86}
of that leper as he moved towards the priest was delightful to heaven; he was not like the ten sent uncleansed to the priest in chapter 17, that is another matter. This one was sent cleansed to the priest, and heaven saw moral beauty and personality developing in the cleansed leper; he might retain the marks of his degradation, but this would only betoken what a work was done in him. Simon, the leper, entertained Christ; the ten were sent uncleansed; the point in them was obedience, not the touch of Christ. The first, I apprehend, refers to the Lord's coming here in incarnation; He could only touch us thus as He went into death for us, but in sending ten uncleansed lepers to the priest, it was a matter of authority, a question of service on high inaugurating the dispensation of faith. In *going* they were cleansed; and one returns to the Lord Jesus and falls down, and gives glory to God; he became a worshipper; he had no word for that, but he came at once into the liberty of faith, and became possessed of instincts, and knew that the One who commanded him to go, was God Himself. In either case you see personality, in the one, a cleansed leper under the eye of the priest, and in the other, cleansed as he obeyed. Instead of going to the priest he instantly came back to his Cleanser -- to One who has authority to command. He worshipped. In either case you see those who come in for the relief that His work brings. Where they had dishonoured God, there is a new personality; "newness of life" shows itself in them.
I go on now to John. It is a question with John the baptist of his showing to Israel, not to the priest. His father was a priest, and had just been uttering most priestly words, but in these words he speaks of Christ, and not of John. Then he comes to John, and addresses him as "Child", as if the voice of *God* through the priest, addresses the young
{87}
potential servant -- for that is what John was then -- as "Child". Such terms are fitting for a Levite, for they were such potentially from one month old, but this particular one is so addressed, the only one addressed thus. Samuel comes close, as placed in the house of God. It may be the Lord has a voice to some potential servant here; you are but a child spiritually as yet. It is one thing to accept the levitical number from one month old; eight thousand were held for service, and much is said of them in the book of Numbers up to the end of chapter 4; then we get chapters 5, 6 and 7, ending with the wealth of the princely offerings, and then the divine speaking; and then the Levites are presented in chapter 8. Now, think of yourself, young brother, as a potential servant, for you cannot waive that privilege or obligation: it rests upon you. "*Thou*, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest"; it rests upon you.
In @Numbers 8 they are presented to Jehovah, and then are given to Aaron and his sons for service; such is the outlook of the young Levite.
So they are presented to God, and God says virtually, I will increase them. They are so lovely in My eyes I will increase their number; not the number from a month old, but from thirty years old. They are lovely, fully developed Levites, and He reduced the age limit to twenty-five (verse 24); that is to say, there would be an increase of Levites by one-sixth. God loves the Levites as presented according to His own mind, acting here in bearing burdens, taking on service, but with personality underlying it all. There is not a family in the universe like them! They are all first-born ones: as it says of the assembly, the "assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven" (@Hebrews 12:23).
Is it not attractive? I think it is. It should be to every one of us. You are to go before the face of the
{88}
Lord to make His way straight; think of the dignity of that!
The verse in @Luke 1 says, "he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel". How am I going to appear to Israel? Not to the Jews -- Israel is a spiritually dignified term, for the saints viewed as the Israel of God have beauty and dignity. The word means 'Prince'; they belong to the nobility, and if you are shown to them they will discern facts. I am not against education, but as to the matter of ministry it has no place; God goes out of His way to show He does not need it. I am not here to decry anything necessary in the service of God, but I am speaking of the spiritual eye of Israel, how critical that is.
We have been dwelling upon John the baptist, and I need not go further than to say it is a question of personality as in the saints viewed spiritually. There is no hope of escape, and moral defects will all be detected, and you cannot hide them. We must make up our minds for this time of our showing to Israel -- how are we to be acceptable? Where are we to get our training? In the deserts. The use of the plural, I suppose, would mean it is more rigorous, the desert characteristically increases; the educational grades are more rigorous as we go on. I have to apply myself to the teaching and there is nothing for the flesh there. There are those who wear horsehair next the skin and do damage to themselves; but that is not the thought. These are deserts; there are many deserts in Scripture, and I believe they provide the school for the levite; the sowing is all to the Spirit, and the reaping is life everlasting, showing that personality is marked by life. It is there; it is a wilderness personality, developed in the refusal of the flesh.
Finally, now I speak of conflict. This section from which I have read in 1 Samuel gives you a sorry picture of the state of things under Saul. He began
{89}
fairly well; the Spirit of God came upon him; but this section contemplates him as rejected. God has already begun with another man, and Saul is left to do the best he can in the flesh, and the best he can do is most miserable. Jonathan here represents the work of God. That is where the levite shines; he works with God. I rise to that level, as the apostle John says, "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son" (@1 John 1:3). They were on that level in their service. Jonathan wrought with God, and men of initiative do this in a dark day. Apostasy was never more rampant than today; nation after nation is taking on an apostate role, but in the dark day there are levites of God, military men, and they are working with God in secret; they have initiative. Jonathan takes on his armour-bearer only recognising the principle that "two are better than one". That is the position of the military man today, the point is to work with God. With God you get the initiative; there is power to move in leadership whatever there is to be done; and the proposal of Jonathan is that under certain circumstances we will show ourselves to the Philistines. Hidden for the moment, he resolved to retrieve the position; he resolved in faith with God, that He can deliver, that nothing is impossible: let us show ourselves to them. What are we in the eyes of these big men? David was a stripling in the eyes of Goliath; the Philistine has no eye for that beauty. Jonathan says, "We will shew ourselves to them. If they say thus to us ... Come up to us, then we will go up; for Jehovah has given them into our hand". I am not speaking of faith, though it is wonderfully present here, but of the showing. Two are better than one in this respect, as in others; they shall have reward for their labour, we need not be afraid to take on another in the holy work of God. The true levitical instinct is for victory that God gives in faith. "We will shew ourselves";
{90}
and they did. The Philistines said, "Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing"; they have the whip hand, as, of course, they have in their own estimation! These men around us are all this kind; they all say, 'We will show you a thing'. What can they show us? They can show us nothing to any advantage, but it was a sign, I believe, a boast with the Philistines, that they could show things, but a sign to Jonathan of their destruction. Whatever the combination, victory belongs to faith, and Jonathan in the humble way, went up on hands and feet. Think of these great men accepting such a humble mode of attack; but it is the successful one.
Jonathan is the leader, and the armour-bearer follows, as with Gideon and his three hundred men. Personality is seen in this leadership, and Jonathan and his armour-bearer slew twenty men in half an acre of land. Think how God acted as these men show themselves, encouraged by the sign God gave, so that the victory was complete.
I think you will see what I mean. I think every christian here will see the need for personality, according to Christ, in all this. The position is, that the testimony will go on, and the end in victory is sure.
{91}
KNOWLEDGE
@John 6:67 - 69; @Hosea 6:3; @Zechariah 11:11
I have in mind to speak about knowledge, as in the expression "the knowledge of the Holy", involving spiritual knowledge -- a very wide and great subject. I shall endeavour to be concise, for in no sense could anyone be exhaustive, in fact, no one should attempt to be exhaustive in addressing the people of God as to Christ and His things. We can only know in part, and understand and speak in part, for speaker and hearers are necessarily limited; and the Lord graciously presents the truth to us in part, or in parts, taking account of our limitations, and specially as to our capacity for retention. Take, for instance, the garments of the high priest; in the types they are brought before us in parts, necessarily so, one garment covering him altogether, as you might say -- the cloak; for personal beauty and line and grace are not what are prominent in service, but efficiency. There is, therefore, a great covering garment, which could not have been on the Beloved One who is described in the Song of Songs -- for the spouse speaks of him in part according to his personal figure, graces, members: that is a question of love, of reciprocated love. But in service that is not the prominent thought, but efficiency. The garments of the high priest are given separately and are severally described, so that we may take them in severally and, according to our measure, piece them together and see them all in order upon him. I mention that, dear brethren, to illustrate what I have in mind before I proceed. There is no question of presenting anything exhaustive, but what may serve in part that we may learn; for each of these meetings is intended thus, that we should learn one thing at a time -- we are scarcely
{92}
able for more; not that each one may not get some feature for himself, but generally that is the intent in these meetings.
So I take up Peter to illustrate how knowledge is acquired, "the knowledge of the holy", as I may say, for that is what he had in mind in his answer to the Lord's enquiry. He places faith before knowledge, for the knowledge of God and of Christ and of the things of God and of Christ, heavenly things, can only be taken in or possessed by *believers*. The natural intellect may go some way, but the natural mind never has a right thought on the things of God. I doubt very much whether any creed gives the right thought of any doctrine, the right spiritual intent in it; all must be on the principle of faith, and in truth faith is what is *impossible* to the natural man. Faith has not to do with what is visible, the bearing of it is upon what is invisible, and that is necessarily outside the range of the natural mind. So Peter here is one of "the twelve", he appears as representative of the twelve whom the Lord had chosen: He says, "Have not I chosen you the twelve?" -- he is representative of them in this particular setting. And in his answer to the Lord's enquiry, "Will ye also go away?", he indicates plainly for us the way of knowledge. So we should pay strict attention to the words, which indeed the Authorised Version does not give correctly, but in the New Translation it reads, "We have believed and known" -- that is spiritual history which ought to set every believer in motion as it is presented to him. It is well to be directed back to your spiritual history; we are very fond of reverting to our birthdays and to anything that gives us distinction since those days -- the camera helps in that way, as well as the autograph album -- but it is well to take a retrospective view of one's whole spiritual history. A believer is an entity, he is a known entity in heaven -- a very great fact -- he is in the 'Who's
{93}
Who' book there certainly. Much perhaps is known there that even he has now forgotten. It is a great comfort, in one way, that things are not forgotten, that nothing is omitted there. I believe the histories of God's people are a perfect delight to God, as He is able to view them abstractly -- to view them apart from what may be discreditable; not that He omits that either, a solemn matter! -- but God takes account of His own abstractly, that is leaving out, as He alone can, what is not to be included finally. God can afford to do that, speaking reverently, and indeed, I can afford to do it as to myself too. It is a poor thing to pursue a line and keep adding to what must be left out finally -- yet, alas, one can do that. John's first epistle is intended to teach us how to think abstractly; how to reckon with God according to His work in us, how to understand that, as Christ is, "*we* also are in this world" (chapter 4:17) and that "every one begotten of God does not sin", that he "keeps himself and the wicked one does not touch him" (chapter 5:18). That is a part of our education, beloved friends, that is perhaps little understood, but it is a very great part; that one is entitled, and indeed required, to take a view of one's spiritual history, to go over it: that is what the wilderness, in one sense, is intended to teach us -- the wilderness in the book of Numbers. It is after they reach what we speak of as the springing well, a well that sprang up after it was digged. Digging is a process that is not seen at the beginning, it is a habit you acquire, meaning the removing of what hinders the springing up of the Spirit. There is something within that is wonderful -- let it come up, give it vent! You acquire the habit of removing what hinders, and what follows on that is movement. After the digging here, they moved on, as you will remember, until they got to Pisgah, which, as we are told, "looks over the surface of the waste" (@Numbers 21:20); that is, it is a sort of retrospective view of
{94}
the wilderness -- as to what God has been to them in it. You may take account of all that history as to what God has been to you, and what you have been to God. How Caleb would have loved to do that! Caleb and Joshua came out of Egypt, and entered into Canaan, they represent the spiritual element in the christian that goes right through. Take Joshua -- how he would revert to his companionship with Moses on the mount, and what hundreds of things he would recall! And so Caleb -- on the confines of the land -- looks back some forty or forty-five years and tells Joshua what he was then; he did not forget. That was history, spiritual history. And, having reviewed it and put it in its order in the present -- what a present! -- what does faith say? "What hath God wrought!" (@Numbers 23:23) -- that is what faith says; not what I have done; I have to put my hand upon my mouth in regard to that, and cover it; I may have much to be ashamed of, but "What hath God wrought!". In spite of what I have done, in spite of what I have been, He carries on His work. A study of the book of Deuteronomy will fill your soul with this line of things. The blessing of Moses the man of God is not anticipative, it is retrospective; the things he speaks of in the tribes were in some sense practical, that is, they denote what God has wrought, and that leads to praise. "At this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!". Heaven knows all that; God is eternally occupied, every day, and every hour, and every minute, with His own work; far transcending the interest He had in the great physical system is His delight in the work He is carrying on moment by moment in myriads of persons, with the great result to bring into view, what *He* has wrought!
Well now, I think Peter gives us the clue to this; he says, "We have believed and known". What have they believed? and what have they known? That
{95}
the One who was despised amongst them and had been rejected of men was the Christ. You may say, 'No wonder Peter knew that, for the Father told him'; but that is not the point here, the point here is past spiritual history. "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God"! -- that was what they had come to. That is to say, it is a question of faith *first*, faith in the Lord Jesus as to *who* He was; not yet, what He could do; faith in His saving work will come in later; the point here is who He was. How can I start out in the field of knowledge save as I get to the Centre of it, to the Source of it, to the Sustainer of it? And that is Christ -- who He is -- "the holy one of God". Beginning with Him, there is no end really to the knowledge -- it ever widens and deepens. "Thou art the holy one of God", Peter says, "we have believed and known" it. I would again suggest, dear brethren, the importance of looking back in this sense, and seeing how you have begun, and whether you have been building up on a right foundation in regard to the knowledge you have acquired.
Well now, the Old Testament ever supports what we get in the New, and in the book of Hosea we have, "We shall know"; this is, as I may say, the spirit of prophecy; but it is also the spirit of the remnant, and it is a great matter to come into possession of the spirit of the remnant. There is, in the Old Testament, the Spirit of Christ, the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of the remnant. The spirit of the remnant is a humble, broken spirit, with nothing vaunting about it, for they are just a remnant, marked by tears as to what had been, joy as to what will be, and present comfort in what *is*, for God never forsakes His people: the spirit of the remnant marks what has been, and what will be, and what is. That is, there is enough to sustain faith in the darkest period of the history of God's people. The prophets
{96}
are of immense importance in that way, the spirit of Christ in them is full of victory, of battling with every possible difficulty and overcoming it; that is the spirit of Christ. It was remarkably portrayed in the passage in Zechariah, a most vigorous chapter on the part of the Spirit of Christ, even as to the destruction of the shepherds, that the poor of the flock might be saved. So in @Hosea 6, the remnant speak of revival, of being raised up: "the third day he will raise us up", a beautiful understanding of the principle of resurrection. "On the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before his face" (verse 2). What confidence! what victory indeed, there is in that! And so it goes on, "And we shall know" -- one would love to see the young brothers and sisters moving in this way -- they are, I believe, but there is a great lack of energy in following things up: the Spirit of God is active constantly in bringing things out for us, bringing things to our attention. The apostle says to Timothy, "*Thou*  hast been thoroughly acquainted" or, as it may read 'hast fully followed up'. It is rarely that one meets with a young brother who fully follows up the thread of the testimony, that which God is continuously and constantly presenting by one and another. We cannot afford to miss any of it. "*Thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted", says the apostle, "with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance, persecutions, sufferings" (@2 Timothy 3:10). I believe Timothy would read every letter that he heard Paul had written; I believe that he would seek to hear every address that Paul gave, every word that he spoke. That was the attitude of Timothy, and it is the attitude that is proper to our time; it is urgent that nothing should be omitted that the Lord gives. So here, "We shall know", that is the statement, there is no doubt about it -- then "we shall know" -- why should not *I*  know if others do? Why should I be ignorant if others
{97}
know? I know of no reason why any one of us here should not know; it is a question of diligence. Here the spirit of the remnant says, "We shall know", but it does not stop there -- "We shall follow on to know" -- that is resolve. Resolution is a great matter in the things of God, as in all else -- "we shall follow on to know". And then it adds for encouragement -- the spirit of the remnant says, "His going forth is assured as the morning dawn; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain which watereth the earth". That is the expectation, dear brethren. How beautiful and exhilarating is the thought! Think of the Lord Jesus, for instance, as He rose from the dead, His going forth, what that meant -- it was truly the dawn of morning. Did one have the opportunity of watching with intelligence the movements of Christ, His going forth, how exhilarating and refreshing it would be! how full of hope is His going forth! And then His coming "as the rain"; how the Lord comes in on His people refreshing us, as He does! Many of us know it. These things are set together as incentives to us in following on. Let us not be weary, beloved, in following up the things the Lord gives. There is no thought of His relaxing in this respect, the ministry will go on. I see the Lord preparing for it in the many young He is raising up to serve as it is going on, and He is preparing them that it should go on, and it is for us generally to follow it up. "We shall follow on to know Jehovah", and there will be ample recompense for us in His going forth and His coming upon us as a refreshing rain causing fruitfulness to God, and refreshment to ourselves.
Then in chapter 11 of the prophet Zechariah, we have, as I said, great vigour in the Spirit of Christ. This often appears amongst us: occasions arise which call for vigour -- vigorous dealing with what is opposed; and for discrimination too; so that the
{98}
poor of the flock come distinctly into view. That is a great matter, to bring them clearly into view -- the poor of the flock. They are called in this chapter "the flock of slaughter"; that is to say, the saints of God, as faithful in any given time, are viewed thus: they are always exposed, as the apostle said, "We are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter" (@Romans 8:36). But then he adds, "In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us" (verse 37). The poor of the flock are regarded peculiarly in this chapter. Jehovah says, "Feed the flock of slaughter, whose possessors slay them without being held guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah! for I am become rich; and their own shepherds pity them not". How vigorous that is! The servant's business is to feed the flock of slaughter, and the true servant will see that he *does*; he said, "I fed the flock of slaughter, truly the poor of the flock ... And I destroyed three shepherds in one month". How vigorous he was; and in times like these vigour is required, in facing things, but making sure of the flock, the poor of the flock, and providing for them. That is the spirit of the shepherd, providing for the poor of the flock, and, in providing for them, the Lord in spirit says, "The poor of the flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Jehovah". It is a comfort to every servant that he may be assured of this, that if he feeds the poor of the flock, they will, as it says, give heed to him. You may be sure of that. Of course this is speaking of Christ, in the full sense of it, but then all the under-shepherds necessarily take character from Christ, and if I feed the flock, they will wait upon me; it is to their advantage to wait upon him who feeds them, but they do it in love. How the poor of the flock were attached to Christ when He was here! Take those women who followed Him from Galilee -- that was a long way for women
{99}
in those days, there was very little provision, I apprehend, for travel. They followed Him to the cross; they stood by the cross of Jesus; they followed Him to the limit, as I might say. What comfort it would have given to the Lord as He hung there to look upon them! How attached to Him they were! Luke says they "ministered to him" in following Him. They did not look for recompense, nor for their travelling expenses; no, they thought only of Him: they ministered to Him of their substance, they waited upon Him! Did they have any doubt as to Him? None; they "knew", it says, "that it was the word of Jehovah". Is there not a great lesson in that for us all? As fed by the Good Shepherd through the under-shepherds, we wait upon them, we feel how essential they are to us, every one of them, and "the poor of the flock" discern "the word of Jehovah" -- *they* "knew", it says, "that it was the word of Jehovah"; no less than that! Not simply the word of an ordinary rabbi, which term Judas could use -- no, they would say, like Mary Magdalene, "Rabboni", *my* Teacher; or they would say "Lord", like Mary of Bethany; they would sit at His feet. Did Mary of Bethany ever question, think you, what Jesus said? Never; it was to her "the word of Jehovah". And as I am ministered to, I minister, I wait upon those that minister, and I have discernment; I know the word of the Lord when I hear it. "The poor of the flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Jehovah". Let others say what they will, the poor of the flock know; that is an immense thing that there are some anyway, who are fed as the poor of the flock, who know the word of the Lord. The servant can be assured of this, dear brethren, that those that are ministered to, those that are fed, will discern; the poor of the flock will discern the true ministry, they will discern the word of God, that is, the word of Jehovah, as it says here.
{100}
That is all I have in mind, dear brethren. There is much, as I said before, that could be said on this great subject. If one were to go into Ephesians, for instance, with one's little ability, what a field there is! The principle there is just what I have been saying; the apostle says, "Having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you at my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory" -- think of all that, think of what was in his mind -- "would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe" (chapter 1:15 - 19) Who can go over that wonderful field? But it is *for us* and the Holy Spirit would lead us on; if we follow on to know, we shall get into that great Ephesian field of knowledge. How infinitely beyond any field of scientific knowledge, so-called, is the knowledge of God in His great thoughts. And the Holy Spirit in us would give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him!
{101}
LEADERSHIP
@Psalm 107:7; @Psalm 77:20; @Micah 6:4; @Psalm 78:70 - 72
I have in mind to occupy us with leadership, but particularly in view of the end of it, that is the "city of habitation". The reference to it in Scripture helps to give lustre to the subject on the journey to it. God would set before us, especially young christians, an end to be desired, in calling us out of the world. It is said that those of old who were called out might have returned had they been so minded; but they were not so minded, "they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly", so that it is said, "God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city" (@Hebrews 11:16). That thought is never lost sight of in the Scriptures; the Psalms take it up, particularly the last book, a book that has the city in view, a book which contains the songs of degrees, of ascent, as if those who had the city before them are buoyant and not mournful. If they are in Babylon they are mournful, they hang their harps on the willows, refusing to gratify the natural mind with the songs of Zion. The natural mind of man is not to be gratified with these holy songs. The songs of Zion belong to Zion, they only fit there; and this book of the Psalms contemplates that there are those who had been in Babylon, but who are now on their way to Zion. They are on their way to Jerusalem, "a city of habitation".
Hence the significance of the thought in @Psalm 107, reverting back to the early history of God's people, and indeed, the early history of us all; for God does go back to our early days, and would encourage us to go back to them. Sometimes they are humiliating, as they verily are if we look at our own ways, but if we think of God, what He has been to us, they occasion
{102}
encouragement. The book of Deuteronomy, for instance, from the pen of the great mediator, views what their history had been, but after they themselves had received and recognised the Spirit typically they move forward until they reach Pisgah, "which looks over the surface of the waste" (@Numbers 21:20). That is, they would recall what God had *been* to them, and also as it says, what God had *wrought* in them. The work of God is a very great matter with Him. He indicates that He takes it on piece by piece, in the first chapter of Genesis, pronouncing on every day's work. And we may be sure, dear brethren, that it is not written in regard of the physical creation alone, but that He alludes to His work in our souls, going on daily, bit by bit, as we might say. God works thus; He would come down to our way of teaching so as to draw us to Him, that is, to show us what He does, working graciously with us; and so, as we review our history, we say, "What hath God wrought!". It magnifies God in our eyes, and reduces us in ourselves, because we are confident that all is of God, every bit of work is of God, it is *His*. So that in regard of Israel and Jacob, that is, Israel viewed from the spiritual side, and Jacob from the responsible side, viewing them in both ways it is said, "What hath God wrought!". So we get a volume of praise in this last book of Psalms, ever swelling and swelling in the sense of what God is, until we reach the last psalm in which all His works praise Him, and "Let everything that hath breath praise Jah ... !". That is the great end, dear brethren.
Now you can see how the thought of the city of habitation is introduced. The dire necessity of the saints, of His people, is in view in this first Psalm of the book, the 107th -- and there is no one who honestly reviews his own history but will say 'amen' to what is said in this psalm. In dire distress and extremity we cry to the Lord and He comes in in every instance;
{103}
He never fails to come in and lift us out of our trouble when we genuinely cry to Him; and what is in mind is a volume of praise, "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!". It says they wandered in a desert land, I suppose the allusion would be to Israel during their thirty-eight years of wandering. Wandering is not a word that properly belongs to faith; faith is definite, wandering is indefinite. For thirty-eight years or more, they wandered aimlessly, as I might say, and God followed them. Of course He took them out of Egypt, as He says here, but then how much wandering came in, and how much there is amongst the people of God today. Young people think nothing of taking positions for the mere sake of some monetary gain, with no regard for the city of habitation, with no regard for the thoughts of God. @James 4:15 says, "If the Lord should so will and we should live, we will also do this or that". There is dignity in that: "if the Lord ... so will" and then if "we should live", that is another dignified thing. But it is otherwise very often and young people arrive at dire distress in this way. But "God is faithful", in His public ways with us; that is in Corinthians: He is faithful, and He finds us. You will all remember how Hagar fled from Sarah when Sarah oppressed her; but still she was her mistress, and it was the household of faith, whatever Sarah was as a mistress. She fled from Sarah, and the angel of the Lord finds her, that is the faithfulness of God, a very important thing for young people. He finds her, and she had to retrace her steps; it is through her that we first get the thought of a well, for God is very tender with His people, especially the young. However little she regarded it, still it was divine consideration for her, and she returned. She says, "Thou God seest me" (@Genesis 16:13): that is, we get experience in these cases.
{104}
So here it says, "He delivered them out of their distresses, and he led them forth by a right way". Doubtless their experience had brought them to this. God allows us considerable rope in our self-will, but He knows when we have come to the end of it, and we are then amenable to be led. Think of God leading His people! The general principle is that He led them, and then follows, "that they might go". That indeed is the general principle underlying christianity, and the position of God's people here -- I come under control, I am amenable. The working out of it is seen in Romans and Corinthians: we come under divine control. These epistles are governed by the leadership of Christ; the Spirit comes into them, of course, but the leadership of Christ is a leading feature. We are led forth into a right way (it may be there are those here who have not yet come into this way) -- we become accustomed to it. Then it says, "that they might go to a city of habitation", that is, you have a definite end in view, that you might go to a city of habitation, where you find inhabitants who are not lawless. There is no difficulty in finding those who are lawless, nor a lawless city; it is an age of cities. There never has been such an age of cities as the present, but to find a city of habitation according to God, that is a great matter! It may be there are those here who have not found it -- most of us have. "Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together", not a city spreading out into suburbs where the boundaries cannot be determined, but a city compact together. In other words, it is the assembly, those that walk in that light, governed by this principle; living not only individually, as in Romans, but living in relation to others who live, in relation to those who understand city boundaries, who understand what belongs to a city, the city of God. That is the thing, dear brethren, at the present time. "That they might go to a city
{105}
of habitation"; the inhabitants are living. Romans, as I said, is the foundation, a foundational epistle in this respect, and Corinthians works out the thought of a city in its external features; there are the inhabitants. The prophets are full of the thought of inhabitants of Jerusalem. They have a distinctive character. It is for us to accustom ourselves to the thought, because the Spirit of God, in the writings of John in the last days, has opened up to us a wonderful city of habitation. There is the most perfect order; it is where the Lord God and the Lamb are; there is no distance there. How attractive that is! God's wonderful thoughtfulness for us, to open up to us what meets the most excessive desire, for God will satisfy the desire of every living thing; He will open it up for us to receive, that we may go to it. So that Romans and Corinthians help us as to what is foundational and what involves the public order; and the epistles, Colossians, Ephesians and Philippians furnish us with the inhabitants. So that you find love in Colossians, "the love which ye have towards all the saints" (chapter 1:4) -- that is the thought. You want people to love; there is love in a universal way, but love in a particular way too; that is to say, you will be loved. The Lord Jesus would say to you, 'I love you, and gave Myself for you'; you will be singled out; at the same time, 'I love the assembly and gave Myself for it'. It is the realm of love, the inhabitants are formed in love, and formed in intelligence too. This is most attractive for us, "that they might go to a city of habitation". We are to be assured that God goes to the greatest pains to lead us, so that we might "go". He loves to see us going according to intelligence. He says in @Matthew 11:28, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and *I* will give you rest". That is the end of chapter 11; then in the beginning of chapter 12 He went on the sabbath through the corn fields, and His disciples
{106}
with Him, and they took the corn and rubbed it in their hands, and ate it. Now that is a principle we want to notice, going beyond what the Lord did, for that was what He had in mind; it was cutting across current religious sentiment and order. He intends that, and He looks to His own to pursue that way -- there is much beyond. The corn was there, and they took it and ate it, and that was exactly what He wanted; that is what underlies christianity, the way is indicated, and then the saints are to walk in it. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God" (@Romans 8:14). "He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (@John 8:12). I see the working of the Spirit of God in righteousness and life, and I want to have the light of life. The Lord has inaugurated that; what the Holy Spirit is doing here is to maintain that, and I walk in that way, in the light of life. It is a dignity set before us, and we reach the end -- the city; the city is eternal, I get to that. I begin to understand what that is, and to look for it and find it amongst the brethren, "a city of habitation".
Now in the second scripture, @Psalm 77, much is said there about the way of Jehovah in the sanctuary and in the sea, and in the great waters, that which is outside the range of the natural mind. No natural mind can find that way, where the lion's whelps have not trodden; it is for faith. "Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron". That is a very beautiful thought, and very different from what we get in @Psalm 107, where they "wandered ... in a desert way". I can picture to myself Israel straggling through the wilderness all those years, death all around them; it was the very opposite to this living state of things. Not that God was not with them in His mercy and grace through Moses and Aaron, but now He leads them "like a flock".
{107}
The suggestion is not of a straggling lot of sheep exposed to the wolves, but of an ordered state of things, a flock. If one had time to open up the passage in @John 10 we would see the force of it, what the flock is; but all I wish to note now is Moses and Aaron have *one* hand, "the hand of Moses and Aaron". That is, God is doing the work, it is done in sympathy and authority, the authority and sympathy of "the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus" (@Hebrews 3:1). Moses is the man who tells us what to do, and he tells us with authority as supported by the power of God. "Are we stronger than he?", Paul says, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?" (@1 Corinthians 10:22). No, we cannot disregard His authority, maybe He will not let us, but still Aaron is there, suggestive of the vast sympathy of Christ. He can be "touched with the feeling of our infirmities" (@Hebrews 4:15). He will go to any length if it be a question of infirmity, mental or physical or whatever it may be, but in no sense will He allow the will; He has got a way of dealing with that. "Are we stronger than he?", says the apostle. It is by the *hand*, as if it were the one idea of Moses and Aaron, the perfect combination of authority and sympathy. If we look into the epistles, especially Corinthians, we shall see that is exactly the blend. We have the apostle with authority, and the brother Aaron, Aaron is the brother, so they are led like a flock. How important that is, dear brethren, especially for the young ones in local gatherings, to move in that orderly way, not a straggling independent way which exposes us to the enemy, but as held like a flock under the hand, that blessed hand of Jesus -- for that is the suggestion in the hand of Moses and Aaron. They are perfectly combined in Christ who is "the Apostle and High Priest of our confession".
Now what links on very beautifully with that, to my mind, is the reference in @Micah 6:4. Moses was
{108}
sent before the people. "I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam". I want to dwell, dear brethren, on that combination now, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. They are sent before. What I understand is, that these three persons were set up of God and wonderfully disciplined secretly. They are not taken on in service till a considerable age, Moses perhaps eighty years of age, Aaron eighty-three, and Miriam over ninety. That is the combination that is set before us. When God brings them forward and sends them before the people, it is not a question of a public position in front of the camp. That is not the idea. It is what they *were* before; they were there *before*, and they come out into prominence and prominence is needed. It is a question for all time, dear brethren, there are those whom God disciplines secretly, and no one is of any use save as he is in that school. It was an eighty-years matter. God is very particular when it is a question of putting before the saints those who are to be models for them, those sent before. Look at this child Moses; his history from his infancy till he was eighty years is given in the book of Exodus. Then we have forty years more of his life, until he finishes in the most marvellous way in Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy is really the man -- what the man was. The book apparently was written by Moses when he was 119 years old or more; almost at the end of his life he wrote that wonderful book. It is a question of the *man*; that is what enters into what the Spirit of God says here; he was sent before the people. He stands before us, dear brethren, as a model. Then Aaron comes in, as I said, at eighty-three years of age, after his secret history with God. God says of him to Moses, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?". Who is this Aaron the Levite? A man who had great faith in God; God is going to make him honoured before the people, He is going to be sent before His people. All the secret dealings
{109}
of God with him in those years are that he may acquire a title. It is not Aaron a Levite, but Aaron *the* Levite, a word for every one who serves -- he is "thy brother". He is thy brother, you can trust him to do his best for you. That is what every servant ought to be, a brother to the saints. "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?", the Lord said to Moses. And what will he do? He comes to meet you, and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart. That is what every levite is if he is truly a levite, truly a brother, he loves the saints, he lays down his life for them -- that is the principle. Of course, one would have to admit much as to these men, but I am speaking now of what God does for His people, so that they might have a trio like this before their eyes, fruits of the handiwork of God. That is what these three persons became as they are led and developed under the secret hand of God. Now they appear in the full view of Israel, Moses first, then Aaron, then Miriam.
Now this is a word for the sisters. Let us not forget that they also are to be leaders; they are to be led and they are to lead. Sisters lead in the sense of being examples. Nothing can be more important than sisterly example. How important that they should set a right example! The first epistle to Timothy speaks much of sisters; and in Titus, the elder women are to teach the young ones; they are to be before their eyes, yet they are to stand in relation to Moses and Aaron, so to speak; they are not to be independent. Miriam is not mentioned very often in Scripture; there is relatively very little mention of her; it is the fact that she was a sister of these great men that brings her into prominence. One mention of her is in the case of wrongdoing; that is a warning for sisters; she envied Moses and spake against him, a sorrowful matter! But I speak now, of what the Spirit of God has in mind in a trio like Moses, Aaron and Miriam, sent before the brethren,
{110}
before the sisters, "I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam".
Well now, the first mention we get of Miriam by name is in @Exodus 15, and she had influence with the other sisters. One might say much about the prophetesses of Scripture; one has indeed spoken of them; but what is to be said about Miriam shows that she had influence with the other sisters in Israel, they followed her. It says, "Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances" (@Exodus 15:20). A very fine example as representing the sisterly side! And when I say the sisterly side, I have in mind the subjective state of the saints, that which is connected with the interests of the young and of all, what there is for God in that sense. So that you find in a house like that of Philip the evangelist four daughters that prophesied. They are brought in as Paul is journeying to Jerusalem; what an atmosphere would mark that house! It is a question of that kind of thing amongst us, dear brethren, as outstanding, for it is a question of going before. They are there before, as it were; God sent them before. So if a sister prophesies or prays, there is much said about it, and what is said about the order is intended to tax her spirituality. We shall never come to the end of that passage in @1 Corinthians 11, but it is to tax our spirituality, as to whether we are subject, as to whether we are ready to go out of the way in the disregard of natural things; otherwise the spirit of prophecy is beclouded.
Now finally David, in the last scripture, is taken from the sheep-folds, from following the ewes great with young; it is a matter of looking after the young. David is marked by that, he leads them into what is spiritual. That contemplates headship, the kind of thing that God has in mind, that He has provided for them. They are in the city of habitation; that
{111}
is marked by headship. David represents that side. Headship is very little understood, not that I am assuming that there are not those who know it, but it is very little understood by us generally; but that is what David represents. Moses hardly represents it, though he comes very near to it in Deuteronomy, for Israel is to go to the city of habitation, but it took hundreds of years for them to reach that city, and it is David who secures the city for them. It is he that had the thought of it and secured it; he took the head of Goliath to Jerusalem; he went there himself, and took the stronghold of Zion. That is to say, it is typically Christ laying hold of the hearts of the saints, of their intelligence -- that is the idea. And "David ... called it the city of David", a very great thought. We belong to the city of God, but then it is the heavenly side that we are called to, where the inhabitants are heavenly, not only risen with Christ, great thought as that is, for christianity is not merely based on the resurrection of Christ, but on Christ in heaven. Hence He is the pattern of the heavenly saints, "such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones" (@1 Corinthians 15:48). How great a thought that is: the inhabitants are heavenly! Hence we are not only raised up with Christ, as @Colossians 2:12 says, "raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", it is a question of faith there, but in @Ephesians 2:6 the point is, He "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies". I love the saints, that is the idea: I would not be there without them. The Spirit of God so works in me, the saints become so much to me, that I would not be there without them! So we are raised up *together*, and made to sit down *together* "in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". How great that thought is! Well, that is the idea of the city of habitation, and David is the head. It says that "he fed them according to the integrity of his
{112}
heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands": he is a type of Christ. As the apostle says, "To know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God" (@Ephesians 3:19). That is what is in mind. That is what God is working for, to lead us in on those lines to a city of habitation, where the inhabitants are all heavenly. What associations, what neighbours, what persons to associate with! There is only one street mentioned in the heavenly city, showing that we are all of the same kind; there is no West-end, so to speak, nor East-end in that city! No streets for the rich and streets for the poor; no, we are all there in the dignity of firstborn ones, "the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven" (@Hebrews 12:23). The word is plural, it means we are all firstborn, alluding to the Levites, so that we are inhabitants all equal in dignity and nearness to God and to Christ. We are to become accustomed to all this now in our associations; it is not to be new to us. We are brought to the assembly, to the saints viewed as heavenly; that is the companionship that God opens up to us. So that David "fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands". It is all a question of headship.
{113}
SPEAKING
@Luke 4:21,22; @Luke 7:14,15; @Luke 11:14; @Acts 14:1,8 - 10,23
J.T. The thought is that these scriptures may show the bearing of speaking on assembly conditions and formation. Luke particularly has in mind that there should be speaking, such as he calls attention to in the Lord. It is remarked that the Lord in Nazareth "began to say to them, To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. And all bore witness to him, and wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth". Luke mentions the effect of the Lord's words on His hearers, and the apostle Paul's words evidently corresponded: "they ... so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed". Then, the lame man "heard Paul speaking". Attention is called to that, not so much to what he said, but his speaking. Then, in the incident of the young man who was raised up, it says that he "began to speak".
J.J. Is it that the manner of the speaking would involve being in a certain spiritual state, that there is some spiritual state behind it?
J.T. Yes. As we come into the world and learn to use our vocal powers, they are apt to become damaged by the thoughts that are expressed through them. The words coming out of the Lord's mouth would indicate the perfect use of human vocal powers. Romans shows that human vocal powers are used ordinarily to express what would damage them -- the throat, the lips, the tongue. But Luke calls attention to perfect human speaking.
P.L. "The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the instructed, that I should know how to succour by a word him that is weary" (@Isaiah 50:4).
J.T. That illustrates what I was thinking.
{114}
Rem. Scripture refers to the words of Samuel, that none of them fell to the ground (@1 Samuel 3:19).
J.T. The gospel of Luke opens with the prohibition of speaking in a certain one because he was unbelieving, as if to indicate that speaking should be in faith, and only in faith: "I believed, therefore have I spoken" (@Psalm 116:10).
P.L. So that "As apples of gold in pictures of silver, is a word spoken in season" (@Proverbs 25:11).
J.T. I suppose the young man in Nain might be taken to represent youth generally in worldly environments. He sat up and began to speak, but how differently he would speak now. He made a beginning. The Lord began, it says in chapter 4. Then, in chapter 11 which deals with assembly furnishings, we have a man who had a dumb demon, and the Lord cast the demon out, and "the demon being gone out, the dumb man spoke".
J.J. Do you think the speaking should be according to the light of the moment?
J.T. Well, I was thinking first of all of the organs, whether we can frame to speak.
J.J. In connection with Zacharias there was light given for the moment, but he did not take it in, and therefore could not speak. Would that have any bearing on it?
J.T. Yes, he was prohibited from speaking, rendered dumb for a season, in that he was not in faith. But what one would like to see made clear is the formation for speaking in the assembly, so that the young may learn to frame, as it says in Judges, to speak and to pronounce spiritually.
Rem. It is not a matter of the number of words you speak, because we read of five words in the assembly.
J.T. The point is to begin. The brethren will soon take notice if one begins according to the Model, for Luke gives us the Model in the Lord.
{115}
J.H.M. It says too, "For of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (@Matthew 12:34). That is where the origin of things is, and if there is abundance there will be speaking.
Ques. What had you in mind in specifying the organs -- the throat, the lips and the tongue?
J.T. The powers that God has given in vocal operations, because I believe in the young they are deformed by use in the conveyance of wrong thoughts, thoughts that were never intended to pass through them at all.
Ques. Has the mind in that way to do with the speaking -- the thoughts of the mind?
J.T. The mind is the dominant thought in the man. Romans and Corinthians both bring out that the mind is the dominant faculty. There is the individual: "*I myself*"; that is, one arrives at consciousness in responsibility to God in Romans, and says, "*I myself*", and then he says, "with the mind serve God's law" (chapter 7:25). The mind is dominant. In @1 Corinthians 2:16 "*we* have the mind of Christ" is the same idea, the thinking faculty which is to dominate. Well, if that be renewed and it be the mind of Christ, then the thoughts are formed and conveyed through the organs according to God.
Ques. Would @Isaiah 6 show the order, first the cleansing of the lips and then the anointing?
J.T. That is good; the thinking is applied through the lips.
Ques. What you said reminded me of Mordecai; he sought the welfare of his people, and spoke peace to all his seed (@Esther 10:3). Is that a fitting end for a saint?
J.T. Just so. We get the thought in Romans that a believer comes into self-consciousness in relation with God. We may be self-conscious otherwise, but where there is self-consciousness in relation with God,
{116}
as morally under obligation to God, the mind becomes the great dominant faculty in the believer, and so in 1 Corinthians, "*we* have the mind of Christ". There may be the tongue of angels, that is, great powers of oratory, without love, whereas, over against that, there are five words with the understanding or intelligence. Those are the words that count.
C.S.S. "The sweet psalmist of Israel saith, The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, and his word was on my tongue" (@2 Samuel 23:1,2). Would that be the result of discerning and seeking after? He says, "One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after" (@Psalm 27:4).
J.T. That would show the tongue was available. The young can come to see the need for framing to speak properly, I mean in a spiritual sense, because we are so taken up with things and convey things that are of no moral value at all, that were never intended to pass through human vocal organs. The Lord standing up in the synagogue at Nazareth conveyed the divine thought in speaking; they "wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth". And the young man in Nain who had died, sitting up and beginning to speak, is a suggestion of how young people begin to speak.
Rem. The ministry of James comes in on the practical line suggesting that having begun, the mouth should be a fountain of perpetual sweetness.
J.T. How is he to continue? Just so.
P.L. Then the perfect man weighs his words in James. It all passes the balances of the sanctuary before it is put into circulation, so that it is not base coin but on the gold standard, so to speak. You want to put into currency what will have general circulation in Zion.
J.T. Romans would develop the sense that one has to be made over again, as it were, as to the use of his members and organs; and, as soon as one
{117}
comes into self-consciousness with God, the obligation comes in, how I am going to use my tongue, my throat and my lips. The mind is to be conveyed through those organs, the renewed mind, and as in Corinthians, the mind of Christ in the christian.
J.J. Do you think Luke would help especially to bring these conditions to pass?
J.T. That is what he has in mind. He is the one that brings in the priest, and the priest's lips should keep knowledge. Of course, you might say the knowledge should be kept inwardly, which is true, that you keep your knowledge -- "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted" (@2 Timothy 1:14) but the lips keep the knowledge, showing it is the means of conveyance that is in mind, that in which it is kept to be conveyed. It is not merely for myself, but kept to be conveyed. That is what Luke has in mind. Zacharias was listening to the most wonderful things about himself and his wife, but he was unbelieving, and the angel said, You will be dumb until it comes to pass; there is no use in giving you that knowledge; you cannot convey it; it is not in faith in you; "I believed, therefore have I spoken"; you do not believe, and therefore you are disqualified.
P.L. Do we get the thought in "The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright" (@Proverbs 15:2), and "The lips of the wise disperse knowledge" (verse 7)?
J.T. That is the idea.
J.J. Mary in chapter 10 would say, "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight" (@Psalm 19:14).
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. What bearing would the healing of the man have in @Mark 7 where the Lord put His fingers into his ears before he could speak right?
J.T. That is Mark's side of this subject, and has a great bearing. It is a question of whether it should
{118}
be presented from Mark or Luke, but I think Luke is the writer that suits for the moment what is before us. But we can see how that incident helps, for it brings out, as peculiar to Mark, the depths of feeling the Lord had in these matters. He spat and touched the man's tongue, and looked up to heaven and groaned. That depth of feeling should be reflected in us. The man could not speak right; that is the point there, and the Lord felt it; the need of right speaking is so urgent.
Ques. Should we be concerned in our local meetings about what is said?
J.T. That is what I hope the Lord will lead to. You like to see the young people beginning to speak, beginning in self-consciousness with God, the mind controlling. The mind says, Now that is not right. The mind is dominant in Romans. It is a question of the law of God, a question of what God requires, and that will reduce the volume of my speaking very much, reduce it, maybe, down to five words. But then I make a beginning; that is the point.
Rem. This young man had a wonderful experience.
J.T. You would like to hear that young man. He made a start, but it does not say what he said. I suppose he heard the Lord say, "Youth, I say to thee". What words those were coming from the lips of Christ. If I have heard the Lord's voice in my soul I am prepared to speak that way. He began to speak, and there was never such speaking as that in that town before -- a young man from the dead.
P.L. Would the sitting up suggest repose and dignity?
J.T. Quite so. He did not speak lying down as he had been. He sat up, which is a sort of position of dignity in the assembly.
J.J. Do you think many are not able to speak because they have not reached the resurrection position?
{119}
J.T. Just so. He sat up at the word of Christ.
Ques. Would the speaking have reference to what had been wrought by the Lord in raising him from the dead? His speaking would be wholly different from what it had been before.
J.T. You can picture that. He was a young man in the town of Nain, which, I suppose, represents the world in its attractiveness. How he would talk about the cricket matches and the like, and current events in the world, which young people love to talk about. But now he has been into death; what can he speak of now?
Rem. In @Romans 12 the renewing of the mind is set over against being conformed to the world. The mind has to be renewed, and it would be in this man's case; that is what he would suggest.
J.O.S. Would the exercise be set out in @Psalm 19? In the first part of the psalm you have the divine speaking, and then the psalmist's appreciation of the law of Jehovah, and the testimony of Jehovah and His judgments and commandments, and then he says in the last verse: "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight".
J.T. That corresponds with Romans: "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law". Well, certainly I ought to serve it in my speech.
Ques. Would you say a little more about coming into self-consciousness with God?
J.T. I think that is what @Romans 7 teaches us. "*I myself*" he says. He was in a quagmire or a fog earlier, but now he is on a solid footing, and he says, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law", in fact, "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man". Then he alludes to his mind in his consciousness with God; I serve the law of God, he says. Well, if I serve it, it works out in my speaking.
{120}
Ques. Would it be right to look first of all for speaking to God in private?
J.T. That is the idea. Romans teaches us how we come into priesthood, and priesthood very largely is a question of speaking to God, but not altogether, because the priest's lips keep knowledge for others too. I believe that God knows us; He comes down to our way of thinking and knows us by our prayers, by the way we speak to Him. He said to Moses, I know Aaron; you say you cannot speak; "I know that he can speak well" (@Exodus 4:14). How did He know? God gets down to our way of thinking, and conveys that He has heard Aaron speak, and that means that he prayed, that Aaron was to be the priest and he prayed to God. I believe that is how the thing works out. God hears us speak. We are not so free with our tongues when we are speaking to God; we are careful in our words and the way we frame to speak to God.
Rem. That is the one thing that Ananias is told about Saul of Tarsus. He gets direct communication from heaven as to the communications that had been going up to heaven unknown to him: "Behold, he prayeth".
J.A.M. Is it a forceful remark that Jehovah makes to Moses in that connection, "Who gave man a mouth?" (@Exodus 4:11)?
J.T. That is what is in mind. God has given all of us a mouth to use. What use are we making of it? Have I come to learn how to speak? There are people, of course, who teach oratory and that kind of thing which is of little use. That is not what we are speaking of. It is a question of learning to use the organs spiritually, and if I am to learn how to use them I must think of Christ; He is the Model. Luke presents Him in that way, and so Romans, I believe, leads us on to consciousness with God. In speaking to God, I am thinking of God, and I obey the law of
{121}
God, serve the law of God. You are to serve in newness of spirit in Romans; that is the priestly thought, and in that I am concerned about the principles that govern it, to serve the law of God, and that enters into my speaking.
C.S.S. When the Lord says to the young man, "Wake up", is it suggestive that I should have my eyes open to the greatness of the Person before I can speak and speak aright?
J.T. That is the way it works. You are impressed with the Being you are speaking to, and the more I pray, the less likely I am to be flippant in my words with others.
J.J. It gives great weight to the passage quoted from @Psalm 116: "I believed, therefore have I spoken", because of what the apostle was going through at that time; there was such a moral state behind it. I mean, it is one thing to speak, and there is plenty of that, but it is another thing to be the thing you are saying, for there is to be no disparity between yourself and what you are saying. I thought that was what Paul was meaning there.
J.T. Yes; the Lord was altogether what He said.
Ques. Does @Psalm 39:1 apply? "I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue".
J.T. That enters into what we are saying, because you become circumspect. If my ways are wrong, my speaking will be wrong. I like to bring myself into the picture always, which is as natural as water flowing down a hill, unless I am with God; but if I am with God I bring Christ into the picture. If I take heed to my ways I judge myself.
H.M.G. "My heart is welling forth with a good matter: I say what I have composed touching the king" (@Psalm 45:1).
J.T. That shows the King is in the picture, as we have been saying; you are thinking of Him. You take heed to your ways and you judge yourself.
{122}
J.J. Do you mean that all speaking that is of God would leave behind an impression of Christ on those that hear, and not an impression of yourself? That is a real test.
J.T. That is the idea. If I do not take heed to my ways, I will bring myself in somehow, and so that is the impression left on my hearers.
P.L. So, almost immediately after this young man speaks, the Lord says, "Go, bring back word to John". They were to bring Christ into the picture.
Ques. Does the thought of hearing enter very largely into the thought of speaking? The Lord says, "Take heed therefore how ye hear" (@Luke 8:18).
J.T. That is the case in @Mark 7. The hearing and the speaking were correlated, and the Lord's operation there brings out that the man spoke right. If I do not hear right, I do not speak right.
A.W.R. According to Romans, would the confession of Christ as Lord be the first right speaking? In chapter 3 we have speaking wrongly, and then later the confessing with the mouth Jesus as Lord.
J.T. That is the public side. No doubt, there would be speaking to God before that.
Rem. The speaking of John the baptist was not very much apparently in @John 1, but great feeling entered into what he said, "Behold the Lamb of God", and then it says, "And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus".
J.T. If we follow the incidents in Luke we get the order and the mind of the Spirit, and the Lord as the Model. Zacharias is prohibited from speaking, as much as to say, You will have to be silent. But in the interval Christ speaks. Then we have the Model, and then the young man raised from the dead who began to speak. Well, that will go on. Then, in chapter 11, we have the man with the dumb spirit, a very remarkable thing, that a person should be possessed by a dumb spirit, as if Satan is now preventing
{123}
the speaking. In chapter 1 God is preventing the speaking, that is, He is passing a judgment that you are not qualified and there are those whose mouths must be stopped, but in chapter 11, Satan is preventing the speaking. It is the time for speaking, because the Holy Spirit is available in the chapter. The Lord is seen praying in a certain place, and evidently the disciple that saw Him praying was impressed, and said, "Lord, teach us to pray", and the Lord teaches them how to pray. Then it goes on to say that the Father gives "the Holy Spirit to them that ask him". Well, if that be so, Satan says virtually, it is time to stop people from speaking. If any one that has the Holy Spirit cannot speak, it is a serious matter, because the Spirit is given that we might speak; we are to say, "Lord Jesus", by the Spirit, a most important matter, that I not only use the words, but I address the Lord, I speak to the Lord in the power of the Spirit: "Lord Jesus". If those words resound in the assembly in the power of the Spirit, we have right speaking and a right state of things inaugurated in the assembly.
J.J. Do you think the assembly is in view in all this?
J.T. There are those whose mouths the enemy would stop. Some of us are distressed that there are those who are the Lord's, no doubt, and have the Spirit, but who never open their mouths in the assembly. Well, that is the devil. "Let me hear thy voice", the Lord says (@Song of Songs 2:14). The devil says, He will not hear your voice. That may be thought very lightly of, but it is serious.
A.W.R. Just previous to the verse which refers to saying, "Lord Jesus", it is said, "Ye were led away to dumb idols" (@1 Corinthians 12:2).
J.T. That is remarkable. It says, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit".
{124}
C.W.M. It says that the Lord gave the young man back to his mother. Would that mean that young people should begin to speak rightly at home?
J.T. The thought of the mother might be enlarged upon. The young man comes under maternal influence amongst the brethren. He began to speak. Well, let him come under right influence now.
J.J. What are we going to do with these dumb cases in the meeting, for there are several?
J.T. There are in every meeting, and the suggestion here is very serious, because Satan has put that dumb demon there. It is a dumb demon so that the person cannot speak, and it says that the Lord "was casting out a demon". That is, attention is called to the transaction, not that He cast out the demon, but that He was doing it. We have to learn how the thing is to be done.
J.J. It is a very great lesson to learn, so that we can do it.
J.T. The question is can we do it?
Ques. Would it also suggest that the Lord is still doing it?
J.T. The Lord "began to say", and here He is doing the thing, the thing is in operation.
C.S.S. It is an advance on the other. It is continued.
J.T. I think so. In the other, the man was raised from the dead, and now the difficulty is a dumb demon, and the Lord is casting him out. We want to learn how to do that.
Rem. The Lord says, "Ask and it shall be given to you" (@Luke 11:9). If you are dumb in your asking, you do not get anything.
T.K. Would the two incidents in @Luke 7 and 11 find a collective answer in @Ephesians 5:14? "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee", and then, verse 19, "speaking to yourselves in psalms and
{125}
hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord; giving thanks at all times for all things to him who is God". You spoke not only of being individually exercised and aroused as to these things, but that it should find some assembly expression. Would @Ephesians 5, which deals with the heart of Christ in relation to the assembly, bring that in at the end? So you have Christ, and the Spirit, and the Lord, and God. One would be exercised that we might not only wake up from the individual bier, the great procession of death, but be relieved from domination, finding ourselves free amongst the brethren, speaking to the Lord and to God, and then chanting with our heart to the Lord. Having learned to speak, would we learn to sing?
J.T. You have there the generality of speaking amongst us. Instead of speaking idle things in our ordinary conversation, we speak things that are profitable and edifying, and God has part in them.
P.L. A woman "lifting up her voice out of the crowd, said to him, Blessed is the womb that has borne thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. But *he* said, Yea rather ...". Speaking out of the crowd is not very productive. Is the speaking to be in an assembly environment if the Lord is going to take it on?
J.T. Of course, that speaking out of the crowd is Roman Catholicism; it is the thought of the 'blessed Mary'. That is not priestly at all. Speaking out of the crowd is what brings in that sort of thing; it is not the temple of God. But with the man out of whom the dumb demon was cast, the inference is that he spoke in a spiritual way, because that is the point in the passage.
J.J. Do you think the remedy lies in that very environment of chapter 11?
J.T. I think @Luke 10 and 11 are the furnishing chapters for the assembly.
{126}
P.L. So the Lord starts with prayer.
J.T. That is the idea.
J.J. Just a little before, it speaks of bread and fish and an egg; would not feeding on living food of that kind be the way to get out of this dumb state?
J.T. It is God: "of him, and though him, and for him are all things" (@Romans 11:36). As we come into the assembly, surely God is to be before us, and we are to speak to God in the assembly. Now Luke, as we follow up this line in the gospel, shows the first assembly meeting in pattern in chapter 24. There were those two who had been to Emmaus, whose hearts burned within them, and they invited Him into the house and He broke the bread. They saw Him and knew Him and He vanished out of their sight, then they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and those with them gathered together, and they were speaking. That is the idea in Luke. John's picture does not give them speaking at all, they were just there, but Luke presents the saints, as first gathered, speaking. Well, what were they saying? "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". That is another thing. Well, that is excellent speaking, and exactly suitable for the moment, that the Lord was risen and was gracious to appear to a poor sinner that had denied Him. How beautiful that was! calculated to permeate the whole scene with grace. The two had their mouths opened immediately, and they said that the Lord "was made known to them in the breaking of bread". How beautiful that was! another contribution, as it were, to the assembly, inaugurated from their side by suitable speaking. If they were all dumb, there would not be any of that, nor would the Lord come in either. It says, "as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst". John does not present that side, but Luke does. While they were speaking, He came in.
{127}
C.S.S. Do you think they said, Come into Thy garden?
J.T. Quite so. The speaking pleased the Lord.
Ques. In @Luke 11 the Lord speaks of using the finger of God -- does that suggest the detail which He would employ in order to secure this speaking?
J.T. Just so.
T.K. Would those who are suffering from spiritual deformity hear something in the assembly in connection with the Supper in chapter 22, which would lead them to learn the Lord for themselves as on the way, as in chapter 24? The words of the Lord in connection with the institution of the Supper and the signalising of the bread and the cup would be familiar -- to have heard those words from the Lord's lips at that moment would be a grand thing. Would they not get help at the Supper in regard of speaking?
J.T. That is what we are at, which is what the two from Emmaus spoke of. They said that He "was made known to them in the breaking of bread".
Rem. Jeremiah said, "I cannot speak; for I am a child" (chapter 1:6), and it says, "Jehovah put forth his hand and touched my mouth" (verse 9).
P.L. But later he says that he must speak because "it was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones" (chapter 20:9).
J.T. When we come to @Acts 14, we have the product of all this in apostolic ministry in material for the assembly. First, the two servants so speak that a great multitude believed. The speaking was such that they saw the result, but there was one man who was noticing Paul's speaking; there was something about that speaking that struck him, and Paul, on the other hand, noticed that there was faith in the man. The interest the man evidenced in Paul's speaking was to Paul an evidence of faith, "that he had faith to be healed", and Paul spoke to him with a
{128}
loud voice. I think there is something in that in testimony, in those who minister, and the result was he sprang up on his feet. Then, later in the chapter, we have the allusion to elders. This material is to be cared for. There is that in the assembly that recognises speaking, and sees that it is cared for. So the elders are chosen in each assembly. As in the case of the mother in @Luke 7, the material secured on the principle is to be cared for, and hence the elders are chosen. That is, it is a question of what would suit the apostles; they chose the elders. This material is to be cared for, that the flow of speaking should be controlled. The spirit of control is another matter. The fruit of the work of God is one thing, the spirit of control in a motherly way is another, and I believe eldership is to promote right speaking, that what is said in the assembly is correct and suitable to God.
J.J. And that there should be room for it.
J.T. There is plenty of scope for it, but under the spirit of control, so that we are not to be like the Corinthians, speaking at random, in tongues and what not. The point is the spirit of control.
P.L. Do the elders lead in that in @Revelation 4 and 5 in regard of the Lamb?
J.T. In chapter 4 the elders are in the lead; they are on thrones and are crowned. The four living creatures refer to the youth amongst us; they have energy, but they need to be controlled. When the living creatures do so-and-so, the elders fall down and worship; they are satisfied; they represent the spirit of control. In chapter 5, where energy is needed, the living creatures come first, for they are the ones that have to do the heavy work, but the spirit of control is never lost sight of. In Revelation the elders are always in view.
A.W.R. The last Psalm ends up with "high sounding cymbals".
{129}
J.T. That is energy; "everything that hath breath".
J.J. It is striking that the Spirit came on the gentiles in speaking. "While Peter was yet speaking these words", it says.
P.L. Do you think the elder in John's epistle is concerned with regard to Gaius and his part in the assembly, that he should be under control, as distinct from Diotrephes and his babbling wicked words?
J.T. I am sure that is important. There should not be loose independent speaking amongst us. The young man began to speak and was delivered to his mother; his mother would regulate the speaking. That is the idea. So here, this lame man heard Paul speaking. The point is, not what Paul said, but how he said it, that kind of speaking. This man would be affected that way, and I believe the spirit of control brought in toward the end of the chapter is to regulate all this. Immediately, it is said, "And the priest of Jupiter who was before the city, having brought bulls and garlands to the gates, would have done sacrifice along with the crowds". Well, all that is lawless effort.
J.J. It was to bring themselves into the picture, whereas Paul brings God in.
J.T. That is right. All this is to bring out the need for eldership.
Ques. Would that be exercised largely in influence?
J.T. Well, it is. It says, "Having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed". That is how the assemblies were left in the region of Lystra. This pagan effort brought into christianity is mentioned here after this wonderful choice material in this man, the man taking notice of how the apostle is speaking; he heard him speaking. There is choice material there. Well now, Satan
{130}
would come in to overthrow all that in this effort to make the apostles gods: "The gods, having made themselves like men, are come down to us". How foreign all that is to what was going on in that man's soul; he had faith.
P.L. And would the bulls provide volume instead of quality, the incoherent roaring of the bulls of Bashan that was a grief to the Lord instead of the speaking of God's sons?
J.T. I am sure that is right, and you can see the contrast here. So it says, "But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having heard it, rent their garments, and rushed out to the crowd, crying and saying, Men, why do ye these things? *We* also are men of like passions with you, preaching to you to turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things in them; who in the past generations suffered all the nations to go in their own ways, though indeed he did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. And saying these things, they with difficulty kept the crowds from sacrificing to them". You can see the balancing word of the apostles, bringing God in to set aside this. Well now, this choice material that is represented in this man is to be cared for, The assemblies in that region were exposed to this lawless paganism that would be mixed up with christianity. How great is the need for wise, sober judgment amongst us! The man in Decapolis was sitting and clothed and in his right mind, and that man can be trusted. They chose them elders. It is not only what would suit Paul and Barnabas, but what would suit them.
Rem. That man was left as the only vocal representative of the Lord in Decapolis. The Lord sent him to "relate how great things God has done for
{131}
thee", not only to say what the Lord did, but to express the Lord's feelings in doing it.
J.T. You wonder how he could stand up in the city influence in Decapolis, but the Lord said he was to be there. But he is a balanced man, and I believe the elders here have in mind the choice material that has come about in this lame man. The enemy is present to overwhelm them with the grossest paganism, so they chose them elders in each assembly -- not here in each city, but in each assembly.
J.J. Is this one of Paul's most serious chapters? He brings in these three places in @2 Timothy 3:11: "what sufferings happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra"?
J.T. I suppose it was the most serious moment in his history, himself stoned and left for dead, but the brethren encircling him.
P.L. So in localities God is to have a mouthpiece in testimony in the assemblies.
J.T. What is an assembly if it cannot speak? In @Acts 11 it is said that the assembly had ears.
T.K. And is it interesting to see that there is perfect response to God as the result of this? It says, "They committed them to the Lord on whom they had believed. And having passed though Pisidia ... and thence they sailed away to Antioch, whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled". The assembly here in this place were able to open their mouths to God, to commend the servants back to Him. That must have been good speaking, speaking such as God would hear and which would support the testimony in the apostles.
J.T. The teaching of the chapter is that the speaking in the apostles corresponded to Christ, and then we have the material that accrued from it. Notice was taken of them in the material, as in @Luke 4. The man heard Paul speaking, Paul on the
{132}
other hand noticing faith in the man, that it is that kind of material. Then this attack of the devil in which paganism is introduced is the danger, and hence the need for that material being protected and cared for, mothered, as you might say, because eldership is mothering.
Ques. Is the spirit of prayer and fasting introduced here to be maintained for the exercise of eldership?
J.T. Surely. The elders are to mother the youth. The Lord delivered the young man back to his mother as he began to speak; she is to regulate that speaking. And so here the elders are to look after this wonderful material illustrated in this man. So that the assemblies in these places are representative of God and right speaking.
J.J. Does that not explain Paul's great care for Timothy, who had fully followed up his doctrine? He had such a care for him.
J.T. Quite so; he was his child.
Rem. I suppose to get the value of the speaking for ourselves our hearing must be mixed with faith. There is wonderful speaking going on today, and people say they do not understand and do not follow. Is it not a matter for their own faith?
J.T. Quite so. I believe, following on the thought of speaking. Luke contemplated the need of moral qualities represented in eldership, so that the young might be under control. When they have begun to speak there should be exercise to see that they continue.
Rem. Apollos was defective in his speaking, and Aquila and Priscilla, hearing him, "unfolded to him the way of God more exactly" (@Acts 18:26).
J.T. They "took him to them" first. That is a matter of brotherly care, for after all he was only a young christian. He had great vocal powers, great powers of speaking and was evidently an eloquent
{133}
man, but he needed that control, which is most important.
Rem. At first it says much of his eloquence but nothing of his contribution, but after he had passed through the hands of Aquila and Priscilla it says nothing of his eloquence but that he contributed much.
J.T. That is the thing. Having begun to speak, the great thing is to continue.
{134}
ADDITIONS
@Acts 2:41 - 47; @Acts 5:11 - 14; @Acts 11:19 - 24
J.T. These scriptures record the conditions in the early days in which additions were made. The first additions were made to what was at Jerusalem; then additions to the Lord in chapters 5 and 11. Chapter 2 sets out the great general thought before us and chapters 5 and 11 give particular detail. In chapter 5 the discipline maintained in the verses read alludes to Ananias and Sapphira; in chapter 11 it is the liberty that marked the preaching, and then the effect of the service of Barnabas. The Jews who were scattered abroad passed through Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch preaching the word to the Jews alone; then it adds there were certain of them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who entered into Antioch and spoke to the Greeks of the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus. As no direction from the Lord is mentioned, it implies liberty of spiritual understanding -- some confining their testimony to the Jews, others going further. Then we have also the influence of Barnabas.
I thought under those heads we might get instruction as to conditions in which we may expect additions. The first verse read calls attention to the general thought of additions without saying who added, or to what the addition was made; then the following verses cite the characteristics of the saints referred to. Then it says that certain people were added to the Lord, as if the conditions described were suitable for Him to add to. This narrative would assist us to continue the rendering of the testimony -- for we require additions as well as conditions which are suitable to God.
Ques. Does the word that they persevered in the teaching, involve there was a certain amount of
{135}
testing and steadfastness with them before the Lord would add?
J.T. The apostles¬ teaching was a new thing -- not customary. The current religion of Moses was right enough, in a way, but this is a new thing -- that so many persons should be found discerning in the teaching that which no religious status in Jerusalem had required -- perseverance.
Rem. They were not casual -- they all came to the meetings.
J.T. They were together, we are told, and that would mean that as opportunity offered they would be present. Together in one place -- together characteristically -- they would not fail to attend the meetings, of which there must have been a great many; this would be implied by the fact that they broke bread in houses.
Ques. Do you think their continuing in these conditions is why the numbers mount up from one hundred and twenty to three thousand, then five thousand?
J.T. Yes, conditions suitable for additions were there. If we have the conditions and testimony rendered we may look for additions. The scene in Jerusalem at this time must have been remarkable. It is well to picture what actually existed in Jerusalem. It was a new thing. As believers come into contact with what is current amongst us they find it new and it is essential that there should be the conditions confirming what is taught because people do not take to what is new merely because it is presented -- there must be conditions.
Ques. Would you say a word on what precedes this -- the acceptance of their word, then baptism, and the adding of three thousand souls? How would the acceptance of the word and the baptism bear upon what follows?
J.T. I thought the conviction by Peter's word
{136}
indicates the work of God. "When they heard this", it says in verse 37, "they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?", and Peter says, "Repent, and be baptized ...". They were baptized -- the Spirit stresses what marked them. The word affected their intelligence as well as their consciences. They said to Peter and the other apostles, "What shall we do?". What is of God is taken account of. They recognised not only the preacher but the other apostles; how they came to recognise them is not stated -- this seems to me to bring out what the work of God is.
Ques. Is confirmation that the assembly was first formed on the principle of separation conveyed when Peter says, "Save yourselves from this untoward generation"?
J.T. Yes, instead of going to an official person like the priests at Jerusalem to enquire, they enquire of Peter and the other apostles. I think that is always a test as to whether God is working if His subjects recognise what is of Him and do not turn to what is accredited in the world.
Rem. Addressing them all as brethren indicates how approachable they were.
J.T. You mean, had they gone to the palace of the high priest they could not have spoken with the same familiarity. The state of things accompanying the whole testimony seems to be noticed -- the environment is free and those who seem to have the light are accessible.
Ques. Will you say a word as to what Peter says, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins"?
J.T. It conveys the position, and we must bear in mind that it is a new thing. Moses is not mentioned. The average person attending the preaching would be accustomed to Moses¬ teaching, but this is
{137}
a new thing presented. It is for them to do it -- Peter does not say, 'I am ready to do it for you' -- he is putting it upon them as to what is required -- a moral necessity. It says, "They that gladly received his word were baptized" -- signifying intelligence.
Ques. In speaking of additions, have you a thought in your mind as to the christians connected with the systems around, and also activities in the gospel?
J.T. I was thinking that their recognition of Peter and the other apostles is one great mark of the work of God in them. If their feelings were mixed they would have gone to well-known priests. The work of God would lead you to enquire of the person through whom the light has come, not only from the person who speaks but from the others.
Rem. In @1 John 4:6 it says, "He that knoweth God heareth us".
J.T. That confirms what we say. The apostle John specially presents that side, "They went out from us" (@1 John 2:19) -- we want to understand that "us" -- the apostles represented Christ, and it was no small matter for Jewish persons to take on with this in view of what they had been connected with -- it shows it was a work of God.
Rem. Very different from the man who was blind in @John 9: he was taken to the Pharisees, and, as you say, they only got darkened.
J.T. There is significance in the fact that the first scripture is connected with the adherence to the apostles¬ teaching, the second, with Peter's discrimination and his shadow, and believers being added, and the third, with the disciples being called christians.
It is important for us to see the instinct which accompanies the work of God in His subjects. It is no small matter to take on something which is entirely new to me.
{138}
Rem. In speaking of the practical working out of these things, one is reminded that some little while ago many came amongst us, and every one of them got his impressions at the Lord's supper.
J.T. That is very important at the present time. Here there are men of Galilean dialect with nothing in the way of religious adherence to commend them, but it is the Spirit of God which puts them forward. Peter's address must have been wonderful -- yet great as the word was and also Peter, they see others besides him. No one-man affair -- that was never intended -- not like the Pope or archbishop.
Ques. In verse 32 of chapter 5, Peter says, "We are his witnesses". Would he be calling attention to the company there?
J.T. Just so. He stood up with the eleven, a group together, but there is something more than that, the converts saw that all those men could be enquired of. This is an indication at the outset that christianity was never intended to be a one-man affair. This is confirmed in @Acts 16 where the jailor says, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?".
The Lord's supper is certainly not a one-man affair -- no official ministering the Supper -- "The bread which we break" -- "the cup ... which we bless".
Ques. Would personality enter into it? It is not only what is done, but what marks those who do it -- the substance they have.
J.T. Yes, these twelve must have been remarkable men, the handiwork of Christ. There was something different about them and that should mark all of us. Where people are genuine they do observe that things are different. There would be Matthew, Peter, James and so on -- there must have been a work of God to lead the subjects to discern and ask them. What works out in these subjects would be in accord with what they saw in the apostles. They were impressed with these men.
{139}
Rem. There was something unusual about them according to current religion at the time.
J.T. Yes, they were different -- they could all tell you how soul difficulties could be met.
Ques. Would one of their features be that they were in touch with the Man who had gone into heaven?
J.T. Quite so. How interesting it is when a person in soul difficulties is put in the presence of one who can tell him how they are to be met. If we recall our early days of conversion how thankful we were to meet a person who could tell us this.
Ques. Does it suggest the thought of how accessible they were?
J.T. Yes, they felt these men were accessible -- not too high for a poor sinner to go to.
Ques. Does Peter bring that in when he addresses them as "Men and brethren" in chapter 2:29?
J.T. Quite so. Your preaching should indicate that you are a man who can get down to people, as it says of the Lord when He appointed the twelve that He descended with them to a level place.
Ques. Do we do well to be sympathetic with those involved in difficulties?
J.T. Yes, the difficulties are very real. Some of us were not brought up in churches and do not perhaps realise how difficult it is for those in that system to get out of it.
Ques. Perhaps we do not get questions because we have not the ability or the readiness to answer them?
J.T. That may be -- these converts realised there were men who could answer their questions.
Rem. We are not all on the look-out for those who would ask questions.
J.T. That may be. There is the environment in the testimony which God provides in view of these contingencies. Are we ready to meet these contingencies?
{140}
It was a great day when three thousand passed through their hands. In this chapter (2) we have a general idea of the inauguration of christianity. There are gifted persons -- these are in the twelve and they are singled out by the converts, who enquire of them.
Ques. Would such speaking as you have mentioned help souls to come early to a recognition of what is authoritative as the testimony of God?
J.T. I think that is an important side of addition. Where God is working there will be a recognition of His authority.
Ques. Would you say that in the apostles here there were moral features that would attract souls? These were men of prayer and feeling.
J.T. Yes, the twelve were certainly the distinctive handiwork of Christ. Of two of them the Lord says, "I will make you fishers of men" (@Matthew 4:19).
Ques. Would you say a little more in regard to the thought of authority? Is there any true material for the assembly apart from starting with the recognition of authority?
J.T. I think not. It is impossible to carry on building without material which recognises authority.
Ques. Is the authority as real today as on the day of Pentecost?
J.T. Yes, in principle. Authority remains, and is a test to any who profess to be the subjects of the work of God.
Ques. Are you giving that a local setting?
J.T. Yes, it should work out there. If young people are interested and see the procedure in the assembly, the next thing is, is there any authority here? Today that requires persons of moral weight, not merely official status.
Ques. Do you connect that with the fear that they had? You get fear in this chapter and also in chapter 5.
{141}
J.T. Yes, that is good. That is where the authority is discerned. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God.
Rem. It was apparently a lack of it that brought in the breach in chapter 5. They laid certain things at the apostles¬ feet but in the spirit of deception.
J.T. Ananias and Sapphira represented features of the devil's opposition to what we have in chapter 2. I have profited by seeking to picture the position. Jerusalem was never a big city and we have to picture three thousand or five thousand persons so described. They must have met in, maybe, a hundred places on the first day of the week. What a state of things existed there! -- as described here in the verses read in chapter 2. As you walked along the streets of Jerusalem you would be bound to hear praise to God -- there were so many places where the saints were. It was a wonderful development of the work of God. Chapter 5 shows that the enemy would spoil that.
Rem. It is interesting that it says the same of the three thousand as of the one hundred and twenty -- they were all together in one place.
J.T. It does not say they were all together in one place, but together in heart. They broke bread "from house to house", which means in houses, and they were jubilant -- so that the enemy in chapter 5 would spoil that. Continuance of conditions for additions requires disciplines. Evil must not be allowed.
Ques. It would seem to indicate that there was spiritual sensitiveness with the apostle to deal with the evil.
J.T. Yes.
Rem. The authority that was seen in the apostles is supported by the Spirit.
J.T. I think that is to be noticed in both these incidents. With regard to the three thousand it says, "Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles",
{142}
and in chapter 5:11,12, it says, "Great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things. And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people". As if God kept up the authority among His people. If the authority is owned Satan will be defeated.
Ques. Is that supported then conditionally upon the maintenance of discipline, on the refusal of all evil?
J.T. Yes, the continuance of the apostles¬ authority is in evidence. The apostles were maintained in their authority; God supported them, as it were, honouring their faithfulness. If we carry on in this way and are faithful in the exclusion of sin God will continue to support the authority which exists.
Ques. Would chapter 5:11 suggest that the sensibilities of the saints were sharpened through discipline?
J.T. Yes, and the added statement that the apostles were supported through their signs and wonders shows that their authority is maintained in this, for it was an attack of the devil, but there is power to repel the attack of the devil not only in the power given to the apostles in signs and wonders, but also in that they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. Solomon's porch would mean that judgment is to continue. The saints are so impressed with this exercise of discipline that they are not evading it -- as much as to say, 'We are supporting this'. If sin occurs we need not be afraid to face it -- God honours nothing more than the maintenance of discipline amongst His people.
Rem. It is affecting that Peter in speaking to Ananias refers to the great fact of God dwelling in the assembly.
J.T. The Holy Spirit would mean God dwelling there. The authority of the Lord is jealously guarded. I think there is often fear to deal with sinful conditions when they arise in case we cause a breach. This
{143}
should teach us not to fear that. We may lose persons but we gain in divine favour. We are told that multitudes both of men and women were added -- multitudes of real believers added to the Lord. So that there was a recognition of the authority of the Lord in the assembly. Adding to the Lord today would mean that one recognises all the principles connected with that title.
Rem. Is not that a feature to be looked for in those who seek to walk with the saints in this path today?
J.T. You would love to see the saints in Solomon's porch. A meeting for discipline in London ought to mean that the saints in London are in it.
Ques. Does Peter represent a lead given in that direction? He moves on his own to meet the attack. Does he represent the spiritual mind in the matter?
J.T. Very good. We are obliged to investigate, but in the investigation we need spiritual discernment. Every case of discipline or breach taxes that element of discernment.
Rem. This discernment is not found with all, only those who take the lead generally.
J.T. So it is here, but it is very fine to see that all are in Solomon's porch -- the brethren are there; the meeting is not left to leaders.
Rem. You have the Spirit's answer to Jesus walking in the temple in the porch of Solomon. Was He alone then (@John 10:23)?
J.T. I suppose He was. "I have other sheep ...", He says. These are all to be brought in -- on this principle there would be addition. Jesus is alone, not with the Jews.
Ques. The winter -- would that allude to all that lay before Him?
J.T. No doubt, but He stood the test. We tend to be afraid of discipline and the consequences.
Ques. Is there a link with what comes out in
{144}
chapter 3 -- the man who was walking, leaping and praising God -- he is holding Peter and John in this place (Solomon's porch).
J.T. Quite so. That they were all there is remarkable. I think that with regard to these discipline meetings the Lord would stress that @1 Corinthians 5 means that the saints were together for discipline, not for the breaking of bread, and it requires power. Paul says, "And my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ" (verse 4).
Ques. Does this suggest that the power is felt beyond the church, because even outside they would not join themselves?
J.T. Yes, it became a bulwark to the church instead of weakness. The spirit of judgment among us is safety.
Ques Would you mind saying a word in regard to Joshua dealing with Achan? Would that incident bear on your thought of discipline?
J.T. Yes, very definitely. It is stoning -- a matter for all the saints.
Ques. In regard of being added to the Lord -- does this involve a deeper transaction in the soul -- a sense of the maintenance of the holiness of the Lord?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. So that it would be good to see souls coming forward having exercise on this line.
J.T. I think so. At assembly meetings for discipline the sisters should be present.
Ques. Is there any significance in the fact that if a man and a woman have to come under this severe discipline God triumphs in adding both men and women as a result?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. In a meeting of discipline, how far should those go who give testimony? Should they give a lead to the saints in what they say: this seems to be done by Peter?
{145}
J.T. There ought to be a clear statement of the guilt -- no more is necessary. A discipline meeting should not be a deliberative one. The enemy tries to do this. Judgment should be executed without question. The facts should be stated soberly.
Ques. Does the power involve our being formed in what came in by Jesus Christ?
J.T. Quite so. The power would be there in those who are formed.
Rem. You have two things mentioned in @Psalm 19:9,11 -- "The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether ... and in keeping of them there is great reward".
J.T. Yes.
Rem. The statement of facts at a discipline meeting should be of such a character as to show to every soul what should be done.
J.T. Yes, the facts corroborated by two witnesses are all that is needed.
Rem. In connection with the incident in @Numbers 15 -- the man found gathering sticks on the sabbath day -- it says they that found him brought him to Moses, but all stoned him.
J.T. Yes, every person can cast a stone. If believe this chapter (@Acts 5) is very important in respect of the maintenance of judgment. The saints are with the apostles in the porch.
Rem. From the middle of verse 12 there is a parenthesis: the signs and wonders are connected with healing.
J.T. The parenthesis is to fill out the position.
Rem. There would not be a single person who dissents from the judgment.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. The exercise may commence with a few but all the saints are eventually brought into it.
J.T. Yes, that is how it works. The finding
{146}
of Saul by Barnabas confirmed the work that had been begun. He is one who, finding work to do, does it with all his might. The Lord's hand was with those who went out, and a man like Barnabas confirms the work. The saints have ears for what God is doing. If God is working we do not want to be deaf, dumb or blind; we want to be alert as to what God is doing. The saints are enquiring not only locally, but universally.
Ques. It will be noticed that some of them spoke only to the Jews but others spoke to the Greeks also. What do you see in that?
J.T. I see increasing liberty. We are all apt to be trammelled by legal thoughts. It is commendable that they were speaking to the Jews, but they were somewhat trammelled by legal thoughts. The church is alert -- another side of the position. That is an important thing for addition.
Ques. Have you any thought why this follows the persecution of Stephen?
J.T. It shows that God turns what seems to be defeat into victory. I understand in relation to Stephen's seeing the Son of man standing at the right hand of God that "standing" there means He is ready to serve. Some of us are often hampered by legal thoughts, with the best intentions, but then there are others who are not. It says in chapter 11:20, "And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord". It was as if the Lord would stress that there are those who go forward.
Ques. Would this encourage initiative of the right kind when serving the Lord?
J.T. Yes, without further word you go forward and the Lord's hand is with you.
{147}
Rem. They were in agreement with what God had done in relation to Cornelius.
J.T. Yes, that is the setting. When the spirit of liberty is at work spiritual instincts tend to illumine the position.
Rem. It is not now the apostle Peter testifying but, so to speak, the rank and file.
J.T. Yes, the ears of the assembly -- so that it says the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and they, not the apostles, but the assembly, sent out Barnabas. You have Paul's ears in chapter 9 and Peter's in chapter 10 and Ananias and Cornelius, good listeners, and now you have all that merging in a collective way. We note from the early part of the chapter that there was opposition in Jerusalem but it is allayed. In chapter 15 it is more pronounced. I think it is an encouragement to us to take the initiative when the opportunity offers and not to be hampered by legal thoughts. God honours that.
Ques. You have emphasised legal thoughts -- what have you in mind?
J.T. I could not tell you; there are so many. We are so prone to be governed by legal thoughts.
Rem. It is for us to apply what you have been saying.
J.T. Over against the legal thoughts we have Barnabas who, having seen the grace of God, rejoices and goes off to seek Saul, after exhorting them all to cleave unto the Lord. In relation to Barnabas you have a large crowd of people added to the Lord. Possibly the refusal of legal thoughts might bring in Timothy.
Ques. What particularly would characterise one whom the Spirit of God signifies as a good man?
J.T. We can only refer to it in the abstract: Barnabas is an ideal, a good man, full of the Holy
{148}
Spirit, a man ready to take account of anything of God and not prejudiced by the person.
Rem. Yet he went off the line.
J.T. Yes, but I think when God calls a man good there is something in him, something in the way of a model.
{149}
THE DIVINE VIEWPOINT
@Genesis 12:1; @Genesis 17:10,22; @Genesis 19:27,28; @Genesis 22:2
My remarks, dear brethren, will bear on the importance of believers reaching the divine viewpoint. There is the entrance into the holiest, which implies that we see things as *God* sees them; but I have in mind to speak rather of what is more initial than that, what comes earlier in the history of the average believer, and Genesis has more in mind the thought of God coming to *our* side to show us things. He is doing this, and is ready to do it for any who will permit it, so that we should get the divine viewpoint; not yet in regard to the fulfilment of His counsels exactly, but in regard to current normal needs of our souls. The normal history of the believer in this respect is portrayed in Abraham. He may be called Abraham the believer, that is the model believer; and what develops in his history is God coming to his side. There was no sanctuary yet, no house in a concrete way, so God comes to his side from time to time, and it is recorded, not as a mere matter of history, but that believers of all ages might understand the divine way, and how God has set Himself to serve us; taking account of the current needs of our souls so that no one should be befogged in any way as difficulties arise; God will not fail. He comes down to us, and in the tenderest way draws us aside to show us His way of viewing things, and what is in mind for each of us; indeed He has the greatest interest in every believer.
Abraham is no isolated case -- he was at the outset -- but he is the "father of us all" from the point of view of faith, and he is taught of God. Certainly it ought to be of interest to see how our father in this sense was taught of God, how God dealt with him; for in dealing with our father in this sense, He intended
{150}
that the thing should become spiritually traditional, a heritage handed down to be proved by every son and daughter of Abraham. It is not our heavenly status, but what we are here as believers. Thus we have the Lord coming down, as in Luke. God come down, as one said, '... see thy God beside thee, In a servant's form come near, Sitting, walking, talking with thee! Sinai's mount no longer fear'. (`112:3). That is Luke's aspect, and Luke tells us about a daughter of Abraham, and a son of Abraham: so the idea is familiar. It comes down to us as a heritage in the sense that God is interested in every one of us, from the first movement of faith in our souls, and in fact before, for we should not have faith if He had not been interested in us before.
We have then this heritage, that God drew near and turned aside to Abraham, or at least He took a position alongside him, so that Abraham might gain His point of view. In speaking of the outset of Abraham's history, I would also remark that the end in view is that the believer should be gradually led on to see things, one thing after another, until he sees Christ outside of this world, and apprehends Him as the Son of God, Christ as He is now, not exactly as in relation to eternal blessedness, although that is also in view, but in relation to the testimony here.
Chapter 22 is Christ as He is now: Abraham received Isaac from the dead, in figure, but not to take him down from the mount, not henceforth to control him; nevertheless, Abraham received him from the dead. Isaac does not come down from the mount according to the record. Abraham comes down to his young men, and they go to Beer-sheba, and Abraham dwells there, but it does not say Isaac dwelt there. He remains, as it were, above for faith. That position is secured by Christ typically above. I mean 'above'
{151}
in the sense of not being on the level here: 'Jerusalem above' and 'Isaac above' is Christ away from the level of this world, but still in relation to it in testimony. Therefore Rebecca comes into view immediately in the same chapter, and as Rebecca comes into view Sarah dies. God never has a void in His mind; hence in chapter 24 it is Christ and the assembly. That is the terminus, dear brethren, that I should like to lead you to; because it is most important at the moment that we should be there. It is still a time of testimony, and in the testimony the great central thought is Christ, not here on earth but on high, and the church brought to Him. Rebecca is brought to the tent, she is here, as it were, but here as *of heaven*. You will see that that is the great end to reach now; and God comes down alongside of us as believers to lead us on from step to step, pointing out this and that, that we might learn His way and have His outlook.
Now the first thing is that in Mesopotamia God appears to Abraham and tells him that there is something else to show him. He is to go out of his country and kindred and his father's house, which would be something very hard, a great tax on natural feelings to be told to move thus. But it is "to the land that I will shew thee". It is a matter of trust so far; and I may say here, dear brethren, that Genesis does not give us such a rich account of the land as we get later; nor even do the twelve spies sent up from Kadesh give us as good an account as we get in Deuteronomy. Moses is the one who gives us that; not yet having been there. He was debarred from entrance, yet no one in the Old Testament gives such an account of the land as does Moses. He is the minister, and qualified in the power of the Spirit to give such an account of the land as no one else does. It is a question now of being instructed ministerially, and ministerial instruction implies authoritative
{152}
instruction. It is not optional, but it is the best instruction. Deuteronomy is the book that furnishes the richest descriptions of the land, and that is by the minister, by one who loves, by one who has nursed the saints forty years. He learnt to love them. The more we know the saints and have to do with them, whatever they may be or whatever their attitude, the more we love them, and the easier it is to serve them. The older one becomes in the service, the easier it is to serve; the saints become increasingly attractive. Nothing is too good for the saints, not even the best that God could provide. Moses expatiated on the land so much that God took account of it and said, as it were, 'I will show you the land'.
Genesis does not go that far; you have to take it on trust. God does not there occupy us so much with the qualities of the land, as with the thing itself. He would say, as it were, 'You must take My word that I have something for you. It is not a small matter, it is a land; it is a land of My selection, and if you are a believer, if you have understood anything of My sacrificing My Son to die for you, if you have known anything of My love for you, you must begin to trust Me that I have something for you. I have a land and I will show it to you'. I apprehend that normally the christian's heart will beat high at that!
Abraham's heart would beat, although he was slow to get into it, as all of us are spiritually. What is this that God has for us? It is certainly not a matter of progress in what this world can afford; that may be found in Mesopotamia. A good way to knowledge is on the principle of elimination. God has something for me, and He says it is a land. He is going to show it to me. It is a country; a country implies national feeling, a place that inspires affection. It is interpreted to be a heavenly country.
One can understand how Abraham would think on the way, 'What is this land? -- God has told me that
{153}
He has a land for me that He is going to show me. I long to see it'. Abraham was detained by natural things, but his father died, and he moved into this land "in which *ye* now dwell" (@Acts 7:4). He moved into it.
Then he is found going down to Egypt. That was certainly not the land God was going to show him. But when he had gone down to Egypt and returned, God says to him, "Lift up now thine eyes". What a moment that is in a believer's history, after a vicissitude of shame and sorrow. The history of his journey to Egypt and the return is sorrowful. Lot separated from him as he came back from Egypt -- both were well off in this world's goods, but that is always a danger -- and rivalry set in, which meant separation. But God never forsakes faith, however bad the circumstances. As Lot separated from Abraham, God said, 'Lift up now thine eyes: this is the land'. That is a great day in a believer's history when God calls attention to what He has previously told him He will show him. It is the beginning of great things. Moreover God says, "Arise, walk through the land according to the length of it and according to the breadth of it". God is not ashamed of His land. Genesis does not bring out its richness. We hear nothing of its stones of iron, nor hills of brass (@Deuteronomy 8:9). It is for the believer to trust what God is saying to him. You will find nothing to disprove what God has said. God calls upon us to prove it so far, to walk through the length and breadth of it.
That is the first thing. It had the effect on Abraham of delivering him from any thought of returning to Mesopotamia. Had he had a desire he might have done so, "but now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly" (@Hebrews 11:16). Abraham saw that the land, just as it was, was a better land, for there is constant increase in God's land. Of course, now, it is a spiritual matter, and one of increasing richness. "But now they desire a better country", says the
{154}
writer to the Hebrews, "that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city". God comes alongside those who have faith; He understands the breathings of your heart, and He goes beyond anything you have conceived. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (@1 Corinthians 2:9).
Now the next thing to learn in view of this, is the utter uselessness of the flesh, a very difficult lesson. Abraham had not learnt it yet; Ishmael was testimony to that fact. The Lord says, "The flesh profits nothing" (@John 6:63). I am not speaking for the moment of its wickedness, but of its utter unprofitableness, its utter uselessness in regard to the things of God. God is showing this to Abraham in chapter 17. He had come down to him in beautiful simplicity and familiarity, a touch that ravishes the heart of faith! And we are told that He went up from him; He broke off the conversation and went up. What lessons Abraham learnt as he saw all this! God came down to him to tell him among other things that the flesh is useless. He says to him, 'It is I. I want to talk to you personally, as a Person to a person'. What a wonderful conversation! He says, 'I want to make a covenant with you, and it is to be between Me and you, but I want you to understand that the flesh is utterly worthless and profitless. Disallow it at once'. This is a hard lesson; but Isaac was in view. There was another coming in, different from Ishmael, not yet there, but coming. The sign between God and Abraham was to be circumcision, which means the utter unprofitableness of the flesh. It says in @Romans 4:11 that "he received the sign of circumcision as seal of the righteousness of faith which he had". It is not a sign in the heavens, like the bow in the cloud, but a sign *in himself* It is a question of arriving in
{155}
himself at the power to disallow the flesh. "If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (@Romans 8:13). We have to definitely disallow the flesh as useless, bad, of course, but useless. It is the real power of circumcision, "the putting off of the body of the flesh" -- the whole of it -- "in the circumcision of the Christ". Some may retain the best, but the whole body of it has to be put off. That is the next point; God having spoken to Abraham in the most beautiful terms, and having made the most wonderful promises -- 'I will be in covenant with you everlastingly; but there can be no tolerance of the flesh'.
No lesson is harder to learn than this, to maintain practically in the Lord's service, and generally, the thought of having in oneself the sign of circumcision, that is, that one has the Spirit, and uses the Spirit in the disallowance of the flesh.
Then we are told, "God went up from Abraham", but He came back later. If God leaves off the conversation, He has in mind to resume it. That is one of the most interesting things -- the resumption of the conversation. The interval between the breaking off and the resumption of the conversation is to bring out the element of obedience. That is what God looks for; without it He can do nothing with you. As God left off the conversation and went up to heaven, Abraham immediately carried out what He commanded as to circumcision. Then God came back. After God has entered into conversation with you He will break it off to see what effect it has on you, and according to that effect He will come back.
This time He finds Abraham sitting in the tent door. God comes back in a confirmatory way. That is a very precious thought. There are now four, instead of two, conversing in chapter 18:2. But I want to hasten on to the thought of judgment, how God shows young people the judgment of the world.
{156}
Chapter 18 brings out the renewal of the promise as to Isaac: he is surely to come, the days are given; and the world has to go. That is the setting; but it is not done in an arbitrary way. God says, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do ... ?". The Lord would intimate to you that He has taken the greatest and most careful account of that world, and He would not ask you to leave it if you should not. He would say, 'I will go down and see if the world is as bad as it seems to be'; not that God does not know perfectly, but He would assure *us* that He knows what it is. Moreover He has given opportunity to the world to save itself. Were there ten righteous persons in it He would spare it; all this is on the intercession of one believer. You see how much a believer can do in the affairs of this world. We have far more to do with the international affairs of the world, if we understand our privileges and responsibility, than the League of Nations, or all the embassies of the world! Abraham had it in his hands, so to speak, but it was a question of what was in the world. God says, 'I am going down to see for Myself'. Abraham stands before Him and intercedes beginning with fifty, coming down to forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty and to ten, and God says, "I will not destroy it for ten's sake". But there were not ten; possibly there was only one, Lot. The Scripture says he was a righteous man. Now God goes on His way; He has been alongside Abraham, who now stands before Him in the position of a friend. How beautiful it is that God would call a believer into friendship. He would say, 'I want you in My confidence. I will tell you what I am going to do'. You will have more light about the history of the world than the greatest statesman. "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do ... ?". He is the friend of God, and so are we friends of God. Friendship with God is a great matter; it is brought in in connection with believers.
{157}
Abraham the *believer* was the friend of God. Friendship with the world today, is enmity with God.
Thus the conversation went on; Abraham did not go below ten, and God went on His way. Abraham returned to his place. Everything is in perfect order in the believer's outlook. He has gone far enough with his requests and he stops. God went on His way, and that way meant destruction for the world. He is on that way now; destruction is sure. The Lord Jesus said, "Now is the judgment of this world" (@John 12:31) -- that is the moral thought; the thing yet remains, but destruction is coming.
In chapter 19 Abraham returns to the place where he had been speaking to Jehovah. He would have the divine viewpoint. God is not arbitrary; Abraham sees that his solicitations could not succeed; there were not ten righteous persons in the city of Sodom; he knew that God knew better than he. He left it with God, and went to the spot where he talked with Jehovah, and he sees the smoke of the world rising up. He is at the divine viewpoint. He has no question now about the world. That is how God brings His thoughts into a believer's mind. He would get you to His viewpoint, to see that His dealings are perfectly fair; He did not destroy that city until it was clear that there was perhaps only one righteous man, and He saved him and his two daughters. The man's wife looked back and became a pillar of salt. That is the third thought that I had in mind.
The next is Isaac. I have spoken of his birth that was promised; and chapter 21 tells us that he was born and weaned, that Abraham made a great feast for him in the house, and that Ishmael mocked and was cast out. That is just the history; but I wanted to show you another thing that is very difficult for believers to see, and that is that Christ after the flesh must go, not as to His Person for He
{158}
had a perfect right to go back into heaven, but if there is to be a world for God, Christ after the flesh must die. That is what is meant in @John 9, where we see the condition that Christ had taken in becoming Man: He had taken a flesh and blood condition in order that He might lay it down. It was not the final thought. A world, even with Christ in it as in flesh and blood, will not do; Christ came in to establish *another world*; He calls it "That world, and the resurrection" (@Luke 20:35). It was in purpose, and in becoming Man, or in becoming flesh, as @John 1:14 puts it -- "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us" -- He had in mind to set this world aside, and in doing that, to die Himself. To heal the man in @John 9 the Lord made clay from His own spittle and the earth, and anointed the man's eyes, made him worse, as you might say, and yet not worse. It is a process. He says to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam". What is to be washed? The humanity of Christ would not defile: He was holy, harmless, and undefiled even as in the flesh; "that holy thing" He ever was! Yet what represented that had to be washed. It had to be removed, meaning that Christ died, thus ending that condition. The condition taken up is laid down, and laid down for ever. He took it to lay it down, and in laying it down He established the basis of another world. That is a lesson that is very hard to learn; that the world as it is now even with Christ in it will not do for God. In @John 6 they would have made Him a king. You may think if the Lord Jesus were to come in on these lines and take charge of the nations, how quickly He would change things! But He is not doing that; He has died out of it; and in view of that, He says, "Now is the judgment of this world". We have to apprehend Christ not as He was but as He is. The apostle Paul says, "Henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh.
{159}
yet now henceforth know we him no more" (@2 Corinthians 5:16). We do not even know Christ now after the flesh; it is Christ in *another condition*. Let us take that thought in. Christ is in another world, and yet in testimony in relation to this world. That is what is in view in chapter 22. Thus you have the thought of showing.
God says, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest". Could there be any doubt as to whom He had in His mind? The earlier part of the chapter is full of the preciousness of this person, and what he is to his father. "Get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of". It is a carefully thought out thing, and the mountain, it says, is to be shown. Abraham obeys, and takes his son, his only son whom he loves, and offers him up for a burnt-offering, and receives him from the dead, in figure. Now where is Isaac? That is what I should like to ask every young heart here. Where is Christ who has died? What is His present condition? We read of His having a "glorious body" (@Philippians 3:21). In the forty days¬ sojourn here after His resurrection we have the spiritual body, glorious of course, but we also read of His glorious body -- what He is up there. Does it not ravish your heart? That is how the church comes into view. He is presented as a heavenly Christ to ravish the heart of the assembly. Hence Rebecca is immediately in view in the end of this chapter; it simply means yourself or myself as apprehending the thought of a risen, exalted Christ -- and that we are *His* body. The Holy Spirit takes us to Him. Surely you will go, if you have travelled on the line of which I have been speaking! The blessed God has shown you things, and now He shows you Christ as He is in heaven. The Holy Spirit has come down from Him.
Beer-sheba is now in view as the dwelling place of
{160}
Abraham. It means that faith says, 'Now everything is secured. I have not a doubt now. Every promise is Yea and Amen in that Person'. That is the idea in @2 Corinthians 1. So the apostle says, as they were questioning his veracity (a common thing among the saints, alas!), 'I did not say Yea, and then, Nay'. "Our word to you is not yea and nay. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him. For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us" (@2 Corinthians 1:18 - 20). That is Beer-sheba; that is what establishes you in that city, so to say. It is the outcome of the statement of the apostle that "God is faithful". That statement hangs upon Christ's present position in heaven as the Son of God. Everything is secure there; it leads us into an entirely new world. The church belongs to that realm, the new state of things, but it is still in testimony here.
As we follow along the line of divine showing we shall reach this terminus, and in that position we shall be effective for testimony here, and that is what God is aiming at, that Christ and the assembly should be clearly in view. So that in @Revelation 22 Jesus says, *"I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come". That is, as we may say, Abraham's servant and Rebecca. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". It is Christ as He *is*, not as He was. It is the same Person, but it is Christ as expressing the purposes of God and the glorious condition of the assembly as His body and bride.
May God lead us on these lines. I am speaking for young christians as much as for others, that God might come down and teach us step by step, leading us on, until we reach that end, and then we shall be luminaries, shining as lights in this world.
{161}
FREEDOM
@John 17:1 - 26
J.T. The remarks ending this chapter are in such a setting as to remind us of how John's ministry contemplates a complete freedom from public religious order. The narrative ending here begins with chapter 13 where John says that it was before the passover without saying how long before. Then he speaks about the supper without saying what supper. He speaks about the Lord rising from supper, as if it was outside of religious customs, so as to set us free to be engaged with what is presented. Earlier the Lord is seen in this gospel as serving before John the baptist was cast into prison, whereas in the other gospels He waited until he was cast into prison, as if observing levitical order; but John would set all that aside, relieving us of any interference from such elements. A divine Person has come in, as the Lord is viewed in this gospel. The Word became flesh. He acts of Himself and Himself precedes everything. John the baptist says, "He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me" (@John 1:15). He has liberty thus to act of Himself, and determines everything. That helps us in our times, as to what He has done. The Lord has done much to set us free, so that we might be able to listen to Him and go in for what He presents to us.
J.H.B. Would the opened door which no man can shut and to which you alluded in your prayer refer to that state of freedom?
J.T. "I have set before thee an opened door" (@Revelation 3:8). That is for us, not that we should assume to be Philadelphia. A door which no man can shut -- it recognises the saints, having not denied His name; He would have us for Himself.
{162}
The Spirit being here, as the Lord says in @John 14, "*He* shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you". The Spirit being here at the present time, we get, in what the Lord said to others in His own way, the forms and applications needed for the moment, circumstances not being exactly the same, because "difficult times shall be there", it says, and these have to be met.
E.C.R. He says, "Be of good courage: I have overcome the world".
P.B. Have you in mind that we learn this freedom in Christ Himself?
J.T. It is a question of the Lord Himself. John refers to Him as no other gospel does. What the Lord says in the end of the gospel, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" (chapter 21:23), is a suggestion of what the ministry is intended for.
A.G. He "will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you". Would that have a wider bearing than the apostles themselves?
J.T. I think so. We have to remember it in the light of the last days. The fact that no allusion to the Lord's supper is made directly, and that there is no word as to what supper it was from which He rose up, would indicate that He is speaking in a setting by itself, ignoring as you might say, what has come about in church history, that is, feasts and days. The Lord can act at any time. That is the idea; it is before the passover. Chapter 12 says six days before, but here (chapter 13:1) it is simply "before" it. He is not regulated by the passover at all.
-- Y. Is it more regulated here by eternal life?
J.T. That enters into it, of course, but it begins by the testimony left here among us to wash one another's feet. That is not simply in view of some particular feast or some preparation for the Lord's supper; it is for having part with Him.
{163}
P.B. Has it a bearing generally or particularly in relation to the Lord's day morning meeting?
J.T. It has a general bearing. I am not thinking of days. "Ye also ought to wash one another's feet". It is in order that there might be a state of love among us. Church privileges and services cannot be held otherwise. It is the *state* in which they are to be held.
C.O.B. If the Lord has shown the way in liberty, He would have us to follow.
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of His example here.
J.H.B. I take it that you have been referring to the whole section, chapters 13 to 17, as having rather a special character.
J.T. That is what I was thinking of. Those chapters begin with an allusion to the passover: "before the feast of the passover". Then it says in verse 2, "And during supper" -- the thing is very informal; the passover is not regulating them.
J.H.B. Do you regard this section of the gospel as having a special bearing on the assembly in its present light?
J.T. Yes. The introduction of the section lifts us out of church festivals and customary religious observances.
Ques. Is it your thought in not being governed by religious customs that we shall be governed by what comes to light in Him?
J.T. That is it. What is He doing? Satan works too, in this section. It says, "The devil having already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon, Iscariote, that he should deliver him up" (verse 2). Satan's activities are taken note of. Satan knows what is going on. He has been occupied with the Lord's wonderful preparation for this period. The Lord has set before us an opened door, and Satan puts it into the heart of someone as in the early days of the revival, so that almost immediately there was an
{164}
attack, showing well enough that the devil was working.
J.H.B. It is a great comfort to know that the Lord has the key of David.
J.A.P. I suppose it is important that the Judas element should not be at the Supper.
J.T. Yes, if you can keep him out. Satan knew he would be there.
J.H.B. What would be the difference in the application of these chapters to the assembly compared with that of the second part of chapter 20?
J.T. There you get the assembly in its persons, not ecclesiastically, not as a body, not as an organism, nor as an organised assembly, but just the persons that form it. Things must be carried through in certain persons: if you have the persons, things will be safe. Jesus came "where the disciples were" (@John 20:19); 'assembled' (as in Authorised Version) should not be there. It is a question of the persons, and how great they are in relation to Him and the Father. The Lord coming in and out among us gives the spiritual side, not the public official side as in 1 Corinthians, where the local assembly is in mind.
H.B. What is the bearing of departing from this world to the Father?
J.T. It bears directly. He is not yet ascended; chapter 20 is as ascending, but this is preparatory to that, to show that He is in relation to this world, though He is going out of it. Current religion is for this world; it is part of this world. It is needed; governments see the need of it, but the Lord would show here that He is going up to the Father, whence He came. He came from God and He went to God.
J.H.B. And His thought is to leave something here according to these chapters in keeping with Himself.
Ques. Would the thought of testimony be in it?
J.T. First He leaves an example in the way of
{165}
love. There is a testimony that we love one another to the extent of serving one another in a most humble way. That is the first great thing we learn in this section.
A.G. Is that why the persons are so often mentioned as disciples in this section?
J.T. Quite so. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves" (@John 13:35). We learn from Him that the great thing is to have love among ourselves. I must contribute to that.
H.L.T. As the day gets weaker and darker, we grow in that which grows strong, in love.
J.T. It is the state of things that enables the Lord to carry on. In chapter 14 we see that if the Spirit is coming, there must be obedience. He says in verse 15, "If ye love me, keep my commandments". The Holy Spirit comes in in that connection.
J.A.P. How is the thought of eternal life connected with what you are saying? The Lord speaks of it in chapter 17:3. Do we enjoy it in any special way in connection with the thought of the assembly?
J.T. I think it is brought in there, as part of what is in His hands administratively. He is going to speak of something more than that. I think the bearing of it is the millennium in this section. "As thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal. And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". It is a part of His administrative position. The Father has given Him authority over *all* flesh. That would work out in the millennial day. Of course it has a bearing in this day; it is worked out earlier in the gospel for us in chapters 3 and 4. @John 3 speaks of it being given to those who believe on the Son, and @John 4 is suggestive of the Spirit as the power to enjoy it. It is brought
{166}
in here to fill out the general administrative position, but *we* are the subjects of His prayer as being connected with the testimony.
W.R.P. Would you say a word as to chapter 16? Chapter 14 begins with love, and goes on to obedience.
J.T. Chapter 14 finishes with "Arise let us go hence". There is a change in the position. Chapter 15 is a setting of fruitfulness for the Father, and chapter 16 is the battlefield. "These things I have spoken unto you that ye may not be offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues; but the hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God". The 16th is the battlefield, with the Spirit here in that relation. In the 15th He is here, but it is the question of fruitfulness.
W.R.P. Would you also say what is the connection between these chapters, 13 to 17?
J.T. Chapter 13 is the assembly, that we should have love among ourselves; chapter 14 is the operation of love in connection with obedience, keeping His commandments as loving Him. The 15th is the vine indicating fruitfulness to the Father; that is another position we occupy. The 16th is the battlefield, the Spirit in that connection bringing demonstration to the world of sin, and of righteousness and of judgment.
W.R.P. In all those four chapters the Lord is speaking more or less to His disciples, but in the 17th He is not speaking to them.
J.T. He is speaking to His Father there, evidently in their hearing.
-- Y. He has something in view greater than what they had before.
J.T. It is that we might know how to say, "Father", and that we might understand the new kind of love, not the love of chapter 13. Of course, that is divine in another sense, but here it is the love wherewith the Father loves. So it qualifies us for
{167}
assembly service, that we might know how to say, "Father", and that we might know the place we have in the circle of divine affection, and the kind of love that belongs to that circle, the love of the Father to the Son.
H.T. The conditions of the first four chapters in this section are necessary to chapter 17.
J.T. Quite so.
P.B. I was wondering whether the four chapters would form the "men" of chapter 17.
J.T. That is where you get the idea of the men.
Ques. Would the desires expressed concerning them, in verses 9 - 21, be in relation to their being maintained here in accordance with these four chapters?
J.T. He says, "I demand concerning them"; but when He comes to having them with Himself, He says, "I desire". The demand shows the urgency with regard to our position here, not demanding that we should be taken out of the world. The urgency is to be here in the testimony.
J.H.B. Would the last verse -- I "will make it known" -- have reference to after His resurrection?
J.T. In verse 6 He says, "I have manifested thy name". That is not quite so deep a thought as "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". Verse 6 is something open, but the making known here is more something known in us. It is inward, not something before your eyes.
E.C.R. Would you say a word about the difference between the covenant love of God and the love in those verses?
J.T. The covenant love is not dealt with in John properly. It is akin to the love of chapter 13, the knowledge of God in Christ and the service that is rendered, as the slave in @Exodus 21. It is that kind
{168}
of love, that has made the love of God effective by dying, which works out in service. It is a perfect love; it is the way the thing affects us publicly here. The love of this chapter is more than that: it is the love of the Father to the Son, which is to be in us. It makes way for Hebrews, the Lord on our side carrying on the service of God.
J.A.P. Is not this beyond Hebrews?
J.T. Hebrews greatly assists us in this. It does not speak of us as sons, nor does it set us in relation to God as His Father and our Father. It is initial, showing how the Lord Himself carries on His service in the midst of the assembly, and how He is such a great Person, Minister of the sanctuary. It assists us as to what is in mind here; He is Minister of the sanctuary: He is in us, on our side.
H.B. "I in them".
J.T. Yes; it is on our side.
-- G. You were speaking of feet-washing having in view part with Him. It mentions that He had come out from God and was going to God. I suppose chapters 14 to 16 would have that in view, the continuation of His pathway, the pathway of the will of God.
J.T. Having come from God -- you might introduce the covenant there. He has come from God and is going back to God, but He is going to the Father too. In His prayer after saying these things He says, "Father". The point is that we might know how to say, "Father".
Ques. Does what you say indicate the importance of the covenant as leading up to this?
J.T. Yes; the covenant's perfect love would set our hearts free. John does not present that here, but only in connection with His coming from and going to God. The feet-washing sets us free. Having part with Him takes us beyond the covenant.
{169}
E.C.R. Is this the highest kind of love a creature could know, in the last verse of @John 17? Do we need to understand the covenant to set us free to move forward on this line?
J.T. We were saying here this morning that in the synoptic gospels you have only a brief account of the Lord's supper. It is *in* Jerusalem, where there is evil all around. Then they sing a hymn, and then they move on. These communications here, especially in His prayer, belong to the mount of Olives. It is the Lord's own link with the Father. He was accustomed to go to the mount of Olives after teaching in the temple all day. They were brought outside Jerusalem to a spiritual realm. The Father's love to the Son belongs to that realm: that is Ephesians.
P.S. "Having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end". Does that contemplate right through to the end, or the end to be reached in chapter 17?
J.T. I think it is more that He loves them through in spite of opposition, whatever may arise. It is the love that never fails.
W.R.P. He was leaving them in Satan's world: He would love them with a love that would see them through.
C.O.B. He proposes in chapter 1 that the two disciples should come and see where He dwelt. In chapter 8 when others went to their own homes, He went to the mount of Olives.
J.T. He says, "Come and see". It is spiritual; He gives them no street nor number. In chapter 8, they all went to their own homes, but Jesus went to the mount of Olives. Luke tells us that at night He went to the mount of Olives (@Luke 21:37). We have to bear that in mind in thinking of Matthew and Mark's version. There *they* went to the mount of Olives. They got the thought; it is not His leading them there: they went.
{170}
C.O.B. How would "Arise, let us go hence", come in?
J.T. That is a change. Satan, the prince of this world, comes. The Lord says, "Arise, let us go hence". I do not suppose they actually moved then. The Lord intimated the change. He goes on. We are so prone to be alarmed when the enemy comes in. In Nehemiah's day, the people were alarmed when there was an attack. The Lord says, "The ruler of the world comes". You could not have anything more alarming; but the Lord goes on to say that He is the true vine. He provides for the enemy's coming.
H.T. Do you connect that with the word 'demand'?
J.T. Yes. It is different from 'beg'. That is used in chapter 14 -- "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter". We have great comfort in that such a One is demanding for us. This matter of Satan is important to notice. Satan will accost us; we can be sure of that. Satan always comes, even with the sons of God (@Job 1:6). But provision is made; we are not to be turned aside.
J.H.B. We go on bearing fruit.
J.T. That is to be attended to. God has to have something.
J.A.P. Where you have the expression, "boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him", is that higher than what we get in Hebrews? Is it a special kind of approach in the light of sonship?
J.T. The approach in Ephesians is stated in the words, "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" (chapter 2:18). That belongs to the assembly proper. Hebrews is approach "by the new and living way", which is more in the light of the covenant. I would like to render that clear. @Hebrews 10 is the consummation of a long course of instruction as to the covenant: "Boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the
{171}
new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water" (@Hebrews 10:19 - 22). The covenant leads up to that. Ephesians is on higher ground than that. It is access through Christ by one Spirit to the Father.
W.R.P. Would you not connect @John 20 with that?
J.T. Yes, I should.
E.C.R. In @John 17 the Lord lifts up His eyes to heaven before He says, "Father". It would indicate the Father's realm.
J.T. "These things Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven". In chapter 11 He lifts up His eyes "on high", but here it is heaven itself, the Father's realm.
J.T.C. We have His glory mentioned on several occasions. There is the glory which, He says, "I have given them" (verse 22) and in verse 24 it says, "that they may behold my glory". Would you give us a little help as to that?
J.T. The first verse is a general side. "Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee". That refers to His exaltation to heaven, and the giving of the Spirit, and the working out of the assembly. That is the general thought. Then there is the administration in connection with the authority of the Father's kingdom as to eternal life, and then the desire to be with the Father, in verse 5. He says, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it; and now glorify *me*, *thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". That is in Deity. It is the greatest thought possible.
{172}
In verse 6 He comes to the men that the Father gave Him. They were intelligent. Then He went on later to say that "the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one; I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me". Then "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". So we have the glory that He shared with the Father, and the glory that the Father gives Him that He can communicate to them, and the glory that they are to behold in connection with the Father's love upon Him.
E.C.R. The glory of verse 5 is incommunicable.
J.T. I should think so.
J.H.B. We do not even expect to see that.
J.T. What we behold is in verse 24.
J.H.B. You said at the beginning you had the assembly before you. How does all this bear on that line?
J.T. Link on the first verse with the last. He lifts up His eyes and says, "Father". It is after He spoke "these words" (chapters 13 - 16), suggesting the culmination. This is what He leads us to, that we might be able to say, "Father". Then there is the love of the Father to the Son, what is proper to the assembly, not simply covenant love but the kind of love that is between the Persons themselves. I think it is a great thing to see that there is something beyond covenant love, something between the Persons themselves that we are brought into.
W.H. What is the meaning of "Righteous Father"?
{173}
J.T. That is over against the world. In this chapter, there is "Father", "Holy Father", and "Righteous Father". "Righteous Father" is over against the world, as He says, "The world has not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me".
J.A.P. "I in them" is a matter of affection.
J.T. As in their hearts in that way, He has room to come in in service.
C.O.B. What is the setting of "Holy Father"?
J.T. Sanctification, I suppose. "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we". Then He goes on to say in verse 16, "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world. Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world; and I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth". It is a sanctified company.
C.O.B. Would it stand against the son of perdition? You get the world against "Righteous Father" and the son of perdition against "Holy Father".
J.T. There is not much distinction between the two thoughts. The idea in "Holy Father" is that there is to be a sanctified company to enter into the service of the assembly, in spite of conditions externally. The full result is indicated in @Ephesians 3.
J.H.B. What do you refer to in Ephesians?
J.T. Glory to God "in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages" (verse 21). That is a service carried on in *suitable* conditions.
E.C.R. What is the difference between "sanctified by truth" -- "Thy word is truth" -- and "I sanctify myself for them"?
J.T. "Sanctify myself for them" is His present place on high. It alludes to His setting Himself apart for us.
{174}
W.R.P. Do you think the service of the assembly goes more on the line of family relationship if you bring it into Ephesians as drawing near to the Father?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. Covenant relationship would not carry us so far.
J.T. That goes on to Israel. Just another word on the question of being sanctified by truth: "Thy word is truth". It is the Father's word that comes into our souls. Then it says, "As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world; and I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth". First it is "Thy word"; here it is by truth in general.
M.W. Referring to verse 24, do we understand that that privilege is open to us now, the Lord's desire that we may be with Him where He is?
J.T. I think it is future properly to be with Him where He is. It is not that we should behold the Lord, but be with Him where He is. The great place that truth has in chapter 17 should be well marked: sanctified by truth, first by the Father's word, and then by truth in relation to the position of Christ as sanctifying Himself on our account.
-- G. Would that mean that the assembly's position on earth would be in moral accord with His position on high?
J.T. That is His desire. The truth as to Christ's present place in view of the testimony here and the Spirit having come, is a great point.
E.C.R. Does it involve the present communications of the Spirit at all?
J.T. The Lord differentiates between what He says, and what the Father says.
{175}
COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE LORD
@John 13:1 - 17
J.T. This scripture is perhaps more familiar to us than most. It should be read in view of its being the introduction of extended communications from the Lord on the eve of His death, and it is introductory to the service of God which was on the Lord's mind as He was about to die. His people should understand the desire of the Father, and enter into the service of God intelligently and in love to one another. One matter of importance in this chapter is the evident intent to lift the saints out of the ordinary religious settings and customs; so it has a peculiar application to this country because of the special observance of religious days and customs.
I think the Spirit made the allusion to the passover here to denote what is in view -- what the Lord was going to say or do. We do not read, "When the hour was come" here, as in @Luke 22:14; it reads, "Now before the feast of the passover", without saying how long before. In chapter 12 it says, "Six days before", and in @Matthew 26 "after two days". In Matthew and in the other synoptic gospels the feast of the passover has a place -- the Lord was still recognising the old economy, but not so in John. There it says, "Now before the feast of the passover"; then the supper is mentioned in @John 13:2, without naming what supper it was. Verse 2 which says in the Authorised Version "Supper being ended" should read "during supper". What gave this supper such importance was that the Lord was partaking of it. No doubt it was the passover, but that is not the point; it was the supper He partook of with His own. The persons present were greater than what they partook of; this greatness was from
{176}
Him. That is, I think, how matters stood in these last days. Would that be the thought?
C.A.C. The important thing here would be the communications, would it not?
J.T. That is what I thought we might see. There are no more important communications than those in these chapters 13 to 17, leading up to the Lord's prayer in the last of the chapters in which He says, "Father". "These things Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father"; in this He was thinking of us; He was thinking of His immediate disciples, but also of us at this very meeting today. The Lord prayed for all who should believe on Him through their word; that makes it living and applicable to ourselves. In that prayer the Lord speaks of love, the greatest love, the love of the Father for the Son. "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them" (chapter 17:26). That places the saints in a wonderful setting, qualified to have part in the heavenly things, because this realm of love is of the highest order. As the Father loves the Son, that love is in us, and the Son is in us. He is in us on our side, ministering to us that kind of love.
C.A.C. In what sense is that love to be in us?
J.T. The love we shall enjoy in heaven is already in the assembly viewed as on heavenly ground. The covenant love in the Lord's supper applies to us more as here in the wilderness; the Lord's supper was instituted and eaten at Jerusalem, that is, where there is evil; the enemy's power was there; whereas after the Lord had given the emblems to them and told them what the cup meant, the bringing in of the covenant seems to set them free. They sang a hymn in Jerusalem, and then they went to the mount of Olives. I think that synchronises with chapter 17 as the spot to which the Lord always resorted while in Jerusalem. In the day time He was in the temple teaching, at night He went to the mount of Olives.
{177}
Obviously that was His retreat, where He was with His Father; the love He enjoyed there would be the Father's love. In chapter 17:26 He says, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". They move to the mount of Olives; that is what they came to spiritually.
L.M. What is the import of "I in them"? After bringing before them such love as the Father's love, it is to be in them. Is that the thought?
J.T. It is John's way of supporting @Hebrews 2:12, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises". John supports that in this way. The Lord's service to us is to make known the Father's name. The Father's love is in us; hence Christ is in us in the sense of having a place in our hearts. As having that love there He is in us; He is on our side, so He is free to move in the service of God. Is that your thought?
C.A.C. That would be a very affectionate setting?
J.T. It seems to me that the understanding of this would practically help us as to assembly service as found in Ephesians. God has one great thought; we begin locally and end, in a spiritual sense, universally. That is, the assembly having that kind of love that the Father has for Christ, we are available to Him as He is in us, to conduct us in that service to His Father.
E.J.F. Will that love go on when the dispensation is past?
J.T. That is manifest. We are possessed with love that belongs to the most exalted thought of love, the Father's love to the Son.
L.M. Is it your thought that Christ being in us here in assembly character, that is the way in which the Father gets an answer?
J.T. The hymn they sang in Jerusalem is not said to have been sung by the Lord, it is not said that He
{178}
even had part in it, though no doubt He did sing it. It would be in the light of the covenant; He said much to them, especially according to Matthew, about the covenant. But when they had sung a hymn they moved to the mount of Olives. In this movement He had not specially in view our side, the mount of Olives was *His own* place, it was the place to which He resorted.
Ques. What is the service of God, and what is our position in regard to it?
J.T. That is what I thought we might come to in chapter 17. Chapter 13 is introductory; it is the service of Christ to relieve us of all that might hinder us taking that place. It is the last use of the water of purification in this gospel; we have it in chapters 2, 3 and 9. Chapter 9 is crucial; the washing takes us off the ground even of Christ's position as here in flesh. He was Son of God here, of course, but in resurrection He was marked off as Son of God. He laid down the condition He had taken up, never to take it up again, and He took up another condition. Chapter 9 takes us off the ground on which He was in the condition of flesh and blood. The blind man was secured by the Lord as cast out of the synagogue. The Lord says to him, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage" (@John 9: 35 - 38). That means that, in principle, he was off the ground of the world where Christ was according to flesh. What I had in mind was the fact that Christ had to die, but not on His own account, death was never imposed upon Him; it was His own act but a necessary act if we were to have part with Him. That condition had to be laid down, not only was atonement accomplished, but that condition was laid down, that He
{179}
might enter into another condition. Chapter 9 means an exit from the world, for though God was more or less complacent because Christ was in it, it had become manifest that He must terminate that condition; faith follows that. The blind man follows, he worships the Son of God on that other ground. The Lord then proceeds to speak about the flock, in view of this section.
L.M. I should like to go back for a moment to "I in them". Is that similar to Paul's prayer in @Ephesians 3, that the Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith?
J.T. Christ, as the term applies to Him in @Ephesians 3, is in heaven, it is by faith. The position is apprehended in our souls, Christ dwells in our souls on the principle of faith. @John 17 would support that, but the element of faith is not the point there. The point is that the Lord has made the Father so known, His love is in us, and Christ is in us in consequence as the Object of our affections.
L.M. Is that something more than faith?
J.T. It is something in us by the Lord's action in making the Father known. Chapter 17:6 says, "I have manifested thy name"; the last verse of the same chapter says, "I have made known to them thy name"; that is a deeper thing, the service of Christ is of a deeper nature. I should like to know if we are following what I have spoken of as to chapter 9 -- for many say, What a wonderful time it must have been for those who were with Jesus when He was down here in the flesh. It *was* a wonderful time, but it was not as wonderful a time as this.
L.M. We have not laid hold of it so that we can take account of Him as Son of God?
J.T. He is in a new condition, and that describes what we shall be: "We shall be like him for we shall see him as he is", not as He was, but as He *is*.
E.J.F. According to @Romans 1 His resurrection
{180}
was the attestation to what He was as Son of God. That was God's attestation of Him. Is that how it is stated?
J.T. That is how believers come into it. Peter had a revelation, and Paul had a revelation in regard of the Son, but what is presented in the gospel is neither Peter's revelation nor Paul's, but Christ "marked out Son of God in power, according to the spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1:4). That is the public testimony that believers come into.
E.J.F. I brought this point up in a reading and it was thought that He was proved to be Son of God by the resurrection of Lazarus, and that that was what was referred to in Romans.
J.T. It is plural, "resurrection of the dead", but it is His own resurrection as much as others. His own is the greatest witness, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (@John 2:19). After He was risen from the dead the disciples understood that, and other Scriptures as well. What believers need to understand is not simply that that Person is the Son of God, but that there is power with Him. We need that power, not as an historical fact, but as it is presented in the gospels.
C.A.C. What relation has feet-washing to all this?
J.T. I thought it was an introductory service of the Lord, a most touching service, and incidentally indicating how great a necessity these chapters are if we are to have part with Him. Chapter 9 must be understood in order to understand this last application of the idea of purification, the feet-washing. It is to take us on to new ground.
C. Would you say that what you are referring to in chapter 9 is parallel to the truth of new creation?
J.T. Yes. That is how it stands in @2 Corinthians 5. The chapter helps us in regard to @John 9: the apostle
{181}
says, "So that *we* henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer. So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation" (@2 Corinthians 5:16,17).
C.A.C. The washing all over of chapter 13 would be seen in figure in chapter 9, would it?
J.T. I think that is right.
C.A.C. I should like to be more clear as to how the feet-washing stands in relation to that in a practical way with us.
J.T. I think if the truth of chapter 9 is understood, the bearing of chapter 13 is clear. The thought of defilement is not mentioned in chapter 13, not that I would exclude it, but it is a more spiritual thought than mere washing to remove defilement. It has often been pointed out that the persons -- the disciples -- were ceremonially clean. We assume it was the Supper here, and undoubtedly it was, therefore they would be ceremonially clean. If that be so the point would be to transfer them on to new ground; what had been legally right before, was not great enough now. It says in chapter 13:3, "Jesus, knowing ... that he came out from God and was going to God"; the Lord was going out of the world and going to the Father. How did He go to God? Through death, and that death implies a change of ground; He was no longer on old ground and we are to join Him on new ground; it is not Christ here in this world, however wonderful He was, but Christ in another condition in another world. We are to apprehend Him thus, and have part with Him thus.
C.A.C. Is feet-washing a continuous service in view of the maintenance of that?
J.T. That is the moral value of it for us if we are to have part with Him on new ground where He is. What is He doing? What is He occupied with? Chapters 14 to 17 disclose much to us; we can
{182}
understand what we are to be engaged with. He wants us with Him and if we are to be with Him it is a necessity that we learn how to get on to new ground.
H. In doing this for each other they were to help each other?
J.T. If we are to help each other in that way, we ought to learn the importance of the water of purification in John. It has a great place in John, he tells us that it comes from the side of Christ; he speaks of it in chapters 2, 3, 9 and 13, and also in his epistle. If we are to be of service to one another we must understand these washings, the use of the water of purification in this gospel. I do not believe that many of us understand the new position -- not that I am saying that I understand it -- but I see that it is greater than what Christ was here, that is the heavenly order of things. How many of us have enquired as to the anointing of the blind man by the Lord in chapter 9? Why should the clay that the Lord made have to be washed off? *That* was not impure.
C.A.C. I think that throws great light upon it. The man had to be washed from that which really typified Christ after the flesh, not from something wrong in himself, nor from a defect in the eye, but from the ointment of mud put upon it.
J.T. That is what brethren ought to look into and see whether they understand. The Lord expressly says, "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents". Having said that He goes on to make ointment with clay from His own spittle. You might say it was holy, coming from the Lord; why should that have to be washed off? Every christian should understand that, and answer in his soul why that should be washed off.
C.A.C. This does not belittle the greatness of the incarnation at all.
{183}
J.T. I think the incarnation was necessary to carry out the counsels of God.
E.J.F. The condition only was changed?
J.T. The Lord did not change as to His Person, but as to the condition He took up; John tells us that He came by water and blood, that means that He had in mind to effect cleansing; the higher service of the water would be the removal of this mud that He made; it has to be understood. The man's eyes open to see a Man in another condition, yet the same Person, "Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee". It points to another condition.
T. Would the transfiguration on the mount go as far as what you are saying?
J.T. The Lord was transfigured on the mount: what does it mean? It says, "As he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white and effulgent" (@Luke 9:29), that points to another condition, what He has entered on now. That condition is to describe ours, "As he is, so are we" (@1 John 4:17).
L.M. Is it similar to what the Lord said to Mary, "Touch me not"? He wished her to get clear of the old condition and be brought into the new condition.
J.T. Not only that, but He had not then ascended to His Father. His ascension has to be noted, though it does not appear in this chapter. In chapter 20 the ascension brings out the exalted nature of the new relationship. Sonship applies to Him in incarnation as much as now. The Father's voice was, "*This* is my beloved Son". "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God" (@Luke 1:35). He was the Son then, as much as now.
H. Does that include what we are now speaking of?
J.T. I think it does, "We know that the Son of God has come" includes what we are speaking of.
{184}
Ques. Is it the same thing as the second Man out of heaven?
J.T. It is more the thought of the last Adam, the last Adam is a quickening spirit. The idea of Christ's sonship links on with deity, as in incarnation the idea of sonship suggests that He is God; John brings that out. The second Man is out of heaven, that is the idea of *the kind of manhood*; it is not of the earth, it is of heaven. The difference between the last Adam and the second Man is, the last Adam is more on God's side, the second Man is on our side, but still the thought of sonship is carried on to our side too. Primarily the thought of sonship denotes that the Lord is on God's side, and great enough to represent God, but the thought is also carried on to our side, but not in John. In John's gospel he never calls us sons, he calls us children. Paul brings out the subject of sonship on our side, but sonship on God's side is mainly in John.
C.A.C. What you said about His being called Son of God is very important; it involves that He is a divine Person.
J.T. That is never applied to us. John makes that quite clear.
C.A.C. The Lord's sonship is unique as involving deity.
J.T. Paul takes up the application to us on the ground of revelation. "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me" (@Galatians 1:15,16). He develops sonship as applicable to us.
E.J.F. Paul helped in that way. Was the fact that he had not known the Lord after the flesh an advantage in connection with his ministry?
J.T. God was pleased to use a man like that. I do not suppose he knew the Lord after the flesh; he was taken up after the testimony of the gospel was presented. That is what marks him; he announced Jesus as the Son of God.
{185}
L.M. Would you mind saying a little about chapter 14:20, "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you"? Would that be consequent on feet-washing as well?
J.T. "That day" would be the Spirit's day. "I am in my Father" would mean that He was in the Father's affections, and we are in His affections. We are in Him and He is in our affections in that day; that is the present time; we know the blessedness of that now.
T. Would chapter 13 not be to remove defilement?
J.T. I remarked that I would not exclude defilement from feet-washing, but I mentioned that the disciples were ceremonially clean at that time. They were sitting with the Lord at table, and He said, as it were, 'This is not good enough, our present setting is not good enough, there is something beyond it. You need this service to enter on that'. That is the new ground that the succeeding chapters open up to us. He leaves after having said these things. Chapter 17 opens with, "These things Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father". I think He would lead us on to that ground that He was on in saying, "Father".
C. Would not the significant thought in feet-washing be love, He would bring us to be at home in the conditions of love?
J.T. I feel that if the Lord does it, it is final. He has left us an example to do it.
C. What I had in mind was that we think of it as a customary thing, and hence we do not see the beautiful setting of it.
J.T. Why did it not happen before they sat down? The Lord "rises from supper". It was wonderful to sit down with Jesus in chapter 12, but there is not a word about feet-washing there. Now He sits down at supper in chapter 13; what a wonderful supper it was because the Lord of glory was there! But still
{186}
that was not just what He had in mind, it does not go far enough, there was something beyond it. He rises from supper; they were already there at the table at supper.
C. Does that act on His part link on with what was said about Him?
J.T. It links with what He was about to say in the succeeding chapters; not what He had said, but what He was about to say. This links on from chapter 12; He made no provision for them before sitting down, but while supper was proceeding He did this. What had He in mind? Something different.
Ques. The Lord interrupts what they had been enjoying hitherto?
J.T. The Lord would say, 'You have had a good meeting, but there is something more'. We are too easily satisfied; our understanding is not much as to what there is, but there is something more.
Ques. Did He want them to rise with Him?
J.T. No. In view of the new dispensation coming in they had to learn that there is something greater than what they had. Let us not be satisfied with what we have got, there is something beyond this. The Lord was sitting down in His robes, then He rises from supper, and lays aside His garments, and does this, then He sits down again after having taken His garments and tells them what He has done, and adds, 'Now you are to wash one another's feet'. He corrects Peter, He said, 'If I do not wash you, you can have no part with Me'. Peter might have replied, 'I am sitting in the meeting, and have had part with Him already!'. But the Lord meant something else. In chapter 17 we read, "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them", that is the most exalted kind of love, but that was not said as to what they were going on with in chapter 13. There is no question about their fitness
{187}
for the place, but in the midst of the meal this question is brought in. Why? That is what often happens in the midst of our meetings, when we come together for the Lord's supper. In the middle a movement arises of something greater, something beyond us.
Ques. Would feet-washing correspond with the mount of Olives?
J.T. It would synchronise with it. The mount of Olives according to Luke and John was His retreat. In the day He was in the temple and at night He went to the mount of Olives. The spiritual meaning obviously is that that was His place alone, but He said, 'I do not want to be here alone', "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone" (@John 12:24). The movement to the mount of Olives means that we are moving to *His* place as Son; feet-washing is necessary for that.
C.A.C. Would you connect all this with the service of God? I think many of us have looked at these chapters more in the light of privilege. Would you distinguish between privilege and service or would you blend them?
J.T. I should blend them. In the chapters which follow the Lord has in mind to lead us to His own place. He says, "Father", then He goes on to say, "This is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou host sent ... And now glorify *me*, *thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". Verse 3 gives us the great general position, and verse 5 brings us on to a new line. It is a wonderful thing to bring that in there; it is no question of administration, it is His own thoughts that are recorded.
C.A.C. Have you in mind that it is in service on this line that we minister to the pleasure of God the Father?
J.T. Exactly.
{188}
C.A.C. In speaking of privilege we think of what we come into, our gain and joy. If we introduce the thought of service, I understood that you had in your mind that there should be that which should minister to the divine pleasure.
J.T. That is what I thought we might see in the Lord's lifting His eyes to heaven; He looked upward to the Father and said, "Father". John does not lead us to the thought of Abba, Father, but the Lord said, "Father"; evidently that was heard; then He sets out the administrative position, He says He would like to be glorified. The next thing is, "I have manifested thy name to the men". Now He comes down to us, He says, "Holy Father", that has to do with His disciples and us; then He leads on in a most wonderful way to "Holy Father", "Righteous Father". Next He speaks about our being sanctified as He is sanctified (verse 19). He ends up with not only that He manifested the Father's name to the men, but He made it known to the end that the kind of love that He knew so well and enjoyed on the mount of Olives -- *that* love should be in us and He in us. When we reach that point we are ready for the service of God, He has a free hand now. He leads us to the Father; that is what you get in @John 17.
Ques. Would you tell us what "part with me" is?
J.T. In this way we have been speaking of, it involves new ground. What I think is so sorrowful is that the brethren (I do not want to blame) are not following on this line, they are not attentive to what the Lord is bringing to their attention. We want to get on to new ground, the ground of the mount of Olives; that is His place, His retreat. The disciples went there, He did not lead them there, they went there. On the mount of Olives His leading begins.
E.J.F. Is the movement in faith?
J.T. Faith must be present with us. As soon as
{189}
you hear a person saying Father, or Abba, Father, in the power of the Spirit of adoption, then you are on the mount of Olives, the Holy Spirit moves there. Faith sees the position and takes the place in the power of the Spirit.
C.A.C. The one who says Abba, Father, or Father, must be equal to it, would you say?
J.T. He says it by the Holy Spirit, "a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father" (@Romans 8:15).
C.A.C. It is worthily said.
J.T. Yes, you feel there is power in it. We are ready to move now, they moved to the mount of Olives. If somebody says, Abba, Father, in the Spirit of adoption, we do not want to go back to Jerusalem again, we do not want to go back where we came from. The Lord's supper was celebrated in Jerusalem, and that is where He died. The mount of Olives is another place, we want to get into that living realm in the Spirit of adoption, that leads on to the service of God.
T. Is verse 24, "Where I am they also may be with me", the thought?
J.T. That gives you warrant for taking ground with Him. It is His thought that you should be with Him; that is literally future, but it gives you warrant for taking heavenly ground. It is the Lord's mind for you, @Ephesians 2 is the same thing, He "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together". The movement to the mount of Olives leads to that -- the saints being together on heavenly ground. The Holy Spirit says, Abba, Father; that is the ground to keep on, and we should not go back to hymns addressed to the Lord in relation to the position in Jerusalem.
Ques. What is the meaning of the last clause of chapter 14, "Rise up, let us go hence"?
J.T. It means a changed position. Chapter 15 is based on the public position of fruit-bearing.
{190}
C.A.C. Would you say a word as to the difference there may be between the knowledge of the Father's name as spoken of at the end of the Lord's prayer in chapter 17, and the knowledge of the Father according to the sermon on the mount?
J.T. In the sermon on the mount it is "Our Father which art in heaven".
C.A.C. Do not many believers know something of the Father in that sense?
J.T. They do, and are content to leave it that way. It is very blessed to know He cares for us, but what we are speaking of is not simply that He is our Father in heaven, but that *we* are there too.
C.A.C. I thought it was important to distinguish between the two, because so many use the term Father, and even the words 'Abba, Father', but you find that they use these terms in relation to God's fatherly care over them in their circumstances down here. That is not what you had in your mind?
J.T. What I think helps is the Son's place. What was His place? The mount of Olives; He went there. You never find Him at Jerusalem at night. One said to Him, "Where abidest Thou?". He replied, "Come and see". (@John 1:38,39) We have to come and see where He dwells.
C. "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known". Is that a continuous service of Christ?
J.T. He alludes to chapter 20. It is not that there is anything more now than there was, the full thought is already out, the full revelation of the Name is out, but we are brought into it. The service of the Spirit is to maintain us in that; it may be continuous in that sense.
Ques. Would you link our coming together with the words, "I have declared unto them thy name"?
J.T. It must be borne in mind that this is something new.
{191}
H. When we come together on Lord's day morning are there not three aspects of love that engage us in divine order? The love of Christ, the love of God in the new covenant, and the Father's love?
J.T. Exactly. The love of Christ for the church, the covenant love of God for His people -- it was not made with us, it was made with the house of Israel and Judah, nevertheless we come into it -- then the Father's love wherewith He loved the Son, that is in us too. This latter is evidently the most exalted form and brings us to heavenly ground, and makes us equal to heavenly ground.
{192}
THE END AND THE BEGINNING OF THE DISPENSATION
@Exodus 4:10 - 16,22,23; @Malachi 3:16,17; @Malachi 4:4
I have had it in mind to speak of the correspondence between the end of the dispensation of God, and the beginning of it. I think doubtless that has been before many of us in many ways, but the Lord will, I believe, help us as to it afresh, so that we may see, and expect, that the end of this great dispensation may be or will be according to the beginning, not perhaps in volume or quantity, but in quality.
The Lord in His final announcement in Revelation has this in mind, He refers to Himself as "the root and offspring of David" (@Revelation 22:16). David represents what is best and most excellent, at least typically and, in a sense, in substance, so that in the announcement of Himself under that head, as the root and offspring of David, the Lord has in mind what David represents. He represents what is best and most refined in the Old Testament, and the Lord Jesus is the antitype of that; He embodies it all as the root of David; He is the Author of everything that is of God. But for the moment I am speaking of what is most refined and excellent, as we have in @Philippians 1:10, that the saints "may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent". My remarks will be bound up with the thought of speaking, and with the idea of sonship. When I say speaking, I mean speaking as God has it in His mind. What is best, is bound up in speaking and in sonship. Now Luke deals with this subject peculiarly in his gospel, and indeed in the Acts as well; he has in mind to present the thought of speaking in its most excellent character. He presents the Lord, as you know, in His own town, Nazareth, standing up in the synagogue, and he calls
{193}
attention among other things to His speaking, the words of grace which were proceeding from His mouth. The passage does not involve anything final, but what was begun. The Lord presents the passage He read in that way -- "He began to say". We may notice first, His beginning; second, the manner of His speaking; third, the words coming out of His mouth. Nothing could exceed in attractiveness those words, not only the words themselves, but the words as coming out of His mouth, the words of grace. Luke takes up the thought, and John pursues it; and we find it in its most exalted character in the two men who appeared in the Mount: we are told they appeared in glory (@Luke 9:31). They were called "men" first, before we have their names mentioned. They represent the heavenly family; we all belong to it, dear friends; let us take it to our hearts that we belong to the family represented in these two men. Luke says that two men appeared in glory to the disciples, it is not necessarily the glory of Jesus there, nor the glory of the Father, but they appeared *in glory*. These men were talking with Jesus, the most exalted Person, the greatest Person, and the Jesus that was transfigured. "The fashion of his countenance became different". It was that Jesus; there was not any change in His Person, but in His condition and in place; it is heaven, we might say. They spoke with Jesus, talked with Jesus, what men they were! But they are said to be men. "Two men ... appearing in glory". Think of belonging to the heavenly! "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly" (@1 Corinthians 15:48). Here are two men speaking with Jesus, talking with Jesus; what are they speaking about? They are speaking of the greatest Person and the greatest thing possible, beloved brethren, that is His death; they were able to do it, and they were doing it as it should be done. Therein, beloved, they prove that
{194}
they are equal to it; as appearing in glory they are able to speak with the greatest Person about the greatest thing possible. That is how Luke presents to us the idea which the Spirit of God would keep in our minds, that we should be prepared for this great calling; that we might enter in some measure into this holy converse with Jesus and with one another as well. That is what I had in mind, that the end should be equal to the beginning. There must be the acquirement of prepared speaking; it is not only *what* we say but *how* we say it.
I took up this chapter in Exodus because it brings out and combines these two thoughts. The first is the question of speaking, and the second of sonship. Moses, as is said of him by Stephen, "was mighty in his words and deeds" (@Acts 7:22) as a prince in Egypt. He would be educated and conversant with all the wisdom of the Egyptians. Doubtless he could make a good speech; he was a man who could do things and say things. This may be the case with many of us here, we may have been educated on these lines; but what I have in mind, dear brethren, is something more than this. The subjects which befitted the court of Pharaoh and this world are not subjects which would fit in heaven, so Moses had to be brought very low. He says to Jehovah, I am heavy, I cannot speak; "I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue". One has a little sympathy with him although he went so far in his self-abnegation that Jehovah got angry with him, and one does not want that! We may think it is simply a matter of a humble-minded brother, but he may by his false humility cause divine anger. We do not want to hesitate in the service of God, or excuse ourselves because we cannot speak, and remain silent all our lives. The assembly is not a place for silent people, it is a place to learn to be silent and to learn to speak. For there is a time to speak, and if we are not able to speak when it is the time for
{195}
speaking, we may arouse divine anger. That that is a matter to be avoided, I need not say. God says, "Who gave man a mouth?". It seems that God loves the thought of a mouth; He says, "Have not I, Jehovah?". One of the greatest things that God has made is man's vocal power, including his mouth. God says that He makes blind people, and seeing people; He gives men mouths, and He gives them so that they should be used, and used according to the perfect Model, even the mouth of the Son of God, the divine Person who spoke to Moses here. He is the Person who spoke in the synagogue of Nazareth, did not He show there what man's mouth is? His mouth was most sweet, there is no Model like Him, He is a model -- an example -- for us. The Holy Spirit would make our mouths like that mouth, and make our hearts like His heart, so that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth might speak.
  What I want to bring to your attention is the place that this thought has with Levi. Levi refers to what is accurate, what is right, and what is according to order. Levi is not head, he does not represent headship, David does. Levi represents what is accurate; you get that in Malachi; it is very remarkable that he is brought into Malachi. You get Jacob, Edom, and Levi in Malachi; they are great features in this book. I want to show you, dear brethren, how God brings in this thought of speaking, so that it might be understood, why it is a great point with Him. He would have Moses speak, and Moses *did* speak, probably more than Aaron; no one is a more excellent speaker than Moses; no one had such aptitude in learning how to speak according to God; hence he is one of those who appear in glory speaking with Jesus. Were we to go over the typical books and count the number of times in which it says, "Jehovah spoke to Moses" we should be impressed. What an opportunity
{196}
to learn God gave him, and He brings him to it. "I will be with thy mouth", let us take that to heart and not be too slow in the assembly. We do not want to be forward, but we do not want to be behind. God says, "I will be with thy mouth". In @Exodus 4 Moses is not equal to it, and God says, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?". I speak of this because it brings in Levi. God knew all about these two brothers, He knows all about brothers, whether near in the flesh, or local in our meetings, God takes special account of them, especially if they are near of age. God watches them because the enemy is watching them too. The enemy watches because he knows that two brothers may irritate each other; God knows the irritating qualities as well, but they are qualities to be overcome. God says, I know Aaron. He knew both. I suppose that Moses was the most interesting man to heaven upon earth at that time, and I suppose that Aaron was the next. Aaron was three years older than Moses; he was about eighty-three at this time, and Moses was about eighty. God was going to put these two brothers together; they had been separated. Moses had had a history. He had been in the court of Pharaoh for forty years and had been in the wilderness for forty years; we are not told where else he was, but that is enough. God knows where you have been. He watches over the history of brothers and sisters. Miriam was there too, no doubt under the guidance of mother or father; that is not told us, but God does give us a life picture and history of both Moses and Aaron. Of Aaron, God says, "I know that he can speak well". He was not a public man, but he was potentially a public man in God's eye. It is what you are in secret that God takes notice of.
What I am speaking of now particularly is speaking powers: Aaron was a man who could speak. God may have heard him in his addresses to the Jews in
{197}
their affliction in Egypt, but I do not think that God was alluding to that. I think that Aaron may have spoken to his suffering brethren, but when God said, "I know that he can speak well", *He* had heard it, and no doubt He had heard it in his levitical capacity for He calls him "Aaron the Levite". Aaron represents the idea of the Levite in Scripture. The history of Levi later is associated with what Aaron was in this chapter; he is "the Levite", that is the man that God brings forward. He is going to be a yoke-fellow with his younger brother, yet his younger brother is put before him in spite of Aaron speaking well. God says, "Thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth ... and he shall speak for thee unto the people". Now I believe, dear brethren, that from this point onwards the idea of speaking is pursued unvaryingly by the Spirit of God. It appears in David in @1 Samuel 16:18; it is not so much that he spoke well, but it says that he was "skilled in speech"; that would mean that God helped him with his mouth. No one can be skilled in speech in the view of the Spirit of God save a man with whose mouth God is. Christ is in mind here and, as I said before, the thought appears in the book of Malachi where the Levite is brought forward. If you look at chapter 2:4 - 6, it says, "That my covenant might be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts ... The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips". Then in the same chapter, verse 7, "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts". You see there, dear brethren, how this thought is pursued, how the Levite appears in the last days of the dispensation. It says, "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips". God can revert to that as He would today. He reverts to what was, so that what was might be *now*. It is not impossible;
{198}
let us not assume that any of these things are impossible. In @Revelation 1:8 it says, "He who is, and who was, and who is to come". What was, may be brought into the present for the simple reason that the Spirit of God remains here. In @John 14 the Lord tells His disciples of the coming of the Comforter: in verse 26 He says, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, *he* shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you". The Spirit is here, dear brethren; He is the guarantee, if we seek it, for the bringing forward of what "was".
"The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. For the priest's lips should keep knowledge". I desire that this should be particularly before us, to show that God is pursuing the same line from the days of Aaron the Levite. God had the thought and He brought it out before Aaron; He anticipated Exodus. It is very interesting to look at Genesis comparatively with Exodus; Genesis is a free time, and represents a free state of things, in which the work of God shows itself. It is capable of showing itself and giving an account of itself. You have a number of people presented in that book in regard of this subject.
First I would mention the fact that Jehovah spoke with Abraham as a man speaks with his friend; what speaking that must have been! God says to Abram, "It is I", as much as to say, I am a person, and you are a person, and I will speak to you. He proceeds to speak to him, but then it says, "He left off talking with him". How one would love to know just what God said! What the gesture might have been -- what the spiritual movement might have been! As breaking off the conversation, He went to heaven,
{199}
but He came back again and spoke and finished His word and He "went away when he had ended speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place" (@Genesis 18:33).
Then again, Jehovah came to Jacob. In @Genesis 28 Jehovah was in heaven and Jacob was on earth, but in chapter 35 Jacob comes back to Bethel after a long detour, and God comes to speak to him. In the assembly God comes down to us, so that we might learn what is the heavenly side. We do not go to heaven in an unsuited state but as able to take our place there. The assembly is heaven come down in a certain sense; it elevates us so that we know what the order of heaven is, and the wealth that belongs to heaven, and we move in that. That is what is involved; so Jehovah comes down and speaks with Jacob in Bethel. Jacob sets up a pillar in the place where Jehovah stood by him, speaking with him. Jacob was sensible that God was pleased with him; God's eyes are on every one of us, He is interested in us before we are converted, but how different to be sensible that God is pleased with me! That is the sense that Jacob had; so he sets up a pillar, anoints it and pours a drink-offering on it; that means that he was sensible that God was pleased with him. It is as if, speaking reverently, the affections of God were stimulated by such a man as Jacob.
Let us apply that to Christ, what a stimulation to the heart of God was Christ here: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (@Matthew 3:17); I have found it. It does not say there, 'In whom I have found *all* my delight', because God had in mind that we were to be brought into that, He has found His delight in us in relation to Christ. Jacob discerned that he pleased God; and if I come into the presence of God I can know that He is pleased to see me, that He is moved by it. Think of it, that the blessed God Himself is moved by the
{200}
presence of a saint such as Jacob! That is what heaven will be. Think of @Luke 15! It is a chapter of buoyancy; the shepherd rejoiced, and he called his friends and neighbours to rejoice with him; the woman rejoiced, and she called her friends and neighbours to rejoice with her; the Father says, It was meet that we should make merry and rejoice because of the return of the prodigal. That is what God is leading on to, to bring us to the sense of His pleasure in us.
Well, dear brethren, as I have said, there is ability in speaking right through Malachi; in chapter 2 as we have seen, and then in chapter 3:16 it says, "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another". Who are they? They belonged to the tribe of Levi; that is the idea. There are rebellious words all round us against God and Christ, but God gets something from the true tribe of Levi, the law of truth is in their mouths. Think of that, dear brethren, "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another"; that is what Levi was. It says of Levi in @Malachi 2:5, "My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear". So now in these days amongst many who are rebellious there is a true people, those who fear the Lord and in whose mouth is the law of truth -- the true Levi. What are they doing? It is no question of oratory, "they spoke often one to another" -- they spoke *often*. How can we stay away from one another, dear brethren? I do not understand a christian who stays away from his brethren; if truly a christian with love in his heart, how does he get on, how does he breathe? Those who fear the Lord do not do that, they speak often one to another, and the Lord hearkens and hears them. The Lord listens in, so to speak, to a company of His people. Think of God turning His ear to hear! That is how God comes down to us. "Shall he who
{201}
made the ear not hear?". That is how God comes to us. He has an ear, and He notes what He hears. It has to be enjoyed in a godly and living way.
So we have the true Levi as represented in Aaron, and we have the son which Jehovah had in His mind when He sent Moses to Pharaoh to say, "Let my son go". That is what God had in His mind at the beginning, and it is in His heart now. According to Malachi they could speak well. Can you think that these dear people speaking together would speak things God could not approve of? Were we to learn with God this lesson, we should perhaps check our speaking sometimes, for He *does* listen. Here they spoke often one to another; we are not told what they said; we leave that with God, but God hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him. You may be sure that it was good speaking. God hearkened to these dear people and a book of remembrance was made before Him, and He says, "They shall be unto me a peculiar treasure ... in the day that I prepare". Depend upon it, they were excellent, the best! Is not that a word for us? We have often dwelt on this precious passage which is so simple and applicable and appealing in our own time. Think, dear brethren, of God listening! Think of the notations made, the words used would denote excellence, "treasure", refined preciousness; all this is recorded. God graciously presents Himself as a treasurer surrounded by His jewels; we belong to those jewels.
In @Malachi 3:17 we get, "I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him". You see those words in what God said to Pharaoh, "Let my son go". God had His sons in these people, they feared Him in true affection and intelligence. They spake often one to another; doubtless they went over the ground of Genesis, and Exodus, and Leviticus which in a remarkable way belongs to Levi. Think
{202}
what the Psalms would speak of to them! Like Anna they would have glimmerings of Christ, though of course she would have more than they had. There is more than a glimmering in the New Testament, and she spoke *of Him* "to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem" -- what a speaker she must have been!
I have one word to add, dear brethren, and that is in regard to @Malachi 4:4, "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances". In our speakings one to another we are not to forget the law of Moses. We have been speaking about Aaron, but let us never forget Moses; I am not now speaking of him as a speaker but as a lawgiver. One of the most important things in our time is the principle of law, and this bears on us universally. It is not mount Sinai here, but "Which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances". In our speakings one to another there may be oftentimes irritability if law is brought in but a true priest always stands by the law, and he never allows the word 'non-essential' in his vocabulary in regard to what God has said. Everything that God has said is essential: "Which I commanded unto him in Horeb". How much there is in the book of Deuteronomy; the ground is gone over again, from the standpoint of Moses himself as a leader of the people. God never forgets one iota of the law that He gave His servant at Horeb. Jesus Himself says, "One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled". "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil" (@Matthew 5:17). I think this passage in Malachi is typical of 1 and 2 Corinthians; the Lord is bringing things in detail before us in these scriptures, and we should not shrink from going into these details. Let us not quibble and criticise and say these things are non-essential. This verse is
{203}
brought in because of our speaking together. The law of the house does not change, there is no development from what was set up at the beginning; that is the standard. "The law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him" (how respectfully God speaks of him) "in Horeb ... the statutes and ordinances".
That is what I had in mind, dear brethren, as showing *how* the dispensation is going to finish, as well as speaking particularly of *what* is going to happen. Let us "remember" on our side; are we going to be faithful? God will be, there is no question about that. But God must have material. Can He use me? That is the point. Am I in His hand? If He has the material, there will be a wonderful finish. The responsibility comes to each of us whether I am in His hands thus? "The law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb" is to be remembered. That is the test; we do not like it often, but God would have us love it, so as to be true levites with the law of truth in our mouth.
{204}
TABERNACLE CONDITIONS
@John 14:21 - 24; @Exodus 24:1 - 12; @Exodus 25:8,9
These scriptures, dear brethren, speak about tabernacle conditions. That is, the conditions into which God can come complacently; not conditions in heaven, but such as are *in* heaven found here, conditions corresponding with the divine circumstances above.
I have selected the passage in John because it brings the thought down to one person. One person may provide such conditions; and if one person, of course five or ten persons, or however many may be in a locality. The bearing of Scripture is always on the present time, even although its primary application may be future. It has always a moral bearing, and that bearing is on the time and place of its being read. The place involves the persons in it. That is how God regards geographical positions; He regards them in relation to the persons in them. In the same sense He regards time according to the persons who lived in it. God reckons on that principle; we should not understand the chronicles of the Bible aside from that method which God has adopted. For whom? It is a question of the lives of His saints. *Any* given time is in His mind, in that way, and any given place. The Scriptures are calculated to affect us thus, for they always have a bearing on time and place. So what I may remark tonight will necessarily apply, if indeed it be the word of God, to this place and to this town. So John's writings, as we have often heard (and the more we hear the more we believe), refer to our time in the main. They refer, of course, also to the time in which they were written, and have always had an application, for no scripture is ever a dead letter. But there is such a thing as speciality with
{205}
God, and John represents this as much as any other -- the principle of speciality. The Lord left him somewhat obscurely, in his remarks to Peter, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me" (@John 21:22). John was following at that time; had he not been following, the Lord would have had something else to say about it, but he was following; he represents the trustworthiness that his gospel presents to us. He is said to have lived longer than any of the apostles, and his gospel was written late in his life. This would go to show that he was trustworthy; the Lord intended him to write his gospel. His gospel has a speciality peculiar to it, which commands the respect of men who read it, and the Lord is, I believe, giving it a place at the present time. It will increase in our minds as a speciality, and not the least in this, that it brings down the greatest privileges to one person, assuming as it does that one person can provide tabernacle conditions, conditions for the divine dwelling. When I speak of the divine dwelling on *earth*, whether it be the tabernacle of old, or the temple, or the assembly, the divine dwelling on earth is always provisional, never final. It is as if God would say, 'Notwithstanding the power of the enemy here, I will have a place to dwell in'. That puts it on us to see that He has a place to dwell in. It is within the range of every person -- every believer -- to provide the conditions necessary for this. I have in mind, as I said, a locality, and I would remark in view of what I have to say, that we have always, where actual conditions suitable to God are in mind, the potentiality of them contemplated, otherwise we could never have them. I refer to 1 Corinthians; it was written to a company of saints addressed as "the assembly of God" in that town or city. They were young converts; we have often spoken of the Corinthians as in a low condition, and they were when the apostle wrote, but they were
{206}
young converts, perhaps of not more than eighteen months, some less. Most of them came out of the darkness of paganism in that short time. This, however, does not excuse the sorrowful conditions there, for the Son of God, as the apostle says, was preached among them in a threefold way -- by himself, Silvanus, and Timotheus. You may be sure that they had the best preaching possible, and all that accompanied that preaching -- ministering and teaching -- so there was no excuse for the conditions described in the letters. But still we have to bear in mind how young they were, and consider ourselves as to what we are relatively. It is only in this way that we can measure things aright. We should consider ourselves, consider the teaching we have had, and consider the length of our experience in the things of God, and then measure what we may think of others -- that is the thought. What formation has there been in us in the course of a year or two?
In regard to the potentiality I referred to earlier, the apostle says in @1 Corinthians 3:16, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?". He does not say, 'You ought to be the temple of God', but "ye are". It was a poor thing that they did not know these things, but evidently they did not; but the facts were there, and the facts are what I may call potential. Another thing the apostle says is that he does not speak after the manner of men among them. The apostle also tells them that they were allowing leaven among them, he says they were worse than the gentiles, that such things as were among them were not even among the nations. They were worse than pagans; yet the apostle says, "According as ye are unleavened" (@1 Corinthians 5:7), that is potential, and it is the basis of recovery, the basis of conditions for the divine dwelling. I say this for our encouragement,
{207}
dear brethren, God takes account of us potentially as well as concretely. If the concrete does not agree with the potential then there is need for rebuke, reproof, correction and instruction in righteousness. John helps greatly because he carries the thought down to one person, and he has in mind that from the outset the idea should be set forth from the divine side. So he tells us that "the Word became flesh", that is to say, Jesus is presented to us as God -- as a divine Person. In the early part of chapter 1 it says, "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us" (@John 1:14), or 'tabernacled' as the word is. Hence there was there some idea of tabernacle conditions; they were not made *for* Him; He made them Himself in coming in. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". What an atmosphere of holiness was there prepared and encircling that holy Person; we can look at Him thus from the very outset in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The Spirit in Luke guards the thought, "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God" (@Luke 1:35). There was a substance of holiness there which nothing could touch or corrupt, a body indeed *prepared*. John presents Him as "the Word" -- "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us" -- and in that same chapter the baptist calls attention to Him as "the Lamb of God". Certain of his disciples then followed Jesus. Jesus sees them following and says, "What seek ye?" (verse 38). He would bring out what was in their hearts, as He always does; if there is one here whose attention is called to Jesus, the Lord would probe you and ask you questions as to Himself. There is no better way of instruction than that, especially for young people. "What seek ye?". They say, "Rabbi", that is what they called Him, that was the state of their souls. He was much greater, but they used that word. You might say, That is not a word to use
{208}
when there was a greater revealed word; but they spoke according to what was in their mind. What they felt was the need of a teacher; as the evangelist carefully tells us, the word 'Rabbi' means teacher -- how much that is needed today! It is the idea of teaching generally that is in mind, the need of teaching is most urgent; I mean teaching in the sense that 'Rabbi' expresses -- Teacher or Master -- not simply such teaching as I am giving to you now, for I leave what I have to say to *you*, and may never say a word to any of you again perhaps -- that is not the thought of teaching in John. The thought of teaching is that the truth is engrafted, forged into the soul in power; that was the Lord's way -- that is the meaning of 'Rabbi', Teacher, Master. It is not instruction that is optional; there is too much of that, the saints being allowed to be as ignorant as they please. It is a disgrace to be ignorant when there is so much teaching; it is to our discredit to be ignorant. We should carry out the things that are presented to us so that they become useful. What good is knowledge if it is not useful? We should become active and practical. These two say, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?" They wanted to know where He abode; He says, "Come and see". That is His way, and that is what He would say to anyone who is interested in what He is doing. The Lord would say, "Come and see" -- not 'see Me teaching', but 'see Me at home in My own place'. Where this place was Scripture does not tell us, but the place is to be found; John makes it a point. How do we get these things? That is a matter of spiritual importance. "They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day", and then it says, "It was about the tenth hour". This day would never be forgotten by these two brothers; they would gain much in their souls which would be for the structure of the tabernacle; they would begin to understand, by what they
{209}
saw on that day, what would be required for the divine dwelling.
So again, John tells us at the beginning of chapter 8, after the disciples went to their own homes, that Jesus went to the mount of Olives. That would confirm what Luke says, that He always did that; it was His habit. If one could but follow Him there adoringly as John presents it! No one did, no one was interested enough to do it; but oh! beloved brethren, think of it, if any one had taken it up and followed Jesus, as He wended His way to the base and then to the summit of Olivet! What happened? ... John tells us, "We have contemplated his glory", possibly he had been with Him there; there is no doubt he was in a certain garden near by, to which the Lord often resorted with His disciples. I mention this now to show how John leads us to this thought of the divine abode; it is not a place like Olivet now, but with a person or persons -- "We will come to him and make our abode with him".
I want to come back for a moment to the verses in Exodus, to show how in the types all this is supported. I would say at once that conditions for divine dwelling are only furnished by a heavenly people; and not only a heavenly people, but a people who have some insight into heaven, a matter which is spiritually possible, as these types show us.
The first thing mentioned in our chapter in Exodus is that Jehovah says to Moses, "Go up to Jehovah, thou and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel". God has a dwelling in mind; that is what the chapter shows, also the next chapter, and the next, indeed the whole main part of the book. That word is to us, dear brethren, God would say, 'Come up, come up'. Then we are told after this word, that "Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah". That is the second point, and it says, "All the people answered with one
{210}
voice, and said, All the words that Jehovah has said will we do!" We may say that they were foolish, and in a certain sense they were, but I was thinking that it was a necessity here to introduce the element of obedience; without that, beloved brethren, there cannot be anything for God; there could be no material for God without that. All the people joined in, and God accepted for the moment what they said for the purpose in hand. Then Moses got up early in the morning -- it was a fine moment when the people took the ground of obedience -- how God loves that! "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me". Obedience is the fruit of love, "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him". Such is the person who loves Christ, such the esteem in which He is held in heaven. A person who loves Christ keeps His commandments because he *loves* Him; that is the point here. Moses got up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars. It is as much as to say, now that obedience is proffered, God can go on, service can go on, great divine projects can go on. How great these thoughts are -- and they can apply to a single believer here; if God has only one He can go on. That is a great fact showing how valuable an obedient christian is!
Then notice the various uses Moses makes of the various offerings that are offered; half the blood is put in basons, and half is sprinkled on the altar, and the blood is sprinkled on the people as well. The book of the covenant is there, as we read in Hebrews; Moses had already written down the things after the people had undertaken to obey. It is worth while writing if there is obedience, but it is of no use if there is no obedience. The people are useless if there is no obedience. The spirit of the testimony is on the principle of faith to faith. Where does faith
{211}
come from? It comes from God, without faith there is nothing for God. Moses read the words of the covenant to the people and they again say. "All that Jehovah has said will we do, and obey!". That is the position in @Exodus 24. In that position the work of God can proceed; the blood of the covenant is there in its fulness to affect our hearts, for God would have a satisfied people, not only an obedient people but a satisfied people, filled with His love. He satisfies us, He does not simply reckon upon our proper obedience, but upon the power of His love in our hearts. Love never fails in God's heart, nor even in the heart of a christian, certainly never in the heart of God. In principle it never fails, and God can rely on that.
After all this, Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and seventy men go up and see the God of Israel; that is the heavenly position. God would tell us this night in this town that if that position is to be achieved, it must be by a heavenly people and by no other. God would have us understand something of divine circumstances. So these people went up, and then they saw the God of Israel, and they ate and drank before Him -- they are called nobles up there. The record is that "on the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand". Perfect love casts out fear; there is nothing that God is not complacent with, in these circumstances. The nobles of Israel were there, and they ate and drank before Him; there is a spirit of communion up there. God is complacent, but the Mediator must be there, hence Moses has to go up higher. God says, Under these circumstances "I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandments that I have written, for their instruction". It is under these circumstances that God undertakes to furnish all that is needed in the way of instruction. "For their instruction", typically alludes to all that has come down
{212}
to us through Christ, the great Mediator, gone far above the heavens. He has sent down the Holy Spirit, as Peter tells us in his epistle, "They ministered those things, which have now been announced to you ... by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven" (@1 Peter 1:12). It is all instruction for us; this is how it should read, "I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction". It is not 'I *will* write', but "that I have written" for their instruction. Are we devoid of instruction? No, beloved brethren, I am thinking of the volume of instruction today, that is the position in this section, that the people should be abundantly instructed, so that they should know what is required of them, and do what is required of them. It is said of the Lord Jesus in @Acts 1:1 -- the great church book -- "all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach". The doing and the teaching must go together. The apostle Paul was taken up in due course in perfect tabernacle conditions, and John shows us how they may be found in one person who is a lover of Christ. A lover of Christ must first keep His commandments, and secondly keep His word. The commandments are in a general way negative; they mean that I have to leave all that is contrary to the divine mind in regard to the dwelling. 1 Timothy, and 1 and 2 Corinthians cover the commandments; but before we understand them we must act on 2 Timothy. If there is one who has not left conditions that God described as not according to His mind, the word I would use for you today is, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity" (@2 Timothy 2:19), that is the commandment. The positive side is, "Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (@2 Timothy 2:22). There are such, they do exist, the apostle supposes they do exist. Just as the Lord supposes that there
{213}
are lovers of God, so today 2 Timothy contemplates that there are persons who call on the Lord out of a pure heart; it is for you to find them. If you have not found them, you are not a seeker, for it says, "Seek, and ye shall find". If you love the Lord Jesus you will find them.
That is the first thing, that sets you free from what is contrary. 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, 1 Timothy, Titus and Hebrews teach us as to the positive side of things; that is to say, tabernacle conditions are all bound up in the words of the Lord, "If any one love me, he will keep my word". What was His word? The next thing is, My words, "He that loves me not does not keep my words". How many there are who do not keep the words of Jesus, who do not love Jesus. What are His words? They are the Father's words; such is the importance of them, that not only are they the words of Christ, but they are the Father's words. The Father spoke in them, such is the wondrous fact about the revelation -- the Father was there in Jesus. There was not one Person, but there were two Persons, that is the fullest idea; there was not one Person but two Persons so united that the Father was actually there, doing and speaking the words. The Lord says this to enhance the importance of what He was doing. He says, "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father" (@John 15:24). So the Father had to do with these words; and a lover of Jesus cherishes them in his heart and keeps them. His word or words imply tabernacle conditions; the commandments of course enter into that too, but the commandments deliver us from all that is evil whilst the word brings us into what is positive or constructive. The word conveys what God has in His mind as to His dwelling, what He cherishes. It is as if He were to bring a pattern down. He says to Moses, See that the tabernacle you make is according to the pattern.
{214}
The next chapter brings out what material was secured, it refers to heavenly materials, such as are in heaven. What God reposes in there, He wants down here; the saints in the power of the Spirit provide this material. That is what the second part of Exodus means; lovers of God provide what God requires, according to the pattern of the great Mediator "ascended up above all the heavens" (@Ephesians 4:10). He brings down to us by His Spirit the pattern of what is required, and also the material, what is worked out in us. So, dear brethren, the question is now, What is there *here*? The Lord would say to us, What have you got? That is a word to every locality, What is there in the way of conditions?
Now in the chapter I read in John, dear brethren, verse 21 refers to the commandments, and I believe the Lord's supper enters into that. "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him"; the Lord Jesus loves the person who keeps His commandments, and the Father loves him, and the Lord Jesus manifests Himself to that person. This is a most precious suggestion; it is not yet the dwelling, but it is most precious to be loved by Jesus, singled out as keeping His commandments; as one of His lovers I am loved by the Father, and manifested to by Jesus. The Lord manifests Himself to you, and that enters into the Lord's supper, as I understand it. In John it does not speak of the Lord's supper, but it speaks of what goes with it, what is essential to it. That is the first thing; then the Supper comes. It speaks in verse 21 of the manifestation of Jesus, that is sure to set you in movement if you are a lover, that is the intent of it. He manifests Himself, and finishes with setting them in movement; how essential it is to be set in movement spiritually. "Judas, not the Iscariote, says to him, Lord, how
{215}
is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?". He puts himself among the lovers of Christ. The Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word", it is not now 'keep My commandment', but "my word"; that refers to what was in the Lord's mind. If we are near Him He will always tell us what is in His mind; He was thinking of the Father; so He says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him". That means that that person or persons represented furnished tabernacle conditions. This is a great fact and it is within our range; it is a question of keeping the word or words of Jesus. It tells us expressly that the words were the Father's words, "The word which ye hear is not mine, but that of the Father who has sent me".
Now I begin to think of what God requires, I fully recognise the commandment. As we were saying yesterday there are three kinds of love that enter into the assembly setting: the love of Christ, the love of God in the new covenant, and the Father's love for Christ. We want to understand these three kinds of love and know how to move in relation to each.
The bread in the Lord's supper signifies the love of Christ, "This is my body, which is for you". In 1 Corinthians we do not get the word 'given for you', but "This is my body, which is for you". That is significant; I suppose the Lord meant that it was for us gentiles as well as for the Jews. The Lord would have us understand that there is nothing missed at all, we are not forgotten as to anything, all the best things belong to us. So in @Ephesians 2 when the Spirit of God is speaking about the dwelling, He tells us what we are, "Fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God", that is a general thought, but he finishes up by saying, "In whom *ye* also are built together for a habitation of
{216}
God in the Spirit". "*Ye* also", we are not left out; there are the greatest things for the most distant gentile believer, not one is left out in the mind of God. I say to myself, 'I also', that means that at one time others had a greater privilege than I, but not now -- I have come into the greatest things! Can I believe that? We have to understand the love of Christ in the bread, "This is my body, which is for you"; if it is for me, What am I thinking about it? What is it to me?
Then there is "the new covenant in my blood, ... poured out for you", not for many but "for you". It comes home to me, What is it? It is the covenant love of God taking account of me, that love is in my heart to set me free. Perfect love casts out fear.
In @John 17:26 the Lord says to His Father, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them"; that is the Father's love for the Son; we are brought into that. We must not proceed in the service of God in tabernacle conditions in relation to *that* love, in such terms or hymns or prayers or thanksgivings as allude to the first love, or the second love; we must proceed in terms belonging to *that* love. How great it is!
That is all I have to say. I hope the dear brethren will understand and follow up the thoughts, especially in regard to the heavenly side; this must be provided by a heavenly people. It is not simply that we come together to break bread every Lord's day, and give out a hymn and give thanks, but we should regard the order that is proper to the assembly. The Lord is looking for this, as He said to Moses, "I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction". The Lord has given us wonderful instruction in this very place; let us profit by it and make it really our own. God expects reality and results.
{217}
SERVICE AS LEARNED FROM CHRIST
@Isaiah 42:1 - 25
J.T. The Lord will help us, I believe, in looking at Himself as presented in this prophecy, in regard of our service. We have Him presented by Jehovah as pleasing to Him, which is the first point to be noticed, that in our service God has some part, and that the Spirit is the power in it, and that the servant is not destructive. However small the work of God may be, or, however waning or perishing, He will not quench it. And then -- I am just outlining what I see in the chapter -- that He brings forth judgment according to truth, and that "He shall not faint nor be in haste, till he have set justice in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law". That is, the servant is becoming influential and worthy of listening to. Then, in verse 5, God comes in to support him, justifying him in saying that He has called him in righteousness and that He will take hold of his hand and preserve him, and then further that He will give him for a covenant of the people; that is, he represents the disposition of God. Then the result is something new in the way of celebration: "Sing unto Jehovah a new song". There are also new things that will come in in his service, so that he will not be stale. As it says, "New things do I declare: before they spring forth will I cause you to hear them", and then there are the new song and the power of God manifest in the paragraph from verses 10 to 18, and then the magnifying of divine principles and the law. I believe the Lord will help us to look at this subject under those headings.
E.J.McB. They are very fine headings, but it puts a good deal on the servant.
{218}
J.T. Well, no servant will shrink from the standard the Lord Jesus has set up, as outlined in this chapter prophetically, and brought into the New Testament, as is well known, in the critical period of the Lord's life when the opposition had mounted up against Him. The Spirit of God quotes these early verses as if to show, in the great opposition that had arisen against the Lord, the necessity of changing over in view of the church, and that the extreme pressure only brought out what is seen here. The more the pressure, the more the excellency in the Servant was disclosed.
So that the first thing we should notice in speaking of this great subject, as applying to us all severally -- for no true christian will claim exemption from service -- is that God has not got to put up with us as if He had no one else, and that He looks for pleasure in the servant, in the person himself: "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!". It enhances the service in our minds to see that this is the divine thought in it.
P.L. "Whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings" (@Romans 1:9), does that enter into the delight afforded God in the service?
J.T. Yes; his inner being in that feature of it in its nearest relation with God is in it, his spirit. It is not outward merely or perfunctory, but the person is in it in all he is inwardly.
C.H.W. Do you mean that if the Lord is to uphold and support His servant there must be features of delight in him?
J.T. That is the way it stands in Christ. God sets out His thought. The chapter indicates there had been service before, but not answering to the mind of God. The passage discloses that others had served but had failed, but now we have One in whom God's soul delights. He had chosen Him, and in every way He answered to the choice.
{219}
W.C. Would the anointing of the tabernacle in all its parts bear on it?
J.T. Yes. What appears in @Exodus 40 is that each part as set in its place is functioning. It is not there merely waiting to be used; it is functioning as soon as it is placed. That is, a saint, as soon as he is placed in the fellowship, in the anointed vessel -- as it says, "so also is the Christ" (@1 Corinthians 12:12) -- is functioning. That is the thought in the tabernacle, and so God says, That is all Mine; He just claims it at once. The cloud covers it, that is, God taking it over, and the glory fills it. There is no discrepancy, corresponding very much with this.
A.S.M. Would the Lord's service in @Luke 4 be a suggestion of all this? "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me ...".
J.T. That is a passage that corresponds. The Spirit of God dwells on the details of the Lord's movements and then on His words, as if the divine complacency is there. Even the Lord's audience was brought into it; they "wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth", alluding to the anointed Vessel. Luke does not quote this exactly; Matthew does, because that gospel has in mind the great pressure that comes on the servant. Matthew has indeed the church before him, and whatever he presents is in relation to the fact that Christ is rejected; he contemplates great pressure, and whether the servant can retain his equilibrium and the beautiful traits of Christ in spite of the pressure. That is, I think, the point he would make, and he quotes this passage in chapter 12.
H.W.A. Do you mean by that He would neither faint nor be discouraged, as seen in chapter 11, in the way He addresses His Father? And, in chapter 12, He quotes this, "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight". Does that amplify what you have in mind?
{220}
J.T. Exactly. After upbraiding the cities wherein most of His mighty works were done, the opposition being complete, He rejoices in spirit at that time, showing that He did not faint nor was He discouraged.
A.M.P. And would the reference to the servant of the Lord in @2 Timothy 2:24 indicate that the quality of the service is sustained under the great pressure of the last days? "The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient".
J.T. That is, he is not quarrelsome, nor does he take pleasure in conflict.
E.J.McB. He is not contentious.
J.T. Exactly; not that he will not stand for the truth, but he is not marked by contention.
P.L. A good soldier, but a meek servant.
J.T. Yes. A good soldier does not always keep firing; he fires under orders; he is one that is under command, and knows how to control himself.
Ques. Is this feature of the delight of God in the servant seen in Caleb and Joshua? "If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land" (@Numbers 14:8).
J.T. That is good. The Lord is not only pleased with the way a preacher maintains the truth, but He is pleased with the servant himself. God has His portion in the servant, which lifts service into a position of dignity, that God, as it were, feeds upon it; He has His pleasure in the persons who serve.
E.J.McB. It says of the day to come, "His servants shall serve him, and they shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads" (@Revelation 22:3,4), which would indicate what they were to Him apart from their service.
J.T. Quite, and what He was to them, His name on their foreheads. Their intelligence would be identified with that. The forehead is the most prominent part, and the book of Revelation stresses
{221}
it in a time of apostasy such as ours, that we are not hiding things, but making clear whence we draw our support and what we are identified with. It is the Lamb's Father.
J.O.S. When Matthew quotes this passage he changes the word to 'chosen'. In Isaiah, it says, "Behold my servant whom I uphold", but in Matthew, "whom I have chosen". Does that bear on the subject of God's pleasure in the servant?
J.T. It does. The allusion is plain enough to the heavens recognising Christ as He came up from the waters of baptism, the Spirit coming upon Him: "*This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". The servant is the Son, and that is the clue really to what we get here.
Ques. Would you say that God's getting His portion from the servant would guarantee that the saints would get their portion in the service?
J.T. Yes. I think the saints should find enjoyment in a brother's ministry. Of course, the enjoyment will not last much beyond the hour of the ministry, but it is important it should be there. What he says is supposed to last longer than that, or ministry may be regarded as a passing song, as in the case of Ezekiel (chapter 33:32). Some brothers and sisters come to meetings like this and they enjoy the time, may enjoy the brothers who are ministering, and that is the end of it. But what they say is the great thing, and that should not end with the meeting. The divine impressions conveyed should remain, but there is such a thing as enjoyment both for God and the saints in the minister. I believe that is what the Lord represents, and what is presented here is what Jehovah found in His Servant, and in Luke it says of those persons who did not perhaps love Him, who would have murdered Him afterwards, that they marvelled at the words that came out of His mouth, "words of grace" they are called.
{222}
P.L. So both Moses and Joshua, as about to die, are particularly called Jehovah's servants. Does it suggest what they afforded Him to their last breath, so to speak?
J.T. That is good. The book of Deuteronomy, I suppose, among other things, is intended to convey to all servants from that time, how freshness is to be retained as old age creeps on. It is a matter of importance that *all* the saints, those who serve particularly, should have in mind that old age is calculated to dull us and make us stale and perhaps perfunctory in our service, or inclining to superannuation. I believe the book of Deuteronomy is intended for all who followed on, to show that service is to continue in freshness until the last breath, as you say. Moses tells us expressly in the song in chapter 32 that his speech should be like the dew and come down as the fine rain. There was not the least evidence of old age in that sense: "His eye was not dim". "Who is blind, but my servant?" it says here. That was not Moses. Service was set out in Israel, but there was no blindness in Moses, and his natural force as a man was as strong at that time as at the beginning when he began to serve.
Ques. You remarked that the ministry did not last much longer than the time the minister was speaking. If we had in view that the ministry was concerning Christ and the church, would it not last longer?
J.T. What is said is to abide, but the saints should not be bored. I mean, the minister ought to have in mind that he should afford pleasure to them in his ministry. Jehovah had pleasure in the minister here, the Lord viewed in that light, and, as remarked in @Luke 4, there is full evidence that if you were there you would have been delighted to hear the Lord as He said, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears". That was to be retained; that was for the
{223}
conscience and for the heart, but the enjoyment would be there.
Rem. I wondered whether the first verse of this book would help: "which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem" -- Christ and the church.
J.T. In any case our ministry should have Christ and the church in mind. No greater subject can be presented for the satisfaction and enjoyment of the saints than the Bridegroom and the bride.
C.H.W. What is the source and spring of this character of ministry that you are suggesting?
J.T. God is the source of all, you know. "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things" (@Romans 11:36). But He says here, "I will put my Spirit upon him". All is carried on in the power of the Spirit, and that is the ground the Lord takes in @Luke 4: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me".
C.H.W. Why does Paul, in writing to Timothy, say, "Rekindle the gift of God which is in thee" (@2 Timothy 1:6)? Would it seem to be in danger of diminishing?
J.T. The gift was darkened to some extent, but the source of all things is God: "Of him, and through him, and for him are all things", and that applies to the servant. The servant is of God, and for God, and the service is carried on by God's power, as this chapter shows. So the third paragraph here brings out the result for God. It says, "Sing unto Jehovah a new song".
W.C.G. You have spoken of the pleasure of God and the pleasure of the audience, but @John 4:32,34 gives us the pleasure of the Servant Himself. "I have food to eat which ye do not know ... My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work". The Lord had great pleasure in the ministry, and should not a servant find delight in what he is to God?
J.T. Quite so, and with results too. What it must
{224}
have been to the Lord to find that lone person. His disciples had gone into the city; they did not know, but the Servant finds sustainment in that way, even although He may be alone.
W.C.G. An audience of one.
P.L. She was a bruised reed, was she not? Then, in verse 4 here, you get his influence extended. Do you have that suggested in what the Samaritans, coming out of the city, say about Him?
J.T. Yes. It says here, "The isles shall wait for his law". That would mean that the servant's reputation is being extended, as it was at Samaria. "We have heard him ourselves", they say. They listened to what the woman said, and were affected by it, but now, "we have heard him ourselves". No doubt they would be impressed with the change in the woman, for she was changed; her manner of speech would be changed. In fact, in leaving her waterpot, she implies that she was the waterpot herself. But now, "We have heard him ourselves", and moreover, "We know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world" -- the bearing of His testimony and what He was. Here it says, "The isles shall wait for his law". That, applied to any servant, would mean that his reputation is extended and what he says is known to be of value. All these things should enter into every servant, every saint indeed; they are the divine standard.
E.J.McB. You had before you, I think, the necessity of a servant being careful in a place where there may be very little -- in regard of the bruised reed and the smoking flax: would you say a word on that, preserving what is for God?
J.T. At the present time, and for some years back, the enemy's effort has been to stir up local troubles. Wherever you go you find more or less of that, and a disposition to discredit even what there may be of God. When local troubles arise there is a
{225}
lot of dust in the air all the time which dims the vision and causes personal feeling and prejudice, and party spirit too, maybe. All those things are darkening and the danger is to discredit everything and ignore what there may be of God in the midst of all those darkening circumstances. There may be something; it is likely there is something, for Satan would not attack so vigorously if there were not something, however small, and it is the servant's business to find that something, and not allow it to be destroyed. What is to be noticed here is the word 'judgment' all through. How important it is! a clear discernment, distinguishing between things that differ, and not generalising everything, but going into detail. However small the gold is, find it and preserve it. Do you not think that is important?
E.J.McB. I do, indeed.
P.L. So you get in chapter 41:19,20: "I will give in the wilderness the cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oleaster; I will set in the desert the cypress, pine, and box-tree together; that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it". Is that the thought, that in desert conditions God is at work and we need to discern it?
J.T. Yes, and you notice here it says, "Thus saith God, Jehovah, he that created the heavens and stretched them out, he that spread forth the earth and its productions". God makes much of what it produces in fruitfulness. He looked on the creation with pleasure, according to @Genesis 1; everything was good -- the production of the earth. Well, viewed spiritually, we want to get that, what the earth produces. "Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind" (@Genesis 1:11). Well, that is the thing for the servant to have his eye upon and to be on the
{226}
look-out for, however little. "If there be any virtue and if any praise" (@Philippians 4:8), find that out and follow it. However small the production is, God gives a lead as to where life is; the production is a question of life.
H.W.A. Would you say that one great thing for a servant in such conditions as you have described is to see that he does not come under the power of them, but his great concern is what is due to God? I was thinking of Moses in @Numbers 20, that his great concern on that occasion should have been to have hallowed Jehovah's name, but, in the circumstances, he seems to have come under the power of the people's then condition. The condition of things outlined is very obvious today, alas! in many meetings, but the servant has to consider first of all for God. It gives an opportunity for faithfulness.
J.T. If we are at all with God, He will intimate things to us beforehand, if we are on the look-out. He says here, for instance: "Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth will I cause you to hear them". Now, Moses got an inkling before he actually came down into the midst of the trouble; God apprised him, and I think He does give an inkling if one is concerned about any of these matters before they spring forth. So you are on the look-out for things; you are not surprised, and God helps you in view of the conditions. I think the word 'judgment' here should be particularly before us. It says, "I will put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the nations. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment according to truth. He shall not faint nor be in haste, till he have set justice in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law". Later it says, "He hath magnified the law, and made it honourable", as if
{227}
God would stress the great importance of principle in these circumstances. There will be productions which we ought to look for, but the principles are the great highways which keep us right, and hence judgment and justice are so stressed here.
Rem. You see a close parallel in the history of Joseph: first of all his moral worth under pressure yielding delight to God, and then the extension of his moral influence: "a man in whom the Spirit of God is", it says (@Genesis 41:38). Then, Pharaoh says later, "I am Pharaoh; and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt" (verse 44), and he becomes the sustainer of life in the country.
J.H.S. Would @Jeremiah 15:19 bring out a little what you are saying? "Therefore thus saith Jehovah: If thou return, then will I bring thee again, thou shalt stand before me; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth". You see what is of God there.
J.T. That is an important thing to be able to do, the need to have an eye for what is of God, the productions of the earth, the very fruit. "If there be any virtue" -- that is a clue which gives you a lead, well, follow that up. There may be other things, but follow that up. So that the bruised reed is not broken and the smoking flax is not quenched. There is some hope yet. The servant's business is to see to that.
W.C.G. It inspires the spirit of confidence: "And in his name shall the Gentiles trust" (@Matthew 12:21).
J.T. That is a great point, that the servant becomes known under these circumstances as having something worth listening to; they wait for it.
J.O.S. Do you see that in Paul's concern with regard to Onesimus in sending him back to Philemon,
{228}
that the work of God in Onesimus might not be hindered by harsh treatment?
J.T. He was very careful about that, and it indicates how valuable one brother may be. Then there are these new things. "I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will take hold of thy hand; and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring forth the prisoner from the prison, them that sit in darkness out of the house of restraint". It is God coming in to justify the servant: "I ... have called thee in righteousness". He called Him because He loved Him and His soul delighted in Him, but it was right. There is no better, because the choice is the best; it is a choice in righteousness. And He says, "I will ... give thee for a covenant of the people", which would mean that He represents the disposition of God; not simply a mediator of something, but that He is Himself the disposition of God, what God is towards His people. How great a matter that is, that one accepts the position, and it is a question of the representation of God, that is, the spirit and manner representing God. Then there is this matter of a prison and restraint. There is much needed in that way. The idea of a prison, I suppose, is important, to restrain lawlessness, but then, we may keep a person in prison too long, like the man in Corinth. The spirit of a jailor may lay hold of us, but the spirit of the servant is not that of a jailor; he has no pleasure in keeping people in prison; he wants to let them out. In fact, that is the point here: "To open the blind eyes, to bring forth the prisoner from the prison, them that sit in darkness out of the house of restraint"; bring them out according to God. If nothing of this kind can be done, and if the prison doors have to be kept locked all the time, the spirit of the servant is not there.
{229}
P.L. You say to them, "Turn again to the stronghold, prisoners of hope!" (@Zechariah 9:12).
J.T. That is the idea of a christian being in prison; he is in a pit without water. That is what you get in the prophet. A pit without water is a place of restraint where there is hope, and his exercise is to get out, and the servant's exercise is to let him out.
E.J.McB. Would that be why the servant is to be for a covenant, that he brings in the liberating power of God?
J.T. He represents God. God has no pleasure in the prison or in restraint.
W.C. Would that principle run through Luke's gospel? I was thinking of chapter 7:16 where the young man is raised up and the people say, "A great prophet has been raised up amongst us". Would that be life-giving ministry?
J.T. Very good. It runs right through Luke; God has come in in Christ. As the anointed One, the Lord announces deliverance to the captives.
W.C. The reference to the prophet would show it was referred to spiritually: "A great prophet has been raised up amongst us".
A.M.P. And is not the effect of the Lord's ministry in Luke to set free glory to God? Would the ministry of the servant here make room for the new song that follows?
J.T. That is the way it works. What the servant is as representative of God is set out in the paragraph, verses 5 to 9, in the New Translation. That is, the thought that new things are coming up, fresh things, and he gets an inkling of them when they come up. They are enlarged, of course, but he gets an inkling of them, and then, in the next paragraph, we have results for God: "Sing unto Jehovah a new song, his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles and their
{230}
inhabitants". Ministry according to God is universal in its bearing, and it results in praise to God, a new song.
J.O.S. Do we see that with Paul as he recounts his commission to King Agrippa? He says, "For this purpose have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee to be a servant and a witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in" (@Acts 26:16). That would be the new thing that would follow on.
J.T. Just so: "what I shall appear to thee in". That is a very great matter in service, to have new things, not exactly revelations, but freshness, things that the Spirit gives.
P.L. Do you have the thought in Hebrews, getting the Hebrew christians out of the Jewish prison? The apostle speaks so much there of what is new, the new covenant and so on, and then the universal system connected with mount Zion, and finally the service of praise in chapter 13.
J.T. That is a very good order. You notice here it speaks of "former things", what one has been going on with, applying it to the servant: "the former things are come to pass". That is, the earlier service is not done with, but things are fresh, and I will get an inkling of them before they spring up.
E.J.McB. Would that not suggest the servant should move on himself, as well as expecting the hearers to move?
J.T. That is so. Former things will not do now, but new things, and I believe that is the ground taken by the apostles: "Our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ" (@1 John 1:3). God honoured that. What freshness there was in that! "These things write we to you that your joy may be full" (verse 4). What freshness there must have been in that ministry! Then, in the next paragraph, we have the results for God in the
{231}
way of praise. I think that is the order in which any servant's service is carried on if God is with him. The service of God is augmented by his ministry, so that there is the song. "Sing unto Jehovah a new song, his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles and their inhabitants. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains: let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands". There is some extent there, some volume in that passage.
P.L. It sounds a little like, "Let everything that hath breath praise Jah" (@Psalm 150:6).
J.T. Just so.
W.C.G. It is in the power of the new access to God that they relinquish their idols according to verse 17.
J.T. That idea of graven images or idols runs through the chapter. We are coming on in the next chapter to Cyrus who would overthrow all that. That is, the coming in of Christ would overthrow all that, but the servant's business is to see to it now.
P.L. And are the prisoners to be released to augment the praise?
J.T. That is the object you have in mind.
W.C.G. The power of the minister is to give them something better.
J.T. I suppose a prison-keeper would be the Philippian jailor after he was converted. That is the kind of prison-keeper God would use.
P.L. In spreading the table for them, would he see that they got food?
J.T. And he washed their stripes.
J.R.S. Do verses 13 and 14 bear on a servant's zeal that lies underneath what he has to say?
J.T. It says, "Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man, he will stir up jealousy like a man of war: he
{232}
will cry, yea, he will shout; he will shew himself mighty against his enemies", and so on. This is what a servant may reckon upon in regard of the general conflict, what God is to him, so that the thing can come in. However mighty the foe may seem to be, God, as it were, clothes Himself in a figurative way to assure us that nothing can overcome Him, and the servant can count on that.
W.C. So Matthew, in quoting this passage, says, "Until he bring forth judgment unto victory" (chapter 12:20). The word 'victory' is not used here. Is it the line of Matthew's gospel?
J.T. Quite so. I suppose the Spirit of God employs whatever translation was current, but it conveys the sense. If the Spirit of God quotes it, you may be sure it is right. He may be putting more into it than the primary translation. So, if the Spirit of God is speaking today, He has a right to quote words of Scripture according to the needs of the moment. That does not give latitude to the servant, but spiritual ministry would quote the words of Scripture as needed to meet current needs.
Ques. So you suggest that underlying this passage is the representation of God in those who serve?
J.T. That is the thought. Is it not very encouraging? Let the waves come up; God is greater than them. It is a remarkable figure here that God uses. "Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man, he will stir up jealousy like a man of war: he will cry, yea, he will shout; he will shew himself mighty against his enemies", and it goes on to say, "I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not, in paths that they know not will I lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight". That seems to me to be very stimulating in the service of God.
{233}
P.L. Is it "the Lord working with them" (@Mark 16:20)?
J.T. Yes, with "signs following". This same thing would appear. Look at Philippi and other instances in the Acts, for instance, the power of God coming in in support of His servants.
P. Were these features not expressed by the apostle Paul in his movements and his preaching?
J.T. I suppose he came nearer to Christ than any other servant. He is intended to represent what service is according to God. Then we have the thought that "he hath magnified the law, and made it honourable". Applying that in a practical way, it is that the principles of God are not falling to the ground; they are not despicable in peoples¬ eyes. It is in keeping with the change in the New Testament quotation, that the divine principles are brought out, so to speak, in the ministry according to God in a magnified way. Instead of being discredited, the things we hold or stand for are magnified and made honourable, that wherever God is working they will be recognised. That is a very important thing.
E.J.McB. Do you think that might in principle apply to the great principles that have led the people of God on, and that, as the flesh is given up, these principles get magnified in our minds?
J.T. They do. I think this enters into the care meeting, as we call it. To care for the saints we must maintain divine principles. Two meetings of great importance to my mind are coming up. There is the ministry meeting, as it is called, and I think rightly, which ought to take the character of prophecy. That is the intent of it in @1 Corinthians 14, that it brings God in, dealing with the conscience, so that people fall down. Instead of rising up in our assumed dignity, we fall down and recognise that God is there amongst His people. The other meeting is the meeting for care. It is a love meeting really. The
{234}
shepherd has to go out in the service. It is burdensome and onerous; it may last long and one may have to sacrifice one's comfort to attend the care meeting, but it is an important meeting and is increasing in importance, for it is a question of caring for the saints. As in @John 10, the Lord as the Shepherd looks at the saints as needing care, and He expends all that He has upon them. That is the idea of the meeting for care. It says of Timotheus, "I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on" (@Philippians 2:20). That is really what the meeting means, and divine principles enter into it. Divine principles should become magnified and made honourable in that meeting. We should learn how to apply them, discerning between good and evil in applying them.
P.L. So the Lord walks in Solomon's porch in winter just after referring to Himself as the Shepherd in @John 10. Would that link up with the love that has a judgment according to God in regard of the saints?
J.T. That seems to be the intent of the introduction of Solomon's porch there. It is also found in @Acts 5 where the severest discipline had just been executed in the case of Ananias and Sapphira. It says, "They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch, but of the rest durst no man join them, but the people magnified them; and believers were more than ever added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women". They were in the recognition of judgment.
A.M.P. Do you think the book of Ruth indicates how the law is made honourable in a day of weakness, how Boaz searched out the law in regard of redemption?
J.T. "He went into the city", in chapter 3:15. The Authorised Version says, "she went into the city", but it is not right. "He went into the city",
{235}
meaning the place of divine principles, where law and order were, and he searched out what the custom was in Israel in regard of redemption.
P.L. "Thou, such a one, turn aside, sit down here" (@Ruth 4:1), is that the care meeting?
J.T. That is it. That was in the gate. So that things are done in that chapter according to the custom in Israel, the custom governing redemption, a very great matter.
R.A.E. It says, "The man will not rest until he have completed the matter this day" (chapter 3:18).
J.T. That is a good word for us in regard of the care meeting, to see the thing through. So much is taken up casually. Anything that comes up ought to be seen through to its ultimate issue, and that must be for the good of the saints.
J.R.S. You have mentioned those two meetings: would you say a word as to the place that sisters have in regard of them?
J.T. The prophetic meeting is for them, of course. They are enjoined in the chapter in 1 Corinthians not to teach, but they are to be there. They represent the affectionate, subjective side which is always necessary for the assembly. Then, in regard of the care meeting, their business is to find out what happens. If they are exercised, they will find out. Anna represents that; she would find out what happened.
J.O.S. Are you suggesting that there are no secrets at the care meeting?
J.T. I do not think there should be. There is wisdom, of course, but in the church the principle is, "I speak as to intelligent persons" (@1 Corinthians 10:15). Every member, every person in it is responsible.
P.L. So that the faculty of judging is to come into play at the ministry meeting, for instance.
J.T. "Let the others judge" would include them. Sisters that are singled out and put forward in
{236}
Scripture ought to be noticed. Sisters like Anna and Lydia and Mary Magdalene are set out as models.
F.P.S. Does verse 22 that follows represent God's feelings? "But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and hidden in prison-houses; they are become a prey, and none delivereth, -- a spoil, and none saith, Restore". God is after the recovery and restoration of those held in bondage.
J.T. Quite so.
{237}
SERVICE
@Philippians 2:19 - 22; @Genesis 14:14 - 16; @Numbers 4:29 - 33
From these scriptures I intend, by the Lord's help, to deduce certain instruction for us, as needed, I believe, amongst the saints of God at the present time. It relates to service. Service is obligatory on all; as one has light from God in any measure, one can use it and serve. The field, therefore, is wide, including all saints; the levitical family included, in principle, all saints. But whilst we are all thus obligated, dear brethren, to serve, Scripture also speaks of *trained* servants, and I have selected Timothy as representative of the saints who serve in this way, especially in our time. He represents service in the early days too, for he had to do with things in the assembly before its decline; but he also is in view as representing service in difficult times, the last days. So that he covers in his own person the idea of trained service extending on to our own times; for whilst we are living in a day of small things, broken conditions -- yet the thought of God remains; the need of training in the service, and the means for it too, remain, in measure at least. We are all familiar with the idea of trained service; how much training is needed in the medical and attendant professions, for instance. The apostle Paul alludes to this, when he speaks of himself as caring for the saints as a nurse cares for her own children; he alludes to training, withal not shutting out from the trained person the love that will greatly augment the service, and the touch -- "a nurse ... her own children" (@1 Thessalonians 2:7). Now Timothy is, I believe, representative of this, not indeed as Paul was -- and you may wonder why I do not select Paul, as pre-eminently the
{238}
servant, but I have deliberately selected Timotheus because, as I said, his service extends to our own times, that is, the kind of service seen in him; as the apostle says, "As a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings". He "served with me" -- this is a suggestion for all young persons, brothers and sisters, who would serve, that they may learn to serve with others. If you are ever to serve according to God, you must learn to serve with others, and with others who have been serving before you in the testimony so that you may receive all the gain possible. So the apostle, finding Timotheus, would have him to go with him (@Acts 16:3), discerning, doubtless, what was in the young man; he was not yet to serve, but to go with him. Every one who is in the service, and in any way qualified and owned of the Lord in it, should have this in mind. If there are young persons with qualities that may thus be developed in service, let us have them to go with us. They will not detract from us in any way; they will encourage us. An interested person nearby is a great stimulus, whatever we are engaged in, whereas uninterested persons nearby are a hindrance; they create an atmosphere of hindrance and difficulty. But then there is the thought of these interested persons becoming servants themselves; and I may say here, dear brethren, that, whilst the number of Levites according to @Numbers 4:48, from thirty years old and upward, was very considerable -- some eight thousand five hundred -- yet, as they were presented to God, as they were brought near, and prepared, and presented as a wave-offering to God, He says virtually, 'I would like the number increased', for He immediately says, as you will remember, in @Numbers 8:24, that they are to enter on the service at the age of twenty-five instead of thirty. He had already said thirty; that was the primary thought, that the service should be carried on
{239}
in maturity, in full manhood, but they are brought near, and presented to Jehovah, and He immediately reduces the age limit and that increases the number; it is as if God intimated that *He liked them* -- that is a matter of great consequence, dear brethren, to be likeable in one's service. Of the great Servant it is said, "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!" (@Isaiah 42:1), that was what Jesus was to God, in His service. "I will put my Spirit upon him", He says; that is to say, likeability in service commends us to God. So as the Levites were presented as a wave-offering before His eyes, He reduces their age: that ought to be a word for every young brother here; God virtually says, 'I like them'. I am not now speaking of the Levites in their heavenly relations as in Joshua, but of them in service here; for the idea is that they were to be burden-bearers, to do active toilsome service; that is what is presented to us in this book -- heavy work. And as they are presented to Jehovah, He says, 'Let the age be twenty-five'. How many that lets in spiritually! it lets in a great number, and there is a great appeal for this, dear brethren, at the present time -- the Lord has need of you. I would say to every young man and woman, 'The Lord has need of you'. He has need of the elder, the trained, the experienced, ones too; for how are the young to learn save as they observe others? I have no doubt the age, reduced by the five years, suggests a novitiate here in this book, but it is not so stated; it is rather that God approved of the Levites, and it is said very significantly, "God helped the Levites" (@1 Chronicles 15:26). They need our prayers, but God helps them specially; He loves them, as pre-eminently seen in Jesus in whom, He says. "My soul delighteth".
Well now, Timotheus, I believe, was a likeable young man; he was well-reported, we are told, of the brethren; and every one essaying to serve must
{240}
bear in mind that they have to get the brethren's report. It is not merely a matter of ability, it is a matter of moral qualifications as well as gift; and that is what comes out in Timotheus -- he was "well reported of" and Paul would have him to go, as much as to say, 'This is the young man I need'. He had just lost Barnabas, a great servant too, one of whom the Spirit of God says much, a titled servant, as we may say, a "Son of consolation", but he separates from Paul; they separated from one another, and though God is with Paul, yet he would feel the loss of his brother. What happy times they must have had together! -- in suffering too -- in their service. But now it is Timotheus, a young man with little or no experience, but Paul would have him to go with him; it is, as it were, his novitiate, he is to be with a great servant. We heard this afternoon, the twelve were *with Jesus*; as with Him what wonderful service they would see! Thus they were trained, beloved brethren, they learnt how to serve from the great Servant.
Now I just want to show how this trained service bears on the persons of the saints, for that is what Merari represents. His service alludes to the persons of the saints. Gershon's service alludes to the principles that govern us -- a great matter. It is not that one serving today is a Gershonite, and another a Merarite; these services are to be combined in the servants. That is to say, if we think of Merari, we have to have an eye to the saints personally; they are valuable as the work of God; they are valuable because of the purchase price; even "the weak brother", we are told, is one "for whom Christ died" (@1 Corinthians 8:11) -- we are valuable in that light. There is not much in the way of the work of God to be seen in the weak brother, but Christ died for him and he is to be nursed; invalided he may be, but he is to be nursed and watched over; he is to be guarded and
{241}
not to be stumbled. So Abraham stands out at the outset in the household of faith -- for it is a question of the household -- as leading out three hundred and eighteen persons in an emergency; that is how it should read, he *led* them out. Who are they? They are trained servants. What a trainer he must have been! how experienced! There is this thought, beloved, at the very outset of the household of faith, for that is what Abraham stands for among other things -- the head of the household of faith. He led out three hundred and eighteen trained servants, all born in his house; they were not hired, for the hireling is not in view. Not that the servant who labours is not partaker of the fruit, not that he has not hire, in a sense, but they are not contracted wages; the idea is what love would have for wages -- if you put it that way. There is no such thought properly, in the household of faith, as hired servants; they are not to be relied upon; they are treacherous servants. The prodigal had in mind that his father had hired servants and he would be one of them; but when he got there, there is not a word about hired servants! No real lover of God wants to be viewed thus; he is a slave, if you wish to call him that, indeed that is what they were called. There were *bondmen* in the house of the father of the prodigal, and the father addresses them under the personal pronoun 'us'; see the beautiful relations in the household of faith between the master and the servant! The Lord Jesus leads the way in that too, as you know, in the type: He was a slave -- a bondman -- He took that place; nobody ever imposed slavery or bondmanship on Him; it is His own election; it is the length to which love will go; that is the idea. He could have gone out free, but love will go that way; it is not imposed, but it is nevertheless real service; and hence the servants may take that place. Paul was that, a "bondman of Jesus Christ", but he was an
{242}
honoured official servant, too. He is a bondman, it is love's own election, and that is what the prodigal found in the father's house -- he found such as these, who could go inside, into the treasury, as it were, and bring out the best things that were there -- they had access within. That is the beautiful state of things, dear brethren, in the economy of God; and it is very attractive that one should have part amongst the bondmen of God, the bondmen of Jesus, and to be able to say, "Ourselves your servants" -- that is, the servants of the saints, "for Jesus¬ sake". So that Abraham "led out his trained servants" we are told, these three hundred and eighteen persons, born in his house, and he was successful in a military way. The Spirit of God mentions the skill and great energy which marked him, for he had a long way to go, from Hebron to Damascus is a good distance, but he pursued them there, and set his forces in array, and was successful. He divided himself against them by night, with true military ability, his servants being trained; but I wish not to speak of military exploits, dear brethren, but of the fact that these trained servants were employed in regard of persons. Lot had been captured, and many of our brethren, most, alas, are in captivity; but there is this encouragement in regard of them, they are prisoners of hope; it is possible to rescue them. The prophet Zechariah indeed speaks of the pit in which they are, as having no water; they can be rescued, as Joseph was, so that there is hope, it is not impossible. This seemed an impossible undertaking of Abraham's, for these were mighty kings relatively, and the distance they had gone was great; that he should pursue them and overtake them seemed almost too much to hope, but he was successful. Let us not therefore be discouraged, dear brethren. Our brethren need to be rescued, and Lot was rescued, and his family -- *persons* were rescued, and the property. Now I do not speak
{243}
of the property; that is not what I have in mind although it is not to be despised: property is necessary; but I am speaking now of persons. It was a great victory, securing persons and property, and when Abraham returned the king of Sodom said, 'I will take the persons, or the souls, and you take the property'. I have no doubt that the king of Sodom included Lot in his suggestion, for Lot belonged to Sodom, alas; but in these exploits we do not want to recognise Sodom's claim on the persons. No, we want to assert the claims of Christ on the persons; we want to assert that they are as we are; in fact, as the apostle said, "Be as *I* am, for *I* also am as *ye*", (@Galatians 4:12). Every christian has part in the inheritance of sonship, and other things that one may mention. It is a question of conveying to them what is their proper heritage. "Be as *I* am, for *I* also am as *ye*"; we know well enough there was a great difference between Paul and the Galatians practically, but not in regard to the inheritance. Every true christian is an heir; as Paul says, "but if son, heir also", indeed, as it reads, "heir also through God" (@Galatians 4:7) as if to assert it is immutable, nothing can shake it! God Himself has made us heirs; and you can say that to any christian, whatever pit without water he may be in; it ought to be a leverage in his soul to lift him out of it, that he has such a great heritage. You convey to him that you are enjoying the inheritance; you have the earnest of it in the Spirit, and if he sees you enjoying it, there is some hope of his coming along.
Well now, the persons were secured, and the king of Sodom would have all the souls. No doubt he valued Lot, for these brethren of ours -- christians -- are valued in the world; they adorn the world, provided they do not pull down the world, that they do not assert the rights of Christ in it. As soon as you bring in the assembly and all it involves, you will not be liked in Sodom; but as long as you keep silence
{244}
about these things, and go on with the world and its ways, you are an adornment to it. There is not one amongst us who might go to any of the denominations who would not be accepted, I believe. They would say, 'We can offer you more: a wider field', and so on. Poor Lot was of that kind, the kind that would be valued in Sodom; he sat in the gate, we are told later on, and Abraham does not say anything here about him. How Abraham would feel about him, 'I have brought him back, but I cannot have him in the household of faith'. The next move should be Lot's, and there is no move, not a word of any move on the part of Lot to join again with his great benefactor who had been so good to him. How often we see that. That is the setting of Abraham and his trained servants here, and I need not add, dear brethren, there is a great field opened up to us, to anyone who is disposed to serve; the field is very great and large, and anyone who knows of it prays the Lord of the harvest to thrust out labourers into His harvest.
Now I want to show that, as Abraham in his house had trained servants, *God* has trained servants in His house; that is seen in the book of Numbers. It is said that Moses was faithful in all God's house; that is what is alluded to. What we get in these typical books, and is included in them, is the training of servants -- that there should be trained servants in the house. I have read these verses about Merari that we might see, typically, how the persons are in mind. I may say here, dear brethren, that these books -- Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, are what should be called ministerial books, as over against Genesis. What is stressed in these books is ministerial authority, a most important fact for us, in whomsoever it may be stressed amongst us, there is that. Christ is the great Servant, but He is in the house as Son. He has built the house, He is greater than the house as a Son over the house, and
{245}
the servants that He has are all sons, all in liberty, but nevertheless *trained*. In no service is there more need for skill, for training, than in the service of God; and that is what is implied in the book of Numbers; so the servants¬ work is classified under three heads, the Kohathites, the Gershonites and the Merarites. It is not that a Kohathite is one, and a Gershonite another, and a Merarite another today; these three features must be seen in every servant. The Kohathite represents that feature that is careful about the Person of Christ, about His deity; that guards the Persons of the Deity in Their proper relations. Everything of God, of Christ, of the Spirit, and, I may say, of the assembly, is to be guarded with the utmost jealousy, the jealousy of love -- that is the service of the Kohathite. And, in order to stress that, the Kohathite, viewed as such, was not even to look at these holy things; they were to be covered by the priests, showing the holiness of what we have to do with, what the things of God are, lest we should be profane in regard to them. How easily we might be this, and treat them lightly and loosely! One feature in this chapter especially, is that the priest is the great ruling principle in all the service. We must look for the priestly element in all service; without it no service is of any value, however pretentious it may be. We must have the priesthood, we must have Aaron and his two sons, and Moses too. Aaron presents the priestly side, for the priests¬ lips were to keep knowledge, and his two sons; Eleazar stands out as "the prince of princes of the Levites", that is the great spiritual, or princely, element amongst us; and without it, professed ministry is valueless among us. When we come to Merari, we get the impression that the things he was to look after are named. It says, "And by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden" (@Numbers 4:32). This, I believe, is peculiar to his charge, to
{246}
his service. Not that other things are not named, principles and the like, which Gershon has to do with, the curtains and the coverings, these have their own designation. The word 'principle' is a good word; it is very much used amongst us, and rightly so. Believers should be persons of principle, not simply of detail; that is one of the great outstanding thoughts of God. One has often illustrated it by a web of cloth in the loom. What is called the warp is stretched along, very lengthy at times -- and the weft, or woof, is thrown across. The principles are like that, they are like the warp of the fabric; the threads that are thrown across are the working out of the thing in detail, so that you have something definite, you have a web of cloth, so to speak -- something definite. Now the warp, the principles, I think, is what is to be seen in Gershon; and Merari would work the thing out, and show how things are upheld, so that we have the boards, and the pillars, and the bases, that is what he is occupied with; these are persons; you cannot have the church without persons. Principles alone will not do for the church, it is not a theoretical matter; the Eastern religions are pretty nearly all theoretical, you get no exemplification of them, not even in their authors; whereas in christianity, the thing is exemplified in Christ, and in His servants, too, in measure. Hence the book of the Acts is not simply a book of principles, but it is a book of precedents, what the persons did, and what they were. Well, the question is, What am I in comparison with these great men? Peter takes "great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three" (@John 21:11); these are all spiritual thoughts. John brings in the idea of names; he speaks about Simon, that when the Lord saw him He said, "Thou shalt be called Cephas" (@John 1:42) -- that is He gave him a name. Matthew says the Lord said to Simon, "*thou* art Peter" (@Matthew 16:18). We have often said these things, but we
{247}
forget them, we forget what is told us. Matthew has in mind the building, but John has in mind the persons that are used in the building. How great it is to be one of these persons! 'great persons', as John says. So in chapter 20 he says the Lord came to where the disciples -- that is, the persons -- were. Now that is what Merari has in mind; they are given to him *by name*. Every saint has a name in the Lord's mind; I cannot conceive of anything else in purpose; but, as soon as you are converted, when the Lord sees you, He says, You shall be called so-and-so. Surely that is right; we shall all have names in heaven; we shall be distinguishable. I believe the Merarites see that the Lord has something in mind in regard of each; such would say, 'He has bought him with His precious blood, and I must take care of him; I must see that young man or woman is not stumbled. I must watch over him, nurse him'. He would pull him out of the fire if he is in it, though hating the garment spotted by the flesh, but pulling him out. Then if there is any virtue, you take account of that, you pursue that -- and God will be with you. That is the work of Merari, as I understand; the things that he is to look after are handed over to him by name. To be a true Merarite servant, you must know all the names of these things; they are given to you to care for, and that means that, in a local company, I must know the names of the local brethren. In a local gathering those who care for the saints should know them by name. John says, "Greet the friends by name" (@3 John:14); and how the apostle Paul in @Romans 16 goes over the names! Wonderful that he could remember them with all he had to think of -- every day the care of all the assemblies coming upon him; but he could mention all the names of those saints in Rome, and, not only so, but he could say something about each. Is there not some little thing to say about every
{248}
saint? Well -- that is Merari; and I commend this to you, dear brethren, in the light of Philippians. The apostle said, "I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly, that *I* also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on". It is a question of the persons, what state they are in; then he says, "I have no one like-minded" -- for it is a question of what Paul had, like Abraham's trained servants. You get the thought of "Paul and his company" very early in Paul's ministry, and it runs through; so he says, "I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on". That is the kind of man who, as I understand, is a true Merarite; not that he was not a Gershonite, for what the apostle said would indicate he was a man of principle too, but he cared with genuine feeling how the saints got on.
May God help us on these lines!
{249}
ACCESS
@Romans 5:1,2; @Hebrews 10:19 - 22; @Ephesians 2:18
J.T. In our reading here last evening we had these opening verses of @Romans 5 and the thought of access was considered a little. It occurred to me that that would be profitable for us at this meeting, not only as it appears there, but as in the other two scriptures read, that is Hebrews and Ephesians. The latter scriptures will enable us to consider, by the Lord's help, assembly privilege, which the Lord is concerned about, I believe, at the present time -- that His people should know how to draw near to God, to worship God. The first passage in Romans simply speaks of access into favour or grace. The passage in @Ephesians 2 contemplates much more, and instead of being *by* faith, in Ephesians it is said to be *through* Christ *by* the Spirit that we have access to the Father. The first scripture may perhaps be before us now specially. What is to be borne in mind in the types in the Pentateuch is that they contemplate a people near to God as of supreme importance. He had borne them on eagles¬ wings and brought them to Himself, so that they should be near. Then there is the unfolding of His covenant with them, the disposition of His mind and heart; He would have them near, but near in a certain dignified way, as a holy priesthood, and would dwell amongst them; then in Leviticus He would invite them to draw near. Leviticus contemplates that they would show their love, not only in being near as set around the tabernacle, but that they would draw near *themselves* with an offering, and I think these passages would help us as to this.
J.H.T. Are you suggesting that Exodus brings in favour, and Leviticus approach answering to it?
{250}
J.T. Answering more to Hebrews and Ephesians, I thought.
F.S.M. Would Queen Esther furnish the type of the first scripture? As she went in to the king she touched the golden sceptre. She was concerned to ascertain what was the mind of the king concerning her.
J.T. The king extending the sceptre would be an evidence of favour, that is what you had in mind?
F.S.M. Yes, it was an indication that the king was favourable.
J.T. In Romans, up to the end of this chapter, it is God coming out in grace through our Lord Jesus Christ -- the *out* line, as we might say, God coming out. Chapter 6 opens up the *in* line, that is our going in, and in a moral sense the *up* line. So that the preposition changes from *through* to *in*. "In Christ Jesus", "In the Spirit", and so on. But we have the inkling of it in this verse, the word "access". This is not God coming out but the way opens towards Him. Peace comes in from the resurrection of Christ. His death and resurrection occasion peace, but it is peace *towards* God, *towards* Him. That is, the movement of the heart is in that direction, what we have towards God, and then the access is a strengthening of that, the thought of access, not exactly to Him but *into* favour. Favour towards us is established and we have access into it -- we *stand* in it.
J.Tr. Would the appeal of Joseph to his brethren support that, "Come near to me, I pray you" (@Genesis 45:4)?
J.T. That runs with it. There was lack of confidence in them, but he would encourage them to nearness to dispel that lack of confidence.
W.S. Would you say the woman in @Luke 7 drew near with her offering?
J.T. She moved beyond what this chapter teaches but still it is included. She had a sense of liberty to draw near and handle the Lord Jesus Christ.
{251}
W.S. I was thinking of what the Lord says of her on that occasion, "She loved much".
J.T. That goes beyond our chapter. "She loved much" more properly fits in chapter 8 than in chapter 5 but the foundation of it is here. One is so in the light of the death and resurrection of Christ and God known in a realm of favour and grace that one moves in that direction. It is an *inward* movement and culminates in Ephesians. David built *inward*. This is the beginning of it. The effect of the gospel, simply received, is to lead us to move in this direction.
F.S.M. Does the expression, "This favour in which we stand", indicate access here?
J.T. This favour or grace. The "we" is characteristic of christians. "We" implies persons experiencing a realm of favour. Light has come into the soul through the gospel and there is movement contemplated -- access. That is what God is in Christ in this connection. You cannot question that He is favourable any more than you could question that mount Horeb was favourable to Israel when He said, "I have ... brought you to myself".
J.H.T. The glory filled the tabernacle in Exodus, and here, "We boast in hope of the glory of God". Does that lie before you in Leviticus -- display?
J.T. It does. The glory in Leviticus is what God is in the covenant -- that is what is before us on the threshold of the assembly, the shining out of God in His love. So that as things were made and brought to Moses, he puts them in their respective places. Each is functioning in its place and it says, "The cloud covered the tent of meeting". God was saying, 'That is pleasing to Me'. Each saint taking his place and functioning in it -- God loves that. He covers it with a cloud as if He would take possession of it, and fills it with the glory. Here we boast in hope and glory. That is Romans is very explicit; Scripture always is, of course, but Paul in laying
{252}
the foundation presents truths very explicitly. We are not to bring Ephesians into Romans, but it is well to see the fundamental elements, how that the favour is to be boasted in. We come into something in our souls. Whatever others may think it is satisfying and assuring to ourselves.
T.W. Why is it "by faith" in Romans and by divine Persons in Ephesians?
J.T. You have a little of that here, you will notice. "Through our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom we have also access by faith". That is you have Christ here throughout; He is the blessed instrumentality of all that has come in. Ephesians contemplates the work of God in us. Faith is omitted in that particular setting -- access *through* Christ, *by* the Spirit. *Through* is one preposition and *by* is another. "By" signifies the power of the Spirit. Here it is through grace by faith.
F.S.M. Is the Lord Jesus Christ the true Boaz giving Ruth the sense of favour and grace so that she has boldness to draw near?
J.T. That is very good. The Lord Jesus Christ has such a place as instrumental. It is nothing of my doing at all. The believer says it is all through Another.
J.Tr. Does it involve a movement on our side here?
J.T. I think it does. The characteristic "we" implies that some are in that. Access implies that some come into it. The instrumentality here is the great thing. The Lord Jesus Christ is in the mind of the believer -- through Him. What can there be otherwise? Not only that He died and rose again but He is by your side to effect everything. The principle of it is faith; the Spirit is not mentioned. Faith contemplates that things are against you. What you speak of is not confirmed by anything that can be seen. What have you got to show? That is what faith
{253}
means. I think very largely is a question of myself. Whatever others think, it is what you have in your own soul.
W.S. Is that the reason Abraham is brought in at the end of chapter 4?
J.T. It is a question of his faith in what God says. "Against hope believed in hope". It is a question of the power of God -- what one has in one's soul here. If I have access into this favour it is what I have got. That is all that is necessary for salvation in its delivering power.
Ques. Is it not rather remarkable that it is put, "we have also access", they are already there?
J.T. The speakers are there -- some are there.
J.W. Is the access equal to the approach of God to us?
J.T. The access must be equal to the approach to us. Access is put in here as initial. It does not go very far but yet it is a delivering element. There are those who stand in this favour, in the sense that God is favourable. It helps greatly to compare this passage with @Exodus 19.
Ques. Is this largely how God has come out and met things from His side and how we come into it by faith?
J.T. The 'in' line begins here. There is the way in. Not far compared with Ephesians but still considerable.
Ques. You were speaking of what the believer had. Would that be like Abraham who had the witness that he was righteous?
J.T. Yes, but this is the sense that you are in the favour of God. I know that God is for me. I see it clearly that He is favourable. There is much to follow this. The dignity He puts upon us in our nearness to Him, but I see here that there is a way in towards Him. Peace is *towards* Him and access is *into* favour and it is this favour in which we stand --
{254}
there are some in it. That is the value of believers in the gospel meeting, they *have* something, whatever others think, and that thing delivers and satisfies.
S.B. Would you say that Abel recognised in God's having clothed his parents that He was favourable, and therefore he could approach Him with his offering?
J.T. We have to read between the lines in Scripture and I suppose Abel would enquire of his father and mother where they got the clothes from, and no doubt they would tell him God gave them, and that would produce something in his mind. As having faith he would think about that and it would be light in his soul and lead to his presenting the right kind of offering, and in that he was accepted. We must not put these words into Abel's mouth but the Spirit of God intimates there was something like that in his soul. We stand in it, Paul says. Anyone speaking with an assurance like that must have some effect upon his hearers. He has something.
J.H.T. Why did you refer to @Exodus 19?
J.T. Because of what happened there. Israel had moved. They passed Rephidim, it says, and pitched before the mountain. The battle of Rephidim is important but they had passed that and moved to the mountain and camped there, and God now speaks to them. He conveys to them His thoughts about them. They are of great interest to Him, in His favour, and He is ready to clothe them with great dignity. That is what this epistle does -- God is ready to clothe the believer with great dignity. God conveys, in @Exodus 19, what His mind is in a general way, before He opens up the details of the covenant. He has great regard for them. That is what the gospel is: it sets forth what God is ready to do for you. He has brought you to Himself and there is much more. This epistle does not end here but I am afraid it does for many people. The Reformation
{255}
did not take believers much beyond chapter 4. In @Exodus 19 God indicates He is ready to go a long way; they have a great place in His mind, and He is ready to dignify them.
Ques. Does it go as far as the best robe?
J.T. Not quite so far. Romans hardly gives us the best; it prepares us for it.
Ques. Would this suggest how the soul comes into the lordship of Christ?
J.T. I think it does. That is one great point in Romans, to establish the authority of Christ in the souls of believers.
F.S.M. In @Exodus 19 it says, "I have ... brought you to myself", and a little later, "Ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests". Is it that we should abide there, we should be to Him? Is not this initial in Romans?
J.T. Yes, in Leviticus "Ye shall be to me". What they *are* as drawing near to Him, do you not think?
F.S.M. The first is in view of this. Could we have Hebrews and Ephesians if we do not enter in faith and power into @Romans 5?
J.T. I do not think we could. Many do take a short cut into Ephesians but I think, as we were seeing last night, it is a question of step by step, item by item. We have here the idea of favour; then we have later the love, but access into favour precedes that thought. It is the beginning of the inward movement that culminates in Ephesians, where the Father is expressly the object of the movement.
J.H.T. Is this the first impress God would put upon the soul -- the sense of favour, and then the covenant (@Hebrews 10) to give boldness to move from our side?
J.T. That is exactly the thing here. The covenant I think in the type includes @Exodus 24. Love is particularly stressed in that chapter and, according with that, the idea of going up. But love is there in
{256}
volume, typified in the blood in the basins. It is the blood of the covenant and that is what is in mind here, the love of God shed abroad in our hearts in the power of the Spirit.
Ques. Is the first point in Exodus His movement? "Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians". God calls attention to His intervention on their behalf.
J.T. Just so, and then there is the thought of dignifying them and the blood of the covenant in such volume so that there is no question about it: it is there. Then I believe there is the Spirit's action -- the people were sprinkled with it. The Spirit's action is to make that a *known* thing in the believer's heart -- the love of God. That is the basis of the tabernacle really -- it is what the Spirit has put into our hearts.
J.H.T. Why do the youths of the children of Israel come in in that chapter?
J.T. Priesthood had not as yet been formally inaugurated. I think it is to bring out the freshness of things, that the current work of God implies all that is necessary. Not yet an official priesthood but persons who can do the work in keeping with the moment. It is the start of things. "I remember for thee", says Jehovah, "the days of thy youth", the movement, I think, of their love. That was pleasing to God. It should touch all the young brothers and sisters. We who are older know how refreshing it is when a young brother stands up and speaks in a priestly way by the Spirit.
J.H.T. Why is that freshness not carried on into Hebrews and Ephesians?
J.T. You have more in your mind?
J.H.T. That freshness should continue with us. The fresh impress of the favour of God in which we stand immovably ought to continue in freshness, running on into Ephesians.
J.T. I think it is intended to continue, but when
{257}
we come to Hebrews we have mournfully to recognise it is a matter of recovery. You cannot get freshness with retrogression, you have to deal with the bare terms of the light governing the position. The saints are not even called priests in Hebrews, which is a very humbling thing, but the teaching in Hebrews is intended to make us priests, not only in youthful freshness but in heavenly dignity. Great stress is laid on the priesthood in *heaven* in Hebrews. Not only freshness but heavenliness, "Partakers of the heavenly calling" (chapter 3:1).
J.H.T. Would the word as to Timothy at the end of Hebrews imply freshness?
J.T. Yes, one young man at any rate is set at liberty. "Know that our brother Timotheus is set at liberty" (chapter 13:23). That is a word for the young men. That is what is required -- men like that.
F.S.M. 'Having boldness to enter, let us approach'. It is in the form of an exhortation.
J.T. People were not approaching; they were retrogressing, pretty much corresponding to what is in christendom. "By the blood of Jesus" is a most touching way, not the blood which has met my sins, but the way in. Sins are included, but it is the blood of Jesus as a way in, a living way. That word "living" applies to persons, that is, that I am not simply a sacramentalist, but that I am actuated in spiritual power in my movements.
J.Tr. Would you say a word as to the bearing of the blood of Jesus here?
J.T. The bearing of it is in relation to the teaching of chapters 8, 9 and 10. It is the blood of the covenant. The teaching that leads up to this begins at chapters 8, 9 and 10 up to this verse. It is put in this way to be appealing -- "By the blood of Jesus". "The new and living way" implies the Spirit, I think. We cannot have anything save by the Spirit. It includes what we get in Ephesians, but it is put in this initial
{258}
way. It is not dead like the sacramentalism current at that time in Jerusalem; it is a living thing. You could not say how many meetings of saints there would be at Jerusalem after Pentecost, probably a meeting in every street, people having the Holy Spirit and worshipping God in a living way. It was a new thing brought into Jerusalem. The opposers said Jerusalem was filled with their doctrine, but Jerusalem was filled with *living* persons who drew near to God by the Spirit to worship by the Spirit. But they had gone back from that and the apostle is alluding to it. There was a *living* state of things brought in and it was for them to go that way.
J.Tr. Does it carry the thought of that precious life of Jesus poured out sacrificially to God?
J.T. I think it does. It ought to touch every christian that it is the blood of Jesus that has opened up a living way, and that implies the Spirit. "Through the veil, that is, his flesh". You see beyond the flesh, Christ as He is now, Christ in heaven.
W.S. The blood of Jesus came from the side of Jesus, so it speaks better things than that of Abel.
J.T. It touches the heart. The living way is by the Spirit, I think. It must be, for there is no other way of drawing near to God than by the Spirit.
F.S.M. Is this the basis of worship? Does it lie at the basis of the service of God?
J.T. That is so. It helps me to go back to the early days. What a scene every Sunday, yea, every day. You see how simple yet how fresh and energetic it was. You might pass down any street in Jerusalem and they would be singing together in freshness. That was the new and living way, different from what was in the temple, although they did go into the temple in patient testimony. They were continually in it, praising and blessing God.
T.W. Had these believers had part in that and were slipping away from it?
{259}
J.T. That is right, so the word, "Remember your leaders". Possibly there were some going on with it but generally there was a falling back.
Ques. Does the veil exclude what is not of the Spirit?
J.T. I think the veil is still there, but we go through it. We see Jesus where He is, crowned with glory and honour. Others do not see Him, although the system of things with which He stood connected stands -- He stood connected with the law -- but we see Him now passed out of all that. We see Him in heaven, the Holy Spirit making it a very real thing to us.
J.W. Would the veil in Hebrews be the veil of the tabernacle or the temple?
J.T. The tabernacle is in mind. They will not go through the veil in the millennium; the Jews will not get inside, but we go there now. Hebrews is the book of the opened heavens, you see everything up there. The new and living way has all that in mind.
F.A. Is it as we learn the value of the blood that we have this boldness?
J.T. Just so. Boldness to draw near and to enter the holiest, that is the greatest privilege. Aaron even was denied this, for he could only enter once a year and then under restriction. The veil is still up as regards Israel -- but we go through it.
J.Tr. "Through the veil, that is, his flesh". How does that thought work out?
J.T. You get past it. @John 9 helps as to it. What Jesus was here comes to light.
F.S.M. What is the object of access in Hebrews?
J.T. The service of God, but the holiest is necessary for instruction. You see there what He is going on with; just as in @Exodus 24 the elders, who went up and saw what was under His feet, saw the God of Israel. I believe entrance into the holiest enables us to see what is before God, what He is
{260}
going on with. You see Christ, not only as He was here, but as He is there. God is not going to change His mind, and I learn what that mind is. I doubt if anyone is in the assembly according to God's mind who does not understand the holiest.
W.S. Is there a distinction between the holiest and the house of God?
J.T. The house of God is a more general thought. Moses was servant in it; Christ is Son over it. It includes the assembly now. Christ is over the house as *great* priest here, not simply high priest. It means He will come down alongside you and do anything for you to set you free to go in. Everything is to set you free to go in there according to God.
Ques. Does it help us to contemplate what Christ is to God?
J.T. The idea is contemplation. I see what is there and, understanding what is there, I know how to be in it suitably. The assembly is a wider thought.
J.H.T. In Leviticus if any one would draw near there were specific directions as to what he was to bring and how he was to bring it. Does that help you to go in?
J.T. Yes, the priests are there, but it cost them something to be there.
Ques. In chapter 9 it speaks of Christ entering in by His own blood. Has that any reference to our chapter?
J.T. Yes, to bring out the value of the precious blood. He has entered in on our side in all the value of the precious blood.
T.W. Is this book for the present day of the church?
J.T. It is for us, not for Israel. The epistle is for us, for christians.
J.W. Hebrews carries us as far as the holiest, but does not take us in?
J.T. Ephesians is the highest thought, I think.
{261}
The access is *through* Christ in the power of the Spirit. I think it might be read in that way. It is only thus we can approach the Father.
J.H.T. Is this verse in Ephesians one of the most comprehensive verses in Scripture?
J.T. Three divine Persons to be approached. "We both" is a collective thought. Every christian says, 'I am going to have the brethren'. You must have the brethren with you. You are not individual; you are always thinking of others. "Raised us up together", seated *together*. "We both have access". You could not have the assembly with the converted Jew only, you must have both.
J.Tr. Is this the priestly support you refer to?
J.T. Yes, that is what it is. Through Christ, in the power of the Spirit, we have access to the Father. The Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Son and the Spirit serving us. It is very wonderful and very touching and shows what a great subject this is, so that there might be approach to God to worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
Ques. Are the other two thoughts of access individual movements, and is this a collective movement?
J.T. This is more especially collective when it says, "We both". That is a collective thought. The 'we's' in Hebrews and Romans are just characteristic 'we's'. Let *us* draw near, such persons as we are.
Ques. Is it somewhat similar, "Every one ... in Zion appeareth before God"?
J.T. That is only Zion, you know, but Asaph is very prominent in the third book of Psalms and he begins by telling us, "Until I went into the sanctuary" (@Psalm 73:17). He would go inside and most of the Psalms in the third book belong to him. He begins by telling us that he went into the sanctuary and then he understood. There are no mixed feelings there, for you have done with what is outside and are satisfied with what is inside. That is what heaven will be,
{262}
no mixture at all but everything according to God.
Ques. Is sonship involved in this access?
J.T. I think it is. That is, we are at peace and the covenant love of God sets our hearts free. "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives". They took up Christ's place before God; they took that up collectively. They left Jerusalem; *they* did it. There is not a word about Jesus doing anything in that movement. Not that He was not there, but they moved collectively to that place. That is what enters into @Ephesians 2:18, collective movement. You are in liberty; the Son has His place. He directs the movement now, and through Him, in the power of the Spirit, we draw near to the Father.
{263}
ADDITION
@Genesis 30:24 - 34; @Acts 11:22 - 26
I have read in Genesis because of the meaning of Joseph's name. The chapter is full of instruction in regard to names, showing, that is, in a divine sense, their significance. Names have meanings; an examination of the chapter will reveal this. It is not that God directly gives the names, but the Holy Spirit mentions them, giving the reason in the text for each of the names of those who ultimately became tribes of Israel, destined to have a place in the purposes of God and in the ways of God beyond any other persons. Rachel's remark here indicates that, however little she understood, the Spirit of God had in mind completion, that the number should be completed, that there will be twelve tribes. In the mind of God there is a certain number, there will be no more nor less. The more we know of God the more we expect this. Nothing is left open; His counsels require a certain number and that number will be secured. That I should be in it, of course, is my concern. It is God's concern but in the gospel it is my concern. It is put to me as a matter of my concern, that I should be not only among the called but among the chosen, the chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world -- a most elevating thought for the believer. To confirm this, in the book of Revelation we have in one chapter a carefully counted number, one hundred and forty-four thousand, they are carefully selected. Then in the second part of the chapter we have a crowd, a multitude that no one can number. It is manifest, in saying no one can number, that He is excepted who numbered in the early part of the chapter. That is, God is excepted. He numbers, and in that unnumbered multitude there is not one more than God
{264}
had in mind. As knowing God we understand this, dear brethren, and whatever Rachel's intelligence might have been, her remarks are recorded by the Spirit to show that addition was then needed. There were only eleven in Joseph but God would add to her, she says, another son, not another child but another *son*. Dinah had been added to Leah but that did not make up the number twelve. There are twelve children already in the chapter, but one of them is Dinah. Her name is something like the feminine of Dan -- an important name for a sister -- that is, the element of judgment. Dan shall judge his people as another of the tribes of Israel. So Dinah, as true to her name, would judge. One of the greatest things, dear brethren, amongst us is the element of judgment -- of knowing how to tell the difference between right and wrong, and sisters are to be brought into this. But Dinah does not complete the number in the mind of the Spirit of God -- she is not a *son*. The male side is always in evidence in Scripture, not in an exclusive way but in an inclusive way, including the female. The word 'man' primarily includes both, "Let us make man in our image", "male and female created he them". It is a question of quality, I mean the masculine and feminine, all looking on to Christ and the assembly. The whole marital thought and that of gender in Scripture look on to Christ and the assembly, a combination in what is spiritual. The feminine is essential in that sense, so we have the bride in relation to the eternal state of things. We may settle down in that thought, dear brethren; male and female comes under the one head in that sense. But it is there nevertheless, Dinah does not complete the number here, it required another, and Rachel says, "Jehovah will add to me another son". The idea of adding is introduced and it is limited; it is limited in her mind -- another son. It covers the present moment for there is another wanted yet.
{265}
God has not finished yet; He is going on in the filling out of His thoughts; how long He may continue we cannot say, but that He will continue until the last is secured is a certainty. Then alas, how many will be left out. That is a solemn side to be noted by those who do not know they are numbered, that they are amongst the selected number. It is for each to tell, to be sure in his own soul, that he belongs to the number.
But the thought of adding is introduced and what I have in mind now is to produce certain moral effects of this and responsibility attaching to it. This is worked out in Jacob. Rachel reached her end, the prophetic word. In great sorrow she died. That is another thing. The Spirit of God says she died at the birth of this other son, Benjamin. I want to refer to that in a moment. But Jacob here, as Joseph is born, had in mind that he must move. The thought of completion, the thought of the counsels of God, is intended to make us move. They are not accomplished in relation to this place, to what Padan-Aram may represent. That was not Jacob's place, it was his place as a hireling. He knew what addition meant in that place -- he had sons and daughters there, but he had more, he had the thought of wealth. Now, he said, I want to go out of this place. It is a spiritual movement of his soul when Joseph is born. No doubt he recognised the prophetic word of Rachel and would be in accord with it, at least for the moment. That addition, that completion, that final son belonged to Canaan. Finality in God's mind, beloved, is not in this world but in *that* world and the resurrection, His own world, that is what is in His mind. So that adding in this world is very precarious. It is the completion that brought the thing home to Jacob; he says, I must move out. Not indeed that Rachel had spoken of addition until Joseph was born, the person whose name meant
{266}
addition -- that of Christ. All addition must be in that setting, not in this world; it belongs to Canaan. Christ is living in relation to Canaan. Take the gospel of John, the whole trend of it is Canaan. What is it to be there? "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend" (chapter 20:17). But alas, dear brethren, Jacob had these second thoughts that are often so ready to replace the original thoughts, tending to disaster. It is one of the greatest things that if one has a right thought, a confirmed thought, in his soul, not to allow it to be replaced under any circumstances. The first thought was right, to go out. It belonged to another world and that meant that all the others had to get into that other world. So these second thoughts, these disastrous thoughts, that even come in with us, lay hold on Jacob. It referred to his peculiar proclivity, that is gain in this world. It has come down to us in the most striking manner. Those who know the posterity of Jacob after the flesh know how they are marked by grovelling in this world, in the dust of it, for earthly gain. Jacob's second thought was, of course, suggested to him by Laban, who can scarcely have a spiritual thought. There are men like that -- you feel instinctively of certain persons they can scarcely conceive a spiritual thought, much less give expression to it, and still more unlikely to carry it into effect. Laban was one of that kind; an unfair master, an unfair father-in-law, an unfair brother, for he regarded Jacob in that light. He thought of his own gain for he knew he had been blessed through Jacob.
This is a very important matter for young people, for these suggestions come quickly enough. As soon as a spiritual thought lays hold of your heart and you give expression to it, the enemy is on the alert and will bring everything possible to bear upon you so that that thought may be displaced by another taking its place. It was seemingly a very legitimate
{267}
thought, 'Why should I not stay with my father-in-law and help him?'. But then Jacob's proclivities entered into it; his thought was wages. He had had them changed ten times. I suppose he would be a labour leader, speaking respectfully of him. But that proclivity is the idea of trade unionism. It tells us elsewhere that his wages had been changed ten times. Here the idea of wages is the prominent thought between himself and his father-in-law. The enemy is always ready to offer wages. God does not care for hired servants. If anyone takes that place He will pay them, as the parable tells us, but He has no interest in hired labourers. His thought is slaves, but slaves who are sons, if you understand. God's thought is bondmen but persons who are secretly sons with Him. As a bond-slave you cannot do anything without your master. Even the Lord Jesus Christ said, "The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing", but He was the Son, known to be that; He was conscious of it. So everyone who is rightly a bondman of God, is secretly a son. It is the idea of heart service, "By love serve one another". The wages is in the service, that is the truth. Love serves, its wages is in the service. Anyone who stands up to serve the saints as a burden does not serve them really. His wages are in the service; it is a pleasure to serve the saints. See who they are and who their Master is. See the dignity of it. "I love my master ... I will not go free" (@Exodus 21:5). It is a realm of love, that is what it is. Bond-slavery according to God is in the realm of love. It is wearying at times: the Lord was weary, dear brethren, but nevertheless He says, "Who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink" (@John 4:10), *who* it is, that is serving. A bondman, yes, but the *Son*. Bondmen of God, but sons of God. That position is exceedingly attractive. I speak of it now that young people may see it and come into it. What am I going to get?
{268}
That is poor. The prodigal had the idea of hired service and christendom is governed by that principle, those who serve are formally paid wages. The prodigal had that thought, 'In my Father's house are hired servants. I would like to be one of them', a very low thought, but when he got there, there is not a word about hired servants. There is a word about bondmen but such bondmen that had the key to the treasury, the place where the most precious things are. The bondmen are in the joy and dignity of the place, sharing in the joy of the house. I mention all this because of this wretched word 'wages' coming in here. Jacob is making his own terms with Laban. He is really covering up what was in his mind. Do not give me money, he says, but he knew what he was going to have; he was a shrewd bargain-maker. He retained Rachel, Joseph, and all his family, dear brethren, in Padan, whereas they all belonged to the land of Canaan; they all belonged to heaven, so to speak. That is what is written over the book of Genesis: it is a heavenly people. "They seek their country ... that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city" (@Hebrews 11:14,16). Jacob settles with his father-in-law and received reward, but not another son -- not there. The addition, according to the prophetic word, would be in Canaan. Jacob settled in Padan in spite of his words earlier, 'I want to go to my own people, to the land of Canaan'. He settled in Padan and added, but what did he add? Sorrow and the bitter hostility of Laban's house, and he well-nigh brought upon himself destruction. That is not the addition that God has in mind. If there is anybody here thinking of adding to himself the wealth of this poor world instead of what belongs to Canaan, you are sure to incur something like this, and you are to be warned.
Now I wanted to link on these thoughts with the
{269}
book of Acts. As one looks at the dear brethren here they become more and more delightful. They are worthy of the greatest service and one would say "ourselves your servants for Jesus¬ sake", for that really comes into the service. The more one looks into the countenance of the saints the more one loves to see them added to. What a spectacle presented itself in the early days, in what we call apostolic days. The Lord looked down from heaven at Pentecost, and what did He see? A crowd of names, one hundred and twenty names. You can afford to have a crowd if the names are distinguished enough, if you can pick them out. No one is lost who has a name. We read of seven thousand names of men destroyed presently in the book of Revelation -- they are the distinguished ones of this world -- one could mention thousands of them perhaps. But here are one hundred and twenty names, the handiwork of the Lord Jesus Christ, how delightful they were to Him! He had just gone up from them, blessing them. Now He would distinguish every one of them and looking down upon them He would know each of them. Then there were the three thousand. You can understand how the Lord would say, I would love to add to those. That is the feeling one has, more and more, as one sees the saints. The work of God came out at Pentecost; there it was and three thousand were added. "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised" (@Acts 2:41). The onus is on them to be baptised. Later on Peter commands baptism, but not here. It is to bring out quality. In the earlier days in Jerusalem there was no regulation; it was left to allow the work of God to show itself. Later on in Paul the testimony is regulated in the world. Not that the twelve do not regulate, but it is not put that way; what is said here is that those who received the word "were baptised". Peter had mentioned it in his address, of course he would, but they were baptised;
{270}
it was their own matter. The Spirit of God would invite us to look between the lines. What a day it was. Was there ever such a day in Jerusalem? The crucifixion transcends all, of course, but even Solomon's great celebration is nothing to this. Think of what it was: three thousand people in one day baptised! These people were not carried away by the preacher, although perhaps it was the most wonderful address that had been delivered, save the Lord's own, and indeed that address perhaps took a character that none of the Lord's addresses had assumed, and yet they were not carried away by the preacher. It is remarkable how traits of christianity enter into that chapter. "They ... said to Peter and the other apostles" (verse 37); they discerned apostleship in others. It is an important matter that we recognise what is of God in whomsoever it may be. These people could not have had a list of them; they were there with Peter -- the apostles were there and were discerned. Then it says they were added. It does not even say who added them. It is that kind of thing. These people must belong to those people; they are all of a kind. That is a christian must belong to christians. There are persons of that kind in this world; you belong to them and you should be with them; that is the idea. The thing was there and they were added, a large number of them. They certainly did not come before a care meeting as far as this passage goes, for they could hardly take up one by one. The mighty work of God was there in Jerusalem. It stands out by itself; there was nothing like it at all. The fresh power of God came in by the Spirit, came down from heaven.
They were just the kind of people that should be added, for "they continued stedfastly in the apostles¬ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers" (verse 42). In the midst of all this the apostles¬ miraculous power went on, as well as the work, the
{271}
wonderful works of God. The apostles go on and these dear people move on together, not in one place now. I do not suppose there was any place in Jerusalem big enough to hold them. They were together in *heart*, which is a greater thing. It is a great thing to be together in heart all over this district of England as is shown as we are together today. But this was the work of God; that is the point. They broke bread in the houses. What a scene in Jerusalem, households resounding with the praises of God! How many of them, who can tell? They went to the temple too; but they would say, We are here in patience to bear testimony, but we are more at home in our own houses than here. The house is the place of affection; the temple had lost that character. The Lord added to them, as if He were to say, 'It is great enough for Me to add to'. The word 'assembly' is not there in the original, but there was such a thing there as is described and He added to that. He added that which was most precious in His own mind, the final son, so to speak, for the number must be complete. They were those that were in the mind of God for salvation, the spared remnant; He has always somebody in His mind for His counsels require it.
That is chapter 2; then in chapter 5, so that this great thought should continue, we get the great sin of Ananias and Sapphira. A most solemn discipline -- for both of them died under the discipline of God and were buried. It is significant that their burial is mentioned. Our Lord was buried too in the same sense, I believe, buried by loving hands. His murderers would have put Him with the malefactors. "Men appointed his grave with the wicked" (@Isaiah 53:9), but that is not burial in the mind of God, not a burial of dignity. Brethren under discipline are to be regarded in their dignity; we must never forget that. After this solemn matter the saints are said to be in
{272}
Solomon's porch, which would mean that they bow to the discipline. Every saint bows to it, but as casting a stone. He or she has part in it. They were in Solomon's porch, a remarkable thing, as if they were bowing to the judgment. Then we are told that multitudes of men and women were added. So that we are not to be afraid of discipline; it would only help in the additions because we want to be according to God. Bringing in extraneous matter is only bringing in causes of sorrow. They were added to the Lord. They faced and bowed to and accepted all that belonged to the Lord in the way of authority, they were added to Him in that sense, to the Lord.
In this passage I have read we have a further thought, addition amongst the gentiles, that is ourselves. It always comes home to me "ye also", that is we gentiles are in the mind of God for blessing. How did it come about? Those that were scattered at the persecution of Stephen went as far as Antioch. Some only spoke to the Jews but there was such liberty that others went further than that. It was not what they were told to do but what they *did*. God likes that, brothers and sisters moving according to the divine nature that is in us and seeking to help other people. God likes to see us go further; it is a question of divine instinct. He did not tell them to go, but He says, 'I am with you as you go' -- the hand of the Lord was with them. As we were saying in prayer this afternoon, we feel the day of small things but what I would say is this, that what *is* is to be added to. It deserves to be added to. Heaven thinks so and any young man or woman who thinks so and moves according to it will find that the hand of the Lord is with him and there will be results. Many turned to the Lord; not merely to the saints now but to the Lord, which is in a sense greater. They faced the fact that the Lord has authority. We have to submit to it; we are not stronger than He. Why I
{273}
read these verses was because this great movement is extended and the word 'added' is mentioned in connection with Barnabas, as if God, whilst owning any that move with divine instinct, also specially recognises a man who is a good man, a good man filled with the Holy Spirit -- a rare kind of product of the work of God. These matters "reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem". It showed this characteristic which is in accord with heaven. It had ears to hear what God was doing and it moved accordingly, sending out this remarkable brother, "a good man and full of the Holy Spirit". How great the need is for such men! He was an unjealous man for he went and sought out Saul. He had a long way to go, but he sought and found him and brought him, with the result that they laboured in the assembly there for a year, these two remarkable brothers. The addition was brought in, constituting an assembly; that is the great thing in view: "The assembly which was there" through the labours of these two men. Then it is named, the saints are named; it says the disciples were called christians there -- that is their character is now fixed on them. Heaven and earth know these are the people. Not an official name as Wesleyans or Baptists but christians, a name we may say given divinely, not exactly by God but it is a fixed thing. We can glory in it for Peter says, "Glorify God in this name". He took account of it, if one suffer "as a christian, let him not be ashamed" (@1 Peter 4:16).
As a christian you should suffer under ordinary circumstances. Christ was here as suffering and the christian is suffering. You belong to them and you ought to be amongst them really if you want to take on this name that is called upon us -- christians.
That is what I had in mind, dear brethren, the importance of additions, but on these lines. Not additions according to the world but according to the counsels of God.
{274}
ESPOUSAL TO CHRIST
@1 Corinthians 11:1 - 25; @2 Corinthians 11:1 - 3
J.T. I have particularly in mind the remark in the last scripture, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ". This, which was in the apostle's mind in his service to the Corinthians as amongst them and now in writing to them, helps us to understand both letters. If we take the remark up in relation to Abraham's servant, we see how the ministry of Paul had in mind the presentation of the assembly to Christ. That is seen here, not as in Ephesians exactly. And what runs with that is the treatment of the feminine side of the truth in these epistles, particularly the first; all that there is in us in the way of attractiveness spiritually is to be for Christ, not paraded, not used to enhance ourselves in this world in any way, but to be concealed, kept for Christ. The use of the word 'veil' in the first scripture, (the proper rendering) serves to bring out the thought. What is being effected in us in the way of attractiveness, beautification, is for Christ, as indeed the same apostle told the Romans that they were "to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead" (@Romans 7:4). There is to be the comely concealment from the rude human gaze, from the defiled gaze of man, of what the Spirit is effecting in us so that we may be wholly for Christ.
P.L. "The servant said, That is my master! Then she took the veil, and covered herself" (@Genesis 24:65).
J.T. That is what I was thinking, the remarkable designation of Isaac by the servant -- not 'my master's son' now, but "my master", and then there was Rebecca's instinctive movement: she alighted off her camel as if to indicate that she was to be for Isaac.
{275}
Ques. Has this special reference to the assembly of God in a city, that is, the public position of the assembly?
J.T. Yes, I think so, the assembly of God which is in Corinth.
F.Fn. You are speaking of what is going on in secret in the way of the work of God in the souls of the saints coming out publicly?
J.T. Coming out so as to be for Christ. There are, of course, moral traits that come out through the body for public testimony, but there is that which is figuratively feminine which is to be for Christ. There is that which is *for* Him where He is, but there is that which is *to* Him where He is. I suggested the early part of chapter 11 simply to bring out the thought of the veil or covering in a woman, as suggestive of that feature in the assembly. There are three words used in this respect -- the word for covering, the word for authority and the word for veil in the passage, but I do not speak of it in detail, but only to indicate that the feminine side in the assembly is to be for Christ. There are moral traits, of course, that are public, as we can see elsewhere, but the covering or veil alludes to what is reserved for Christ, what cannot be shared in by others. The opposite of that, of course, is the public church of christendom, which has neglected this, and hence we have the gross conditions spoken of in the book of Revelation.
Ques. Would this refer to the subjective work of the Spirit in all the saints?
J.T. Yes, it is just the feminine thought used for that purpose. There is more than that in the passage, but I speak of it as leading up to what is peculiarly attractive in the assembly, which is for Christ and to be concealed from others.
The assembly at Corinth was a very young one, not as young as that at Thessalonica, but not
{276}
more than two years old. It is well to bear that in mind when we see the gross conditions allowed there. They had emerged from paganism, some of them less than two years before. What is also to be noted is that Paul, being the minister of the church, regards this assembly with more concern than we find elsewhere, with profound anxiety as to the result of having left them for a while, as to what Satan would do in his absence. Paul is concerned about the quality of what is to be actually presented to Christ, what indeed he had already done. He had espoused the saints there as a chaste virgin to Christ, to one Man, and in his mind that meant much.
F.Fn. Do you think we carry many things that cannot enter into that presentation?
J.T. That is what comes out in the history and in the types. It is the assembly in the wilderness. The feminine figure prominent in Numbers in that respect is the Ethiopian wife that Moses had married. The suggestion is that she was not attractive but Moses selected her, asserting (in type) the Lord's right to take up an assembly like that of Corinth, however much there might have been unsuitable to him or that others might think unsuitable. That a large number of persons should be converted and formed into an assembly in a very short time and presented to Christ may well be considered: they were drawn out of paganism and judaism and set up in an assembly and presented to Christ.
W.J.W. Verse 8, "Of the man"; verse 9, "For the man"; does that enter into what you have before you?
J.T. It does. In the full result the assembly is seen in that way. She is of Christ and for Him and He is not without her. She is essential to Him. That came out in the types: "It is not good that Man should be alone". And though the character she bore is seen in the Ethiopian wife yet she comes
{277}
up out of the wilderness leaning on her Beloved, beautified. That is what the servant has in mind: to present the church, not exactly as taken out of the side of Christ but with a long wilderness history, exposed to the vicissitudes of the wilderness, that *she* should come out of it entirely suitable to Christ. If we see that we shall see more clearly the meaning of the epistles. The apostle was jealous about them because of Satan's activities, and these activities are current now as never before.
-- .P. Is not the apostle putting it on a high level when he says that the woman is the glory of the man, so that Christ is seen morally in the assembly?
J.T. Yes, that is the thought. She is Christ's glory. These early verses in chapter 11 are to prepare us for concealment that what is intended for Christ should not be desecrated, exposed to the rude gaze of this world. All this enters into dress and deportment, what we are in public.
Ques. Is it your thought that what we are *for* Christ will depend upon what we are *to* Him?
J.T. I think so. The one is the counterpart of the other.
Ques. Would you mind distinguishing a little between the two sides?
J.T. What is to be to Him is first, and I think chapter 11 shows how the saints¬ affections are to be reached. We are reminded that we are not to expose ourselves in those features that belong to Christ through our loose ways or dress, but to hold ourselves as belonging sacredly to Him, His property. "Be to another".
Ques. Does that involve the Spirit's work in secret in our souls?
J.T. It does. The apostle would convey in all his ministry what he has in mind. Abraham's servant had one thing in mind governing him in his journey. I believe Paul would have in his mind, as to every one
{278}
converted, what that one was to be for Christ. So that what is for Christ is concealed. It is not exposed loosely to the gaze of this world -- the sacredness of the assembly as the sacred possession of Christ. Paul is moved by jealousy for Christ. "I am jealous as to you with a jealousy which is of God; for I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ".
Ques. Would you say this is addressed to every individual that forms part of the assembly?
J.T. That is what I understand. It is addressed to the assembly, and thus to the members of it.
P.L. Have you the thought in @Psalm 128:3: "Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the inner part of thy house"?
J.T. That is the idea. Privacy belongs to the inside.
P.L. "All glorious ... within" (@Psalm 45:13).
J.T. That is the thought: the King's apartments.
H.McM. Would Ruth be an illustration of the concealment in connection with the covering?
J.T. Well, that is pretty much the thought. I think the covering there was her measure. She had to hold up the cloak for Boaz to pour the barley into it. That was her measure spiritually. That is one thing. The other is to hold oneself femininely for Christ. What is for Him comes first.
I believe it will be seen by careful enquiry that Luke takes up the feminine side and shows in five persons who received blessing from Christ that in each ease the result would be for Him in some sense.
Ques. You were saying just now that in Corinthians it was the work of the servant in contrast to Ephesians where it is the work of Christ. Could you give us a little help as to that?
J.T. What the apostle had in mind helps us to understand his ministry in this assembly. He uses great care as to what he presented to them. He says
{279}
to them indeed that we know in part. Well, the more unspiritual we are the more that is true, that we have to learn in part. It is remarkable how he keeps to that. "Let the prophets speak two or three". That is, the saints can only take in a little at a time. He illustrates this in chapter 2 by saying, "I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified". He confined himself to that, so that the truth in question might be known as a great fundamental. The garments of the high priest were in parts, each to be taken by itself, and so the truth is to be known in part, the minister carefully gauging what he presents so that some one thing is laid hold of.
Ques. Is the idea seen in the five women in Luke that you mentioned? Would you say a word as to each?
J.T. The first is Peter's wife's mother. The Lord stood over her and rebuked the fever. It left her and she arose and served them. She was not partisan in her outlook. The situation in the house would probably provoke personal feeling, but she served them without any preference.
The woman in chapter 7 is the next. She is a lover of Christ. She loved much. A lover of Christ is for Christ. So He turned towards her. He did not stand over her, but turned towards her. That is deference, respect, as much as to say, 'There is something there to occupy and attract Me'. He turned towards her and spoke to Simon. Simon was a secondary matter; she was everything.
Then in chapter 8 we have the woman with the issue of blood. She is transparent. She falls down before Him and declares before all the people. In her case virtue had gone out of Christ. He was conscious that something had gone out of Him. I believe the idea is the formation of the body. The body is of Christ.
{280}
Then Mary in chapter 10 is in keeping with the light of the moment. The particular light of the moment was a voice from heaven: "*This* is my beloved Son: hear him". She was hearing Him, sitting at His feet, listening to what He was saying. The full result with her is seen in @John 12. She was for Christ. The house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
Then the woman in chapter 13 who had been bent over by the devil for eighteen years. The Lord called her, and said, "Thou art loosed from thine infirmity", and laid His hands on her and she was straightened and glorified God. The full result was reached for God.
W.J.W. Had you in mind that the thought of being for Christ enters into the Supper?
J.T. Yes. The Supper coming in after the thought of headship. In the early part of the epistle we are approaching what is calculated to draw out our affections for Christ, so that He should have His full place. "This do in remembrance of me". So the apostle takes pains to bring it forward, not merely historically, but to speak of the Lord as giving it to him: "This is my body, which is for you"; he omits the word 'given' as in Luke's account lest it might be thought that the original institution was primarily for the Jewish disciples. It is "for you", for us; it is not something passed on second-hand to us by the Jewish disciples. It comes to us direct from heaven and it is "for you", not a secondary matter. I think the apostle had in mind to impress the Corinthians with the great place they had with Christ. The Lord had told him about them before they were converted: "I have much people in this city". The Supper was received from the Lord by him for them.
P.L. So that the calling of the Lord to mind would relate peculiarly to this inward side of things.
{281}
J.T. I think it would.
P.L. In the calling of Him to mind, it is what we are to Him, and in the announcement of His death, more what we are for Him.
J.T. That is it. The first thought is calling Him to mind. It is an inner matter.
Rem. There are doors to be shut.
J.T. Well, that is John's side. It is properly in Jerusalem, that is, where the Lord is not. That is where it is celebrated as testimony, but alongside of the testimony there is this precious thought, the calling of Him to mind. That is the inner spiritual side of it. Luke does not say that they went to the mount of Olives, but calling to mind is enough. It is the spiritual side. Eating and drinking, as in Matthew and Mark, can be noticed by anyone, but calling to mind can only be noticed by the spiritual. It is like the mount of Olives in Matthew and Mark. There is no eating in Luke. It is a memorial, and that is the spiritual side.
P.C. Would you connect that with "the simplicity that is in Christ" as in the second epistle (@2 Corinthians 11:3)?
J.T. That is right. How very simple it is!
W.E.B. Does this tend to produce local unity more than anything, having this great objective before us -- what we are to Him?
J.T. I think it has that end in view. Chapter 10 shows that the idea of unity is in the bread and chapter 12 shows that we have all been brought to drink into one Spirit, alluding undoubtedly to the cup, so that the Lord's supper is intended to promote the unity which it symbolises.
Ques. 'To Him' involves correspondence?
J.T. Yes. The idea is that the church in the full result is given to Him. The apostle has the full result in mind but he does not go so far as in Ephesians. I was lately at a reading on @Romans 5 where the brothers were bringing everything into the chapter.
{282}
They missed the teaching: they were not learning in part.
Ques. Is that why the Spirit is careful to bring in only Rebecca in Genesis?
J.T. I think that is right. She stands out, perhaps more than any of the types of the church, as a personality in the grace of the way in which she met the servant. What would she not do for Isaac if she did that much for the servant and the camels! It is readiness to serve people. It says in @Luke 4 that she arose and served them. What would she not do for Christ personally! The Corinthians were not like her. They were partisan.
Ques. Were they not recovered when the thought of unity was introduced in the ministry?
J.T. I think the use of the word 'repentance' shows how much the first epistle effected.
-- .P. So that to understand the Supper rightly, must we understand the meaning of the word you emphasised, 'for you'? Should we understand the place the assembly had in the heart of Christ?
J.T. That is right. That is where they needed Him most, when He entered into death. Now the point is we are to be for Christ.
Ques. Speaking of knowing in part, would you say that the particular point to be learnt in the first portion of chapter 11 is subjection?
J.T. I think so. That is what the woman learnt in @Luke 4. The Lord stood over her. He would convey to her the majesty of His Person. Doubtless she had failed in subjection to Peter, for Peter should have been the head although her son-in-law, and probably that was the secret of the fever. Now the Lord would impress her with what man is. You get the thought of manhood in Christ. He stood over her and rebuked the fever. Peter could not have done that. Perhaps the idea of manhood was not yet in Peter, but it was in Christ. So that the thought
{283}
of subjection is what is in mind in the early part of the chapter, in the covering. In that subjection there is affection: the woman is for the man. The man is by the woman, but the woman is for the man. The church is for Christ. He has been for her where she needed Him most. Now we are to be for Him where He needs us.
Ques. Would you say a word on verse 10 -- "because of the angels"? What does that mean?
J.T. I think it is a testimony to what God has effected through the gospel that the woman is subject. The word is 'authority' and means, I think, that she is under it -- power in the sense of authority, not in herself but in another to whom she is to be subject. It is on her.
F.Fn. How would this subjection to authority come out practically in any locality? You said just now that Peter had not the thought of the man at that time.
J.T. I do not think Peter was equal to the divine thought in manhood. Christ alone was. This epistle is aiming at manhood -- "Quit you like men".
F.Fn. The more that is known locally the more the spirit of subjection would be evident.
J.T. That is the thought, leading on to what is to be for Christ.
F.Fn. And that is the first part of the truth?
J.T. Exactly.
Wm.C. Would the spikenard in the first chapter of the Song of Songs be the spirit of the song?
J.T. I think so -- the recognition of the King.
Wm.C. That spirit helps at the Supper to form an atmosphere.
J.T. It does, and that is what the Lord is aiming at at the present time in the ministry of the Lord's supper -- what is His normally in the saints coming together in subjection and then speaking to Him by the Spirit, 'Lord Jesus'. What that is for Him!
{284}
How pleasing to Him! The love of Christ enters into that side. The love of Christ constrains us. That is the kind of love it is. "Because we thus judge". It is all in that setting we judge of things.
E.B. We live to Him who died for us.
Ques. Would Paul be marked by the spirit of subjection in his ministry?
J.T. It is well to compare what is said in @Acts 18 in this connection. He was ready to move in his spirit and the Lord said, "I have much people in this city". The Lord's property was there, what is to be for Him, and the apostle would never lose sight of that. A skilled workman will know as he proceeds what to do and Paul represents the skilled workman.
S.R. Would you say a word as to verse 10?
J.T. The word is 'authority'. It evidently means the sign of the authority in another that she is subject to. The authority is in the man, her head. She has a sign to show that, and the angels see it, showing how wide the thought is in the mind of God.
S.R. Does it refer to a covering on her head when she has communion with God?
J.T. No doubt it is formal or public prayer that is in mind. The bearing of the whole matter is the assembly.
-- .P. Was this the primary thought of God, that she was created as a helpmeet for Him?
J.T. That is what the epistle brings out.
Ques. Would you say another word as to manhood as formed in the saints?
J.T. That is a most important matter. The epistle aims at that. We are to be full-grown men in our minds, fully developed whether men or women. Then we are enjoined to quit ourselves like men.
Rem. That element of authority amongst the saints would ensure the element of subjection.
J.T. If we expect it from the sisters we ought to be men. There ought to be that quality.
{285}
Rem. Paul himself was an example of a true man.
J.T. Now at the close we want to get on to the idea of a chaste virgin. The second epistle affords conditions for the apostle to bring that word in. It shows the anxiety he had as to Satan's work: how Satan is active to deprive the Lord of what He intends in the assembly.
Ques. What is the idea of chaste?
J.T. It is a well-known word. The idea is to prevent any lightness or looseness in manner or word.
Ques. Does it carry the thought of beauty?
J.T. It is more virtue. It is holding yourself for him.
Ques. Purity from the influence of the world?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Are you connecting that with the servant presenting Rebecca to Isaac, and Isaac taking her into Sarah's tent?
J.T. Yes, though I do not think Corinthians rises fully to that. You hardly get her behaviour suggested in Corinth, but it is quite legitimate to bring the reference in -- how she served him and the camels, and her decision to go with the man, and how Isaac was seen coming from the well at eventide. He stands related to the well. That is the setting -- the Spirit's refreshing satisfying service is in mind. Rebecca enquires as to Isaac and the servant says: It is my master. How the apostle stresses that all the way through! What Christ was to him! How the apostle regards Christ! "Legitimately subject to Christ", he says. That was his attitude. How he would convey that in his ministry amongst them! Rebecca springs off the camel and takes the veil. That is the connection, I think, in the veil, intimating that all she wishes is to be for Isaac. The church is to be for Christ.
F.Fn. Is that her glory? The hair is her glory.
J.T. I thought so.
{286}
Ques. Would it be right to link the thought of espousal with following the servant? Do you think that it introduces the idea of our responsiveness to the ministry that the Lord is giving us?
J.T. Very good. The aim of the minister is espousal.
Rem. All the utterances of the servant seem to be where he came in touch with Rebecca. The ministry in the Corinthian letters is to us in the circumstances where we are.
J.T. That is right, and in order that there might be movement to where He is.
H.McM. Would the inside place at the Supper answer to being taken into Isaac's tent?
J.T. She is not taken into Isaac's, but into Sarah's tent. What is alluded to is Israel's place in the testimony. No doubt the Supper would have relation to Isaac's tent, so to speak, but Sarah's tent is the position in testimony. The word is that he led her there. There is the idea of leadership, really headship. The standing of the saints is that they occupy Israel's place, and they are great enough to do so. They are greater than Israel was but the testimony that Israel bore is to be carried on. He led her there, not to his own place. The type in Genesis does not carry us through, but the position of the church as Isaac's spouse, or bride, or wife is as in testimony there.
W.J.W. Is there any other way of being for Christ except at the Supper?
J.T. Well, we should always be for Him: we should never lose that thought, in the street or in business or elsewhere.
W.J.W. How far does it follow after the Supper as to response to the Father?
J.T. That is another matter. That comes in after the Lord's supper if the covenant is understood -- liberty to draw near. But what is in mind is what the saints may be in the way of attractiveness, being
{287}
covered, that is to say, kept jealously for the heart of Christ.
P.L. Is it the hidden treasure, that character of things, the "pearl" going on more to Ephesians?
J.T. That is so. "The hidden man of the heart" comes in there.
Ques. Would you say that the secret of all Rebecca's movements was that Isaac wanted her?
J.T. There is evidence that he did. Then there were the ornaments which the servant had to put on her. I think the Lord is bringing about the assembly conditions with a view to the end, so that it is for us to see that and to be in accord with it. If we get help on what is a current feature of the truth the next thing is to be in accord with it. That is seen in Mary of Bethany in a very beautiful way. She was in accord with the voice from heaven. He defends what He loves and what loves Him.
W.E.B. Could we have one more word with regard to the peculiar opposition of Satan to this truth -- how it might be met?
J.T. You can see that is what the apostle was oppressed about. As he says, "As the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ". It is not simply that what they had should be attacked directly, but corrupted. What the Lord would give us is apt to be corrupted, vitiated by something else, by the craft of the devil.
P.L. Laban's proposal to stay ten days?
J.T. Quite. You may be sure she would be damaged if she stayed ten days. Decision is what is needed.
Ques. Why is the reference to Eve and not to Rebecca in this scripture?
J.T. It does not say Satan attacked Rebecca. He attacked Eve. It was quite consistent to bring that in here.
{288}
Ques. Was the attack against headship, and did Satan succeed in drawing Eve away from her head?
J.T. That is what happened.
Ques. Practically, would you say it is impossible to corrupt the saints if we are really following what is suggested in the man?
J.T. I think so. You do not get it fully in Corinthians, but Colossians shows how the enemy attacks. The apostle says, "not holding fast the head". That is the point -- to hold the Head.
-- .C. Were they missing those great things mentioned in the second chapter of the first epistle on account of being carnal?
J.T. They were indeed. He brings it in early. This attack of the devil is what we should all pay attention to. We may be professedly taking in the truth but vitiated by something the devil brings in.
Ques. In principle, did Satan bring in philosophy and vain deceit to Eve?
J.T. Very good. Eve's mind was corrupted.
Ques. Is the Babylonish system that has been brought in the result of this attack of the enemy?
J.T. I am sure it is.
Ques. Is that in contrast with the simplicity of the Christ?
J.T. Yes. You mean, that system is so ramified and complicated. In the Vatican, as set against the upper room, you have the full development of this corruption.
{289}
THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD AND HIS SERVICE IN RELATION TO IT
@1 Peter 1:2; @1 Peter 4:17,18; @Genesis 3:21 - 24; @Genesis 11:7 - 9; @Amos 5:26,27
J.T. What I have in mind is to show from these scriptures the government of God, and its exercise from the time sin came in until the present time; and concurrently with that His service in grace, involving the incarnation and death of our Lord Jesus and the presence of the Spirit here. What one would particularly seek to make clear is how His deity, His supremacy and majesty are maintained throughout; notwithstanding the humble service that begins almost immediately on the part of God, God maintains His deity, maintains its supremacy and majesty in its government, whilst at the same time serving in the lowliest way those who are under that government.
So that we have the government of God in Genesis as affecting the whole race, that is, death. That stands. Death passed upon all, we are told. And then the scattering at Babel, also affecting the whole race of mankind up to the present day, the division of the nations by the difference of languages. And then the scattering of Israel, another testimony to God's government which also stands, not affecting the whole race, but a special nation, a special family, but still effective until the present time. Peter addressed those who are affected by it under the word 'dispersion'; that was the government of God. According to Amos they were transported; God caused them to be transported. And then we have in @1 Peter 4, the government beginning at the house of God, which also stands and is current. The chapters 2 and 3 of Revelation enlarge on it. These
{290}
features of government all stand, and saints are affected by them today; but concurrently with them we have the service of God ministered to us, to those of faith, so that we might subsist notwithstanding the pressure of the judicial government of God.
Eu.R. Did you say judicial government?
J.T. Yes, it is judicial throughout.
Eu.R. Would you explain that a little?
J.T. God is known in the judgment which He executes. That is God in His supremacy. It was judicial to impose death on Adam, on the race. It was judicial to disperse the race at Babel. God came down to examine what was there and deliberately imposed difference of language and scattered them abroad upon the whole earth. Those of us who travel know that the race is dispersed, in many instances in grave degradation. That is the government of God. The scattering of Israel is also the same. "I will cause you to go into captivity", He says, because of idolatry. Even in the wilderness they scarcely offered a voluntary sacrifice. The judicial act of God begins as they enter into the wilderness, covering hundreds of years, but it is one thing. "I will transport you beyond Babylon", Stephen says (@Acts 7:43). Peter addresses the Jewish christians, those who were dispersed under the judicial government of God. So judgment has begun at the house of God, the assembly today in its public character, and has extended as @Revelation 2 and 3 show; the Lord has executed judgment on the professing body. All these judicial results exist now and affect every one of us. We may not have noticed it perhaps, but it is a solemn fact and God would have us to take notice of it, and be humbled by it, because we have part in it all more or less. We are responsible in regard of each of those judicial acts of God. On the other hand there is that service of love, beginning with the clothes that He made for Adam and Eve.
{291}
F.W.W. Is it judicial because some form of departure from God had come in?
J.T. That is what comes out in each case.
F.W.W. That is why you used the word 'judicial'?
J.T. It is over against the exercise of grace; it is the just judgment of God; it runs right through.
R.S.K. In spite of the dispersion God has given a living hope; God has given them that, you would say?
J.T. Yes. There is hope immediately. In the presence of the penalty of death Adam calls his wife Eve, which does not mean death but life, showing that there was light and hope, and there is right through. So that even in the scattering of the race Abraham is immediately called out, and they are all to be blessed through him. The blessing of Abraham has arrived at the nations and we have received the promise of the Spirit. How God can maintain His majesty and yet serve His own is what we want to get into our souls: God in His holy majesty. We want to be accustomed to that in view of finality when God will be all in all. We should accustom ourselves to the supremacy of God, His holy majesty. The testimony to that right through is His just government. He lets nothing pass.
H.D'A.C. God's hand has always been over everything, has it not?
J.T. It has been over it in a dual way. His hand has been there in judicial dealings, and on the other hand in lowly grace, serving, beginning with coat-making, coats of skins. Some creature must have died under God's hands to make those skins. God began with Christ, as it were, as having died, the humanity of Christ coming in at once, the sufferings of Christ. Service is all on that line, based on the incarnation and death of Christ.
T.F. A just God and a Saviour.
J.T. That is right, a just God and a Saviour, a
{292}
very touching word. All was maintained perfectly at the cross. Nowhere was it more maintained than at the cross -- these two thoughts, the majesty of God as against sin, and love in Christ, a divine Person, for the sinner, so that he might be saved.
O.W.W. Is this something we must definitely accept?
J.T. I think so. It is a very great education to have these two thoughts of God in your soul, for we are not much given to balance. Balance is a great thing with God. There must be that principle throughout the universe, and He would have it in our souls.
C.B. Is it a necessity that death immediately comes to light as soon as departure is in evidence?
J.T. The necessity is there if the second line is to be maintained. That is God acting in lowly grace. Sin having come in, God might have acted judicially and made an end of the sinner. If He is to take up the line of grace, the second line, there must be death. Only on that line could there be any service, for the majesty of God could not be met otherwise.
Eu.R. How do you regard the cherubim? Are they the guardians of the majesty of God, while He goes on in His grace?
J.T. Well, I think they represent government throughout. There they stand to guard the tree of life. They are judicial, I suppose; the actual working out is the penalty of death becoming effective on every man. They keep the way of the tree of life. There is hope, too, for the tree of life was there still. The penalty of death already pronounced is carried out by them, but every death that occurs is a question of the government of God, and if in a christian, there has to be the recognition of that. We have to recognise that we are mortal; it is penalty.
Ques. Does the tree of life represent the other side, God's service of love and grace?
{293}
J.T. I think so. It is corresponding with His counsels. In Timothy we have the promise of life going back, including these scriptures. Even the tree of life would be a witness of that, but it has to be guarded. The guard is the cherubim, but with a flaming sword turning every way, it says, to keep the way of it. I think it would be observed in the better translation that God speaks in great feeling about this. He speaks with feeling, as if to say, What a disaster if man should eat the tree of life in his sins! And yet Adam has some thought of it for he calls his wife Eve. There is some light in his soul.
H.D'A.C. He had not lost hope.
J.T. That is what comes out.
H.D'A.C. I understand that you mean that the tree of life was not taken away but was guarded.
J.T. It is there. God would say with depth of feeling, Oh, what a disaster if man were to live as he is in his sins! That meant that He had in His mind a way out, and already He is indicating it by making clothes through death.
G.A.v.S. Would you say then that there was a depth of divine feeling in connection with the whole of the government of God? I mean, tracing it right through as you have already done, are there depths of divine feelings which need to be in some sense realised in our souls so that the government of God should have its proper place in our spiritual experience?
J.T. I am sure that is right. God in His supremacy and in acting judicially is capable of feeling that hardly belongs to the service side; it enters into it, but it belongs to God in His absoluteness. It would be disaster in His mind if man were to have access to the tree of life as he was. There is feeling in it, as you note in the New Translation in the verses read. So as was suggested in the scattering of man, God came down to see what the children of men did. He
{294}
is capable of that. That is in view of carrying on His government, If a judicial action is needed in my history, God will apply it; if He does, it is there and has to be bowed to.
C.O.B. Does the Lord recognise the position in His answer to Pilate? When Pilate says, "I have power to crucify thee", the Lord says,"Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above" (@John 19:10,11).
J.T. He justifies the position of Pilate. That brings out another thing. That is magisterial government. In @Genesis 9, magisterial government was established, but more as a help to man. Still, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed". That was what magisterial government was for, to restrain evil. That magisterial government was vested in Pilate. How much feeling enters into it, that the One who made that principle -- for it was Jesus -- should Himself stand before a poor sinner, a magistrate, to get His verdict! That brings out the position most clearly. How God's government runs on, and God Himself has to come in and suffer at the hands of the magistrate.
C.O.B. Then there would have been no crucifixion apart from the government of God?
J.T. Well, it was there. That is how it was carried out. The Lord in approaching the cross regarded it. "Take me not away in the midst of my days!" (@Psalm 102:24). Why should He be taken away in the midst of His days? Not for any personal reason. It was the government of God on Israel; it was the penalty of a broken law which He was taking up vicariously.
G.A.v.S. With regard to the human race as a whole, is not one of the prime causes of the government of God on man, to a large extent, the abuse of the power or magisterial government that had been entrusted to him?
{295}
J.T. I suppose so. If you take Nimrod, exercising authority -- he was a king and established a kingdom -- it is said, "He was a mighty hunter before the Lord". He was a man who did violence to God's rights -- a mighty hunter; he used God's creatures for his own pleasure. He was cruel, for hunting implies that, turning the magisterial power in his hands, desecrating it, turning it against the ordinances of God. That man has come down to you. The most successful rulers of the earth, as men speak, did violence to the rights of God. In none is it more manifested than in Pilate. He pronounced his sentence in spite of his wife calling Jesus a righteous Man, for she says, "I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him" (@Matthew 27:19) as a righteous Man. Pilate knew that and yet he scourged Him and handed Him over to His haters to be crucified. Such is the utter inability of man in the flesh to exercise these magisterial powers. God, of course, uses them today and we pray for them, but no man in the flesh is equal to it; Jesus alone is. God has appointed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness. He has given assurance to all men in that He has raised Him from the dead. The government is upon His shoulder, but it is touching that He submitted to Pilate. How perfectly He justified God in His governmental ordinances! All that has a great voice for the christian. If God sees the need for government let us bow to it.
W.C.C. Would you say it is really in our favour?
J.T. It is, in that it works righteousness, works holiness.
Eu.R. What is the exact force of that word 'magisterial'? You are applying it to all governments?
J.T. Oh, yes; from the king down.
Eu.R. We rather connect magistracy with the lower officials who exercise it, but it is general.
{296}
J.T. It is general. They call the President of the United States, the Chief Magistrate. That is the thought.
G.A.v.S. The difficulty in one's mind is how far we can keep in our own minds the perfect consistency that exists between the government of God, as you have spoken of it, and the maintenance of that service in grace which is moving on side by side with that government.
J.T. It is a very important matter. It is a very important education, and important in the sense of maintaining balance in us. Balanced christians are so needed, for a right balance maintains judgment on the one hand and grace on the other.
Ques. Do you suggest that directly God begins to move in government He is at the same time moving on the other line in connection with it?
J.T. That is what comes out as far as I can see here. The pronouncement of the sentence of death on man is immediately followed by these coats being made. What can be more touching, that God should make clothes for the very man and woman that sinned against Him most inexcusably? God did it Himself. It says, "Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin". We have that title here, Jehovah Elohim, stooping to do this service, to make clothes, a service that runs right through so that we should not be unclothed. We are to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. God makes that house.
W.J.P. Does this suggest the work of God right through?
J.T. It is His gracious service. In many expressions in Scripture we overlook what enters into them. The Lord says, "My Father worketh hitherto". He looks back to this period. That Person was working. "My Father worketh hitherto and I work" (@John 5:17). That one divine Person works, and another comes in and
{297}
works, and the Holy Spirit comes in and works, what a service of grace it is! Yet the majesty of God is maintained throughout.
C.G. Would it be right to say that, in view of verse 21 and what you have been dwelling upon as coming before the driving out of the man, the governmental side is to facilitate this service of love? So that it has been said that the lake of fire itself is a necessity of the love of God.
J.T. Every right-minded christian recognises that it is not less than love. The lake of fire is not less than a provision of love. It takes time to enter into it, but it is obvious to a christian that there must be a place for lawlessness.
G.A.v.S. It is really shut up there.
J.T. Quite so. There is liberty. There is never any scope for evil again.
O.W.W. Does the climax of God's work appear in type in the coats of skin?
J.T. That was the climax. That is the fulness of the grace and love that did service: although the service goes on. The Lord says, "Father, ... glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee" (@John 17:1). That implies the continuance of the service. The cross is the full expression of what is behind the service.
G.A.v.S. Do you suggest that it is a part of the divine service of Christ in glorifying God to make us appreciate to the fullest extent how all the government of God is based really upon the demands of the heart of God as well as what God is in His holiness?
J.T. The Lord said, "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee". Already it had been said in @John 3:35 that "the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand". That is in administration, and it is effective in carrying out the desires of love, and in this shows the gain of the government of God. The government of God is turned into gain for those who are the recipients of
{298}
grace, but it runs on to the lake of fire for those who are not. It is just judgment; the believer bows to it and comes into the benefit of grace by bowing to it. But the government of God stands. I believe an understanding of the government of God as we are looking at it will help us to maintain in our souls the majesty of God, that it never alters, that His lowly service does not affect it. It stands.
W.J.P. Do you see the two things put together in @Zechariah 13? "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts", then you get, "I will turn mine hand upon the little ones".
J.T. The sword is awakened against Christ.
W.J.P. Majesty and grace are put together?
J.T. Yes.
C.S.S. Would you say that the appreciation of what is expressed in this word, "Lest he put forth his hand" and the appreciation of what God has provided in the coats of skin enables one to move on the line of the overcomer, to have the right to eat of the tree of life?
J.T. It is a right, now the way to it is made in the death of Christ. The right is in the washing, as it says, "Blessed are they that wash their robes" (@Revelation 22:14). That is, there is a maintenance in oneself of that death, not only in its application to one's sins, but as to oneself. I believe it will be seen in investigating the truth, that eternal life stands over against man's state. "Blessed are they that wash their robes", that is, wash with water, not with blood. We have "washed ... in the blood" in @Revelation 7:14. Mr. S. is calling attention to the right to the tree of life. Christ has washed us from our sins in His own blood, and the great multitude washed their robes in His blood, but in chapter 22 it is the present continuous tense, "they that wash their robes", it is the continuous washing
{299}
as with water. Historical washing is with blood, once for all, but continuous washing is with water. It is the maintenance of the death of Christ as to one's state. One's state has to be dealt with. You are using the water as God dealt with Christ on the cross. You are acting judicially against yourself in the application of the water, and that gives you right. There can be no right otherwise.
G.A.v.S. Is that in relation to what is said in @Revelation 18:20, "God has judged your judgment"? As we come into accord with the judgment as indicated by the washing of the water by the word, God manifests that He is in accord with our having reached that.
J.T. God loves to ratify the judgments of His people. They may relate to an act of discipline in a locality. There (@Revelation 18:20) it relates to God judging their judgment upon Babylon. God looks for His people to form a judgment about things. The things we refuse to judge become our scourge.
G.A.v.S. In that way the government of God is intimately connected with our hearts.
J.T. We ought to have a judgment about everything on earth. I believe the enlightened christian would be drawn to God's side and have a judgment about everything. God loves to stand by him and say, That is your judgment, and I will execute it.
Eu.R. In the Old Testament we see what brought the scattering in; and how solemn it is, and how necessary to judge those principles in ourselves.
J.T. That is where the practical gain of it comes to us. The government of God stands, and it implies that His majesty stands. There is no diminution of that thought. Because one divine Person becomes Man, or because three divine Persons are acting in grace, actually serving us, the majesty of God is not impaired in the least by that. If God is to act judicially in my case, He will do it, and it is for me to
{300}
bow to it; in bowing to it I come into this precious service that He is rendering that I might get the gain of it. Peter's epistles have this in mind. They refer to the government of God, and he writes to the dispersion, alluding undoubtedly by the use of the word to the government of God that was affecting them. Why should they not be in Palestine, in Jerusalem? The government of God willed it otherwise.
G.A.v.S. Is it a question of the government of God that if I sow to the flesh I shall of the flesh reap corruption (@Galatians 6:8)?
J.T. Quite so.
G.A.v.S. There is the rest of it, "But he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting". I was wondering about that in connection with eternal life, in relation with what you get in @Romans 2:7 - 10, "To them who ... seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility, life eternal. But to those that are contentious ... wrath and indignation, tribulation and distress". They stand over against each other, as if God set eternal life over against evil, that it is the right of those who work good. That is the way it puts it.
Eu.R. So in the second verse here, though he has to address those who were dispersed, he can refer to all the Persons in the Deity and then say "Grace to you and peace be multiplied".
J.T. Very beautiful, and in that position they are sanctified, "elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ". It is a question of election, but it is through sanctification. The practical side is in mind. "By sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ".
Ques. How does the government of God stand in relation to the kingdom of God? What is the relation between them?
{301}
J.T. Well, the kingdom implies His government, but in its present form. It is a gracious establishment. It bears on His protection for the saints. Presently He will take out of it all that defiles according to Matthew, but it is running on, a gracious protection for us.
H.E.F. I was going to ask you to say a little more what was in mind as to the way this election was carried out.
J.T. You see how he puts it. "According to the foreknowledge of God the Father", but it is "by sanctification of the Spirit". That is, the election is not an abstract thought, but a practical thought, that He elects me by an action of the Spirit. What is in mind is that I am really one elected by the action of the Spirit, by sanctification of the Spirit. One can hardly claim it any other way than by sanctification of the Spirit.
G.A.v.S. Do you mean that that involves formation according to the Spirit?
J.T. It does. One is really one of the elect. It is a practical thing that I am one of the elect "by sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ". *Unto* that, meaning that that is to be the state, that is what is to mark me; a very powerful thing in relation to what we are speaking of in relation to the government of God, for that is what is really in mind in these epistles.
C.S.S. In the address to Ephesus He speaks of transporting in His government, but the obedience on the other hand giving them the right to the tree of life.
J.T. Obedience is seen in the overcomer in each assembly.
W.J.P. Do we see this service of love and grace working in the middle of @Hebrews 12, the chastening
{302}
there, which would produce holiness and the peaceable fruit of righteousness?
J.T. That is how it works out, and I believe in @1 Peter 4, "the time ... is come" the apostle says, "The time of having the judgment begin from the house of God is come". It takes the form of discipline in us. It begins at the house of God; it takes the form of discipline for it is the same thing. It runs on to "the end of those who obey not the glad tidings of God". "And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the impious and the sinner appear?". It is the same thing, and this verse helps us on what we are speaking of; the government of God runs on to the lake of fire. It works out effectively in christians now in the way of discipline, but how solemn if I refuse the discipline! Am I not putting myself alongside the impious and the sinner? Anyone who refuses the hand of discipline of God is placing himself there. Are we stronger than He? What may not happen?
Eu.R. The contrast would be to use diligence to make our calling and election sure.
J.T. That is right. That is the next epistle. In that epistle he addresses himself as a bondman as well as an apostle to those of like precious faith with us. He comes down; he has in mind to stir up their pure minds. He runs on in his subject to the dissolution of the elements, not only the lake of fire, but the dissolution of the heavens and the earth, showing how real a thing this is that we are dealing with. "What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?" (@2 Peter 3:11), because this discipline that God is exercising on us is just a piece of what is going to be exercised on the ungodly and the sinner.
Eu.R. It would deliver us from all fatalism, saying that nothing could be interfered with; "All things continue as they were from the beginning".
{303}
J.T. Just so, and another thing that comes out here is the people that are difficult to save. One often questions oneself, Am I a difficult person to save? Lot was a difficult person to save. He made it as hard as possible for God to save him by turning his face to the world. Abraham delivered him from it, but he goes back into it. He is a difficult man to save, yet in the government of God he is saved.
E.S. Would that apply to us by not being exercised thereby?
J.T. I should not like to be one who is difficult to save, although God makes the most of them. In the second epistle He makes much of Lot, but he was a difficult man to save.
G.A.v.S. What bearing has @1 Corinthians 11 on what you are saying? It says, "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep".
J.T. Very applicable to what we are saying. "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you", that is among those he was addressing -- "and many sleep". As if God would save us from the ignominy of the world.
R.S.K. That is why we judge ourselves.
J.T. Quite so. It is a sorrowful thing to be amongst the class who are difficult to save. Lot was a righteous man; he was saved with great difficulty.
R.S.K. I would like a little help on the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
J.T. It is just an allusion to the type. The sprinkling of the blood was common in the types, the blood applied vicariously. That is what we are sanctified to, the obedience of Christ and the precious blood, which of course means His death.
H.D'A.C. It does not say the righteous are difficult to save, but "if"; suggesting that there are those who do give this difficulty, which is a very serious thought.
{304}
J.T. Yes. "If the righteous is difficultly saved". That is alluding to discipline, judgment beginning at the house of God. God has to resort to discipline to save us.
W.C.C. Would David be an instance of that bowing to it, when Nathan went to him?
J.T. Yes. Just so.
{305}
DIGNITY
@1 Corinthians 12:12,13; @Exodus 40:9 - 16
I have in mind to occupy you, dear brethren, with the dignity that is divinely intended for us, specially viewed in a collective way. These epistles, that is 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians, dealing with the saints in a collective sense, introduce this thought of dignity. This first epistle introduces it, and also the next one, that is under the thought of anointing. The expression here in verse 12, "the Christ", alludes to the saints as most of us will be aware. The context shows that; the context shows that it is a question of the saints viewed organically. That is the figure, being the human body in its members. That could not represent Christ personally; it is a question of the saints viewed as His body. The second letter actually uses the word 'anointed'. This in the first epistle, is more abstract; in the second letter their state had improved and accordingly the apostle by the Spirit is able to speak more concretely. Hence he says that "He that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God" (@2 Corinthians 1:21). The saints in Corinth are linked on with the apostle and with christians generally in that statement: first in regard of the Spirit as anointing; the second as sealing; and the third as the earnest. In this way, dear brethren, the saints would be dignified. They would be dignified by the apprehension of the Spirit upon them, for that is the idea of anointing. The question should arise as to our public appearance, what is upon us. We read elsewhere of the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon us. What dignity that is! No great personage on earth can confer anything at all to be compared with that. And then in relation to that, the sealing, namely that I belong
{306}
to God. Let no one claim me; that is the language of one who understands the sealing. Let no one put a badge of ownership upon me; let no one endeavour to honour me by any public symbol. God has put His seal on the christian. He is worthy of Him. God would not put His seal on what is valueless. These epistles stress the value of a saint, and if God seals us it is as of some value, a value of course because of what one costs but also because of what one is, that is, what one is as the work of God. "He that establishes us with you", says the apostle, "in Christ, and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us" (@2 Corinthians 1:21,22). How the apostle moved about as the property of God! Heaven looked down upon him as he moved; every step of the apostle, we may say, viewed in that way was of interest to heaven. He was God's, "whose I am", he says, "and whom I serve" (@Acts 27:23). What dignity is in that! And then his enjoyment -- what enjoyment such a one has! The enjoyment lies in the earnest of the Spirit. The earnest is not all, but it is much. It is enough to satisfy and make the believer thus an influence for good, a possessor of buoyancy. That is what the earnest does, the earnest of the Spirit. He continually brings in, beloved, thoughts of God into the heart; constant freshness marks the activities of the Spirit as in the believer. He makes good as the earnest, He gives us to taste in a very real way what God has in mind for us, what God is, which is the greatest thing of all.
It is well surely to bring in what Christ is before God, but let us never forget, beloved, what God is. Christ is God, of course, but God has maintained His own majesty and supremacy, what is proper to Deity always, and He looks for His people to know something about that. He looks for His people to have in mind what He is, what He is Himself that He dwells in light unapproachable, that He is the King of the ages, immortal, invisible. He expects us to think of Him
{307}
in that way. He gives us to understand that we cannot compass Him, but He expects us to have Him before us in that way, and the Spirit which is the earnest will not fail to keep Him before us in that way, to accustom us to Him, so that as the Son is subject to Him who has subjected all things to Him, God will be all *in* all. The 'in' there is a very powerful thought. It is not merely an idea of God, it is God in power in a Person and in all things. The Holy Spirit, dear brethren, will not fail to occupy us with God in that way.
So that in this second epistle Paul says, If I think of God, I am beside myself. He is sober for the sake of the saints, but he would be beside himself to be free of all encumbrances, to be free of all blinding or darkening thoughts, to be with God. Jesus had led the way in that, dear brethren. The Scripture furnishes us with enough to indicate how much time the Lord Jesus personally spent with God, how He spent His nights on the mount of Olives. But I am speaking now of the earnest, how it tends to make the saints buoyant spiritually, and in this way a testimony to what God is.
Now this verse in chapter 12 of the first letter has in mind what we are, viewed as the body of Christ. "So also is the Christ". That is, as you might say, the anointed vessel, the saints viewed here in testimony, for that is the thought -- that there is to be a representation of Christ here -- "So also is the Christ". A very remarkable term to use as designating the saints, but with great dignity that we might be equal to the expression of Him here in testimony.
I want to show, dear brethren, from the Old Testament, how this is worked out in detail, and I would first remark on the anointing oil. It is the anointing oil, it says. It does not typify the Spirit merely or only as a divine Person here. He is here as a divine Person, another Comforter, as Jesus says
{308}
of Him. As such He is begged of the Father; the Lord graciously intimated to us how He would humble Himself in asking for this great gift. "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter" (@John 14:15,16). But then Jesus received Him, dear brethren, from the Father in heaven. He was anointed by Him on earth, but as in heaven He received Him, Peter says in @Acts 2:33. He received of the Father the promise of the Spirit and shed Him forth.
Now I wish to dwell on this for a moment, so that we may have before us what the anointing means, how the Spirit is presented in it. It is the Spirit of a suffering Christ; that is the anointing -- a glorified Christ, but a suffering Christ. The list of ingredients is headed by myrrh in Exodus, and I believe, dear brethren, that is what is in mind in the Acts, in the Lord, as we are told, presenting Himself living *after* He suffered. We have to understand Christ *before* He suffered: the most touching words came from His lips; no words can exceed them in feeling, in affection. It is not only with what Matthew and Mark and Luke furnish us, for they furnish us with very little of what transpired at the Supper in the last parting word, but John furnishes us with much more, and what he furnishes us with, beloved, is calculated to affect our hearts. They are the words of the Christ about to suffer. We have to remember that. The Holy Spirit alone can bring to us today the feelings of Christ before He suffered. Nothing that came out in Christ could fall to the ground. Everything is gathered up by the Spirit; He has the treasures. He it is too who searches the depths of God, we are told. How He understood perfectly all that came out in Christ here on earth! Not one item, not one word is lost, not a feeling either. All that Christ was here was pure gold indeed, carried forward to enrich the
{309}
assembly, and is here still. It is here in the Spirit. His feelings *before* He suffered are here, but then there is what He was *after* He suffered. Those hands, as it were, could receive the Spirit from the Father and shed Him forth. Ah, the suffering hands of Christ! suffering no more, but still "after he had suffered" would convey the feelings, beloved, proper to the assembly. And the anointing carries those feelings, and dignifies us with them so that we are a suffering people here, we are representative of Christ. But the Christ must suffer was the word, and so it is now, if we are the Christ in that sense we must suffer.
As soon as David was anointed the Philistines sought him; they would attack him. As Christ was anointed, Satan attacked Him, and so as the saints were anointed in the Acts they were attacked, and wherever the anointing is there will be an attack; there will be suffering, but in such suffering there is dignity. How one might, were there time, go into the furnished examples of dignity in suffering! "When he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously" (@1 Peter 2:23). That is the dignity of the spirit of suffering, and that Spirit, beloved, is the anointing.
There are other ingredients too in Exodus, but I speak of the myrrh. The ingredients are to bring out, not the Spirit viewed as a divine Person abstractly, but what He is as here sent down by Christ, by which we are anointed. So that they were together, we are told, at Pentecost in one place. They were all together; they were together with one accord, too, in one place. They were according to Christ, and the Spirit came upon them from His suffering hands, as I may say, on high, to dignify, to characterise them here unitedly and individually. It is most exhilarating spiritually to go through the Acts, and see how this spirit worked out. What a testimony there was, first in the twelve and then in the saints
{310}
generally, then in Paul and those who were with him, and it has come right down and it is what I have before me now, that we might have it in mind in these last days, a representation of Christ in a collective way in some sense, in some little way, but including this feature of suffering, unity, of course, grace and power too in testimony, but dignity in suffering, in being belittled for Christ's sake.
Now what you will see in the passage I read in @Exodus 40 is that Moses is directed by the Lord, by Jehovah, to take the oil. He says, "Thou shalt take the anointing oil". You see how what I have been saying enters into this. "And anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it". Now, dear brethren, I want just to say as to this part of the passage that the saints are in mind. The reading of this latter half of Exodus fills the mind if it is instructed as to what the types mean, it fills the mind with the saints; it fills the mind with Christ, of course. That is what is in the mind of God, Christ, *but* the saints also. And so these parts of the tabernacle are gone over, gone over, gone over. Why these repetitions? Just, beloved, because God is so pleased with the saints, so pleased with Christ, so pleased with the saints in relation to Christ that He loves to go over the ground. From chapter 25 onwards you have the raw material, as I might say, first. Then the pattern of the tabernacle in its parts; then again, we have after the second giving of the law, the people called upon to furnish the material, and they do, and again we have the list. And then we have the vessels employed in wisdom to make; "and he made", "and he made", "and he made". The
{311}
Spirit of God loves to go over the ground. How it should affect us as we come to see that He is going over the ground of ourselves, looking into our countenances, taking account of us according to what our names signify according to Christ. That is what it is, what the saints are to God, what Christ is to God, of course; what the saints are to God, what I am to God, what you are to God, and how He loves to go over, as it were, the saints according to their names, all written in heaven as the Lord says. 'Do not rejoice', He says, 'in the results of your work, but rejoice in this, that your names are written in heaven', and having said this He rejoices Himself in spirit, and later He turns to the disciples, 'You are the ones'. He says, "Blessed are *your* eyes" (@Matthew 13:16). That is how God regards the eyes of a saint; they are blessed. That is how He regards us. It is a question of the value of the saints, dear brethren. He says from heaven, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (@Matthew 3:17). It does not say "all" there, notice. He leaves room for us. God leaves room for us; He carefully chooses these words. "All" His delight includes ourselves. Exodus implies that the saints are the centre. There would be no Exodus without the saints; there would be no Exodus without Christ, of course; there can be no heavens without Christ, of course, but there could be no assembly without the saints; there can be no heaven according to God without the saints.
That is what is in mind, and so you get the ground so covered here; and then as all the parts are made they are brought to Moses one by one, and they are all made exactly according to the divine command; Moses thought they were very good, and they were. And it says Moses blessed them. How the Lord, the true Moses, would convey to us His pleasure in us as we are taken account of with His vigilant eye as the workmanship of the Spirit, and how He would
{312}
bless us, as the Lord did as He ascended! He lifted up His hands and blessed them. Moses blessed them, and then as I said, he is directed to anoint them. This is Christ in heaven. He blessed them with His outstretched hands, and He went up, and the Holy Spirit comes down. That is the antitype of the verses I read, where you have the tabernacle, that is to say, the saints viewed as together, viewed, as I might say, organically. That is what is in mind. Oh, how essential it is that we should hold to this unity, the unity of organism, not of organisation, but of organism; the vital links that are there, dear brethren, that is what is in mind. So that as we sit down in assembly this is held. It is held intelligently; we hold ourselves in relation to one another, as one bread, one body. Heaven knows that; heaven is pleased with that; and then there is the power of the anointing. There is the light governing the position, but there is the power, there is the anointing governing the position, so that the saints are together, not only as a matter of light, but as a matter of feeling, as a matter of conscious relation with one another in love. One would ask the brethren, Are the saints becoming increasingly delightful to you? If they are, you are growing; if they are not, you are not growing. It is an excellent test, What are the saints to you? What are the saints to heaven? The book of Exodus shows us. What are the saints to me? Moses says about Jehovah that He loved the peoples. He loved the tribes. Shall I be behind that? It is a test as to where I am spiritually. Why? The test is how much I think of the brethren. It is the measure of my thoughts about God. I do not love God one bit more than I love the brethren. That is what is in mind, and it is a test as to what I am thinking of the brethren.
I have spoken of how essential they are to God, but then they are beautiful, each one of them, and
{313}
as I advance in the truth I see their beauty more and more, and I love them more and more, and serving them is much easier than it used to be. The more you love the saints the less onerous and irksome it is to serve them.
So that as I said, these verses I have just read now refer to the saints; they refer to Christ too. We have what is inside; the ark of the covenant refers to Christ, the altar refers to Christ, anointed as we are told elsewhere, seven times, so that Christ has His pre-eminence in all this. Then Aaron is a type of Christ too; according to Leviticus he is anointed by himself. There again Christ must in all things have the pre-eminence, but, making due allowance for that, we may speak of the saints as delightful to heaven, and essential. So in the second part Aaron is brought in, as you observe. "Thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations".
You can see, dear brethren, what I have said, and how true it is that you cannot omit the saints here as to the tabernacle itself or as to the priesthood. You must have Aaron's sons to fill out the instructions. And then, what does that mean today? I have spoken of the saints gathered together in assembly; that is the idea of the early part of the passage, and one would seek to make one's remarks converge on the saints as together in assembly. How pleasing to heaven they are, as they hold each other organically; first in mind is the matter of light and
{314}
then in power. They have all been baptised in the power of one Spirit into one body, and we have all been given to drink of one Spirit. That is a very real thing, beloved, and it is intended to enter into the saints¬ position as in assembly: so that we are not merely together theoretically or merely as a matter of light, but all as a matter of feeling, that I love the brethren. The Supper really means that it is for persons who not only love Christ but who love one another. Hence the full instruction that John records that we love one another, and that love, dear brethren, is in the Spirit. It is a question of the Spirit, first the baptism and then the drinking, so that there is satisfaction in what we drink together, for we have all been made to drink, it says, of one Spirit.
That is what I understand to be the early part of the passage I have read; then the latter part alludes to the same persons, only functioning in service. The same persons -- first it is a question of their relation to one another, what the saints are to me, whether I fit in relation to them feelingly, and then secondly as in this holy feeling to move in service. Christ moves, the High Priest moves. He is the first here. His pre-eminence is seen. What I am saying, dear brethren, is very important in regard of our assembly meetings. That is, that I sit down with the brethren, not merely in understanding, but I sit down with them as loving them. I look around on them -- I do not mean literally, but it is right to look round on the saints. The Lord looks around on them. It says He turned towards them. Heaven looks around on them, as sitting there. What I am seeking to make clear is what the saints are organically, what we are as in relation to one another as in the bread, and what there is for God in that. The holy anointing oil is put on by Moses, by Christ. They are fit to be anointed, and then there is the service, priestly service. That is the next thing.
{315}
You must have the tabernacle for the service, and the tabernacle alludes to the saints in relation to one another as anointed (even if they do not speak, it is there), in relation to one another inwardly, outwardly too, as together in one place, but inwardly, and then the service. You have now conditions for service and hence Aaron, that is Christ as Priest, moves now. He moves now; he is in relation to his sons. We must not isolate Aaron here; he is in relation to his sons. Christ moves according to the position whatever it may be in His perfect wisdom. We must give Him His place: and then Aaron's sons are brought in. They are clothed and anointed; according to Leviticus their garments were anointed, the tokens of their dignity, I apprehend. All that is of God, whatever is there of God, is anointed, and it is to be active in the power of the anointing, which means the exclusion of the fleshly mind. That is what it means; there is no room for that in the assembly; so that we have the blessed service of the Lord, and His own brought into it in the power of the anointing.
Well, dear brethren, that is what I had to put before you. One could say much more as to this, as to how this service proceeds, for when we come to Leviticus, in chapters 1 to 7 the offerers are in mind before the priesthood is brought in and anointed; meaning that in drawing together, dear brethren, we draw together each with an offering; that is, each has got something. Then there is room for the priest in chapter 8 of Leviticus, so that what I have in mind would lead up to assembly service in the fullest sense, what we are in assembly as under the direction and leadership, according to Hebrews, of the Minister of the sanctuary, of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man. That is what God has in mind, and you can see how essential, dear brethren, it is to have before us the idea of dignity, which can only be by the Spirit of God.
{316}
THE SPIRIT
@1 Corinthians 12:1 - 13; @Ephesians 2:18
J.T. I am thinking of the place the Spirit has, first as the anointing, bearing on the public position of the saints, and then as the power for worship, for access to the Father. Perhaps a consideration of the Spirit in these two relations may help us in this meeting. What may be observed is that, as the saints come together in assembly, what precedes or transpires may all be regarded as in the power of the anointing, even to the posture of the saints, how we sit together, and what may be said in the way of announcements or information. The whole tabernacle was anointed, and the position of the tabernacle in the wilderness corresponds with this epistle, so that all is to be under the anointing. Nothing is common, nor should anything necessary to be done divert us or interfere with us spiritually. The Lord has been helping the brethren as to this side of the truth, and it is linked up with the position of the assembly in a given place or in the world generally, that the assembly in a given place is called *God's* -- God's assembly, and it should lack nothing in accord with God. Then, on the other side, the worship or approach to God even is shown to be in the Spirit. @Philippians 3:3 says that we "worship by the Spirit of God"; @Ephesians 2:18 says that we have access through Christ "by one Spirit to the Father"; and @Romans 8:15 says that by the Spirit we cry, "Abba, Father"; @Galatians 4:6 says, "God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father". So that, I believe, the Lord would help us as to the place the Spirit has as in the assembly as convened from the outset. He is not presented as coming to it; He is there from the outset, and He is there as available for worship.
{317}
E.J.McB. I was wondering if you had in mind that every detail in a local company would be spiritual in its character.
J.T. I was thinking of that. We are prone to think that some things are common, whereas they are not. Of course, there is the idea of what is clean and holy, and what is most holy, but the anointing is to pervade or mark everything in the assembly as convened; all is to be regarded as holy. Sometimes, perhaps, it may be thought that the announcements are ordinary or common, whereas they are not. I understand they should be in the power of the anointing, and in their place. The reading of letters of commendation has its place, but in any case it is not to divert us but rather remind us of the general unity of the assembly.
E.J.McB. Then is your thought that that carried on in a spiritual way would lend power to the access to the Father in the light of worship?
J.T. Yes. There is a dignity attaching to it that takes it out of the range of ordinary religious gatherings. The anointing gives it that distinction, and the brethren, I believe, should hold themselves in that way. The Spirit operates in relation to our intelligence and our faith. It is well to be reminded that faith is the principle of our gathering, and we are addressed as intelligent persons in view of gathering in assembly, so that the position is that we are there in faith and as knowing what is to be done, and that it is to be done in faith, and thus the anointing enters into it.
Ques. What is the object in view in the anointing? Is it the expression of God, or something for God?
J.T. One thought is that it is a definite committal to the position. The holy anointing oil was carefully compounded. It was figuratively the spirit of Christ, and I should say of a suffering Christ, that is, the
{318}
outward position is governed or pervaded by the spirit of a suffering Christ. In the ingredients, the myrrh is the first mentioned. There are others, of course, but myrrh seems to be the leading thought. It is, as it were, God requiring that what He has found in Christ as Man here is to pervade or characterise the assembly, so it is called in these verses, "the Christ", the anointed organism: "So also is the Christ", alluding to the body, that there is that to which God can (at least, in early days, He did) commit Himself as His assembly just as He committed Himself to Christ openly from heaven.
F.W.K. The anointing would bring in holy feelings and sensibilities, and they would find expression in the way things are done.
J.T. Hence the brother giving out the notices has in mind that he is not doing anything common; it is a sacred service.
P.H.H. What is connected with the anointing in @Exodus 40 is the word 'hallow'. It says, "And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its utensils; and it shall be holy" (verse 9). Would you mind saying a little about the hallowing in connection with the anointing?
J.T. That would mean it has taken on a holy character which should find response in our intelligences as we sit together, that we have taken on a holy character. I believe our intelligence enters into that, and the Spirit operates in us according to our intelligence. It helps you to recognise, first of all, and then to realise in whatever measure that you are held, that the saints are hallowed. The position takes on a holy dignity in that way. It enters into the way we hold ourselves minutely, and even as to our bodies, our position and movements, that we have taken on that holy dignity of being hallowed by the power of the anointing. It is not theoretical, but I
{319}
believe our intelligence and faith enter into it, and the Holy Spirit operates in us and gives us feelings according to the light, the intelligence and the faith we have, so that God is identified with us. It is God's assembly. The anointing therefore, as you will observe, is first of the tabernacle, and then its utensils, and then the priesthood. That is, you have the great general thought, the principles of gathering, the saints viewed in that way, for they are the material. That is the point in this chapter; we "being many, are one body". We are acknowledged in that way, but then also anointed as persons who have to say to God. We have to look at ourselves as we sit down together as the tabernacle, and then to look at ourselves and hold ourselves as priests. That is, in a dual kind of way, provision is made in those verses, first the tabernacle and what was in it, including the altar -- what is public -- and then the priests. So that the position becomes extremely clear and simple, and yet all was hallowed and God can identify himself with it. I do not know whether we have ever thought very much of ourselves as moving from our houses to the place of gathering as material. The saints are the material viewed as the tabernacle and are anointed, but then, we are also priests in speaking to divine Persons; that is the next thing -- the anointing of the priests.
E.J.McB. Does that indicate that it requires more spiritual power to take up the priestly side?
J.T. I suppose it does. The saints, viewed as material, are more negative, you might say, and yet in the same chapter, that is, @Exodus 40, as we have often noticed, as each part is in its place, it is functioning. That does not mean that I am speaking; the principle is that I have a place to fill in the organism, and I am functioning in it, just as members of one body are all fulfilling their service as each is in its place.
{320}
E.J.McB. In that way, if one is speaking, morally all are speaking.
J.T. Exactly.
Ques. Would what you say enter into the true thought of assembling together?
J.T. It does. The saints, from the time they leave their places -- "the dwellings of Jacob" -- are under the eye of heaven; their footsteps are noted, and the sense of that would affect us as to how we behave ourselves on the way to the meeting. It is a matter of supreme importance to heaven that those feet are wending their ways to the assembly. "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob" (@Psalm 87:2), but He loves the "dwellings of Jacob". It is a question of comparison; the "dwellings of Jacob" are of great importance to God, but Zion is of spiritual importance.
Rem. It is a great thing to come together according to chapter 11 "in assembly".
J.T. What we are remarking now is to show how great the thing is, that what we are is material on the way to it.
W.C. Does the law of mutuality enter into that, as the psalm puts it, the way to hold sweet intercourse together?
J.T. Just so.
P.L. "I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah" (@Psalm 122:1). Does the psalmist hold himself in the light of the vessel?
J.T. It is manifest that he has his mind on heaven.
P.L. And then I wondered, in the same psalm, "Whither the tribes go up", as was their custom, if we get there the Ephesian view that you have referred to, the thought of access.
J.T. That is the next thing; the tribes went up. Of course, the allusion would be to the set feasts of the year. What pleasure would be afforded to Jehovah
{321}
as they started out from the different tribes, some taking a long journey and others a shorter! He would find pleasure in all their movements as they went up. But then, as reaching Zion, the next thing is approach to God; they were to appear before Him.
F.W.K. The ascent by which Solomon went up to the house of Jehovah was no doubt greatly dignified.
J.T. It affected the queen of Sheba, and that would be a lead for us: "His ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah" (@1 Kings 10:5). That is a later thought, that the saints, as having come from their dwellings, are sensible of divine favour in them; even if we are unobservant, the pleasure is there; the footsteps of the flock are precious to God. And then, as seating ourselves, as taking our places, we have to bear in mind that it is a question of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle was anointed and all in it, including what was external.
P.H.H. Was this thought in Paul's mind in Corinth? It says, "Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ" (@Acts 18:5). Does the company of the saints in Corinth, known afterwards as the assembly there, link on with the fact that Jesus Himself was testified to as the Christ?
J.T. Just so, the Anointed; that was the testimony. He said to Paul, "I have much people in this city". He had His heart on the people, every one of them known to Him, and yet perhaps not one of them converted; except, of course, Aquila and Priscilla who were there, they were all still, you might say, unconverted, and yet the Lord said, "I have much people in this city", and "no one shall set upon thee to injure thee" (@Acts 18:10). He would be with the apostle to secure those, and what pleasure it gave Him as one after another was secured! But the kind of preaching was the Son of God. Whilst it was the Christ that was announced, the Son of God was
{322}
preached; whether formally, or whatever the form of words used, the Son of God was preached. The Lord had in mind that He should have the saints in that way, the knowledge of Himself as the Son, so that the fellowship was to be that, the fellowship of God's Son. That is the principle that attaches to it, that the Christ is the public thing. Sonship is a question of what is inward, but the Christ is the public thing, the public character of the assembly.
Ques. Is there something similar in @Jeremiah 23, speaking of Judah being saved, "This is his name whereby he shall be called, Jehovah our Righteousness", and then in chapter 33, speaking of Jerusalem again it says, "This is the name wherewith she shall be called: Jehovah our Righteousness"? The Lord's body was the anointed body, and then the assembly is called "the Christ".
J.T. @Luke 4 presents the Lord in the synagogue of Nazareth as the anointed One. What delight there was in heaven in what was there, and then what an appeal to men! Although there was no outward result in the way of conversion, as far as we know, yet they marvelled at what they saw and heard; they never saw such movements in a preacher or minister before. That is the thing; that there should be something different; we are lifted above what is current in the religious world. They never saw anything like it before, and they "wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth". The allusion is to the vessel.
E.J.McB. In referring to the anointing in this outward way, have you in mind the manner or deportment, the very character in which the brethren gather together, and then the way in which statements are made in assembly as they are together?
J.T. The anointing enters into all that.
E.J.McB. The apostle evidently refers to what they were, "led away to dumb idols", and now he
{323}
would have a company that were influenced by the Spirit.
J.T. See what intelligence there is, what speaking. So the first thing is, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit".
E.J.McB. Why is the reference to "Curse on Jesus" spoken of first?
J.T. It alludes to what was possible at Corinth after the apostle left. In speaking of this, it is only fair that we should remember the Lord had called these people His own: "I have much people in this city". They were not merely nominal christians, but really christians; in fact, he speaks of "babes in Christ", so as to make that clear. They may have been only twenty-four months old -- they could not have been more, and many of them much less -- so we need not be surprised that such conditions existed in the gathering. Some of them might be so devoid of intelligence in the gathering that the devil might get a place. Some of us actually know something of that, of the devil having persons to speak for him, so we need not be surprised that there should be such a thing as that. The enemy had made a great effort with them, for there was conduct among them that would not be named among pagans. What is alluded to is the possibility of a demon being there as together, and saying, "Curse on Jesus" -- a terrible thought. I suppose ministry is alluded to, persons standing up to address the saints, and one of them might be under the influence of a demon.
E.J.McB. Bringing the old system into the assembly of God.
J.T. That is right, making room for the devil. We are told not to give place to him, and the test is the Spirit as the anointing. No one saying, "Curse on Jesus" would be anointed of God.
L.W.H. Is that why you emphasise our coming together in faith?
{324}
J.T. Yes. Many of us come together as people go to church, as we say, just dress and prepare for the meeting and walk along looking at what we see with unhallowed eyes, and, of course, when we get to the meeting we are not much above the level of ordinary religious persons, ordinary church-goers, whereas the thought is we should come out of the "dwellings of Jacob", that is, clean places where God has a place, and our movements on the way have in mind that we are material, so to speak, for the tabernacle, and our deportment should be in accord with that, so as entering into the room and taking our places there is dignity attached to us, and we are able to hold ourselves from the outset as linked together in one body. The organism ought to be in mind, because the Spirit operates according to the way we hold ourselves, according to the intelligence and faith we have.
J.J. Would that be the true thought of assembling, coming in that way?
J.T. Yes. The expression in chapter 11: "when ye come together in assembly", is a very great expression. The article is not there before the word 'assembly', so what is meant is attitude of mind, that I am not coming into something, but I am the something myself in principle. So that I hold the saints in my mind in that way.
N.K.M. Does faith enter into this? You have expressed the need of our coming together primarily on the principle of faith.
J.T. It does. Of course, we are to walk by faith at all times and not by sight, and when we are assembling it seems to me it should be a matter of great consequence how we hold ourselves, so that as we enter into the place and sit down it is a real thing and that gives room for the Spirit.
W.C. Are you connecting the thought of the
{325}
tabernacle with the assembly convened, or does it go on when the saints are not together?
J.T. You hold yourself as of it, and that is where the fellowship comes in. In chapter 10, it is when we are not convened, how we hold ourselves in relation to our brethren when we are not in each other's view, that is, when the tabernacle was taken down and carried in the wilderness. Of course, what we are speaking of did not enter into this, but when it was taken down it was to be put up again.
W.C. So there are three positions, the "tents of Jacob", and then the tabernacle in connection with the carrying, and then the tabernacle set up.
J.T. That is how it stands. The tents of Jacob were each in their place, a certain distance from the tabernacle. The suggestion is very beautiful, the Lord looking out from His place within, according to Leviticus, to see His people coming. How delightful they were to Him! Alas, we have to own there was very little of it apparently, but still there was that. The Lord led the way in that; the Psalms indicate that He knew how to approach the house of God.
A.W.P. Are you suggesting that God only can appreciate the movements of leaving the tents of Jacob?
J.T. I think He does supremely. I like to see the brethren as they come. What can be more delightful on the streets than to see the brethren moving towards the assembly? I think it is very fine. Think of the dignity that attaches to them, but do they hold themselves in that dignity as they move along the streets?
P.H.H. Is Simeon an example of it, coming into the temple in the Spirit? Would that cover what you are alluding to, as to literally coming to the meeting?
J.T. Anna came up too. She did not have to kneel down to get her spirit right. Years back the
{326}
brethren knelt down to get themselves right -- whether it was borrowed from the church, I do not know -- but Anna did not have to do that, nor did Simeon who came in the Spirit.
P.L. So in @Luke 24:52 it says, "And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God". Would that be the thought?
J.T. Quite so. If you take Luke's account in the Acts, the Lord is said to have gone up from Olivet, and they returned to Jerusalem, and then we are told how far it was -- a sabbath day's journey. I suppose the allusion might have been to the journey from the "dwellings of Jacob" to the tabernacle. What delight there would be in heaven as Jesus had gone up in those movements! Those feet were taking those dear people back to Jerusalem, and they entered into the city and went to the upper room. That was the outlook in Acts, alluding to the place of meeting, not the temple, not a religious building in Jerusalem, but an upper room. That is what has continued ever since; at least, it is to mark our meetings. What delight there was in heaven as those feet carried those people, their hearts full of Christ, wending their way back to the city, and we are told how far it was, and going to the upper room.
N.K.M. Why does it say a sabbath day's journey?
J.T. It would seem to be a short journey, limited, but enough to take you to God. The sabbath does not hinder you getting to God; it ought to help you to get to God.
P.L. Does the sabbath as a sign of covenant suggest that they would be governed by covenant conditions to do that journey?
J.T. Yes. It must have been a limited journey, but the sabbath should not prevent the saints from
{327}
getting to God; there could never be such a thought as that.
J.J. Would you connect @Psalm 133 with the scripture in Corinthians or Ephesians?
J.T. I think it is more the Ephesian side, because you have the heavenly side brought in "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!". If we assume this to be concrete at any time it would be the Corinthian thought. It is not what men see exactly as the order of God in the assembly; it is brethren just, and what it is like. Of course, it would enter into our assembling, but the word 'dwell' is a question of love and brethren. But still, it enters into what we are saying, because you have the hem of the garment, which would mean that things are in order -- they are not loose.
E.J.S. Would the thought of baptism into one body by the one Spirit and being given to drink of one Spirit be on that line? Is the thought of unity there?
J.T. And satisfaction also -- unity and satisfaction. "In the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body". That is done by the Lord, you might say, by the Spirit Himself but the drinking is our side. We have "all been given to drink of one Spirit", meaning that we are satisfied in the unity. The drinking is brought in to suggest satisfaction, that we are not there looking at the clock in the hope of going home soon, but we are satisfied, and there is enjoyment in the position.
E.J.S. Is that all contained in the thought of the anointing?
J.T. That is what is implied. In verse 4 you will observe, "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things
{328}
in all". We have the great general position stated in those two verses, but the apostle, having stated the great general position of the Spirit, the Lord and God, then resumes what he had in mind, that is, to speak of the Spirit. That is the main thought in his mind, to speak of the Spirit, so that the anointing is the thing, as he goes on to say, "So also is the Christ". It is very remarkable that we have the Spirit here as first mentioned as giving the gifts and then we have the gifts mentioned. There are nine distinct things mentioned and they would all have a public bearing. They are given for profit, it says in verse 7, and then it goes on, "For to one, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; and to a different one faith, in the power of the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in the power of the same Spirit; and to another operations of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues". There is a large variety of gifts, all with a public beneficial bearing, giving the assembly a marvellous place publicly, the Spirit of God operating through these gifts. They are given, and it denotes the beneficent character of the thing; they are all in the sanctity and dignity.
P.L. Would it be like a city set upon a hill which cannot be hid -- elevation in dignity?
J.T. What could be greater -- if anyone had eyes to see -- as you walked along the streets of Corinth and turned into this company ordinarily, than what one would see and hear? There was nothing like it in all the history of the Greeks with all their powers of speaking and oratory; there was never anything like this, and that is the idea, that God should set those in that very place, Corinth in Greece, a known place of human mental ability. Was there ever
{329}
anything like it? Never, and that is the thought.
Ques. Would it be the continuation of Christ here?
J.T. Exactly, not only in the powers that were there, but in the way things were done.
F.W.K. So Peter and John going up to the temple to pray brought in the power of healing and blessing on the lame man, the manifestation of compassion and divine grace.
J.T. How completely God was identified with them, and not only with what was done, but the way Peter did it. It was at the Beautiful gate of the temple, but God had brought in something new. The Spirit of God loves to give us that bit, because it would bring in the dignity of the thing in one case, how it was done, and all in the name of the Lord Jesus, in the Spirit of the suffering Christ, the Nazarene.
Rem. It would make us careful in the way local offices are filled.
J.T. It should. These things are not common; they are all to be in the power of the Spirit.
W.C. Could you help us as to the sequence of these things? Why is wisdom first?
J.T. The Greeks were famous for wisdom, but here is something they never had. It is enlarged upon in the earlier part of the epistle. It is "the word of wisdom", a man getting up and speaking in this wisdom, the wisdom which God gives, the wisdom which the anointing affords.
W.C. This would come out in the setting of chapter 14 practically.
J.T. I think it would. It comes before the thought of miracles, as if God thought more of wisdom than of healing and tongues.
E.J.McB. Do you not think, God having much people in that city and Paul being the vessel by which they were brought to light and the Spirit the
{330}
power, that they are adequate to the thoughts of God in the city?
J.T. Yes; you feel how God would provide for the Spirit. There would be self-judgment; there would be scope for the Spirit. That is why I spoke of faith and intelligence, for that is what governs these chapters, especially chapter 14, intelligence and understanding; indeed, the section is opened by that thought. What delightful times they would have, a brother standing up, as room is given for the Spirit, to speak a "word of wisdom". We always need the "word of wisdom". And then it goes on, "the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit", that one has knowledge. Knowledge is a very important matter, the knowledge of God and the knowledge of things in general bearing on God and His service, and that would be given out in the power of the anointing, and you would be impressed that those men who were speaking were gifts; they are called gifts here. It was God's provision on earth for those dear people. The Lord had called them His people: "I have much people in this city", and now they are furnished, as it says in chapter 1: "so that ye come short in no gift", and those brothers standing up in this way would affect you: it is God speaking to me. They are gifts, and what a place it gives the Spirit as come.
J.J. So would it be right to say that in Corinthians the body is given for the manifestation of the Spirit rather than the thought of the Head?
J.T. I do not think headship is much in view. It is to bring out the greatness of the Spirit, what He is here to us, and He is with us from the time we sit down together. He is not presented as coming to us; but Christ comes.
L.W.H. So it is one and the same Spirit.
J.T. That is what is stressed here; there is only one Spirit.
{331}
E.J.McB. And prophecy is stressed as the governing factor of everything.
J.T. It goes on to knowledge, and then faith is the next thing, and then healing, and miracles, and prophecy, and discerning of spirits, and different kinds of tongues, and interpretation of tongues. You feel those people are so wonderfully provided for, as you have eyes to see and ears to hear, and the blessed Person who has done all this is actually among them. It is "in the power of the same Spirit" right through here. Prophecy would bring God in; the prophet standing up would impress you that God had something to say, it may be to your conscience. You might enjoy a word of faith, and so healings, and the like, but maybe there is something in my conscience that needs to be dealt with too, for there is not a moment but perhaps I need to be searched about something, and that is an important thing. In fact, I do not see how the others could go on without it, without God coming in in convicting power.
P.L. There is what is arresting in the anointing. It is said that they "wondered at the gracious words". Is that a feature?
J.T. That is what is contemplated, what the Greeks would see in testimony. They never heard such persons speak as these. Well, what is the explanation of it? Some of them might be mere humble people outwardly, but it is in the power of the Spirit of God.
P.H.H. It is very wonderful the way the Spirit is spoken of in verse 11 "dividing to each in particular according as he pleases".
J.T. It is to bring out the sovereignty of the Spirit. We shall come to "as he pleases" later on, but this early part is to bring out the Spirit and His sovereignty.
Ques. Why is faith spoken of as a particular gift in this section?
{332}
J.T. It is not faith as we ordinarily speak of it, as in Romans; it is faith for certain purposes. God is pleased to give certain persons special faith, faith to do things, to remove mountains and the like. If we go before, as some do, there are obstacles to be removed, but there is faith given to do that.
J.J. Could you give an example of that?
J.T. I suppose it marked the apostles. Peter standing up with the eleven in @Acts 2 was not simply as an ordinary christian, but as a man who knew that the whole power of Jerusalem would be against them. The Lord had said to them, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Be transported hence there, and it shall transport itself" (@Matthew 17:20). That mountain would be the Jewish system, and Peter would know that. Though he spoke to them in beautiful terms, yet he would know well enough what was there, and what soon came out too, but he overcame on the principle of faith.
Ques. Would Paul illustrate it when he said, "I believe God" (@Acts 27:25)? He had faith for the moment that all would be well.
J.T. I think all the apostles had it, and Paul more particularly. What obstacles they had to overcome -- we hardly realise it -- after Jerusalem was overthrown in the souls of the saints, so that they went to the upper room instead of the temple. That would be the meaning of that. And when Paul approached the pagan world, what he had to overcome, but faith gave him power to overcome. It is a special thing for pioneers.
N.K.M. Timothy is exhorted to be a model of believers and one of the ways is in faith.
E.J.McB. Does it not come out strikingly in the shipwreck, Paul evidently having this gift of faith?
J.T. He said, "For I believe God that thus it
{333}
shall be, as it has been said to me" (@Acts 27:25). He saw that they would be saved.
E.J.McB. When it looked as if everyone was going to be lost, be stood up and said, "There shall be no loss at all of life of any of you".
J.J. And would it not apply to a locality, that if something has to be done and one has this gift, the thing will be carried through?
J.T. The Lord supplies someone with faith for the thing, and it takes the form of leadership in that way.
Ques. So would you include the care meeting in your thoughts in regard of these matters?
J.T. Of course, every saint should have faith. The dispensation of God is in faith, but there is a special gift spoken of here given by the Holy Spirit. Faith is the gift of God in general, but there is a special thing God gives in view of the testimony and obstacles to be overcome.
F.W.K. So Paul saw the whole thing going to pieces before he passed off the scene, but his faith looked on to the completion of things.
J.T. Such a thing is to be borne in mind, that faith is given to us, for all this implies the Comforter, the Paraclete. There is not a thing that escapes His notice. The Spirit has watched over this meeting today, and we bring in the Holy Spirit who is here to help us in every detail, and so, when we come together, things are according to God and every one is to be in faith. The dispensation is on that principle, but then there are special obstacles to be overcome, and the saints generally perhaps could not cope with them, but there are those who can, and it is our wisdom to follow the lead they give.
A.E.C. Does the apostle bring in this gift of faith and healing in @Acts 20, in the case of the boy who had fallen down?
J.T. That is a good illustration of it. He says, "His life is in him". How did he know his life was
{334}
in him? It was not that he had brought him back to life again yet; it was faith, he knew it was in him. It was God going before, and the boy, of course, lived. The same things were seen in the Old Testament: "Who by faith overcame kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped lions¬ mouths, quenched the power of fire ..." (@Hebrews 11:33). There are greater difficulties to overcome today.
P.H.H. Men like Gideon having his numbers reduced and reduced again would be an example of this.
J.T. Quite so. Faith does not reckon by outward appearances; faith sees things as they are before God. It enables one to go forward; you are assured it is of God, not going forward blindly, but in the distinct knowledge that God is in it.
Ques. Is it like the woman in Proverbs who considers the field?
J.T. She considers the field and purchases it; there is no question of where she is to get the money. The purchase becomes easy if you decide on a thing.
P.H.H. Do you think the drinking in verse 13, "All been given to drink of one Spirit", would be a practical link between these external things and the Spirit helping us on the line of worship in the assembly?
J.T. That is the next thing. The public side merges into the inner thing, that is, approach to God, and I believe that approach is in the anointing. That is, we are all brought together in the sense that the Lord has put us together. Baptised "in the power of" is really a question of the Spirit here and not the letter as elsewhere. It is baptism "in the power of one Spirit". "In the power of" is put in there to give the meaning of the preposition. It is the power of the Spirit acting, so that we recognise His sovereign action, and we are conscious that He has done something. Baptism by the Spirit is that He has done
{335}
it; it is in His power. Well, the next thing is that we "have all been given to drink of one Spirit". Whether the word is 'made' or 'given' -- I suppose 'given' is more correct -- it is your privilege to do it, as it is the privilege of the church to clothe herself with fine linen. You are doing it, and in doing it you are satisfied as a holy organism in which there is no complaint. Later on we have complaint, the foot saying of the hand, and so on, implying independency. But verse 18 shuts out all that. If the Spirit is given place, if I am subject, all independency is shut out. I do not isolate myself, I am in an organism and I do not wish to get out of it. I believe it is in that way we move, as it says, "Having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives" (@Matthew 26:30). We move together.
E.J.McB. That was your thought in the expression, "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".
J.T. That is right: "we both", which suggests the idea of unity, that we move together: "They went out to the mount of Olives". An examination of the facts shows that the mount of Olives was Christ's place, where He went when He was in Jerusalem. There is no suggestion of a special place in Galilee, the point being that Jerusalem is the place of evil. It is where our Lord was crucified that the Supper is celebrated and where all this comes about, the Holy Spirit being here. So there is an organism brought into action. We may be together and the first action is the singing of a hymn; "they" sang it, it says. The Lord is not mentioned, as it were; it is the saints there together, and then they went to the mount of Olives. Now, in the mount of Olives we take a position that was already occupied by Christ. As the Son He is in that position, and we are in that position. That brings in scope, and I believe it is there that this verse in Ephesians fits. It is more
{336}
Christ there: "And, coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh. For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". If He preached it was to bring us there, but it is in the power of the Spirit. For us the mount of Olives is not a physical thing but spiritual; it is in our minds as we take up the new place, and that place is already occupied by Christ. That is the position.
J.J. Would you say why it says in the verse in Corinthians, "Given to drink of one Spirit"? Does it mean participation?
J.T. I think drinking suggests satisfaction; it is what refreshes and satisfies.
Ques. How could you worship apart from satisfaction?
J.T. Just so. How could I worship if I am in a complaining attitude. God all in all is the great end in this epistle, and in Ephesians He is the great end before us, and the other two divine Persons are engaged in our approaching God the Father.
Ques. Is worship taken into account in our access to the Father?
J.T. Clearly so. The Father seeks worshippers. The position is as clear as possible, and these scriptures are important as to taking the new place.
P.L. Does this witness to the great objective that God may be reached in worship?
J.T. I think so. These two holy divine Persons have taken a lower place all to the end that we might be brought to God and to worship Him, one of the Persons retaining the position of Deity in absoluteness. You find throughout that God is the end in all these matters.
E.J.S. Is it important that in the second epistle the apostle stresses the anointing as being by God? "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and
{337}
has anointed us, is God" (@2 Corinthians 1:21). Is that God in the three Persons of the Trinity?
J.T. Quite. You do not always need to say the three Persons because the Father is God: "To us there is one God, the Father" (@1 Corinthians 8:6). He retains His place in absoluteness. The thought of God is never impaired in any sense by two divine Persons taking a place of service; God is always there. We have to bear in mind the inscrutable in speaking in that way. When the Son and the Spirit are operating on our side there is no need to bring Them in as Objects of worship. Of course, They are part of the Deity, but it is a question of the economy we are in. Let us be in it as it is presented to us, and not endeavour to compass it with our natural minds.
{338}
HEAVEN'S INTERVENTIONS
@Acts 2:1 - 4; @Acts 9:3 - 5; @Acts 10:9 - 16
What is in mind, dear brethren, in these scriptures which have been read is to call attention to heaven's interventions in this book. The book of the Acts is, as you will all know, Luke's second treatise. The first treatise, setting out in the most touching manner the service of Christ from the evangelical point of view, culminates in the remnant of Israel seen in Bethany, or rather led by Him as far as Bethany; that was not the full end in view, but it was as far as He then in wisdom led them. Bethany is a very auspicious point, its history disclosing much that was precious to Christ; His leading always culminates in some advantage, even although it may not be finality. The patience of God requires lodging places for those who are in the way, and, as lovers of God, we do not complain if we are held at a point to fill out some wise, gracious, patient purpose; that is the end of Luke. Whilst they were led to Bethany, they, in the liberty wherewith Christ sets free, returned to Jerusalem and were in the temple "praising and blessing God". They were well occupied, for in these lodging places we are not to be idle but well occupied, and in no way can we be better occupied than in praising and blessing God. The book of Acts, the second treatise, on the other hand, has finality in mind, reflected for the moment in the assembly, not the remnant of Israel, although that is taken account of in the book as it is said, "Such as should be saved" -- the remnant are in mind in that. But finality is in view, for the assembly is final in the sense of affording a residence for God without reserve; God resides in it without reserve. It is a residence, too, for His glory and a residence for all His thoughts, for all His counsels
{339}
and thoughts reside, find a place, in the assembly. The remnant of Israel was not great enough for that. According to Ephesians the assembly is the lesson book even for angels, the all-various wisdom of God is seen in it, and that even now. And then moreover in that same chapter in Ephesians (chapter 3) it is stated that God is to be glorified there -- glory to God "in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". You can see therefore, dear brethren, that finality in principle is in mind in the assembly; and so in this second treatise the writer speaks of the Lord presenting Himself to the saints -- to the apostles, of course, those whom He had chosen, but to the saints, to whom, as it is said, He presented Himself living. It would be enough for us, no doubt, if it said He appeared to them: it is also said in great detail by the apostle Paul that He did appear to them, He was seen of them in various circumstances. But the early verses of the book of the Acts say that He presented *Himself* living; a very remarkable statement and one to be well noted, because it is the Lord presenting Himself, taking up an attitude toward His own so that they may have every advantage in seeing Him in the sense in which He intended to be seen, that is, as living, but as living after He suffered. He is presented by Luke before He suffered and after; after He suffered He is presented living, but not in the sense of living as He was here in the flesh, but in a wholly new condition, a condition and a life which entered into the constitution of the assembly and the material to form it, for the tabernacle is to be a greater and more perfect one, not of this creation, as it is stated in Hebrews. It is of material that is not of this creation; it is a new creation; Christ is the pattern for that, He is the beginning of the creation of God; whether we look at it as it is materially or spiritually, He is the beginning of it. He is not part of it -- we must never admit the thought that He is
{340}
part of the creation -- He is the beginning of it, for the new man is created "according to the image of him that has created him" (@Colossians 3:10) -- created in full knowledge, and the Creator there is Christ. So that it is Christ presented as the pattern of the material that should form this great building, the assembly. And, in order to fill the thought out, Luke continues to say that the Lord was assembled with them, He assembled with them; He was not only the pattern of the material, for it is a question of persons who have suffered, but who live after having suffered. But He is not only the pattern of that, but He is the pattern of conduct in the assembly, of service in it, so that He was assembled with them -- not they with Him -- meaning that He would take part in the position with that great assembly, as I may say, the first one properly after the Lord rose -- being assembled with them. So that you can see that in the second treatise the outlook is the assembly -- other things come in, of course, the wonderful patience of God in waiting on Israel, for instance -- but that is the great end in view in this treatise.
Well now, that being so, dear brethren, what we should spiritually expect is that the Lord Jesus having gone up into heaven, as we are told He did in chapter 1, there should be heavenly intervention. Surely there must be! The object of His heart is here on earth, that for which He gave Himself is here on earth, His eyes are on it; He "loved the assembly", we are told, "and has delivered himself up for it" (@Ephesians 5:25) There must, therefore, be interventions, and in these interventions, heavenly impressions, reminders that 'Your place is not down here; your place is up there' -- that would be the reminder. The Lord would say, 'I know where you are; you are in the world; you are where I have been; you are where I suffered, and I am not forgetting you; I know all about it' -- and hence these interventions. We are kept, as it were, on the
{341}
qui vive of something to follow -- we should be, dear brethren; the movements of heaven come in to remind us that 'This is not your resting-place. You are there just for a moment for wise purposes; you have to suffer in that scene, to testify in it, but it is not your place'.
Now the first great intervention is in chapter 2. Of course there is much more in it than I can undertake to speak of tonight. I have only one thought in what I am now presenting, and that is heavenly intervention, not as a mere historic matter, but as having a present bearing, that there is such a thing as heaven intervening, and, in doing so, it is to remind us that this is not our place, we belong elsewhere. "Where I am ye also may be" (@John 14:3), ye must be, ye shall be -- that is what the Lord said. That would surely never be forgotten by those to whom it was said. He said, "In my Father's house there are many abodes" -- He would cover the extent of the Father's domain, the Father's house; but "I go", He says, "to prepare you a place". It seems to me that in His remarks to them in that passage, He assumes that they would expect something like this; He says, "Were it not so, I had told you", as much as to say, 'You have had such a thought in your mind and you are not to be disappointed'. No spiritual instincts will be disappointed; however vague, they will always be gratified. So He says, "Were it not so, I had told you" as if they had expected they would have a special place and that He said that was in His mind. Why, He says, "the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me" (@John 16:27) -- what a comforting thought that is. And so you will have a special place; there is a special place for you; and lest this should be forgotten or the thought disappear or weaken in any way, heaven is intervening. Now the first great intervention was when Jesus went up. As you will remember, there were two men at the ascension
{342}
clothed in white, and the disciples were on Olivet beholding the Lord as He went up. A cloud had received Him out of their sight and they evidently kept looking up, but the men said, 'He is coming back; why do you stand looking up?' -- that is, they would be adjusted as to this -- "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven". Note the word 'manner' -- He went up, they beholding Him, they are not to lose anything. You say, 'Well, what does that matter? that is a mere trifle'. It is not a trifle -- "They beholding him" -- they saw the movement; it was the movement of ascension, a movement we are to understand, for we are to ascend too; that is, we are to be taken up; and the Lord is to come in like manner. And now that He is taken out of their sight, the faith period has begun, but *heaven is to come in*. I wonder if we understand these things; have we had any experience of heaven coming in either in sound, or in rushing mighty wind, or in the way of light, or in the way of a vessel? These things are to be apprehended spiritually, they are the great features I have in mind: first, the sound, the power; then the light; and then the substance. Veritable substance comes down from heaven. There can be no dwelling place of God here aside from this, it is a question of what is in heaven brought down. But the first thing, dear brethren, is the sound from heaven.
Now we have to just note for a moment what was in Jerusalem, what was in mind, what heaven was thinking of in this. Would that our thoughts could be transferred a little to heaven -- think of what goes on in heaven. Even the conversion of a person occasions joy up there; but think of how much more interest is a company of people formed by the hand of Christ, every one of them not only convicted sinners, but having a name and distinction given by
{343}
the Lord. Think of what they are to heaven amidst the general state of things at Jerusalem, in the world! To make it simple, dear brethren, think of what we are -- without occupying ourselves with ourselves except for the sake of being practical and concrete. Do you not think heaven is interested in this meeting? Do you not think heaven is pleased with this meeting? Do you not think heaven is restful in this meeting? I do. It is a veritable green spot amidst the general sterility around, not to say anything of the corruption. As to the saints, the corruption is, as it were, dealt with by the fire, like the two loaves of old that were baked with leaven, but the leaven was inoperative -- made so by the fire. That is what the assembly is, and that is what any meeting gathering in faith in the recognition of the Spirit of God is.
Now these dear brethren spoken of in @Acts 2 -- we are told in the previous chapter the crowd of the names was about a hundred and twenty -- are together, we are told, in one place; and they are *sitting* -- a word to be noted in this book too, a word pointing to finality -- they are sitting. It was while the feast of Pentecost was accomplishing, the thing was running its course, and heaven asserted itself. Jerusalem did not know, Jerusalem as such was not affected by this: it was the house where these people, so interesting severally -- each having a name, were -- and not exactly "were" as in @John 20, but they were *sitting*. That would imply a certain restfulness and a permanency as to position; they were not idle people, they were not watching the clock to see when they should go home; they "were staying", we are told in chapter 1, in the upper room; it was the place of intelligent affection, the place of mutual sympathy. Now they are sitting, there is a certain dignity about them that is perhaps indescribable -- heaven would understand it, they are the handiwork of Jesus; He
{344}
left them behind Him. And, as they were sitting, they heard "a sound ... as of a rushing mighty wind"; that is to say, you are going to be preserved in this attitude; you will not be disturbed in this attitude; there is power in your favour. It does not say the place was shaken here; it does in chapter 4; it is called a "house" here, it is called a "place" there; they are "sitting" here, they were "assembled" there. They have made headway. Here they are restful, and heaven says, 'All the power up here is on your behalf'; do you not think the apostles understood it? I am sure they did. And then we are told, "There appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it [not 'they'] sat upon each of them". It is one idea, marked by these great features, features that faith does not recoil from; that mighty power is in the favour of faith, faith reckons upon it. Nor does faith recoil from the fire, it welcomes it. Who is there who is with God, as understanding the cross of Jesus, who does not welcome what withers up the flesh, what purifies the soul, what maintains the assembly in purity so that God can be in it! It is to be welcomed, dear brethren. Well, that is the first thing. It is a question of sound; that is to say, heaven is going to speak, heaven is to be heard during all this period. A sound -- heaven is to be heard in power; that is the idea, as I apprehend; and the sound filled the house. What a moment it must have been! Neither before nor since, I suppose, has there been any such moment; but it is to be carried down, the same Spirit is here tonight as was there at Pentecost on that day. Let us be believers in the Spirit, that He is here; not simply that He exists, but that He is here under the wonderful term of Comforter or Paraclete. That is, He is here beside us, here in power, here to make heaven heard; and He will be heard. Through whom? Well, through us, dear brethren, to be simple. How great that is,
{345}
that I may be used by heaven to make a sound; not a confused noise, but a sound, a distinctive sound, a heavenly sound -- that person is speaking from heaven. And then there is the power going with it, filling the house too.
The next thing -- and I suppose the order is right morally -- is an intervention in the way of light. What I have spoken of refers to the Spirit in the great general features of His presence here; but there is, added to that, the thought of a light out of heaven. We must always be ready for any movement from heaven in the way of additional light; not that the thing is not complete in one sense, but there is this constant intervention from heaven in the way of light, and it gradually becomes clearer, because in the third account we get there is increase in the quality of the light. Not that it was not the same light at the beginning; it is a question of our apprehension. How often it is some thought comes; it is not very clear, but it is there. Why is it not clear? Because *I* am not clear, because of some clouding principle in me that God has to remove; and I have to be brought to it. Let us be brought to it, let us not throw a thing aside because we do not understand it. Maybe the thing will become clear, and clearer and still clearer, until it shines round about us and we will call it "a light above the brightness of the sun". How affecting that is, when the thing becomes so clear and brilliant that we are able to describe it as above any natural light, above the brightness of the sun. That is going on, dear brethren, in a small way, of course, for we are not in such times as these, but the assembly is the same to the Lord as it was then, and He is constantly intervening and causing light to shine round about us. We may say, it shone round about Paul -- so it did, and that is the first thought of it -- but it shone round about all who were with him. I believe that is the thought. Some
{346}
brother gets a thought, it shines for him, perhaps not for others then; but presently all get it -- that is the thought, it includes all, it shines round all who were with him. We should be prepared for heavenly light. In that beautiful hymn we often sing, it says, 'Heav'nly light makes all things bright, seen in that blissful gaze'. Let us be prepared for that, let us not be afraid of the light -- let it shine. It is to prepare us for heaven itself; so that this great light Saul saw would prepare him for the light that shines in heaven -- not only *out of it*, but *in it*. Think of the brilliancy of it shining in its own sphere.
Then another thing, dear brethren, is that in this second intervention, we have the thought of the saints being something peculiar that had not been disclosed before, that is Christ's body. The light is progressive, and in this case the very saints who heard the sound in chapter 2 are now to be regarded as Christ's body, as Himself indeed -- "Me", He says. You can see how progressive this is, and how preparatory it is for chapter 10; it is the Lord Himself: the first intervention was in relation to what was there in the way of approval. The fire did not mean that the flesh was active; it meant that, if it were active, it would take care of it, it was a provision. There was no reproof in the presence of the fire, it was a provision; it was a question of deference to the one hundred and twenty, or whoever were there. Heaven is coming in in relation to them; the Spirit of God, a divine Person, can actually rest on them -- It sat on them, it says; it is the public position, it is God identifying Himself with them, but in such a way as to prevent anything that would disturb Him. But now, Saul was not pleasing to heaven -- he was a violent persecuting man -- it is no question of deference to him; what is in mind is prospective now, it is what is to be. So this second intervention should be taken in that way, that the Lord comes in from heaven
{347}
in view of what is to be, meaning that things are not altogether what He would wish, that there is something more, and that is always true in the most practical way. I say certainly I invite anything that indicates something that is to be in regard of myself, for the Lord intends much more; He has much more in mind as to me than He has realised; it is a question of what is to be, hence we invite the light. This great vessel is to be -- What is he to be? Well, the Lord says to him, as we learn later, "Rise up and stand on thy feet; for, for this purpose have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee to be a servant and a witness" (@Acts 26:16). It is what he would be; and in speaking to Ananias, the Lord tells him, He "is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel". How much of that is needed, dear brethren, amongst us, the Lord taking up someone -- for the need is very great. One servant after another passes away; the Lord takes His servants, you know; they do not live beyond the ordinary life of men, and the Lord takes up others. Who are they to be? The need is there; there must be the continuance of the testimony; hence it is a question of who it is to be. Am I a potentiality? The Lord has a long look out, and He prepares a long way ahead. Who knew what He was doing here on the way outside Damascus? Only Himself. What was He doing? He was beginning to make the great apostle Paul. Who knows what He may be doing now? Who knows who is in the making? Is there anyone here who says, 'I do not wish to be in the making'? The Lord forbid it. The Lord has His thought as to you, and it is a question, not of what you are now, but of what you are to be. He will make you what you are to be if you will let Him. He has His thought about you. "That I may apprehend", says the apostle, "that for which also I am apprehended" (@Philippians 3:12). The Lord will make
{348}
us that if we allow Him to. Did Paul let Him? Yes; he said, "What shall I do, Lord?" -- he said, "Lord". I would say to any young man or woman here, 'The Lord needs you: He will make you what He has in His mind for you if you will let Him'. Paul was told to go into the city, "and it shall be told thee what thou must do". That is a humbling thing, certainly it would have been to a man like Paul to go into the city and learn from a hitherto unheard-of disciple; but Paul did it. The Lord made him what He had in mind for him, it is what he is to be; so the Lord said, "*I* am Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest"; He did not let him off, the Lord would never let us off in His love -- "whom *thou* persecutest", that is, You are persecuting Me when you are persecuting My people; those people in those houses whom you are persecuting are Myself. Now, as we have often heard, the mystery is here, that the Lord is completely identified with His people, that we are the body of Christ. That is a very great thought; but it was not stated at Pentecost or subsequently; it was stated in this mysterious way, as I might say, to Saul before he had the Spirit, but it is recorded there that we might know and understand what the Lord had in His mind at this juncture. The Lord was moving forward and the light was increasing, and He was to be represented here, not only by certain ones with names on earth, but in a body, in the saints vitally linked up as an organism. That is what He has in mind.
Where does this come from? That is the next intervention, and what is meant in this well-known vision to Peter is substance out of heaven, that is, the material in the assembly is out of heaven; the body is of Christ, not Christ as He was here on earth, but Christ as He is now; that is the thought in the church, the body is of Christ. Well, you may say, 'These creatures did not represent the body'. No,
{349}
they did not as creatures, as quadrupeds on the earth, but it is what they are potentially. As I have been saying, it is not what is, but what is to be. God can call things that be not as though they were, and that is the idea when the Lord says, "Me"; this is the substance, taken up, to be sure, as each of us has been, in his local responsibility, as a sinner cleansed and purified and formed and indwelt by the Spirit -- all that is from heaven -- not a bit in the assembly, not an item, that does not come out of heaven. Peter had to learn that; not that he did learn it here, but he was certainly an apt learner; he was not rebellious, and that is a word for us. Saul was not rebellious, nor was Peter -- they are examples for us. What could the Lord do with these men, or with any of us, if they or we are rebellious? Nothing. I mean as to what He is doing positively. He can deal with us in judgment, of course; but in a positive way He can do nothing with a grumbling person or a complaining person. He has to stand over such, as He did over Peter's wife's mother, so that they might become subject. But, as subject and obedient, the Lord can do much with us. So He can bring in this thought of a large vessel, a substantial thing, knit at the four corners, let down from heaven with all these creatures in it, reminding us of Noah's ark. Now they are in this sheet come down from heaven -- they came to Noah in the ark, they are obedient. How did they get up there? Of course, it is a vessel, but there it is. There are the quadrupeds of the earth and the wild beasts and the creeping things -- and Peter is to be brought round to that. It is not that he is to be with these people in this character. No. "What God has cleansed" implies the removal of all those hideous features; but what a God He is to let them come down from heaven, as if to imply that even such thoughts are in heaven. Why does God admit such thoughts as are expressed in these wild beasts
{350}
in heaven? On our account. It is God saying, 'It is what you are, and in spite of that, I am going to make you what I want you to be, a member of Christ'. And Peter doubtless learnt that. We have to learn things abstractly, and then to see how God works them out; so Peter says beautifully afterwards, "It came even to me", as much as to say, 'I was greatly honoured. I did not think so at first, but I do now'. How wonderfully he explains the matter at Jerusalem; 'God is working', he says; that is the great thing in the sheet, it is a question of the counsels of God, what God can do and what He is doing to accomplish His counsels out of the most extraordinary material to bring out the most wonderful thing that has ever been conceived, that is Christ and His body, Christ and His people.
That is what I had in mind to present to you as to heaven's interventions, and to seek to show that, while these things are historical, the bearing is always on the present, that heaven is always intervening in relation to that which it loves, to make them suitable to heaven. Men will say -- if they are not saying it already -- Let God be in heaven: we on the earth; but the point is that God is the God of the earth; in the book of the Revelation God asserts Himself as on the earth, as He will, but, in the meantime, He is asserting Himself in relation to those He loves. This book tells us that God purchased the assembly with the blood of His own; that is what it is to Him; it is a question of God and this four-cornered sheet in regard to His creation, what He can do, what He can take account of in it pending its complete deliverance from the thraldom of sin and of Satan.
{351}
THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS
@Acts 11:19 - 26; @Ephesians 4:11 - 16
J.T. The proposal is to consider the perfecting of the saints as a marked feature of the ministry of the apostle Paul. After the death of Stephen, many were scattered from Jerusalem, all, indeed, "except the apostles", and we are told in the passage read in @Acts 11 that they went as far as Antioch and preached not only to Jews but to the gentiles, so that a great many believed and turned to the Lord. We are not told who these people were by name, nor is it said that they were sent, so that we have to regard them -- to use a common expression -- as unskilled in their work. Philip, even, who preached at Samaria, is not said to have been sent, nor is he said, till afterwards, to have been an evangelist, but in his case, and in the case of those who went to Antioch, there were results from the numerical point of view, and, not only so, but they "turned to the Lord", we are told in our chapter, and, indeed, were "added to the Lord". But still, in both cases, skilled labourers were required to carry on the work in the souls of these converts. In the case of those at Samaria, they did not even receive the Spirit immediately. Peter and John came down from Jerusalem so that they should receive the Spirit, and found indeed a condition there that would have been extremely detrimental to the work had they not discerned it. Peter discerned the state of soul of Simon Magus. And in chapter 11 at Antioch, Barnabas came also from Jerusalem, and the Spirit tells us "he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit", for as he arrived he recognised the work. He also discerned that other ability, another workman, was needed besides what was there, and he went and sought out Saul, we are told, and found him,
{352}
and brought him to Antioch, and he and Saul taught a great crowd in the assembly for a whole year. The object in bringing all this forward is that we should be reminded of the need of perfecting, that numbers, while to be valued in themselves as having light and a measure of knowledge of God through the gospel, need to be perfected, that, indeed, the work today for those who have the Lord's mind, who know Him as Head in the assembly, is largely to perfect what the Lord brings forward of the labours of others. Much has been done abroad in christendom for which we can thank God, but very little of it, alas! is available for the assembly in a practical sense, and the Lord would lay it upon us, as having any knowledge of Christ as Head and the assembly as His body, to see to the perfecting of what there is, that there may be something for God. That is what comes out at Antioch, that there was an assembly there; after the service of these skilled men for a year there was something there for God: "they ministered to the Lord, and fasted". Perhaps the latter is as great an evidence of perfecting as the former -- ability to fast.
C.A.C. Does that begin with individual labour? Paul speaks of presenting "every man perfect in Christ" (@Colossians 1:28).
J.T. It would show how much is in mind. In Ephesians it is, "until we all arrive", with a view to the body, the organism, edifying itself. Evidently ministry can only go so far. God uses it to perfect us in the sense that our senses are all in action, that things are normal with us spiritually, so that there is growth "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ; in order that we may be no longer babes". Apprehending the organism, that is, what we are as related to one another by the Spirit, there is self-edifying in love.
{353}
E.L.M. Do you see the same thing in Ezra's day? They discovered there was a lack of Levites, and Ezra sent some back to Babylon to bring further help in relation to the remnant that was recovered from Babylon, and "by the good hand of our God" (@Ezra 8:18) certain men were brought to light.
J.T. Ezra himself represented the skilled side, the priestly side of the ministry. We have his genealogy given so that there is no doubt as to who he is from the standpoint of spirituality and refined thoughts. So that we get with him not only number but weight -- quality.
S.J.B.C. Are the gifts persons here, or are they gifts given to persons? "He gave some", it says, and also, "Gave gifts unto men". Would the gifts be universal here?
J.T. These are persons -- apostles, prophets, evangelists, and so on. But what is to be noted is that Saul at the beginning had no converts from his preaching. Peter had three thousand from his first address, but we hear nothing of converts of Paul's for some years after he began to preach. That is, we have to learn how to think of quality in our service. At the outset, young men are apt to think of quantity, of outward results from what they are doing, but in this great vessel we do not get any converts at the outset, although we get preaching and we get him a whole year labouring here in Antioch, not in the gospel, as we speak of it ordinarily, but teaching in the assembly.
C.A.C. Were things ever perfected at Jerusalem?
J.T. I do not think they were. What had you in mind to say about that?
C.A.C. I was thinking of the strong trend of legal influence that remained there, and that even acted upon Paul himself later, indicating an imperfect condition of things.
{354}
J.T. The Lord had said that if they were persecuted in one city they should flee to another. Apparently they all did save the apostles, and those that fled seem to have been the ones used. As regards the apostles remaining at Jerusalem, whilst they gave further evidence of the patience of God, and whilst God worked with them too and there were results, it was not His mind that the truth of the church should be developed there. It was His mind that the full testimony of the gospel should be presented there as marking the dispensation, but what was in His mind as a vessel of testimony here was evidently reserved for Paul, and the way the converts were withheld, or the non-mention of them, from Paul's ministry at the outset, is something for us to notice. It cannot be alleged that God is not with us because of the lack of these outward evidences. We have to consider whether there is any perfecting going on. I think that is a word for all who would essay to serve or who are serving in a small way, to have in mind that the ministry of the greatest vessel was not marked by great outward results at first. It is as if God would remind him that, whilst there were many converts through the testimony of the twelve and others, these needed perfecting.
Eu.R. Is the exercise that those who had previously been characterised as a crowd might become intelligent as to functioning as an assembly?
J.T. That is what we shall see if we pursue the history. After the first missionary journey, Paul and Barnabas chose them elders in every assembly. Titus was told to appoint elders in every city, but they chose them elders in every assembly, meaning that they were to be set up in themselves severally with the means of going on and serving God -- self-edifying. That is what was in mind. You do not get that with Peter and John. There was a great numerical result at Pentecost and what followed.
{355}
We are told in chapter 4 that there were five thousand converts, a great outward genuine result, the work of God manifestly there in the description given of them, but there is no special allusion to the thought of forming assemblies. Not that they were not formed, because the assemblies are spoken of, but Paul makes a point of ordaining elders in each assembly.
Eu.R. It says even of the work at Antioch that "the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem".
J.T. Showing that the thought was there, and God would have us respect the assembly, that it was still with Him thoroughly, so much so that it had ears -- a very great tribute to it -- and a readiness to send out persons to help. All that is metropolitan, but it is not perfecting. The dispensation is not to be marked by a metropolis on earth, but a metropolis in heaven, and that comes in under Paul.
C.O.B. Would you say that we should not be discouraged if there is a lack of converts from our preaching?
J.T. We ought not to rest content if there is a lack of converts. One is not bringing forward these things today to suggest that we should relax any efforts in the gospel, because the apostle Paul did get wonderful results, even numerically, in due course, but I think the way the facts are presented is intended to put it upon us to have quality before us, not to belittle what is being done around us by others, not to forbid anyone, but to get a hold on what there is in order that it should be perfected. That was in the mind of Barnabas in seeking out Saul, that what was there, that is a large number of converts, should be perfected -- and they were perfected. Instead of those two great servants saying, We must go on with the gospel, we must get the gospel before all, they settled down to teach for a
{356}
year, according to this account, and in the assembly. It was not simply teaching with a view to the assembly, but *in* it, that is, the idea was there in the teaching.
Ques. Would the exhortation of Barnabas for "all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord", lead up to perfecting?
J.T. Yes; if you abide with Him, He will look after you till perfecting comes.
Rem. I thought it was remarkable that it is "with the Lord".
J.T. Could he have put them in better keeping? If saints who are wanting in the truth of the assembly cleave to the Lord, it will come. That is what He has in mind. You may say, Why did not the Lord teach them Himself? That is simply to ignore His way, that He provides special persons for the purpose, that He has His own workmen, and we must find them if they are to be found. Barnabas found this man and brought him to the spot. May we not say it was the Lord that Barnabas had prayed to about this matter and he had asked Him about it, and the Lord went with him every step to Tarsus, and was with him in finding Saul and inclining him to go back with him, and filling Saul's heart with what was needed? The Lord was in all that, and the Spirit of God tells us just what happened outwardly, so that those two men should be before us in the idea of skilled labour.
H.E.F. Are you implying that, if those servants are not found in a local company, we should seek them out and bring them there?
J.T. That is the thought -- if they are to be found, if they are available, why not get them? That is what comes out here. In chapter 9, Peter is sent for from Joppa; Cornelius sends for him, and Barnabas goes for Saul. That is, there are men for the work, and if we are with God we will ask Him about those
{357}
men. If He has them, where are they? And if they are available, avail ourselves of them. It is a question of honouring what God does. Hence in Ephesians it says, "*He* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers". He gave them with perfect wisdom according to the need and their measure -- "some", it says.
Rem. It perhaps requires considerable grace to go for somebody else when there is a work going on.
J.T. I think it does; it is an acknowledgment of our own insufficiency that is always wholesome. God may order it that we are insufficient, but sufficiency is elsewhere; there is an equalising in that. On the other hand, we are to make the most of what there is in a locality. "What is under thy hand?" (@1 Samuel 21:3), David said to Ahimelech. We have to use that, but if there is insufficiency, it is well to acknowledge it and not pretend it is not there.
G.E.G. Is there any special thought in the idea of a whole year?
J.T. God appointed the seasons at the beginning: "seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter". I suppose the cycle brings out certain conditions that test us, and it is well to go through the year.
Eu.R. With the brethren.
J.T. Yes. We read of Paul wintering with them (@1 Corinthians 16:6). A whole year would give occasion for the actual conditions in the great crowd that had already believed in Antioch to come to light.
C.A.C. Is there any distinction between the power of the Spirit acting relative to numbers as at Pentecost and the power of the ascended Christ conferring gifts with a view to perfecting? Is the perfecting connected with the power of the ascended Christ, perhaps as distinct from the power of the Spirit down here?
{358}
J.T. I suppose there is a distinction, not that the gifts do not come under the Spirit, but the link with an ascended Christ, as you suggest, is of great importance in this matter, for what is in mind is heavenly, what is to be perfected is for heaven.
C.A.C. Evangelical christendom has got some thought of the power of the Spirit to effect conversions and the like, but is there any thought of what is the expression of the ascended Christ? All would be skilled labourers who were given from heaven, surely.
J.T. They are classified, showing that in heaven the idea of skill has great place. The Lord has gone up as the great Masterbuilder Himself. "On this rock", He says, "I will build my assembly" (@Matthew 16:18). So that the classification of the workmen as from heaven is very suggestive, that it is not beneath the counsels up there to classify labourers and give them in measure -- "some", heaven knowing well what was needed for the foundation, and what was needed following on that in prophets, and what was needed following on that in evangelists, and what was needed following on that in pastors and teachers. It is very suggestive as to how things are thought of in heaven, for the incoming of heaven after the Spirit came, in various ways, links on with all this; that is, heaven thinks of what is needed and acts with perfect wisdom in supplying what is needed, but all to one end, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, the ministry being the great general thought. The work of the ministry is to be carried on in a skilled way and not haphazardly.
H.E.F. Why do you think the evangelists are put third? We should have thought they might have come first.
J.T. That is heaven's wisdom, heaven's way. There must be a foundation, and I suppose apostolic service is foundational, according to what we get in the heavenly city. The prophet is to bring God in,
{359}
not that the apostles were not all prophets doubtless they all were, but it is the order, one, two, three. If you have apostolic service, the prophetic service brings God in; God is there.
Eu.R. And that makes a man fall down on his face.
J.T. Quite so. "God is known in her palaces for a refuge", (@Psalm 48:3).
S.J.B.C. Is the "full-grown man" individual or collective?
J.T. It is a great general thought, the same as the new man.
H.E.F. Then would the evangelist have in view the bringing in of material for the assembly?
J.T. Yes. You have the foundational thought fully there and developed, and God being there. I apprehend the prophet brings God in and is concerned about all that would affect God; the gift of the prophet is that God is brought in in power -- not simply mentioned but brought in in power. The evangelist is for addition. What you get in the Acts are conditions for additions, first the conditions and then the additions. When Joseph was born, Rachel said, "Jehovah will add to me another son" (@Genesis 30:24), and on that, Jacob immediately thought of leaving, but he did not leave, but remained and added earthly things which only hindered him. What was really needed was Benjamin, and Benjamin is added in Canaan.
H.E.F. Then, referring to @Luke 10, would you say that when the Samaritan found the man who fell among thieves there were conditions to which he could bring him and in which he could leave him?
J.T. Yes, the inn. You get in @Acts 2 that "there were added in that day about three thousand souls", but before you get that there are beautiful conditions for addition. Then you get a description of those three thousand and the whole position at Jerusalem so beautifully given at the end of that chapter: "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the
{360}
apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers. And fear was upon every soul, and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles¬ means. And all that believed were together, and had all things common ...". They were together, and "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved". The conditions were there. Then, in chapter 5, the severe discipline administered to Ananias and Sapphira brought in other conditions. The additions were not hindered, and it says, "and believers were more than ever added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women", and they were in Solomon's porch, that is, the additions were in that relation.
Eu.R. Would you have us concerned in any locality as to whether the conditions are such to which the Lord can add?
J.T. Yes -- conditions for additions.
Eu.R. Is that suggested in @Acts 11, that, as the result of the teaching, right conditions were brought about in that the disciples were first called christians?
J.T. The work is dignified in putting that name upon them. That is not stated until after the year's work of those great servants.
S.J.B.C. I suppose they were called christians because they were so much like Christ.
J.T. That is the inference. It is not simply that outsiders called them that, but God had part in it and ordered that it should be so.
Eu.R. Does it link on with @1 Corinthians 12:12: "So also is the Christ"?
J.T. Pretty much; it is an honour to what was there after the year's service.
H.E.S. Do the evangelists then secure the material, and are the pastors and teachers for the perfecting of it?
J.T. The pastors and teachers come in after the evangelists, because the saints viewed as a flock
{361}
need to be looked after in a shepherdly way and taught in detail.
Ques. Should all these gifts be found functioning in any one assembly?
J.T. Well, you would not look for apostles now, of course, but it is well to get the great general position at the outset, as has been remarked, from an ascended Christ. It is most interesting to think of an ascended Christ thinking of all this and providing classified labourers so that the ministry should go on: "with a view to the work of the ministry". The ministry is a great dignified thought, and is to be marked by skill. "As a wise architect", the apostle says -- the allusion is to the skill with which he laid the foundation -- "I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it".
S.J.B.C. "Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets" (@Ephesians 2:20). The foundation is laid now because the structure is going on. The apostles and prophets had to do with the foundations.
J.T. It is to bring out the quality of the foundations, the very best possible.
S.J.B.C. So that the thought of apostolic succession is laying a series of foundations really.
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Should not the thought of perfecting weigh with us in inviting brethren to a locality for special meetings?
J.T. I think so. All these meetings would have that in view. It is a question of ministry: "with a view to the work of the ministry". As it says, "For the perfecting of the saints ... until we all arrive". That is, there is an end in view. It is not that we should have a big meeting in W -- ; the point is the perfecting of the saints, and with the universal outlook. So that the idea of sending for a qualified workman is quite in order, the one that will suit best for the moment. Of course, we have not got much
{362}
now; it is well to admit our deficiency, and the Lord would have us to accept things as they are, but the word is, What have you got? -- "What is under thy hand?", David said when rejected (@1 Samuel 21:3) -- to make the best use of what we have got, and the Lord has provided for these meetings. It is well to have in mind that there are those who may be better suited than others for the particular occasion, and I think that is what we get here. The first two that were sent out from Jerusalem to perfect the work of others were Peter and John, an excellent combination for what was needed at Samaria. When we think of what the woman said to the Lord, we can understand that what was current at Samaria was rivalry of Jerusalem. When there is anything like that you need some particular workmanship, because rivalry is always detrimental to the work of God, and God withheld the Spirit from them until Peter and John came down. When it was given, you can understand what exercises there would be. Why did we not get the Spirit at once? The Samaritans had to learn something from that. They did not get the Spirit at once; they did not get it until Peter and John came down and prayed that they might get Him. It is as if heaven was considering all this, that Samaria will have to be brought down. The Lord said to the woman, "Ye worship ye know not what" -- they were full of rivalry -- "we worship what we know". That is, He would assert the positive thing, that there is something that God can point to: "we worship what we know". There is that today; there are those who know, and those who do not know may as well learn that they do not know -- it is to their good.
Eu.R. This would involve not only concern that there might be right conditions in the local gathering where we may be set, but the recognition that the Lord is well able to maintain similar conditions among
{363}
His people in every locality. You would regard the saints in each locality on earth where gathered from this standpoint and unify them in that way.
J.T. That is right. Heaven is in control and operating from its own point of view, not building up any particular gathering for its own sake.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the distinction between Ephesians and Corinthians? In Ephesians Christ as the ascended Man gives the gifts for the assembly, but in Corinthians God gives them in regard to the local assembly.
J.T. You can understand heaven is operating universally. Christ is ascended in Ephesians where the instruction is universal; it is the church as a whole, Jew and gentile brought together and builded "for a habitation of God in the Spirit". It is the great thought of God as to the assembly as a whole, looking on to the future too. But Corinthians is in the main occupied with local conditions; we do not get evangelists in the gifts in Corinthians. It is humbling that the evangelist is not mentioned, meaning that there were not the conditions there to be added to. Would you say that?
Rem. Yes, and I thought there was something special in the fact that they had all the gifts at Corinth, but had to be reminded that they were the sovereign gift of God.
J.T. What is stressed in Corinthians is the activity of the Spirit, because what was in mind was to bring out the importance of the anointing. So that, while chapter 12 begins with the Spirit, it fully recognises the three divine Persons: "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all". The three Persons are brought in, but having said that, the apostle resumes the question of the Spirit, that the Spirit gives some
{364}
nine different gifts, leading up to the idea of the anointing: "so also is the Christ", that in the local company at Corinth -- the Greeks known for their wisdom -- there should be in the assembly of God that which was infinitely superior to anything seen or known in Greece. All that would allow for the anointing. At the end of the chapter, he refers to the general gifts, and brings in apostles, that is, he widens out, but his concern in the main is as to the anointing and how it works out in the local company organically. So that the Greeks had never seen such a thing as this -- the local assembly, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".
S.J.B.C. Can the spiritual features seen in Philadelphia be expressed in a local company now? Philadelphia does not present an impossibility to us, does it? It actually existed.
J.T. Quite so: "Thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word", "Thou hast kept the word of my patience" (@Revelation 3:3,10), and so forth. We should certainly have that before us.
Rem. One was impressed by the fact that where they were boasting in all these gifts you have brought before us, they were failing to recognise that they were sovereign from God. They were connected with the exalted Man, and the Corinthians should have been rejoicing in all His operations from heaven.
J.T. It is said of the Spirit, "as he pleases" (verse 11), and similarly of God (verse 18), in @1 Corinthians 12, and then it ends up with "God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers ..." (verse 28). They are in perfect order, firstly, secondly, thirdly, and so on. God calculates in that way, showing how He thinks of what is needed, and how there is the order of one, two, three, in all His calculations to bring us into His mind and into the ordered mind of heaven. So that the instruction
{365}
ends in chapter 14: "But let all things be done comelily and with order". We are so extremely loose-ended, whereas God is perfectly in order in everything He does. In His provision for His people He has got order, and we have got to abide by it.
Eu.R. What do you mean when you say we have a tendency to loose-endedness?
J.T. Because we are not with God. "For God is not a God of disorder", we are told (@1 Corinthians 14:33).
Eu.R. You mean that "thus I ordain in all the assemblies" (@1 Corinthians 7:17), would involve the assemblies all rightly ordered of God?
J.T. Yes, and God is seen in that way. What is in one assembly is in all the assemblies.
Eu.R. Is that the idea in the anointing, that what was set forth in the Lord Jesus at Nazareth, as anointed of Jehovah, is to be seen now in each local gathering?
J.T. He sets out the great thought. It says, "He has anointed me". That is what Luke presents, and all must conform to it. Hence the tabernacle was anointed, we are told, first in its parts -- the material -- that is, every saint is anointed viewed as part of the structure, and then the priestly family is anointed. That is, the same people, only looked at as serving God. So that every saint, old and young, viewed as of the tabernacle, is anointed, for the anointing signifies that God is committed to something, committed to us as in the assembly, that is material, and He is also committed to us as priests to serve Him. The idea is that there is something here in this world in the way of testimony that is of God, and hence infinitely superior to anything religious in this world.
O.W. Did the perfecting take place in the days of Paul, or is it still to take place?
J.T. It is going on now. It is the point in this meeting that we should have perfecting in our minds,
{366}
that God is finishing things. The assembly is about to be translated, and we should have in mind, even if there be no concrete results numerically, that there is something going on in the way of perfecting. That is the point, I think, whilst not to leave the other undone surely, for the dispensation still stands. God is not willing that any should perish -- we must never forget that -- but that all should be converted. At the same time, Paul's calling out in the early part of his ministry points to what God had in mind -- quality and the perfecting of what was already there.
S.J.B.C. Would the perfecting of the saints be individual? We have to start with the individual.
J.T. That was said at the beginning, to "present every man perfect in Christ", but Ephesians is the whole thought. If you are ministering to a number of christians, as the minister has to, you cannot attend to every person -- even Paul could not. They taught a crowd for a whole year in the assembly -- it was a collective matter, and I believe school is the best place to learn it, to learn with others, not that each is not attended to -- each is to be attended to -- but it is "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ; in order that we may be no longer babes", but full grown, and able to grow together; even if gift or ministry be in a person in a special way, there is the growing together, and self-edifying in love.
E.S. The apostle speaks of preaching publicly and going from house to house in @Acts 20.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would what you say have in view the Lord's coming?
J.T. Manifestly so; to "present every man perfect" has that in mind.
{367}
Eu.R. "With a view to the edifying of the body of Christ"; would that give us at all times to recognise, whether individually or locally, that we are part of one spiritual whole on earth?
J.T. Quite so, and this self-edifying in love is a quality which is not contingent upon gift. Gift may not be always present. We are told that Paul laboured a whole year at Antioch, and came back there with Barnabas, and at Corinth we are told the time expressly, but when it expired, he left. What happened after that is another matter. We cannot count on the special gifts being present all the time, but love must be present all the time, and it is in love we grow. Perfecting is one thing, that is what the minister has in mind, but growing is another thing. The thing is to get all the saints uniform, to get them perfect. That is to say, a child at any given age is perfect, there is no malformation, but the growth is the next thing, and that is by love.
Eu.R. So if love is in activity in any local company, however small, the saints in that locality can function in the way you speak of as organically.
J.T. That is the idea that Paul had in choosing elders in every assembly, that there should be the continuance of growth. I do not suppose he would have left without being sure that things were normal so far.
Eu.R. So, in this thought of perfecting, have you in mind that every brother and sister should be concerned to be a spiritually healthy member in the body?
J.T. That is right. I think the apostle had in mind before leaving that normal conditions existed, and perfecting implies that a normal state exists, whatever the growth may be, and the elders are chosen for each assembly that there should be that self-containedness locally and growth in love, for an elder should be just a joint of love.
{368}
C.O.B. What is implied in the "knowledge of the Son of God"?
J.T. It is the full idea that God has in mind, it is the Son of God as a pattern for us. It is not a question of His deity there, but what He is as Man, the divine thought for men.
Eu.R. As we have in Hebrews, the pattern of things in the heavens?
J.T. That is right, the heavenly things themselves we have. The Son of God and all that attaches to Him are the heavenly things themselves; in fact, we belong to that.
H.E.S. I suppose the Lord has this perfecting in view. Is His thought expressed in the book of Ruth, where Naomi says, "The man will not rest until he have completed the matter this day" (chapter 3:18)?
J.T. Yes, and he goes into the city to do it.
Ques. Do you think the idea of perfecting is connected with the giving of assembly ideas to the saints in contrast to the individual, the individual being more elementary? As the saints are built together they get assembly ideas.
J.T. That is right. Ephesians contemplates the great general thought of God, what He has in mind. As has been remarked, the gifts are given by the ascended Christ. Think of how heaven looks at things, at things up there! What a great outlook, and what a great end in view, so in truth, it is "the heavenly things themselves". We are not dealing with patterns, but the "heavenly things themselves" and we are essential to them.
O.W. Would you say a word as to the distinction between the "Son of God" and the "fulness of the Christ"?
J.T. A clear knowledge of the Son of God is one thing, and then there is the "measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". I think the anointing is in mind in the Christ, that is, what God has in the
{369}
Man of His right hand. The Son of God is a great inward thought. "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?", the Lord said to one (@John 9:35). It is a great inward thought leading us out of the world into another world. Still, it is the idea of One who does things for God, the One who carries out His will.
Eu.R. And do we need to recognise all gift as the present activity of the love and service of the ascended Man towards the assembly?
J.T. Yes. The ascended Christ is a great thought to have before us. "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things; and *he* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". What a great thought that is, and especially if we link it in our minds with Him who gives the gifts up there.
Eu.R. So things are going forward, you might almost say, triumphantly, and accomplishing the divine end on these lines.
J.T. And we want to get into line with all that. The thing exists. In any local gathering there is self-edifying in love. Love is the great thing; it never fails us.
Ques. Do you connect the apostle's ministry with an ascended Christ?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Is the ministry of Peter and the eleven more connected with the Spirit, in that way?
J.T. That is what has been remarked, but heaven began to move in a light from heaven, and then a sheet from heaven, and all that underlies the apostle's
{370}
ministry. So it is a question of what is in heaven, and what is stated in heaven, and hence the need for perfecting.
Eu.R. If there is self edifying in the local gathering, gift will function freely when it comes in.
J.T. Quite so.
W.R.P. You have said nothing about the first clause of verse 13: "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith".
J.T. "The faith" is the system of truth involved, not exactly what is in the Bible, but what was held in the power of the Spirit at the beginning. It is the system of truth. There is "the unity of the Spirit" and "the unity of the faith".
{371}
HEAVENLY INTERVENTIONS
@Acts 2:1 - 4; @Acts 4:31 - 33; @Acts 16:25 - 31
J.T. The book of Acts affords instances of heavenly interventions. In some instances the idea of heaven is stressed, as in the first verses read, where we have a sound from heaven, and in chapter 9, a light from heaven, and in chapter 10, a sheet from heaven, all evidently to maintain the heavenly thought amongst the saints -- the mind and influence of heaven. But we have also, as in these scriptures, the thought of *power* stressed, which one is free to bring forward now, so that we may have opportunity to consider the thought of power as in our favour, as occupying the divinely-ordered position, and also in testimony. The first suggestion is power as it affects the saints house-wise; the sound filled the house where they were sitting. The second relates to the saints viewed assembly-wise, that is, it is where they were assembled, the thought of the house being dropped, and it is just a place. The third relates to the power of the world as it would interfere with the testimony and service. The Philippian jailor may be taken as a symbol of the power of this world and how it may be used to interfere with the Lord's service. We may reckon on a corresponding intervention in whatever way it may be needed in our day of small things, so that the power of the world may be prevented from interfering with the position into which God has called us and the service that He has opened up to us. He intimates early in the Old Testament that He would shake heaven, that is, God's power to shake what might be in any way opposed, but for the moment, it is just to set aside any effort of the enemy to interfere directly or indirectly with the position into which God has called us and the service He has opened up to us. That is an outline of what I have in mind.
{372}
C.A.C. Would you suggest to us the difference between house-wise and assembly-wise?
J.T. We have only the suggestion of the house in chapter 2, but it is very significant that we have the word "house" there, and that the saints are viewed as sitting. The thought of the house involves dignity and a sitting attitude would suggest the same thing. There is that side to our position. It is an upper room in the gospels, as indeed in @Acts 1, but we have significantly the word "house", and the fact that they were not simply abiding there, as in chapter 1, but sitting.
C.A.C. Is it the setting of them in relation to heaven prior to any public service?
J.T. I think so. There must have been a link at the moment with the great movement from heaven. There must have been great complacency on the part of heaven in what was happening. Earlier the Lord had gone to Bethany, and we have the thought of sitting and the persons who sat with Him -- Lazarus was one of them (@John 12:2) -- and it seems as if, having the facts as stated in chapter 1, the position in chapter 2 is one for heaven's complacency, the restfulness and dignity that marked these people, fresh from the hand of the Lord, He having gone up from them.
C.A.C. Does that sitting attitude and what came upon them from heaven necessarily precede the standing up as in the latter part of the chapter?
J.T. I suppose so. It is the thought of dignity which becomes us, so that in entering on public service we are sobered and self-controlled. The suggestion was that, as the Holy Spirit had come, they were filled with new wine, that is, abnormal excitement, whereas in truth there was the greatest sobriety and a dignified attitude in the house. The Lord had said, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you" (@John 20:21), and He having breathed
{373}
into them, they would go forth in that setting. The Spirit has come in this way in power, power through breathing -- plenty of power, but in the possession of the power we are to learn to be dignified and under control.
P.L. Is that thought reflected in the person who is sitting and who has a revelation from the Lord in @1 Corinthians 14?
J.T. I think that helps. The idea is restfulness of spirit, developed doubtless out of the idea of sabbath keeping, learning to be restful in holy contemplation.
N.K.M. Would Abraham in @Genesis 18 correspond in any way with the spirit of restfulness -- sitting at his tent door in the heat of the day?
J.T. That is a good illustration, working out from the previous chapter where he had such remarkable communications from Jehovah in a personal way. The word is that Jehovah "left off talking with him; and God went up from Abraham" (@Genesis 17:22), and a great sense of dignity would rest upon the patriarch's mind in such a scene. What an experience, that Jehovah should come down and say to him, "It is I", speaking to him as a friend to a friend, as you might say, and finishing what He had to say then. "God went up", we are told, "from Abraham". Abraham immediately carries out the commandment as to circumcision, and then he is seen sitting at his tent door, not in his house indeed, but still there is remarkable correspondence, because Jehovah had gone up. Here in the Acts the Lord had gone up. It was Jehovah indeed, and attention is called to the movement by the angels: "they beholding him". All that would enter into the position in the house and a sitting posture; there would be great restfulness, and a great sense of dignity in what had transpired. More was to follow as the Lord had told them, and now it is about to happen, and they are there. "They were all together", it says; there is no disinterested person
{374}
in the company; they are all there in the place of sitting.
F.S.M. Is it significant that in both passages you have the words, "They were all filled with the Holy Spirit" -- in the first instance in regard to sitting, and in the second in regard to praying?
J.T. We may see that. It was a remarkable prayer in chapter 4.
F.S.M. Pursuing the line of thought in @Genesis 18, Abraham goes on to intercession. As having proved the Lord's presence in sitting he is able to go on and intercede in prayer.
H.E.S. Is it necessary to have this sense of dignity within before there can be any of the activities that follow in the book?
J.T. I think so; it is a question of the person sent out; it is heaven's representation. Think of what Jesus was! "Whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world" (@John 10:36). What dignity there was in that! the Son set apart and sent into the world. Heaven announced its pleasure in Him: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (@Matthew 3:17), and then again, "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight" (@Matthew 12:18). Well, the scene here corresponds in the sense of the persons sitting who are about to be sent out, at least the apostles. So that the help to be derived from it now is that we should learn what belongs to the house, the dignity of the house, that we belong to that, and that we are thus qualified in some way to be representative of heaven. In the case of the prodigal the best robe was brought out by the servants and put upon him; he was in liberty in the house, and we have immediately the music and dancing in the house. Dignity is attached to it. The instruction is important for those who are in service, and especially for those who would wish to be in service, that
{375}
in serving in any way it is necessary to understand our place in the house, a sitting attitude and the knowledge of our holy relations.
G.E.G. What have you to say as to the cloven tongues as of fire sitting upon each of them?
J.T. There is complacency in the persons, nothing to disturb so far. The fire would be to preserve from any disturbance from henceforth. God has that in which He can rest in view of testimony here. There is no fire found in the anointing of Jesus, but there is here; it is a merciful provision that there should be no disturbance. If the fire has its place there will be no disturbance. The thought of sitting is continued in that "it sat upon each one of them", each one singled out in his distinction. It is profitable to call attention to it in this way, to learn to be spiritually restful in the sense of the relation in which we are set, that in truth a son is greater than a servant. Some make their service more than their house relations, but the house relation is greater than the service.
C.A.C. Would that be involved in the Lord's saying, "Peace be to you" in connection with the mission in @John 20?
J.T. Yes. That would follow on the message through Mary Magdalene which implied their dignity and where they were. They are now viewed in their greatness, "where the disciples were", and in coming in, the Lord would recognise them in their greatness, as I suppose in the House of Lords the King recognises the dignity of the peers before the actual work is taken on. So that the Lord coming in, would come in in all His own greatness, the One who had said, "I ascend", and recognise theirs in saying, "Peace be to you". That would enable them to sit.
Rem. If we have a deep sense that it is God's
{376}
house, we would, like David, go in and sit before the Lord (@2 Samuel 7:18).
J.T. That comes in before the great thought of sonship is introduced. David had thought that he should build the house, and Nathan thought so too, but they were both mistaken and God corrects them, and David accepts the correction. He is in the light of sonship, in fact he has that place himself, the firstborn, as it says in @Psalm 89:27. "I will make him firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth". It is in that sense he goes in and sits before Jehovah. I believe the word might be translated 'tarry', but in any case it would be restful. But how can one be restful inside save in the sense of the relationship and of what God is to him? All this is most important to those who serve, and to all of us, to learn to be restful in dignity in the sense of the relation in which we are set according to the divine counsels.
C.A.C. Would you say that the servant in that way is greater than his service?
J.T. Just so. It would help us to see the place, the relation in which we are set in the house, that is, sons of God and brethren of Christ and of one another, above the thought of service.
Eu.R. Has @Ephesians 2 any bearing on it -- seated in the heavenlies in the early part of the chapter, and then the habitation of God in the end?
J.T. Yes; it is to bring out our qualification to be the habitation down here, that is, persons who belong to heaven. There can be no accommodation for God save as afforded by heavenly people, people who as up there know the conditions that are there. Hence, before the requirements of the tabernacle are given in Exodus, seventy of the elders of Israel go up, and as up there they are called nobles, and see the God of Israel. That really is the background for the house.
{377}
H.E.S. Is the principle seen in the apostle, "I do not seek yours, but you" (@2 Corinthians 12:14)? He had the persons more before him.
J.T. Exactly. The idea of persons has a great place in Scripture, and I have no doubt John takes it up finally for these last days to bring out what the saints are. You have the idea of counting and numbering and weighing, with John, so as to bring out the greatness of the persons. In Ezra we have the thought of numbering at the outset of the recovery, but when Ezra himself comes into the service he stresses the thought of weighing to bring out the quality of the persons.
S.J.B.C. Do you mean that if we are to serve rightly according to God we must serve in the dignity of sonship?
J.T. That is the thought: "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4:23).
S.J.B.C. I thought we might connect that with @Mark 1: "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God". He is represented in that gospel as Jehovah's Servant, yet He did everything in the dignity of sonship.
J.T. Quite so. It helps greatly, for young brothers especially, to see that the relation with them is necessarily greater than the service, great indeed as the service is. One serves in love as in the realm of love -- the house is the realm of love.
Ques. Do you get a suggestion of that in @Mark 3 in those sitting around the Lord?
J.T. It is significant that it comes in there. I do not know of anything to be coveted more than that spirit of restfulness spiritually, not to be lethargic -- we may be lazy -- but to be spiritually restful yet alert, and when the time comes for service, we go forth in the sense of being persons who are liked in heaven: "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight" (@Matthew 12:18).
{378}
One would not like to be in service save as personally pleasing to God. That really is where the rest lies, in the sense of what God thinks of you in the service. You snatch an opportunity for physical rest as it comes, as the Lord did. He said, "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little" (@Mark 6:31), but when they got to their destination there were five thousand persons waiting to be served. The rest is in a spiritual sense. God would give occasions to rest physically, but the thing is to learn to be restful spiritually.
P.L. We have the great Servant in Mark, the Lord Jesus, as our Model, and at the end of the gospel it is said first that He "sat at the right hand of God", and then it says, "The Lord working with them" (chapter 16:19,20).
J.T. That is right; there is no cessation of that. The sitting is to bring out one thing, but the work goes on: "the Lord working with them", that is, persons who had learnt this great thought, for there must be correspondence with Christ even as to this restfulness.
C.O.B. Mary sat in the house in @John 11 which came before her service in chapter 12.
J.T. Just so. She had learnt how to be restful spiritually, and that all comes out at Bethany where "they made him a supper ... but Lazarus was one of those at table with him".
Eu.R. Would the Lord's supper greatly induce that restfulness with us, the sabbath-keeping conditions leading to the enjoyment of sitting in privilege in the enjoyment of sonship?
J.T. Quite so. Sitting as we have to while the emblems, the bread and the cup, are being passed round, denotes what we are to one another, what company we are sitting in. That is, the Spirit is there. It should always be borne in mind that the Spirit is there from the outset of our assembling and
{379}
He pervades in His own way and looks after everything, so that all is in the power of the anointing. We are not sitting wasting time, but in holy company and in holy relations. That marks every assembly movement, and we come under the Lord's hand. When the time comes for Him to use us we are available, not restless, having a hymn on our minds to give out, or having in our minds before we came to the meeting to take part at some particular time. Restfulness of spirit precludes all that; we are just there "to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead". Well, what will He do? The movement to the mount of Olives later -- as we have often had it -- is spiritual, so that we arrive at His place, which is a great thing. The idea of the sabbath was prominent in Exodus and is brought in first by name in that book. @Exodus 31:17 tells us of Jehovah that "on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed". That is a very beautiful word and we only get it there. The fact existed for hundreds of years, but now it is mentioned that God Himself was refreshed on the sabbath. With others I have been looking into the matter and I think about twenty-eight per cent of Israel's time was occupied in sabbath-keeping. It is certainly interesting as applied to what we are speaking of, being restful spiritually and sitting in assembly in a spiritual way so as to be available to the Lord.
Rem. In the house God has found His rest and we should be restful if we realised that all blessing has come from Him. It says in @Psalm 132:14: "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it", and it goes on, "I will abundantly bless her provision".
J.T. Quite so. It is significant that the name of the man who built the house means "peace". Jehovah loved him and he was a man of peace, and we want to get into the realm of love.
{380}
Rem. You said just now that we have the interventions of heaven right through.
J.T. I was calling attention to the way heaven is specially mentioned, but the point now is more power in relation to certain things, and this is one that we are speaking of, sitting in the house. God honours that and will preserve it.
N.K.M. Would what you are saying enter into what the Lord said in @Luke 22: "For which is greater, he that is at table or he that serves? Is not he that is at table?".
J.T. That is good. That shows how you regard the saints when you are serving them; you are not lording it over them, but sitting at their feet serving them, and surely they should be more restful. If a little ministry is given in the assembly, it ought to make the saints even more restful. The intent is that it is a holy restful scene where God is at rest; He rests in His love in His people, and we share that love.
H.E.S. Then is the first operation of this power to preserve those right conditions within?
J.T. The power has come in in that relation, and would preserve those initial conditions; they are to run through. I believe the power is for that, it is not only that it filled all the house where they were sitting. What a sense you have of being there, the sound filling all the house!
C.A.C. It was there for God before it yielded anything for men.
J.T. What God had in that scene! The Spirit sitting upon each would denote the restfulness of heaven in them. I suppose David was never more pleasing to God than when he entered into the house on that occasion and sat there just to enjoy the light and liberty he had, the joy of Jehovah and what he was to Him.
{381}
C.S.S. Is the thought that power and rest go together? The mighty God is seen in His power and then His rest comes in, and in Zephaniah He is called the "mighty one" and then He rests in His love.
J.T. That is very good. The thought is to preserve those conditions. Peter's service following is very beautiful; it is so composed and orderly, and so free too from mere philosophy; he just seizes simply the occasion. They were saying, "They are full of new wine" and mocking, but Peter said, No, and he took that up and began his address from that, but how dignified it was and with what authority.
C.A.C. He is not overwhelmed by the greatness of the things, for they were "the great things of God". He is spiritually capable of handling them in the greatest sobriety -- very lovely!
J.T. I believe this chapter 2 stands out in the way of a model. He stood up with the eleven, showing how intelligent and deliberate he was in his service.
C.A.C. What have you in mind in linking chapter 4 with this? Had you a further thought?
J.T. I thought we might see the importance of prayer. It is said, "And having been let go, they came to their own company"or 'their own' possibly, "and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. And they, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them; who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have the nations raged haughtily and the peoples meditated vain things? The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had
{382}
determined before should come to pass. And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word, in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus". This, I suppose, was the prayer that was made at the time. It was the priestly side, and then it goes on, "And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness". The position now is the assembly in principle. "Hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it", it says, and I think this shaking is to remind them of the power that was for them. It is not now the house, but just a place, but the word 'assembled' is to be noted. As the apostle says to Timothy, "That thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth" (@1 Timothy 3:15). I think support is in the word 'assembly', and the power is here: "the place in which they were assembled shook", not now where they were sitting, but where they were assembled.
C.A.C. Is this the thought of an impregnable fortress, able to stand in the face of all that is hostile?
J.T. That is what I think we may see in the word 'assembled', linking on with the Lord's remarks as to the assembly that "hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16:18). Hades¬ gates were active here. What the apostles Peter and John reported would be that, but God is saying, You are to be protected, this order of things is to stand -- where they were assembled, the prayer being uttered there.
C.A.C. Then the assembly in @Matthew 16 is rather to be in a militant position, a fortress. Is that side important?
J.T. I think we may link it on here. We have the house conditions to continue, and the service flowing
{383}
out of it, and now we have the assembly continuing when the position is militant.
H.E.S. Is that the line of the Scripture that says, "The name of Jehovah is a strong tower" (@Proverbs 18:10)?
J.T. Quite so. The assembly militant is a very good word here in chapter 4.
Ques. Is this an additional filling here? It says, "They were all filled with the Holy Spirit", in chapter 2, and it is the same here.
J.T. It does not say refilled; it is just the thing maintained. Of course, many had come in, and it was the maintenance of what was, that there is no weakening. The assembly now is in a militant position marked by prayer and God answering it, showing how we can go on. God comes in for us in answer to the prayer of the assembly.
F.S.M. The enemy was endeavouring to stop the testimony going forth, and the word being sent forth in power, but this prayer would be that it should continue in power.
J.T. So what is said is, "And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one, and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them; and with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus". The position in chapter 2 is continued and augmented: "with great power did the apostles give witness". There is a reassertion of the apostolic position. Peter and John had been prominent, but in returning to their own the apostles all come into view again; they came to 'their own' or "their own company", as it says. As we seek each other in this affectionate way and have recourse to prayer that God will come in and there be adjustment, whatever power there is amongst us will come into action. There will be no overshadowing; there will be room for all that there
{384}
is, and more. It is a question now, not of Peter and John, two of the apostles, but all the apostles; they get their place. There would be a tendency for Peter and John to be the leaders in the service, but there is a resetting of things, and how important that is, for as militant we need every brother and sister with ability -- there must be room for all.
P.L. "Twenty years old and upward".
J.T. Just so. When the Levites come to be before God according to @Numbers 8, they are presented as a wave-offering, and God reduces the age and increases the number. The number is needed; every bit of ability is required, and the more as we are together in this mutual way. "They came to their own company", it says; not simply back to the ten others, but "their own company". Then there is the prayer and the shaking which was, of course, reassuring, and then the mutual oneness and care for one another: "not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them; and with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all".
G.E.G. Would you in any way connect the thought of the Lord standing at the right hand of God, as seen by Stephen, with this militant position of the assembly here?
J.T. I think the allusion is to His patience. Israel was rejecting Him, but He was still there, and the allusion is to the patience of God with Israel, that He would still serve in spite of their attitude. It corresponds with the position in the end of the gospels where He is seen standing, meaning that He was going further, there was more beyond. In @Luke 24:50 He "led them out as far as Bethany", that is, a sort of lodging-place which we would accept; it is not final, but it is necessary for a purpose. God is patient, and, as it were, He is content to lead them just as far as
{385}
that, not that it was final. I think all these standing attitudes in the ends of the gospels and the Acts bear on the patience of God, another great fact for us to remember, that it is the period of the patience of God. He is still waiting on men, and we are not sitting in that relation, but active and ready to serve. The sitting position is really an inside thought.
Eu.R. In the beginning of the prayer they refer to the power of God in creation, and then they bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and then they are filled with power and the Holy Spirit, so that we have each divine Person bearing on this question of power here.
J.T. Quite so. It is very remarkable they should bring in the power of God in creation here. The prayer ought to be examined from the standpoint of the circumstances. How priestly it is, and how intelligent they are in what they say!
Ques. And is it important to notice that they speak of the Lord Jesus as "thy holy servant", and then they go on to pray for "thy bondmen", and speak of the power of God that moved even Pontius Pilate to do what He had ordained to come to pass? Do you think this prayer was that He should use the bondmen to bring His thoughts to pass in blessing?
J.T. You have in mind that the sitting attitude is not here now? It is the service and the bondmen -- that is the attitude. It is a militant position, but militant to carry on the service, not that we want to fight with anybody, but stand for these things and carry on our service at the same time. And the answer is, "With great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus". That was the great power.
H.E.S. Is your thought that first this power would mark all and dignify what was of God, and then this part of the Scripture would maintain it?
{386}
J.T. Exactly, and the service must go on. The enemy was endeavouring to hinder it: "They charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus". Think of that! What defiance that was to heaven, and the apostles felt it and laid the matter before God with this result, that the service is to go on. Let us ever bear in mind that the service is to go on; conflict will attend it, but conflict is only that it should go on.
S.J.B.C. The apostles had great power, but they were morally supported by the multitude; there were right conditions in the assembly.
J.T. Quite so. Then the incoming of others is another thing to notice here -- men with means. "For as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to each according as any one might have need. And Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles ..." That is the consolation that accompanies such support from God. The word 'consolation' is very beautiful in service. There is very little for those who serve really; it is constant conflict and constant activity and anxiety, but the word 'consolation' is very touching.
H.M.S. In this first prayer of the church we have a very remarkable sense of calmness and confidence in God. They do not ask for protection or vengeance upon their enemies, but only that the word of God might be spoken with boldness. Are they not restful in spirit in what they say here: "Whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass"? There is a spirit of restfulness in the sense that it will be so.
J.T. The knowledge of God and His counsels, and not only His counsels in a positive way but what He allows to happen. We may profitably compare the first prayer recorded after the Spirit came with
{387}
Solomon's prayer. God says, as it were, 'I have heard it' -- very comforting. He showed, too, in Solomon's case that He had heard it, and here the shaking is very significant of divine power for His own. It is for those who know and love God; it is understood to be in our favour. Then the fire in chapter 2 causes no fear, but it is welcomed; it is a great provision and love values it; it is to preserve from corruption.
Ques. Is the speaking in verse 31 more general, or is it limited to the apostles? "They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness".
J.T. It is more general, I should think, but the apostles are mentioned later: "With great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all". It was a hallowed scene marked by the anointing.
C.S.S. Have you anything to say about the place where they were assembled being shaken?
J.T. I do not think the place is of much account now. The upper room had a certain significance as elevated morally above current religion, and the house had a significance as we have been seeing, suggestive of the place of relationship and love, but the word 'place' has little or no consequence, save that they were there: "the place in which they were assembled". So that we have to link it on with our meeting rooms. A good deal of exercise is current about meeting rooms, and God's eye is upon them. I am sure the places where the saints meet are of interest to heaven. It speaks in @Acts 16:13 of a place "where prayer was wont to be made", which is not without importance.
C.S.S. Do you think it is in line with the militant action of their movements after their sitting and restfulness?
{388}
J.T. Yes, the place is shaken. God is taking account of it; it is God's, and they are of value in that sense. "The place in which they were assembled"; it is not simply that they are there, but they are assembled.
Eu.R. Do you mean the important thing is the assembly in function, as in @1 Corinthians 14, the whole assembly in one place?
J.T. I think honour is paid to the word 'assembly'. @Matthew 16 contemplates the militant phase of the assembly, and I think we get it here, prayer accompanying it.
Ques. Should we expect this power to act now in the stretching forth of the Lord's hand to heal, and then in connection with the name?
J.T. Of course, the healing was a sign gift; it was a gift to call attention to the greater thing, that is the gospel. We do not need the gift of healing today, but we do need the power, as was alluded to by the apostle when he said, "That the excellency of the power may be of God" (@2 Corinthians 4:7). The power of God in the preaching is what we need.
H.M.S. What had you to say as to chapter 16?
J.T. It was only to say a word about what the powers of evil might do, what they are doing, alas! in some parts of the world today. It is stated here that "at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison shook, and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of all loosed. And the jailor being awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword was going to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had fled. But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here. And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and, trembling, fell down before Paul and
{389}
Silas. And leading them out said, Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house. And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, with all that were in his house". I thought a word on this would help us as to what the powers that be might do. We may expect them to be adverse, taking everything into account. We are drawing near to the end and the antichristian spirit is prevalent, and we ought to be on the alert as to these matters. In this country, of course, we are greatly favoured, but a change might come about, so that God would call upon us to take notice of these things and pray. It says, "at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing". That is the thing to keep in mind. God will protect them and will release those who are thus engaged. But it is important to take account of the actual situation as it is, and speak to God accordingly.
C.A.C. You would rather look that things might become more straitened publicly?
J.T. I rather do. There are such conditions on the Continent -- not certainly in the English-speaking world yet -- but we know from history that changes may happen. God permits things: "Whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass", as said in chapter 4:28, and I believe God would expect us to pray intelligently about these matters.
S.J.B.C. I think that is a very needed word.
J.T. We were speaking recently about Abraham in Genesis. God said to the king, that is, the power that then was, that "he is a prophet, and will pray for thee", and Abraham did pray for him, and God answered his prayer. Abraham was held in the position of testimony in that connection, and he was preserved. "Do my prophets no harm", God said (@Psalm 105:15).
{390}
J.H.B. Does the shaking have a different purpose in chapter 16 from that in chapter 4?
J.T. It is a notification to the world. It is not the place where they were assembled, or even the place where they were incarcerated; it is the prison and the jailor that are in mind. It is the world that is in mind, that God can shake it, that God can act to prevent it interfering with the testimony. I was going to say that Genesis, from the time of Abraham s call, is typical of the world as in reconciliation -- as it is today. God's attitude towards it is favourable. Abraham would understand that all the nations were to be blessed through him, and would consequently speak to Abimelech, or any other person, in that light, and therefore, he would think, not adversely, but favourably; he would think in grace in regard of them, and that is our attitude. The gospel period is going on, and it is our business to be with God about it and pray for these according to @1 Timothy 2.
S.J.B.C. Would you say a word on singing praises? Is there the perpetuation of the ministry of song in the gospel? It says that "the prisoners listened" not only heard but listened. They seem to have understood the words as well as hearing the sound. Is there that ministry of song still in the gospel?
J.T. Quite so. What God gets in the service, even in the militant attitude. God has always got His portion. What a scene it was! The prison was really turned into a temple of praise, but still it is spoken of as the jail -- the jailor and the prisoners. And so they are released and the service goes on. It is a very remarkable scene.
Ques. Would you say that where there is faithfulness the Lord is bound to respond and act? I was thinking of Philadelphia, "I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut" (@Revelation 3:8). While it has not got perhaps a specific reference to the gospel it would include it.
{391}
J.T. I think it does; it had been closed, but He will keep it open, and on these lines. There is something to open it for: "Because thou hast a little power".
Rem. I was thinking of the answer to the prayers of Paul and Silas, and how it would encourage us to be faithful in view of others.
J.T. Quite.
H.M.S. In this chapter the power of the Spirit is not mentioned as it is in the others we have read.
J.T. It brings out the quality of the servants. They were such servants that in these circumstances they could turn to prayer and praise. The whole scene is to bring out the quality of these servants. What men they were! It is the background of Philippians, of course; the result is in keeping with all this.
F.S.M. Could the three thoughts be put in this way? In chapter 2 the Spirit gives them power to speak, "as the Spirit gave them utterance"; then in chapter 4, it seems to be power to witness, and in chapter 16 it is power over the enemy and the activities of the enemy so that the gospel should continue and the testimony be preserved.
J.T. I think that is right.
{392}
DIVINE RESOURCES
@1 Corinthians 2:10; @John 21:5 - 13; @Matthew 17:27; @Luke 24:41 - 43
I wish to speak this evening, dear brethren, about divine resources, connecting my remarks with the Spirit through whom those resources are available to us. To suggest briefly how divine resources are mentioned in Scripture, I would allude to such a passage as that in @Romans 10:12, which says, "the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him" -- He is *rich*. "He was rich", we are told elsewhere, "yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich" (@2 Corinthians 8:9). That has come about, and now He is "rich unto all that call upon him". Then we read in the same epistle of "the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God" (@Romans 11:33) -- the *depth* of the riches. The apostle in writing breaks out into poetic form, God coming into his mind through His relations and dealings and counsels as regards His earthly people, His ways with them as with ourselves, showing us incidentally that God's ways on earth, inclusive of His earthly people, become the occasion of worship. "O the depth of the riches", he says. Then we have His riches in mercy, "God", as we are told, "who is rich in mercy" (@Ephesians 2:4), and again, "the unsearchable riches of Christ" (@Ephesians 3:8), these indeed being the theme of the glad tidings, showing that they are available in the fullest way, and are presented so that we should lack nothing. It is the Lord's intent that we should lack nothing: "perfect and complete, lacking in nothing" (@James 1:4). Indeed, so great are these riches that in Colossians we are told that all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily; God is there so as to be available, and that we might exclude from our minds all else.
{393}
For spiritual independency is what is in mind in that epistle, especially in regard to what appeals to a refined mind. Great appeal is made to the young at the present time in this respect, and there is considerable flattery in it; "philosophy and vain deceit" aims at flattery. Take away that side from the education of the world and it loses much that is attractive for the natural mind. God would impress us that we are independent as there is the depth of wisdom, as the apostle says, and then, that all the fulness of the Godhead dwells, as available to us, in Christ bodily.
Now I wish to take the liberty of using the product of the seas as illustrative of divine resources, and that is why I have read these scriptures in John and Matthew and Luke. I believe that these scriptures support the thought, for the seas are symbolic in their fulness -- for we have that word in regard of them -- of the resources of God. As over against the fulness of the earth, or the creatures upon it which are countable, as we may say, which are known, we have the great sea, as it says in a psalm which is full of creatorial glories, @Psalm 104. The great sea is said to have "moving things innumerable, living creatures small and great" (verse 25). No one can make a census of them; indeed the word 'innumerable' would preclude that, but aside from that, the very nature of ocean conditions forbids man determining what is there. God knows. But, while the living creatures in the sea are innumerable, they are put under man, as are the land creatures, with a view to the incarnation; nothing is withheld from man s dominion. Hence we find that in @Genesis 1, man is to have dominion over the fish of the sea. There was no provision made for them in the ark, and directly the flood passed, God blessed Noah and his sons, and directed that the fear and dread of them should be upon the fish of the sea (@Genesis 9:2). We can thus
{394}
see in these facts what a place they have in the divine mind, and as in the divine mind, what a place they are to have -- inasmuch as God has written for us about them -- in our minds, and how we are to understand that there are the "depths of God", and that those depths are searchable by the Spirit. "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God", and that same Spirit is given to us as the passage declares; indeed, it is brought in there as over against the wisdom of this world. The apostle labours in those early chapters to detach the minds of the saints at Corinth from the wisdom of this world, and he brings in the hidden wisdom. He had not spoken of it to them; they were incapable of receiving it, but it was there to be spoken about, and he did speak about it to those who could receive it: "the hidden wisdom", he says, "which God ordained before the world unto our glory" -- think of that, dear brethren! -- "which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him". The Spirit as in us searches these depths of wisdom. He is not here in any other way than in us. Think of the link there is in us, therefore, with those hidden depths of God, the Spirit available in us to search them for us and bring them into our hearts. "The Spirit searches all things", we are told, "even the depths of God" How this renders us independent of man's wisdom! It comes to nought, says the apostle, and the leaders of this world come to nought. How assuring that is, and how it should detach us, especially young people having to do with the educators of this world. Our minds are so susceptible of being drawn into the whirlwind of the speculation of man's mind, never wanting of flattery and pride. Whilst recognising
{395}
the need of ordinary education, God would detach us by presenting to us what is infinitely beyond it, the "hidden wisdom" which He prepared before the world, mark you, for our glory.
Well now, I want to show how these resources come to light in these last days, first in regard to the breakdown in the ministry. The most sorrowful part of church history is the breakdown in the ministry. The type of it is in Numbers where certain favoured ones of the tribes were linked on with certain Levites, that is, it was a party matter. The daughters of Zelophehad said, as regards their father, that he had nothing to do with that, and one is thankful to find saints who can say that they avoid party affiliations. "Our father", they said, "... died in his own sin" (@Numbers 27:3). That is, it was an individual matter. It was bad enough, for he died in it, but it was not as bad as that party matter; he did not die in that party matter extending to the whole camp of Israel, led by Korah, Dathan and Abiram, against Moses and Aaron. But what is so comforting is that the cloud covered the tent in the presence of all that; God looked after His own interests. The precious testimony is to be preserved at all costs, and it was. Whilst the sinners themselves were swallowed up, I only speak of that to show you the full extent of the breakdown of the ministry, and how important it is for those who are in the ministry to avoid party affiliations.
Now we have Peter and John and some five others of the ministers, and Peter said, "I go a fishing". That is to say, it is a movement among the ministers, and leading ones too, in independency and disregard of what was needed amongst the people of God. Whilst not dwelling unduly on these great men -- for they were such and blessed of God subsequently -- we have the thing here in principle so as to find a place in John's ministry -- I wish to show how the ministers are recovered through the introduction of
{396}
divine resources, for as sure as possible, if we turn aside in party affiliations, we shall have nothing. We may have words and subjects, but there will be no supply, no communications, no speaking in the power of the Holy Spirit, no making of "the excellency of the power" to be of God. So the Lord says, What have you here to eat? And they said, Nothing; they were truthful. Well, He says, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find"; and they did. That is to say, the passage calls attention to the resources of God under the Lord's hand, and they caught, as we are told, a great multitude of fishes, "a hundred and fifty-three" great ones. It is over against the turning aside; persons turning aside have nothing in a spiritual sense. See what there is, the Lord would say, from the standpoint of divine resources, you who have been working all night and have caught nothing! They had no means of tapping those great resources of God. How could they? Wanting of faith for the moment, and exercising their own wills, how could they draw upon the resources of God? To allow them to do so would be to set them up in their self-will and independency. And now one says, "It is the Lord". That is very beautiful. Who said that? John, the one who loved the Lord.
Then the Lord stood on the shore, and there was "a fire of coals there", we are told, "and fish laid thereon, and bread" -- not bread first, but fish. I say that, because bread generally is knowable; it comes under the number twelve, or the number five, or what not; it comes under the hands of the disciples elsewhere for distribution, but Mark, who treats of the Servant, reserves the fish, in the feeding of the five thousand, for the Lord Himself. The Lord blessed the loaves and the fishes, and He gave the loaves to the disciples, but He hands round the fishes Himself. That is a very interesting matter for those
{397}
who minister. One may have something; I come here tonight with something and I know what I have got, but I am not so sure of what the Lord may have. I count that He has got something, that is to say, He brings in things from the standpoint of divine resource that I have not thought of. What would our ministry be without this? So the Lord comes in, and Mark says that "the two fishes divided he among them all". I have not a doubt that those two fishes, small as they were, were sweeter than the loaves of bread. Coming from the direct hand of Christ, how sweet is something, however small, but enough to go round to all! One little word, it may be, or a sentence, or a suggestion directly from the Lord stimulates everybody. That is what one looks for in all these services. So John would present the thing in this way. He does not admit that the servants had anything in this passage. They had nothing, and they admit they had nothing. Were I to go to the leading denominational ministers and ask them what they have, were I to go to the Archbishop of Canterbury or York and ask them what they have -- I am not here to say anything about them -- What have you got to eat? Well, what have they got? They have got the Creed -- I admit that, and the Bible, thank God, is appointed to be read in churches. The Authorised Version is the Bible for public reading, and it is no small matter that it is appointed authoritatively to be read in churches. Nor would I say a word against the Creed, or the Catechism, but what is the present catch? What have you got now? Well, there is nothing in the way of freshness, and that is the test. Peter and these ministers here say, We have nothing; they had toiled all night and caught nothing. Well, the Lord says, there is plenty, you know, just "cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find". Would that those ministers I have alluded to would
{398}
do that. The Lord would help them to do it. But do they cast the net on the right side? I do not think so. I look in vain for anything today of that kind; it is "whosoever hath, to him shall be given" (@Matthew 13:12). The Lord is graciously helping those who have, but He is gradually but surely taking away from those who have not. That is a solemn matter. Well, the Lord says; there is plenty; there is no stint at all; there is not the least reduction in the resources at all; just cast the net on the right side and you will find. And they did. What did they find? Great fishes, that is to say, there are great persons to be had today. The Lord knows them, and I speak of them now as a matter of resource to carry on things here. Then, what is on the shore? The Lord has fish laid on the fire and bread, the fish presented first. It is a dainty, as it were. It is no ordinary matter; it is food of an excellent kind, and it is His own doing. It is no question of the minister's providing. He gives them opportunity later to bring in the fishes, but this is what He is doing. It is in keeping with John, and the Lord provides this dainty morsel from the standpoint of divine resources. There is the fish laid on the fire, and then there is the bread. But He brings the ministers back; He would bring them all into it. He would impress us with the extent of divine resources: "Bring of the fish which ye have now caught", but there was what He had provided. Then He says to them, "Come and dine". That is to say, John, at the close, anticipating ministerial defection, would bring in the best sort of things to effect recovery; the dignified word 'dine' is brought in, the Lord Jesus Himself inviting us to dine.
Now I want to show from Matthew how those same resources are available for us viewed as sons of God. The passage has in mind the kind of people that are to form the assembly. The Lord announced the building of the assembly in chapter 16, and then
{399}
we have the dignified people of chapter 17 that should form it, those seen on the mount and now here on earth regarded as sons. But we cannot sustain ourselves in this dignified way, we cannot sustain a spirit suitable to our dignity with bread alone, with what is known, with the Scriptures and all the writings we have, the creeds and all that can be availed of publicly. There are those, alas! who are relying on those things, but they do not maintain themselves in the spirit of sonship. It is a question of sonship here, and how it is to be sustained, so that we are right in spirit towards those who are without. It is the resources of God. It was a house matter, as you will remember. We were speaking of the house this afternoon, and this was a house matter. Peter came into the house. He had been answering a question outside, Does your Master pay the temple tax? He said, Certainly, but the Lord in the house said to Simon, "Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?", and Peter says, "Of strangers". Now it is well to note that Peter knew that. He was a fisherman, and you may say that he did not know very much, but he knew what was necessary. God sees to it that His servants are not wanting in these matters. He knew and he answered the Lord rightly; he says, "Of strangers". Well, the Lord says, "Then are the sons free". How beautiful that conversation was in the house! The Lord loves to carry on conversations like that, because we are so feeble as to sonship; He would bring it home to us; it is a house matter, a conversation that belongs to the house, and the Lord says, "Then are the sons free". How beautiful that was! Had Peter fully understood it, what a joy it would bring into his heart, that the Lord should say to him, "Then are the sons free". And He goes on to say, "But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and
{400}
take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee" -- you and I are the sons. How glorious that is! But, mark you, it is a question of maintaining ourselves outwardly. How is it to be done? By using the resources we have. The depths of God make us suitable to represent God in this world in the dignity of sons. This is a very important matter, and I do urge it on young people, to understand this house matter in Matthew. It is a great subject, and I do not know any incident in Matthew in the house so interesting as this, in which the Lord brought this matter up with Peter, and how He brought Peter on to His own ground as a son: "Give it to them", He says, "for me and thee". Peter would never forget that, I am sure. Indeed, I often picture in mind how these great servants in ministry to the saints in later years would bring forward these great things and mention them in the power of the Spirit to their hearers. The Holy Spirit is here today to bring to our remembrance, we are told, what Jesus said. It is one of the offices of the Spirit, to bring to our remembrance what the Lord said. It is a precious service He renders; He would bring to us these precious conversations, these precious remarks of Jesus during His ministry here.
Well now, the final thing is in Luke, and it brings me to the assembly -- I may say, to the local assembly, but to the assembly. The passage is well known to us. We often speak of these verses, and I speak of them now because they indicate that the saints at the beginning, as in assembly, had something in relation to the resources of God; they had already learnt to draw upon those resources. I wonder if we have learnt to do this, dear brethren, in our little gatherings. I love the thought, and often use it as expressed in @1 Corinthians 11: "When ye come together in assembly". I wonder whether that phrase
{401}
is understood and taken up in our minds and hearts as we draw together on the first day of the week, and whether too, as coming thus together there is the sense of being pleasing to the Lord in our footsteps and in the manner of the wending of our ways to the place of assembly. We believe but little in the delight with which heaven takes account of it, and all is in the power of the anointing. Think of those two, for instance, recorded in this chapter. They had gone to Emmaus. What their footsteps would be to the Lord and to heaven as they were going back! How different from what they were as they were going the other way! "What manner of communications", said the Lord, "are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?". The Lord does not look for doleful countenances and hesitating steps as we draw to the place of assembly. "I was glad", said one, "when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord" (@Psalm 122:1). The steps are to be in the power of the anointing, and in the power of the incentive of what is before us -- to be "in assembly", the most august expression you can get in the Scriptures. It is going through to heaven. Hence, those two, we are told, "returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them". Every movement would be delightful to heaven as they moved back that day.
Now, as in assembly, the Lord comes in. The doors are not shut to Him. It is His assembly, and He comes in, and He says, What have you got *here* to eat? It is not only, What have you got? but *here* -- in the assembly really. How He loves it! The Lord loves that thought of it. It is the joy of His heart to have part in it, and "they gave him", we are told, "a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb" -- the broiled fish first. Now, I think the Lord would say, as it were, They have got on to the thought. There are the resources of God available
{402}
for the assembly. Why should we be impoverished? Why should we be unfurnished? Why should we not have everything needed, not only for our own comfort simply, but for the Lord? For it is a question of a part of a fish. They did not give Him all, nor does He wish it. Nothing pleases Him better than to share what we have. And what does He share? The resources of God. They have come in through faith and in the power of the Spirit, and He loves to have part with us. I would that the brethren would keep that before them, that every assembly should have in mind that Christ is to have part in it, not simply to help us -- He does that -- but to have part in what we have. Is there anything He can have part in? Things were not quite right here, according to the record, but right to this extent, that they had this piece of a broiled fish, and they handed it to Jesus and He ate it before them. What a lesson book that is as indicative of how the assembly is to go on! We who walk in the light of it are to go on in freshness, in the power of these resources, in the power of the Spirit who searches the depths of God and brings them to us as we are together. So, as the Lord comes in and reminds us of what He would like, have we got it? They had "a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb", and they gave it to Him, and He ate before them.
I think you will see in what I have said, that the resources of God are available for us by the Spirit, the Spirit being here, not to leave us, but to stay with us under the title of Comforter or Paraclete, who takes care of us and reminds us of what should be, and helps us to provide what should be, and brings in from these infinite resources of God what is needed in its living freshness, so that the Lord can come and have His part with us. May He grant it!
