THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (1)
@Matthew 26:36 - 46; @Matthew 27:32 - 56; @Matthew 16:21; @Matthew 17:22,23
J.T. Feeling that the Lord would remind us that this subject is to be approached in an intelligent and sympathetic manner, I thought it would be helpful, by reading the verses in chapters 16 and 17, to call attention to the Lord's preparatory instruction to His disciples in view of His suffering. It is to be dealt with in no sense academically, but reverently, sympathetically and feelingly, for it concerns a Person known to us and whom we love and adore. The verses in chapter 16 call attention to the Lord's thought for His own in view of His sufferings, so that they might be able to enter into them in some measure. He looked for sympathy from those that were with Him, and therefore instructed them as to His sufferings and death beforehand. In entering Gethsemane He made provision that there should be *selected* ones near Him in His agony. He says to the disciples, "Sit here until I go away and pray yonder;" then He takes the three known and trusted ones to be nearer to Him. It seems to me that the Lord would press upon us that the subject is to be considered by us as being feelingly interested, sobered, and holy. The apostles Paul and Peter would be representative of the saints in this sympathetic way, especially Paul who shared more than anyone in the sufferings of Christ. Peter refers to them very touchingly as a witness of them. The Spirit tells us in chapter 17 that the disciples "were *greatly grieved*". There were two instrumentalities of suffering: first, He must "suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
{2}
killed"; then in chapter 17, "The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him"; that is, you have the Jews and their leaders, and then *men*, so that the race, as well as the Jews, is brought into responsibility for the killing of Christ. In @Mark 8, He *teaches* them about it as if to fix it in their minds; and in @Luke 9:22, He says, "The Son of man *must* suffer"; and in @John 3:14, "thus *must* the Son of man be lifted up". All these statements are to impress upon us the character of the sufferings of Christ, and to draw us in accord with them.
W.B-w. Is chapter 16 the first reference He makes to His sufferings? It says, "from that time Jesus began to shew".
J.T. Yes. After the truth of His Person and of the assembly came out, He began to speak of His sufferings. That subject stands peculiarly in relation to the assembly. In chapter 17 He is seen as coming in His kingdom, then as descending from the mount He says, "Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer".
J.S. Is it as the Son of man you view His sufferings here?
J.T. The Lord uses that designation of Himself as over against His special relation with Israel. He stands related to the whole race of mankind, which would include Israel as well as ourselves. It ought to touch every man, woman, and child, that *the Son of man* had to suffer.
A.F.M. It is as the Son of man that He is on the side of man.
J.T. Yes, He is the only hope of the human family; the light that shone in Him was the light of men. The race must have gone into utter oblivion apart from the Son of man taking on its obligations. This should touch every one in the world.
{3}
C.A.M. In chapter 16 the Lord refers to the religious element.
J.T. Yes; it is in keeping with Matthew, to call attention to Jerusalem in this way. "He must go away to Jerusalem", it says, as though it had become the place of opposition to Him, and consequently the place of suffering. It *had* become that -- a terrible fact. Elsewhere He says, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her", (@Matthew 23:37). It is called "the holy city" even as Satan takes the Lord to the temple, in chapter 4:6; it is also called "the city of the great King", in chapter 5:35. These are abstract thoughts, but the murder of the Son of man in that city is all the more dreadful in view of its place in the counsels of God.
F.H.L. Is there any significance in the elders being mentioned first in chapter 16?
J.T. I suppose the elders represent the *responsible* element in the people; the chief priests have the official place with the scribes, and would represent the *religious* side. The whole system was thus embodied in these three classes; so that there is no escape for that nation in the day of judgment when this crowning guilt of Jerusalem, and of that nation, will come up. This crime of murder was done after full deliberation; the leading classes of the nation were all in it, and since the crucifixion of Christ was accomplished by their united and determined decision, what must have been the terrible state of these heads of the nation! You see the chief priests and scribes taking a judicial attitude, in formally *condemning* Him to death, but in verse 22 of chapter 17, it says, "The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of *men*, and they shall kill him". The killing would be the act of the nations of chapter 20:19, but here it is *men*. The race is guilty.
{4}
A.B.P. Is there any significance then, in the article "the" coming before "Son of man"?
J.T. I think so. One Man only is in the Spirit's mind, whether the title occurs in the Old or New Testament.
Referring again to Gethsemane the pressure would be dreadful, as the facts show: "Then all the disciples left him and fled", (chapter 26:56). These were the Lord's own picked men, but they all forsook Him and fled! The pressure was so dreadful that man, aside from the possession of the Spirit of God, could not stand it. No creature under any circumstances could endure Gethsemane and the cross.
A.F.M. Would you please distinguish for us the sufferings of Gethsemane from those of the cross?
J.T. The sufferings in Gethsemane were anticipatory, occasioned by the pressure of Satan -- "the power of darkness". He was bringing to bear on the Lord anticipatively the terribleness of death as the judgment of God, of which he had the power; it was the penalty of sin, and Satan pressed it on the Lord.
A.F.M. Do you think the reference in Matthew to "a place called Gethsemane", and not to a garden as in John, would be significant? The name itself would have some meaning.
J.T. It is possibly meant to convey the idea of pressure. He "comes with them to a place called Gethsemane". It was deliberate; He had been accustomed to go there. @Luke 22:39 says, "he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives", and @John 18:1 says, "beyond the torrent Cedron, where was a garden, into which he entered". But the point here is in the word "Gethsemane". It is found only in the "pressure" gospels, Matthew and Mark. The instruction is in the word "Gethsemane", suggesting the pressure the Lord went through with His Father beforehand, all that the cross would mean. Satan's power, as we
{5}
have said, entered into it -- Satan bringing this to bear on Him; not through human instrumentality, but *direct*, as in the beginning, after He was baptised, when He was driven into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. Here the devil comes back again, as the Lord said, "the ruler of the world comes" (@John 14:30), which alludes to this particular time.
A.P.T. "My soul is very sorrowful", He says. Would this refer to His inward feelings?
J.T. Yes; whereas, verse 47 looks at the external instrumentality: "while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people". Swords and sticks are weapons to affect Him externally; but Gethsemane was not that. The battle there was spiritual and inward.
J.S. Sufferings in His spirit.
A.F.M. Was the conflict intended to divert the Lord from going into death?
J.T. Yes; to divert Him, if possible, from the path before Him of God's will; that was the enemy's intent; which if he had succeeded would have been a great triumph; it was what he looked for, having failed in his first effort to turn the Lord aside from the path of obedience. Satan, at that time, had offered Him all the kingdoms of the world if He would worship him, but now he endeavours to divert Him by pressing upon Him what He was about to suffer at the hands of God. Hence the Lord's terrible anticipatory agony. It says here, "taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed". The word "depressed" should be specially noted. Being truly Man, He was capable of that here, for He could not but recoil from the judgment of God. What unspeakable pressure was brought to bear upon Him, causing Him to be deeply depressed! The *power of darkness*
{6}
*was there*! Satan was pressing the thought of death as the judgment of God. The causes of judgment had accumulated; besides the wrath of God on account of sin, there was also before His soul the special wrath on Israel on account of a broken law, which He was about to bear. All that could but profoundly affect Him. The more we think of who He was, the more we understand how these things would affect Him.
J.S. Because of the condition into which He had come?
J.T. Yes; He was a real Man; perfect humanity was there. He felt as man should feel in view of all that He should have to undergo. All the wrath of God against sin was about to be poured out upon Him.
A.F.M. Was all that of which you have spoken, condensed into the form of a cup? The Lord says, "My Father, if it be possible, let this *cup* pass from me; but not as *I* will, but as thou wilt".
J.T. Yes; it was not to be extended over months or years, but, as it were, compressed to the period of an "hour". In Gethsemane, He is not undergoing the actual suffering. It is what He went through spiritually there, Satan bringing the judgment to bear upon Him, and the awfulness of what He would have to face. He Himself knowing, as no mere creature could know, what it meant. He went through it anticipatively with the Father, taking the cup in infinite obedience from *His* hands.
W.G.T. Does the presence of Peter, James, and John show they are brought into it?
J.T. Yes; He did not ask for their presence or support when on the cross; they could have no part in that. Here He is going through conflict with Satan. It is not yet God pouring out judgment upon Him; but Satan against Him, seeking by the terror of death as the judgment of God to divert Him from the path of obedience He had entered on,
{7}
knowing, as Satan could not know, what it meant.
C.A.M. It would almost look as though Satan had anticipated another season to tempt Him when he left Him as stated in chapter 4; having in his mind another occasion when the Lord would perhaps be under more oppressive circumstances than mere hunger.
J.T. After the first temptations he had departed from Him "*for a time*", (@Luke 4:13). He had now come back in other circumstances with suitable and dreadful weapons. According to Luke, He was forty days in the wilderness, tempted; apparently the temptation covered the whole forty days. It was an extended period and afterwards He hungered; but here the temptation is very short. It is like the Jordan as compared with the Red Sea, it is condensed, Satan bringing every bit of pressure he was capable of bringing upon His spirit. It was not a question of mere physical death, but *the judgment of God*, which the Lord understood infinitely and from which He could not but recoil. His perfection involved this.
C.A.M. Satan makes his supreme effort, so that if possible He should be diverted from the will of God.
J.T. Yes. We see here how the Lord disposes of His forces. He told certain ones to "Sit here". He was not calling upon them to do much, but they were to be there. Then He takes with Him the three selected ones and began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed; but He went a stone's throw from them. So that there were three distinct steps, for finally He is alone, although they are regarded as near, and were to be a support to Him as there. He was looking for their sympathy as Man, and even their presence would be a comfort.
J.S. "Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee" -- did He take them because of their special place in the testimony?
{8}
J.T. I think so. They had been on the mount with Him, and in the house of Jairus. They evidently had a special place, like "the first three" of David's mighty men.
A.F.M. Why do you think the Lord prayed the third time, "saying the same thing"?
J.T. On the principle, I think, of "two or three witnesses"; there is *full testimony*, in these three prayers, to what was in His heart, feeling tested in the presence of God as to the work He had undertaken. On the one hand, He could not but shrink from the forsaking of God, and on the other, He would be absolutely obedient to His Father. It was infinite perfection in man.
R.A.L. Does He allude to His sufferings in saying, "But ye are they who have persevered with me in my temptations", (@Luke 22:28).
J.T. Yes; only that was said before He entered Gethsemane.
R.W.S. What does "even unto death" mean?
J.T. It is the expression of His *extreme* grief, the pressure extending as a complete test; death itself was being tasted anticipatively. All was felt extremely in the most perfect way. The experience affected Him physically, but He speaks of what was inward: "My soul is very sorrowful even unto death". He tasted death literally on the cross. Here, He is touching death in anticipation.
A.P. Does the brazen altar connect with Gethsemane?
J.T. I think so. Gethsemane would disclose the great moral power that He had to go through these things and to endure the judgment of God. The anointing oil was sprinkled upon the altar *seven* times, which is a very remarkable thing. It is not said of any other item of the tabernacle. Scripture does not say Moses was told to do that; it is, I think, expressive of the spirituality of the mediator, as
{9}
seeing instinctively what it meant. The act was prophetic of what is before us.
A.P. Would not the suggestion of suffering be implied in the altar being of brass?
J.T. Yes, brass implies judgment, involving, of course, suffering. In Genesis the details of the altars were left to the altar-builders. When you come to Exodus you get the measurements of the altar as well as the materials for it.
W.B-w. @Isaiah 53:4 says, "Surely *he* hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows". That would hardly go as far as Gethsemane, would it?
J.T. It is connected with the Lord's ministry of relief for Israel (@Matthew 8:17), which was earlier. In relieving men of their sorrows and diseases He felt and carried them in His own spirit. All this did not cease in Gethsemane, but was absorbed in His own sorrow. The cross was now before Him on which He would bear, not "our infirmities" and "diseases", but our *sins*, involving the judgment of God. Gethsemane involved a change of position in our Lord's life; hitherto He had been engaged in service according to @Luke 4:16 - 22, but now His arrest and the cross were at hand and the disciples, instead of relying on Him, must look after themselves; (@Luke 22:35 - 38). Satan was coming in all his power and the cup which the Father would give to the Lord must be drunk. In the garden, He looked for comforters; *His* sorrow is in evidence rather than the sorrow of His own, although, of course, this would not be overlooked.
A.F.M. He came to Gethsemane with perfect intelligence and understanding of all that lay before Him; and then, when He came to the cross, they offered Him a stupefying mixture to drink, but He refused it.
J.T. When He *tasted* the vinegar mingled with gall, He would not drink it, showing that He knew
{10}
what it meant. In Gethsemane, and on the cross, it was evident that His mind was perfectly clear.
A.P. Scripture speaks of Him as the Leader of our salvation through suffering. He is taking the lead here.
J.T. Yes; He is like the ark. He is, as it were, two thousand cubits before them, so that victory was assured. When the Lord spoke of His death to the disciples, He usually added that on the third day He would be raised up, implying that the victory was sure. It was the same Person who comes out of heaven by and by with the armies which are there following Him. Here He disposes of the disciples.
A.F.M. To the eight disciples He said, "Sit here". To the three He said, "remain here and watch with me". That was beyond what the eight were asked to do. Would that indicate the special confidence our Lord placed in them?
J.T. I think so. It is a question as to whether or not we can enter into this matter, whether we can be disposed of by the Lord in relation to His sufferings; for He would dispose of us according to what we are.
A.P. I was wondering whether there is here an allusion to the disposal of the army in @Joshua 8, where Israel took Ai. Joshua, it is said, went that night into the midst of the valley, having disposed of the armies.
J.T. That is right. Jehovah directed him to stretch out the javelin that was in his hand, which he did, and kept it thus until Ai was destroyed. Christ is in principle in the valley here and does not withdraw His hand until the enemy is destroyed. Through death He annulled him who has the might of death.
As regards our part in the sufferings of Christ, I was thinking of Saul; the Lord says, "I will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name", (@Acts 9:16). The suffering side was an important
{11}
matter with the apostle, and so it should be with each one of us.
A.F.M. Is that why he speaks of filling up that which was behind of the tribulations of Christ? It seems as if others were not taking their share.
J.T. I think so. I suppose there was very little acceptance of suffering. Paul enjoins Timothy: "Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ", (@2 Timothy 2:3).
C.A.M. God has a wonderful way of estimating our service and devotedness as indicated in what is said of David's mighty men. Much is made of "the first three", and what is written is written according to the divine estimate.
J.T. "Jehovah will count, when he inscribeth the peoples", (@Psalm 87:6).
W.B-w. Do you think these are the first three -- Peter and the two sons of Zebedee?
J.T. Well, I think they have that place; you may be sure that they came up to it in some way; otherwise the Lord would not give it to them anticipatively. We know that Peter suffered martyrdom. He tells us that himself, the Lord having shown him. The Lord told John and James that they should drink of His cup. We know that James suffered martyrdom by Herod. Whether John suffered martyrdom is not said in Scripture, but tradition says he did. Scripture says enough to show that the beloved disciple had his share of sufferings. Our last view of him is as a sufferer in Patmos for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus; (@Revelation 1:9).
A.B.P. But in these sufferings, they did not pass through what pressed upon the Lord's spirit here.
J.T. No; the spirit is willing, the Lord said to the disciples, but the flesh weak. So we have to wait for their position in the testimony until after the Holy Spirit had come down, for these men were to take their part in suffering. This evidence of weakness
{12}
suggests our incompetency without the Spirit, however much we may be subjects of the work of God.
A.Pf. In this case the disciples all fled.
J.T. Yes, which brings out the incompetency of the flesh to enter into what the Lord suffered.
A.B.P. The expression "My Father" here would show the Lord's *sense* of a relationship which He would not have when forsaken on the cross.
A.F.M. Do you agree with that remark, involving the Lord being forsaken by the Father on the cross?
J.T. Certainly; that is, the *sense* of His relation with the Father would be broken; for the abandonment would be *complete*.
A.P.T. The intimacy is sustained in Gethsemane throughout. There is no suggestion of abandonment there.
J.T. No. The relation with His Father is there in full consciousness, and after the abandonment on the cross He says, "*Father*, into thy hands I commit my spirit", but as abandoned, He says, "*My God*", not "My Father".
A.P. Is the Trinity involved in the expression, "my God"? I am seeking help as to the relationship with the Father being broken.
J.T. The Person who was dying was divine, but a divine Person *as Man*. We must not attempt to enter into the inscrutable. Here we have before us God and Man. Christ having taken a vicarious place on behalf of men on the cross, is forsaken of God. He says, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Christ is as man in man's place. It is not a son with a father, but Man asking God, as His God, why He forsook Him. He was dying as Man, but He never ceased to be a divine Person. To represent Him as having active part in the Deity while He was on the cross is confusion of thought and weakens the reality of the forsaking which He was enduring. The consciousness of relationship could not exist during
{13}
the forsaking, otherwise the word could not apply and hence there would be no atonement. The abandonment was absolutely and infinitely real.
W.B-w. He died as the Son; not merely as Man.
J.T. Yes; sonship alludes to Him as Man, but implies that He is a divine Person, a divine Person in *human condition*; for none but a divine Person could effect atonement. We must have our minds controlled, by Scripture -- the way the Spirit of God puts the truth. Scripture speaks of God not sparing His own Son, and of the death of His Son to show what God surrendered in love, also to show how great the Person given is; but this does not weaken the fact that on the cross Christ was meeting God about sin on behalf of men as *Man*; and that He was thus regarded and dealt with as if the sins He bore were His own. It is impossible to introduce conscious relationship with His Father or active part in the Deity into this position. Nor can we rightly say that Christ died only as regards His humanity, *that Person* died. He committed His spirit to His Father. His spirit was Himself, but as Man and without His body He went to Paradise, and so opened up the place for man; the saved thief would be with Him there. In all this He was working out the counsels of God and hence retained man's place -- His divine Personality -- being unchanged.
A.P. In @Colossians 1:22 it says, "yet now has it reconciled in the body of his flesh through death". Who does the "it" refer to?
J.T. The "it" there is the "fullness": "for in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell", verse 19. The words "of the Godhead" are not in the original, they are put in to make sense in English; but it means that all that God is, was there in Him. The neuter is employed in the New Translation, but it is the Deity that is acting. One of the divine Persons became Man to effect God's
{14}
thoughts, but the Deity remains; it is not impaired at all, even though One of the Persons of it has become Man and hence is great enough for the Deity to dwell in Him as Man. You bow to that, owning at the same time that it is beyond you to compass.
A.R.S. The Lord took a body in order that He might die. Doing so enabled Him to die as in flesh and blood condition.
J.T. Quite; and in that body, He has never ceased to be a divine Person; but to talk of Him as being God actively, as forsaken on the cross is confusion. He speaks as Man to God; He says, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
J.S. So that in His coming into manhood, we are able to follow Him intelligently in all that He does from the manger to the cross.
J.T. Quite so; we have to apprehend Him as the Spirit of God presents Him to us. We are not great enough to hold Him in our minds as God and Man *at the same time*. One divine Person becoming Man, does not alter or weaken the Deity. But all this is too vast for us to compass; our wisdom is to think and speak as Scripture presents the truth.
Ques. Does, then, the abandonment mean that the link between Father and Son had ceased?
J.T. The relationship, of course, remained, but the *conscious* link must have ceased, for He was bearing the judgment; He was *made sin*; communion had ceased. You cannot bring in communion with God *there*. He was actually made sin. He was the Victim as in flesh and blood, and *that condition* was laid down and not revived. The *Person* who laid it down as under the judgment of God was raised, but in another and wholly new condition. The condition to which our guilt and the state that occasioned it could be attached, was laid down never to be revived. But the Person who died was victoriously raised in a
{15}
condition of manhood answering to the eternal purpose of God.
C.A.M. As in the type of the sin offering, the victim's blood was carried into the holiest, and its carcass was burned outside the camp.
J.T. Quite. That means that the judgment was absolute; it is a complete termination of all that we are as affected by sin.
A.F.M. Might we go back to chapter 26 to ask whether the Lord in coming to the disciples the third time, came as victorious over Satan?
J.T. Yes; He was perfectly calm; henceforth you hear nothing more of depression or of sorrow or of sweat as great drops of blood falling to the ground.
Ques. Why did the Lord not awaken the disciples the second time?
J.T. Their inability to watch with Him was clear and He leaves them. Having prayed the third time, He says, "Sleep on now and take your rest". That phase is completed.
J.S. That conflict is over.
J.T. Yes; He is perfectly composed now to face the judgment of God and all that Satan and men, as let loose, could do against Him. He speaks, too, in perfect obedience; He had settled the whole matter with His Father. He wanted them to be with Him in it, but they had failed Him; nevertheless He settled it absolutely.
Ques. "And going forward a little, he fell upon his face" -- There seems to be much meaning in that expression?
J.T. The agony was most intense; falling on His face, would show how He accepted things and felt them before God. The meaning of this action is clear from Old Testament examples, especially those of Moses and Aaron in @Numbers 16.
W.B-w. There is the settling of the matter
{16}
with His Father in Gethsemane, and then actually being forsaken on the cross.
J.T. He also met Satan in Gethsemane as remarked already; Satan was pressing Him, He prayed, and finally Satan is defeated.
C.A.M. So that the cup was taken from His Father?
J.T. Yes, Satan would put it into His hand, but it was taken from His Father.
A.R. In Matthew, you do not get any mention of the angel strengthening Him, as you do in Luke. Does that emphasise the pressure?
J.T. Luke brings out the sympathy side. There is no forsaking recorded there. The Lord makes the way for us, more, to come into it in martyr character.
J.S. I suppose the spiritual sufferings of the Lord are more difficult for us to apprehend than the physical sufferings of the cross.
J.T. I think so. That is why I thought we might dwell on Gethsemane. Those who go forward in the testimony of the Lord, have to suffer the exposure, for there are the direct frontal attacks of the devil on your spirit when there is no one near you at all. If you are really in the conflict the pressure is there night and day. As in the conflict, the pressure upon you continues, whether through men or direct from the devil.
A.F.M. Would you make the thought of continual pressure upon us a little clearer? Possibly some of us do not know much about the conflict in relation to the testimony.
J.T. Well, connected with the tabernacle there were eleven curtains of goat's hair for a tent over the tabernacle, the extra one was to be doubled in the *front* of it; suggesting that those who are in the forefront of the conflict have to meet the enemy as he comes, even before others know anything of the attack. Gethsemane implies this. You would like
{17}
to have the brethren with you, but they may not be ready.
J.S. So the nearer we are to Christ, the more we should feel things in our spirits.
J.T. The enemy would say, You had better compromise or turn aside altogether; but you have recourse to *prayer*.
J.S. Hence the great privilege that these three had of being with the Lord in the conflict.
J.T. Well, they would encounter the enemy themselves later. The Lord knew that, and would bring them into the conflict with Himself. No doubt they would revert to this great event.
A.P. Would you distinguish between *suffering on account of righteousness*, and the sufferings in Gethsemane?
J.T. "*Suffering on account of righteousness*" would be from man. The sufferings in Gethsemane were mainly from the pressure Satan brought upon the Lord's spirit; He went through it in prayer and came out victorious.
T.H. Should the three disciples, being with Him on the mount, have been helped in view of these sufferings?
J.T. Yes; that is what the Lord intended; as they came down He spoke to them of His sufferings; (@Matthew 17:12).
R.D.G. Just what is involved in "watch with me"?
J.T. How great the privilege to be called to watch with Him in *that* hour! It was outwardly the hour of His enemies and the power of darkness. It is a military position: the enemy is attacking; and we want to be intelligent as to things -- for it is a question of temptation -- "that ye enter not into temptation". The enemy would say, Compromise; Do not go so far ahead; You are too extreme; that he might turn us aside.
{18}
J.S. You are giving it a present application now?
J.T. Yes, the temptation was there for them, but we must learn from what is recorded, for we have to meet the enemy too.
A.F.M. The position is like being baptised for the dead; we must fill the ranks, taking our place at the front as in @1 Corinthians 15.
J.T. Yes, it is a military position; and the utmost vigilance is required. Warfare means vigilance. "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation". The enemy's attacks take the form of temptation.
J.S. How do you view the temptation that the Lord had? Was it a question of whether He should take the cup from Satan or from His Father?
J.T. It was a question as to whether He should take it at all. It was right that He should shrink from it, but He accepted it from God, in unswerving obedience, which is the ground we should always take.
W.G.T. What is your thought about His not getting any answer to His prayer?
J.T. Well, there is no outward answer as, for instance, in @John 12:28, but the will of God that He should drink the cup was clear. Our Lord's exercises and prayers here present infinite perfection in Man and should command our profoundest spiritual admiration and reverence. It was *perfect* manhood.
A.P. Would you say that moving in the will of God keeps us in the boundaries where the sufferings might be encountered? We encounter other sufferings outside the will of God.
J.T. The latter may be sufferings for sin; Peter says Christ suffered once for sins, so that we do not need thus to suffer. But the government of God may require this because of bad conduct. The path of the will of God brings in sufferings from men and Satan.
Before we close, it may be pointed out that there three groups at the cross: First, we have those
{19}
that do not understand the Lord's language. He cried out saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" and then we have the interpretation of those memorable words, of which we should take notice. They are the actual words He uttered, quoting from @Psalm 22. Then in verse 47 it says: "And some of those who stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calls for Elias. And immediately one of them running and getting a sponge, having filled it with vinegar and fixed it on a reed, gave him to drink. But the rest said, Let be; let us see if Elias comes to save him". One would call attention to that first. This group of persons does not understand the Lord's words on the cross, yet the Spirit of God gives them in the original language in which the Lord spoke, and then the translation of it is given in Greek. Now, of course, we have the latter in English.
J.S. Lest there be any misunderstanding as to what it meant.
J.T. And this all enters into what we were saying; it is the realisation of what the abandonment meant. There were persons there who did not understand this language; they said, "This man calls for Elias". Of course, there is a relation between *Eli* and *Elias*; but they made the Lord an idolator. "This man calls for Elias", they say -- a group of persons making Him a mere man calling on another man. Then the passage says, "And Jesus, having again cried with a loud voice, gave up the ghost. And lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent, and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many". And then in verse 54 it says, "But the centurion, and they who were with him on guard over Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that took place,
{20}
feared greatly, saying, Truly this man was Son of God". That is another set of people -- the centurion and those that are with Him; they are not misunderstanding the language; but are affected by the testimony and say, "Truly this man was Son of God".
And then there is the group in verses 55, 56. "There were there many women beholding from afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to him, among whom was Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee". I thought it well to consider these three sets of persons seen alongside of the cross, as you might say, one set of persons that did not understand the Lord's language, although He spoke plainly; and another set of persons, military, who were actually affected by what happened, and made a confession; and a final set of persons that followed Him from Galilee and were there in sympathy. I believe that is the position today.
J.S. The mother of the sons of Zebedee is mentioned here. Her presence here is remarkable.
A.F.M. This military group own Him as the *Son of God*; they confess who He was even as on the cross. Over against them there were the passers by who said, "If thou art Son of God, descend from the cross". They, with the chief priests, scribes and elders, ridicule His claim to sonship, whereas these military confess who He is.
J.T. These military Romans *are capable of being affected by the testimony rendered*. This indicates the position today; there are those that do not understand the language, and they ridicule, and would make the Lord an idolator as calling on another man in heaven to help Him; and there are those that are there officially (they are not mere sightseers), and they are affected by what happened. There are actual persons affected by the testimony; so that we
{21}
need not give up at any time; at the *darkest hour, you may look for results*.
J.S. Would this first group represent the Jewish race in responsibility?
J.T. No doubt; they are the ones who do not understand, although they should, because what the Lord cried out is a quotation from the Psalms. They thought He was calling for Elias, which exhibits the state they were in, for ordinarily they should have understood it.
It is very remarkable that the Romans should come in here. Not only the centurion confesses that Jesus was Son of God, but those also that were with him.
J.S. Would the light reaching that officer's heart, indicate that the light was going out to the Gentiles?.
J.T. Well, no doubt; these are the first Gentiles in Scripture to confess the Son of God. But note what is presented in verses 51 - 53; it is to call attention to the testimony. The passage says, "the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent, and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many. But the centurion, and they who were with him on guard over Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that took place, feared greatly, saying, Truly this man was Son of God". Hence it is the idea of testimony affecting them; so that we should never give up; in the darkest hour, the testimony will yield results. The next group is the women, who represent fellowship; with these I think the scene at the cross properly finishes.
J.S. Does it not show remarkable progress in the testimony in spite of the opposition?
{22}
J.T. It is the beginning of a great harvest. Matthew tells us earlier about "the field"; in this passage it is yielding.
C.A.M. It would seem as if God would cause creation, as well as this Roman -- representing the powers that then were -- to pay a tribute to His Son.
A.B.P. Does the fact that the two Marys are mentioned suggest that these women had been brought into fellowship with His sufferings?.
J.T. I think so. The name means bitterness. John gives *three* Marys at the cross. They are truly in fellowship; they had followed Him from Galilee ministering to Him, and are here because of their love for Him.
J.S. They are in the fellowship of His death.
A.P. Philippians speaks of the "fellowship of his *sufferings*". These women had part in this.
W.B-w. Do you think these groups would run on to the present day?
J.T. I do. We should belong to the *third*. They represent the *love* side. They followed Him from Galilee, *ministering to Him*. John says they were standing *by* the cross of Jesus.
A.P.T. Is not the title of @Psalm 22 feminine. It has an excellent finish: "They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it".
J.T. Yes; "A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a *generation*". Such a generation will be to His credit. "And shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it".
J.S. It seems the earthquake specially moved the military.
J.T. Yes; "and the things that took place". The point is -- the testimony there was not fruitless.
F.H.L. Was there *intelligence* in the second class and *love* in the third?
{23}
J.T. That is right; the former determined by what occurred that "Truly this man was Son of God".
J.E.H. Referring to the Lord's words, "If any one desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me", (@Matthew 16:24). Would that be illustrated by the women here? They were publicly identified with Christ as crucified.
J.T. Yes. In chapter 16, where the Lord tells about His sufferings, Peter says, "this shall in no wise be unto thee", (verse 22). He would turn Him aside; he was doing what Satan sought to do in Gethsemane, and so the Lord says, "Get away behind me, Satan". Any one of us might turn another aside from the sufferings involved in the path of the will of God, so the Lord says, "If any one desires to come after me, *let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me*".
{24}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (2)
@Luke 22:14,15,39 - 53; @Luke 24:26; @Acts 1 - 3
J.T. Matthew and Mark treat of the sufferings of Christ in a deeper and fuller way than Luke and John; the former are more foundational, the bearing of them not only involving this dispensation, but the coming one, whereas, it would appear that Luke and John have more in mind the bearing of the sufferings of Christ on the saints in this dispensation, and particularly on the assembly as such. So Luke records the Lord sitting down to partake of the last passover, and saying, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you *before* I suffer". In @Acts 1, he says that the Lord presented Himself living to the disciples *after* He suffered. Then Paul, whom Luke would have in mind especially, is said to be shown how *much* he should suffer for Christ's name; (@Acts 9:16). So that Paul from the outset of his service exhibited the idea of suffering; portraying the sufferings of Christ. He speaks about filling up that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ for His body's sake; (@Colossians 1:24).
It will be observed that what is before us, lies between the periods designated as *before* and *after* His sufferings. He said, "*before* I suffer", at the supper table; and then, @Acts 1 says, "he presented himself living, *after* he had suffered".
A.N.W. Does that imply that there was no suffering for the Lord up to that point?
J.T. Not in the sense in which He spoke. He suffered earlier, of course, but from other causes.
A.P. In @Luke 9:22, the Lord said, "The Son of man must suffer many things". Does that relate to the period earlier than that of which you are speaking?
J.T. It looks on to what would happen at Jerusalem
{25}
although, of course, all His sufferings from that time would be included. I think He alluded specially to the cross when He spoke at the supper table. He suffered from the outset, but especially from the time of His anointing. He was attacked by the devil in the wilderness, and by his instrumentalities later on; but He had the cross in His mind when He spoke of His suffering at the supper table; and the Spirit of God, through Luke, had those thoughts in His mind also. When Luke says, "after he suffered", in @Acts 1, he also refers to the cross.
A.F.M. You stated that the character of the Lord's sufferings as recorded in Luke and John was not so deep as when treated of in Matthew and Mark. Would you mind saying a little more about that?
J.T. Matthew and Mark alone speak of God forsaking Him, which alludes to the root of the sin question and is foundational for the whole moral universe; but this matter of His suffering as presented in Luke and John bears particularly on the assembly as His body. In Luke, He showed unto them His hands and His feet. That is the witness of His love in His *suffering service*.
C.A.M. In that way, perhaps, it would be right to think of this gospel as having a specially sympathetic setting -- this expression, "before I suffer", for instance. There are sufferings in Matthew and Mark that are beyond us to enter into. But the expression here in Luke seems to count upon intelligent sympathy.
J.T. So in Luke it is recorded that they slept on account of *grief*; they were grieved about what was occurring, and Luke alone tells us about the angel ministering to Him. I believe he has in mind that the assembly comes into all this. It is not beyond us. As Paul said, "I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for
{26}
his body, which is the assembly; of which I became minister", (Colossians l:24,25).
A.F.M. You mean that the assembly becomes qualified, as affectionately pondering Christ's sufferings, to be here in suffering also?
J.T. Yes; the assembly is formed in these sufferings. Paul had it in mind. The Lord said, "*I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name", (@Acts 9:16); he could therefore enter sympathetically into what was expected, on the Lord's part, from the assembly. What the Lord looks for in us, is the fellowship of His sufferings, of which Paul speaks in @Philippians 3:10.
C.A.M. I suppose we should be able to give an intelligent answer to the question the Lord asks in chapter 24:26, "Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things?"
J.T. Yes. "It became him", that is, God, "... in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings", (@Hebrews 2:10). He is the Leader of our salvation. He has led in that way and we are to be in it. I think Luke's gospel would make that plain. Paul says, "and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence", (@1 Corinthians 12:31). That is the way of *love*, but it must be also the way of suffering in this world.
A.F.M. So that leadership would have two characteristics -- that of suffering and of praise, according to @Hebrews 2, would you say?
J.T. Yes. The sufferings enhance the praise. It speaks of it immediately in @Hebrews 2:12 -- "in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises". The assembly's praise is attuned to Christ's praises through suffering.
W.G.T. Speaking of the fellowship of His sufferings; would the sufferings in Luke go beyond Gethsemane, and include the cross, or do they simply go as far as Gethsemane?
{27}
J.T. Luke does not mention Gethsemane at all, which is important to notice. Gethsemane, I believe, involves excessive pressure, and belongs to Matthew and Mark, which are marked by this. Luke says, "And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him". It is the *mount of Olives*; that is, the sufferings are not presented in such intensity; they are, in a way, within our range. The Lord had said to two of them, "Ye shall drink indeed my cup", (@Matthew 20:23). They shall *indeed* do it. I believe @Matthew 20 would show that it can be done, but no one but Christ could endure the forsaking of God. There are sufferings that are available to us, and I believe Luke presents these. So that we have the angel's support in the sufferings here.
J.S. Are the sufferings in Luke identified more with the testimony here?
J.T. The severity of them is not stressed in Luke, having in view their bearing on the assembly and the Lord's position when He instituted the Supper. When He assembled with them after He arose, they are also mentioned, for the disciples saw Him *before* and *after* He suffered. Peter speaks about being a witness of them -- "who am their fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ", (@1 Peter 5:1). It is an important matter that he could give an account of the sufferings of Christ. Paul was a *partaker* of them in a fuller way possibly than any.
A.N.W. "If indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him" (@Romans 8:17), has the glory in mind.
J.T. Suffering with Him makes us morally suited to be glorified.
F.H.L. You were just referring to the ministering angel. Is there a suggestion that the angel's support came to Him following the statement, "not my will, but thine be done"?
{28}
J.T. Just so; you can understand the moral suitability of that. We can look for divine support under those circumstances. As Paul said, "For an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me this night", (@Acts 27:23).
A.F.M. We have the power of darkness mentioned here: "but this is your hour and the power of darkness". Would that be Satan's power?
J.T. Yes; it was all there.
A.F.M. Is not the position of the disciples on the mount of Olives educational for the assembly? They are not in two companies here, but in one.
J.T. The Lord does not separate them. In Matthew and Mark, He leaves some in a certain part of the garden and takes others further on. I have no doubt that those gospels are foundational and bear on the future dispensation as well as on the present, and so take in all. Luke would give us just one company -- the assembly -- bringing it in as sharing in the sufferings of Christ: for morally, it must be so. To be *His body*, there must be suffering; and so Paul, representing that idea, says, "I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus", (@Galatians 6:17); that is, the marks of His suffering.
C.A.M. That is very remarkable and would seem to leave a special place for the sufferings of Paul. Would you say, in that way, his sufferings were descriptive of the sufferings of the assembly?
J.T. I think he represented what was in the mind of the Lord as to the assembly. He says that he was minister of it; so that what otherwise would come out, by and by, in the day of display, in writing to the Corinthians he is compelled to disclose, because of their state. What an extraordinary amount of suffering he passed through!
He says, "in *labours exceedingly abundant*, in *stripes to excess*, in *prisons exceedingly abundant*, in *deaths oft*. From the Jews *five* times have I received
{29}
*forty stripes, save one. Thrice* have I been *scourged, once* I have been *stoned, three* times I have suffered *shipwreck, a night and day* I *passed in the deep*: in *journeyings often*, in *perils of rivers*, in *perils of robbers*, in *perils from my own race*, in *perils from the nations*, in *perils in the city*, in *perils in the desert*, in *perils on the sea*, in *perils among false brethren*; in *labour and toil*, in *watchings often*, in *hunger and thirst*, in *fastings often*, in *cold and nakedness*. Besides those things that are without, the *crowd* of *cares pressing* on me *daily*, the *burden* of *all* the assemblies", (@2 Corinthians 11:23 - 28).
We know from other accounts that he did not list them all here. Much of his sufferings occurred later, for 2 Corinthians was written long before his arrest and imprisonment at Jerusalem.
A.N.W. The term "joint heirs" in @Romans 8:17 is rather striking: "And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him".
J.T. Yes, you feel the suitability of that. If we are to reign, there is some mark of distinction in us in the way of suffering; so that Paul says, "for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus", (@Galatians 6:17). One could see those brands at any time, showing that he was marked off as representative of the assembly.
J.S. The assembly's position in glory will have been reached through suffering.
J.T. It is suitable that we should go that way. It became God in bringing many sons to glory to make their Leader perfect through suffering.
A.R. Is that why the Lord said, "it is I myself. Handle me and see", (chapter 24:39); then He showed them His hands and His feet, as indicating the suffering through which He went.
J.T. Quite. He says here, "But *ye* are they
{30}
who have persevered with me in my temptations", (chapter 22:28). He then appoints to them places of honour, as sharers with Him in His kingdom. Thus Luke gives us the side of suffering into which we can enter. Instead of the idea of pressure, as in Matthew and Mark, it says in verse 39, "And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him". He was leading them, not in a new way, but in a proved one, which was "according to his custom"; whereas, in @Matthew 26, He went to a place called Gethsemane, and stipulated that some should remain in a certain position, taking others further on. Here, as at the place, He said to them, "Pray that ye enter not into temptation" -- prayer is always our resource. In Matthew and Mark the Lord mentions His own purpose to pray first, and enjoins them later to watch and pray.
C.A.M. The word attuned that you used is forceful, for the mount of Olives as associated with suffering, would show that heavenly music is produced in this way.
J.T. That is what we should see, that it is not beyond us; for the Lord has taken a way which He had gone before. He goes to the mount of Olives, which was according to His custom; it refers to heavenly associations. If you go that way, this is the position you come to. You are not taken into the pressure at once. As is said in the Old Testament, "that God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near", (@Exodus 13:17). It was divine consideration for Israel that would not lead them into war at once.
W.F.K. Luke's presentation is that the assembly is to share the sufferings of Christ; he also mentions the angel ministering to the Lord. The angels are ministering on behalf of the saints at the
{31}
present time, so that they are helped and encouraged through the various characters of suffering.
J.T. Yes, you may count on them. Paul in the shipwreck, at a most critical time, is ministered to by one of them; and so in Revelation when the great multitude are seen who come out of the great tribulation, it is said that all the angels were there -- showing their sympathetic interest in those who had suffered.
A.P. It says, the Lord being in conflict, "prayed more intently"; with whom was the conflict?
J.T. It was with the devil; he was endeavouring to turn the Lord aside from the will of God.
A.P. Is this the second effort of the devil?
J.T. Yes; after the first attack he had "departed from him for a season" (@Luke 4:13), but he came back. "For the ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing", (@John 14:30). The devil had sought to tempt Him, and here made this onslaught, but he failed, for "in me", said the Lord, "he has nothing".
A.R. It would appear that the angel came to Him *before* the conflict.
J.T. Yes; the angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him, after He said, "not my will, but thine be done".
W.G.T. An angel appears to Him here; whereas, when He was taken by the soldiers He speaks of the angels not being necessary, though a legion of them could have been sent.
J.T. That is Matthew's presentation of it. He said He could have called upon His Father for more than twelve legions of angels; (chapter 26:53). John has the divine side in view; and when He said to the band in the garden, "I am he", "they went away backward and fell to the ground", (@John 18:6). It was a question of Deity there. You do not bring in angelic support in John where the side of His deity
{32}
is presented. Luke presents the human side which lets us in.
F.H.L. Would you say what the power was that caused Paul to rise up, after he had been left for dead, at Lystra?
J.T. We know that the Spirit of God indwelt him, and that he rose up and went into the city. *It was in the power of life* that he did this. We are not *told* by what power this extraordinary thing was done. It was by the power of God.
A.P. Would you make a distinction in angelic service? Michael, for instance, would be on military lines; Gabriel, on teaching lines.
J.T. Yes. Gabriel's service would be more priestly, but generally angels, as @Hebrews 1:14 says, are "ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation". They do what is needful. Take the case of Elijah, for instance: the angel speaks to him about the extent of the journey before him, that it was "too great"; his service had been to provide food for him, to bake the cake on hot stones, to awake him and invite him to eat. The angels will do anything the servant of God needs, or that the saints of God need when in suffering; they are always active on their behalf.
A.P. Would you say that an angel may have very great power, for Scripture says, "And I saw an angel descending from the heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand", (@Revelation 20:1)? That would not be a priestly angel?
J.T. No; that would be a military one; 185,000 Assyrians were slain by one at one time; their power is seen as unlimited. But it is more in relation to external or physical conditions; besides, the Spirit of God is in the saints, and it seems that it was through Him that Paul rose up after the stoning at Lystra. Though apparently he was dead, he rose up himself and entered into the city.
{33}
W.B-w. What is the meaning of the mount of Olives here? Is it the Spirit coming in in the way of power?
J.T. I think that is the suggestion, that the Lord is leading us apart according to Luke, not in the way of the land of the Philistines, lest we should see war at once; we are thus brought into heavenly associations. The Lord had been accustomed at night to go to the mount of Olives, not for conflict, but evidently as a spiritual retreat. During the day He taught in the temple; by night, going out He remained abroad on the mountain called the mount of Olives. He did not go there to be tempted of the devil; He went there, we may say, to be with His Father. If He leads us thus, He prepares us for suffering, so that we can go that way and not turn back.
W.B-w. Prayer is mentioned five times in this section. Does that not help us through suffering?
J.T. Prayer is the great thing. "Is any ... afflicted? let him pray". (@James 5:13), "Men ought always to pray, and not faint". (@Luke 18:1) Luke makes more of it than any of the evangelists. It is the great resource we have.
I think it is very beautiful for the saints to see that if the Lord is leading us in suffering, He leads us by way of heaven, as it were. The mount of Olives, having been His own retreat, indicates this. You come down from heaven, in principle, to suffer. His departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem was the theme of conversation on the mount of Transfiguration. From that mount He came down to suffer.
W.F.K. It says, "he learned obedience from the things which he suffered", (@Hebrews 5:8). Do we learn it that way?
J.T. I am sure we learn through suffering.
H.E. In this connection I was thinking of John. "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the
{34}
tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos", (@Revelation 1:9). He became in the Spirit.
J.T. He was in the Spirit on the Lord's day. That is a fine start. He fell at the Lord's feet as dead, but He laid His right hand upon him, saying, "Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the living one". He enters the position in the book of Revelation in that way.
A.P. The words, "with desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer"; then the occasion of the Supper coming in, would it affect us in the same way?
J.T. Yes; you may anticipate suffering, but what are you *before* it? Here the Lord is with His own before His suffering. He is not overpowered, but is occupied with others, not with Himself at all. He says, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer". We must consider Him thus before He suffers and see that just as He is occupied, so He will go through in this spirit; He is thus an example to us.
G.MacP. Does Luke present Him as a model of suffering? and does the position on the mount of Olives here suggest the assembly as having the Spirit and being called into conflict and suffering?
J.T. Yes. He eats the passover with them. The passover entails sufferings; He was the Lamb about to be sacrificed; but we are to see what He is before suffering. Then in Acts we see Him after He suffers. The assembly begins its education in suffering as having Him thus in the midst.
F.H.L. He was not overcome by the suffering when He prayed, "Father, forgive them", (chapter 23:34).
J.T. There was complete superiority to the suffering. It is in that way we learn how to go through things, seeing what He was before and what
{35}
He was after the cross. The mount of Olives for us implies power for all this. On the cross He says, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do". That is the point to be noted. The saints in the testimony are to maintain this spirit of forgiveness in persecution, like Stephen; instead of vindictiveness, they exhibit the same spirit of forgiveness. No one can go through suffering in this way save by the mount of Olives. The altar of copper was anointed seven times, showing that in going through sufferings, you have power to be superior to them.
A.R. Would you say that Stephen stands out as a model in that way? His face shone as the face of an angel.
J.T. He is a beautiful example in suffering. Peter and Paul are also examples of all that we have been saying. Stephen was entirely above the pressure; he is like his Master in saying, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge", (@Acts 7:60).
W.G.T. In Matthew, the coming to the mount of Olives, seems to be immediately after the Supper; in Luke, there seems to be more on the line of exhortation before going to the mount of Olives.
J.T. Exactly; "they went out to the mount of Olives", is said in Matthew and Mark, as if this movement was immediately after the Supper, but the sufferings are not connected with Olivet in these gospels. It is in Matthew and Mark that we get Gethsemane presented in all its pressure. Luke is the gospel we need to come to, in order to follow the Lord. He says elsewhere to Peter, "where I go thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me after", (@John 13:36).
Rem. The position of kneeling is omitted in Matthew and Mark, but it is stated in Luke; it fits in with Stephen, who also knelt down.
J.T. Yes; you see in him a beautiful example of
{36}
the reflection of Christ, who is to be reflected in the saints as of the assembly. Then Paul says, "in deaths oft", (@2 Corinthians 11:23). He says to the Galatians, "I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus", (chapter 6:17). There was permanent evidence of his sufferings.
W.B-w. It is touching to see that Stephen was evidently not knocked down by the stones. He knelt down and cried, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit", (@Acts 7:59).
J.T. It displays his superiority. You can understand that the angels were supporting him physically, as they had ministered to his Master.
Instruction as to the Lord's sufferings goes back in the history of the disciples. In Mark, He *taught* them about His sufferings. So at the last passover, they could see Him as in anticipation of His suffering; I believe the thing to learn is how to suffer. We must understand in view of this, how He was before His sufferings, how He went into them, and then how He went through them. Peter was a *witness* of all this, and hence the testimony was rightly carried on.
J.T.Jr. Peter speaks of Christ as a Model. We are to follow in His steps; (@1 Peter 2:21). Would that include what the Lord was *before* and *after* the Supper?
J.T. Exactly; if one were at the passover when the Lord's supper was instituted, and heard the Lord say, "before I suffer", and were at all sensitive, such an one would look to Him and learn what His demeanour was at that time, and how He was affected in speaking of it. In our great Example we learn the way to enter into, and how to face, anticipated suffering.
A.P. Does the fact that Judas was there at table indicate that we should be ready to anticipate suffering; the *betrayer* was there?
J.T. Exactly; that Satan should be so near
{37}
(because Satan had entered into him) must have been dreadful to the Lord in His spirit, yet He was perfectly calm in spite of this. He says, "the *hand* of him that delivers me up is with me on the table" (chapter 22:21); it would be that member of Judas's body that suggests *doing*; he had power to act against the Lord.
R.A.L. John the baptist had said, "Behold the *Lamb* of God", etc.; (@John 1:29). Would not that suggest suffering?
J.T. Yes; the Lamb denotes the *Sufferer* -- "he was led as a lamb to the slaughter", (@Isaiah 53:7). That meaning of it is carried through the Old Testament, and @Isaiah 53 emphasises it.
A.P.T. The Lord says, "*this* passover". What you say about that?
J.T. It was the last and greatest of all the passovers, for *He* was the Lamb, as already said; and the passover always involved suffering. The lamb was slain and *roasted with fire*; typically, it indicated extreme suffering; and that is what entered into this last passover.
W.B-w. Would the right understanding of the passover help us in suffering?
J.T. No doubt the whole scene is educative. What was in the Lord's mind when He said, "before I suffer"? He intended to impress the thought of His suffering upon the minds of the disciples. He did not use the word casually -- it was specially for them.
A.P. Is @Exodus 12:8 parallel with this? "Roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs shall they eat it".
J.T. Quite; all that entered into the passover would be there, without anything lacking.
W.G.T. "This Passover" alludes to Himself.
W.B-w. In Egypt, on the passover night, a great many lambs must have suffered.
{38}}
J.T. So that instead of all the firstborn of Israel suffering, the *lambs* suffered.
C.A.M. The fact that the Lord raises the question in @Luke 24, "Ought not the Christ to have suffered?" seems to be a test to our souls as to how much we have understood this.
J.T. I think so. The Old Testament leads you up to it, as marking out the Messiah. The Christ must be the Sufferer, and they should have known this. "Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?" shows that the sufferings are immediately linked with the glory.
A.N.W. Luke, referring as he does to the suffering in his writings, would show that he gained by the ministry of it.
A.F.M. Is there a parallel between the "brands of the Lord Jesus" in Paul and the wounds in the Lord's hands and feet, because in this gospel, the *side* is not mentioned?
J.T. I think so; amongst the sufferings of Paul, he mentions "journeyings often", (@2 Corinthians 11:26). I believe Luke presents the journey the Lord took, by the prominence given to His feet. In chapter 7, His feet were anointed by the woman. That is to call attention to the journeyings; in chapter 10 we have the Lord as "a certain Samaritan journeying". These journeyings are amongst the sufferings.
C.A.M. Peter speaks of "His steps", (@1 Peter 2:21).
J.T. Just so; that is a word for all who serve the Lord, because we shrink from very long journeys. It is right in a way to measure things, and in measuring them, to know what they involve; yet to take them *in spite* of their cost. Long journeys must be taken. As the apostle says, "I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ", (@Romans 15:19).
Ques. Does the Lord give the disciples credit in that connection, when He says, "But ye are they
{39}
who have persevered with me in my temptations", (chapter 22:28)?
J.T. That is right; they kept on with Him. There were certain women who followed Him from Galilee; that is a long journey, too.
Ques. What has been said makes much of the mount of Olives. Would it convey the thought of oil or be figurative of the power of the Spirit?
J.T. It is more the power of the Spirit linking us with heaven. He went according to His custom to the mount of Olives; it was the known place of His relations with the Father into which we are to be brought. Gethsemane, the place of pressure, is mentioned only in Matthew and Mark, as already said. What is to be seen in order to get this position clear, is that whatever the pressure may be, the Lord takes the lead for us. He says in verse 46, "Why sleep ye? rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation". He does not say, "Sleep on", as in Matthew and Mark. Then it says, "As he was yet speaking, behold, a crowd, and he that was called Judas"; and then verse 49 says, "they who were around him, seeing what was going to follow, said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?" Now this "seeing what was going to follow", is for us; you see the thing *before*; but what are you going to do? How are you going to act? We have to learn that in such conditions the Lord takes the lead for us.
J.S. That is, in conflict?
J.T. Yes, in open conflict now.
A.R.S. They are awake now; and can see what is going to follow.
J.T. Yes; you may say, in view of certain occurrences, I see we are in for trouble. Well, what are *you* going to do? The first question raised is, "shall we smite with the sword?" No, that will not do; for it is not according to the dispensation. That is what was done in the Reformation: some of
{40}
them smote with the sword and perished by it. Here we read that "a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear". He could not have done a more serious thing than to take off a man's right ear when it is a time for *speaking and hearing*. What is to be done now? "Jesus answering said, Suffer thus far; and having touched his ear, he healed him". The Lord is leading in this great conflict.
J.S. Showing by His own acts the spirit of the dispensation.
J.T. Yes; instead of cutting off a man's ear, He heals it when cut off, so that he may hear.
A.R. He corrects His disciples, and then He would correct those who had come to take Him; the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders.
J.T. That is the next thing. We should first notice those *who were around Him*: their position is that of the saints now; but being around Him, we may discredit Him. Shall we smite with the sword, they inquire; Peter does not wait for the Lord's answer. He smites, and the Lord has to undo what Peter did. Jesus then addressed the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders. Could Peter and the others have challenged these religious heads? No. What could they say to them? "And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who were come against him, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks?" They might have easily retorted, One of your own has just used the sword. We see that Peter's rash act compromised the Lord's position. The Lord did not intend to defend Himself with swords and sticks, compare @John 18:36. Peter's act had compromised the position. Thus it is for us to follow the Lord's example in conflict.
A.R.S. Why does the Spirit of God keep Peter's
{41}
name in the background here? It says, "a certain one from among them".
J.T. I suppose it is to throw the onus on all that were there -- "one from *among them*". That sword has no place in the mount of Olives; the "sword of the Spirit" is the only necessary weapon in the conflict, coupled with "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ".
A.P. It says, "shall *we* smite?"
J.T. Yes; they were *all* in it.
A.R. The first speaking is to rebuke the disciples; and the second speaking, to rebuke those that came to take Him.
J.T. The Lord is making the position clear; He puts it to them as to why they came out with swords and sticks as against a robber, and points out that He had been day by day in the temple. He is exposing them in showing that they had to wait for some treacherous occasion in order to take Him.
W.G.T. "Let him sell his garment and buy a sword" (verse 36), would be another idea.
J.T. Verses 36 and 37 show their new position: He was to be taken away from them and they were for the moment to depend on themselves. We have to understand that expression, "buy a sword", spiritually. The Lord quotes from Zechariah in @Mark 14:27: "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad"; this indicates His position as the Sufferer. The disciples said, "here are two swords". Jesus said, "It is enough". They did not catch His thought, one sword is enough -- it is "the sword of the Spirit".
J.S. Why did He use the term "robber"? Would it imply that they were robbing God?
J.T. Well, it was as if they came out against a lawless man or criminal; whereas, He alludes to His *conduct among them*; He never robbed anybody. He further says, "I was day by day with you in the
{42}
temple". They never saw anything in Him to indicate lawlessness. The intent of His challenge was to expose them.
Ques. Jesus, being the Lord, would not need any human help, would He?
J.T. Peter compromised the position. I believe it is an allusion to the Reformation here, prophetically. They compromised the position by the use of the sword, and the saints suffered for three hundred years on account of it; that is, until light as to the true position of the assembly militant, and the character of its weapons, was recovered.
A.P. Earlier the position was carnal, as the weapons were carnal.
J.T. Yes; the Reformers appealed to the "powers that be" for help. Some took the sword and died by it, but the great need was to make room for the Spirit. It took nearly three hundred years for the saints to recognise the Spirit. In the great favour of God He made room for the Spirit, and now it is for the saints to maintain subjection to this position.
C.A.M. The use of the sword in the Reformation was a serious obstacle to progress. The Lord no doubt came in with healing, and the saints became spiritual. He is able to reach His end in spite of such unfortunate things.
J.T. I think the Quakers were used later to make way for the gospel; they also tried to make room for the Spirit, but in a very defective way. It is somewhat unseemly to criticise the Reformers, but if they had gone the whole way in standing for the truth, room would have been given for the Spirit; and we should have had the recovery of the truth of the assembly long before it appeared a hundred years ago.
A.F.M. What in particular did the Quakers do?
J.T. I believe, under God, they made the way for the open-air preaching without licence
{43}
from the Crown. Others followed more or less devotedly, making way for the gospel to be preached "by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven", (@1 Peter 1:12). That is the principle governing gospel preaching, and we should never lose sight of that fact.
W.B-w. A good general in the conflict repairs the breach in his army and moves on. The Lord Jesus in like manner met the situation here.
J.T. Yes, and Peter even going so far as denying the Lord, is presently recovered. Protestantism has been marked by the substitution of the natural for the spiritual, but recovery has taken place. The Lord looked at Peter at the right moment, that is, as the cock crew, and Peter, remembering His word, went out and wept bitterly.
Luke presents what is priestly. The Lord healed the high priests bondman, and later looked at Peter, and Peter repented. These are priestly acts. When the Lord was crucified, He said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", (chapter 23:34). His prayer for His murderers manifested the spirit that was to mark the dispensation of the gospel; the spirit in which you are superior to opposition and suffering. The thief was converted, as having heard that prayer.
C.N. Would "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts", (@Zechariah 4:6,) enter into this dispensation?
J.T. Quite so; that is the thing to come to; however much we may have to suffer, we are not to be under the power of it, but superior to it; the Spirit thus enables us to maintain the dignity of the position.
A.P. So that the two witnesses in @Revelation 11 are in keeping with the mount of Olives, in the presence of possibly the greatest kind of suffering?
J.T. In the passage just quoted from Zechariah the two sons of oil are mentioned. That is what
{44}
@Revelation 11 alludes to, confirming what was said -- "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit", that is, by the power of the Spirit of God sent from heaven, the gospel is to be preached.
A.F.M. So that the going forth of the gospel is dependent upon vessels whom the Holy Spirit is pleased to use, as they suffer; then the subjects of the gospel form the assembly, which as under Christ, renders praise to God.
J.T. The result of suffering by the saints is that there is service in the assembly Godward. The sufferings of Christ are mentioned in @Hebrews 2:10; it says, "it became him ... (God) ... to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings". Sufferings refer to the effect of what sin has done. The Leader must take the way of suffering in order to lead the many sons to glory, but the sons suffer also. So it says, "he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one", (@Hebrews 2:11). The assembly is thus the vessel of praise as of suffering.
W.F.K. Why does Paul speak in @1 Corinthians 11:23 of suffering before he introduces the Supper? He says, "in the night in which he was delivered up".
J.T. It enters into what we have remarked -- "the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread"; it connects with what we have been saying about Judas, who delivered Him up. The Lord was occupied with the assembly, in spite of what He suffered through the treachery of Judas. He "took bread, and having given thanks, broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for *you*",(verse 24).
R.D.G. Has the reference to the temple in verse 53 of our chapter some special significance? At Nazareth they lead Him to the brow of the hill to cast Him down. He does not refer to that here, but to the fact that He was day by day in the temple.
J.T. I think the point here is that the Lord is
{45}
adjusting everything, and by the adjustment His enemies are exposed. The whole position is glorified. These enemies are not honest, nor courageous; if they were true to their convictions, they would have arrested Him in the temple. Why did they wait for this wretched betrayal of Judas, if He had been guilty of wickedness? Why not arrest Him before this time? The Lord is exposing the whole position, and that is always important.
{46}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (3)
@John 3:14; @John 8:28; @John 12:32; @John 19:1 - 6,25; @John 21:18,19
J.T. In order that we may have a complete outline of the teaching of Christ's sufferings as seen in John's gospel, it is necessary to have these scriptures and similar ones before us. The allusions to the *cross* are more numerous in John than in any of the synoptic gospels. The obvious teaching of these three scriptures, which speak of our Lord being lifted up, is to call attention to the *ignominious character* of His sufferings as presented in John. It was the enemy's aim that this great Person coming in on God's behalf should be humbled. So with regard to His followers, they are seen representatively as standing by the cross of Jesus; this is peculiar to John's presentation of this subject. Then, as if to carry the thought to the end of this gospel, the Lord signified to Peter "by *what death* he should glorify God;" a death which would glorify God and correspond with Christ's death.
J.S. That is, after God was glorified in the cross of Jesus.
A.F.M. When you speak of the Lord being lifted up, as seen in these three scriptures, is it to show the intent by men to humiliate Him?
J.T. Yes; Paul used the words, "a spectacle to the world", (@1 Corinthians 4:9). The enemy designed to humble the Lord, hence, as already said, the cross is more frequently alluded to in John's gospel than elsewhere.
W.G.T. In Philippians, He is viewed as having humbled Himself. That would also be in keeping with John.
J.T. That, of course, was His own act; but in this gospel, the enemy's design is in mind.
{47}
A.F.M. Do you think that in the Lord saying to the Father, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth", (@John 17:4), there was another reason for His being lifted up besides being humiliated by men?
J.T. Quite; He was morally fit to be lifted up as meeting God's claims; so that the believer should have everlasting life.
A.N.W. Say a word about the soul trouble of Jesus in John, which, in a way, seems to answer to Gethsemane. "Now is my soul troubled". Will you just put that in its setting with regard to the other gospels?
J.T. Well, it is Gethsemane, as you say, anticipatively. But that section of this gospel brings out, not what is forced upon Him through conflict, but the *depths of feeling* of which He was capable. Chapters 11 and 12 bring out that depth of feeling -- not so much the human side, although, of course, it was in manhood; but depth of feeling in a divine Person in *these circumstances*. He is answered from heaven, which you do not get in Gethsemane.
A.F.M. In chapter 12 He says, "Father, glorify thy name", (verse 28) and then came this public answer.
J.T. That is right; it is heaven owning Him, I think, as a divine Person -- "I both have glorified and will glorify it again".
C.A.M. Putting chapters 11 and 12 in a section by themselves is very interesting.
J.T. Yes; they comprise a section. First, there is the capability of His feeling as regards the loved family as seen at the grave of Bethany; it says: "And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me; but I knew that thou always hearest me", (chapter 11:41). That is one divine Person speaking to another; and then there is the answer from heaven in chapter 12 of which we spoke. But there is nothing of that in Gethsemane; the answer to Gethsemane is His
{48}
resurrection. There is no outward answer, save the angel's attention, until resurrection.
A.F.M. That is very striking because the Lord went through all that period -- the night and the next day until three in the afternoon -- and there was no outward answer. It is very solemn, indeed.
C.A.M. I want to ask you about the "lifting up". Will you say something as to the significance of that expression?
J.T. Like many other things, it is peculiar to John. Firstly, in chapter 3:14, it is, that He *must* be lifted up, without saying who does it; then, secondly, "When *ye* shall have lifted up the Son of man"; that puts the onus on the Jews; and thirdly, "if *I* be lifted up", this calls attention to the Person who is to be lifted up, without saying *who* does it. I suppose it is because He had glorified God on the earth. He is lifted up between heaven and earth, a spectacle for both; but then, with what great results! God overcame the most ignominious treatment of His beloved Son; that life eternal might be the portion of the believer, that the Son of man should be known to be a divine Person after being lifted up, and that He should be the gathering Centre for all in spite of such an ignominious death. "But this he said signifying by what death he was about to die" (chapter 12:33), in this instance, His personal attractiveness comes before us.
C.A.M. The immensity of the accruing glory seems to be set against the ignominy.
J.T. Quite so; it is a complete triumph over the malice of man and Satan.
J.S. And while He is presented from the divine side, in this gospel, it is as Son of man, on our side, that He is lifted up. What is the significance of that?
J.T. What is in view is the universal bearing of the act. It would not be limited to the Jews, but
{49}
as lifted up He would be the Centre for all: "I will draw all to me", (chapter 12:33).
A.P. Does the "must" in @John 3 refer to what God sees is necessary?
J.T. Yes; in order to carry out His thoughts; that is, the people had come very near to Canaan, but they proved themselves unfit to go in, and thus the serpent had to be lifted up: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up". The state of man had been exposed and was such that it prevented him from entering into the purpose of God. The "must" was a moral necessity if eternal life is to be available to men.
A.F.M. Life is clearly in another Man; not in man after the flesh, therefore, the Son of man must be lifted up.
C.N. Would you connect the lifting up on the cross with the ignominy that was represented in the serpent?
J.T. That is the allusion: "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up". The state of man comes to light in that way. They spake against God and against Moses. You can hardly conceive of any more terrible state than that, speaking against God and against Moses; that is, against God and against Christ. How *could* they come into Canaan? If heaven were filled with such men it would cease to be heaven! Hence they cannot go in, and the Son of man must be lifted up to bring that vile state to an end. "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh", (@Romans 8:3).
J.S. The sin of man must be dealt with if men are to be blessed, and it could only be dealt with in Christ's death.
J.T. Yes; in that ignominious way. "The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is
{50}
crucified to me, and I to the world", (@Galatians 6:14). It is Paul accepting that the crucifixion is *his* due -- not only death, but crucifixion, the most horrible and ignominious death possible. It expressed man's hatred of God and Christ, but God conveyed in it *His judgment of man*. It is due to us on account of the terrible condition that was manifest when "the people spoke against God and against Moses", (@Numbers 21:5).
J.S. So that the public shame of the cross is ours.
J.T. That is the idea, and faith accepts it, as you see in Paul. He says, "I am crucified with Christ", (@Galatians 2:20). It is due to you and to me. The more we get on in the truth, the more we accept the ignominy of it. It was deserved -- not only death, but that *kind* of death.
A.F.M. This expression in verse 14 would go beyond the general teaching of John's gospel. The serpent Moses made and lifted up was of *brass*, typifying Christ bearing the judgment of God.
W.G.T. Verse 13 would suggest that only the Lord could be in heaven by personal right, and verse 14 would show that we cannot enter, save through His death.
J.T. If you connect this scripture with what the Lord alludes to in the Old Testament, you will see how morally impossible it was that man as in the flesh could have life eternal; that is, go into Canaan. "The Son of man who is in heaven" would have to remain there alone unless He came down and submitted to all this; so the ignominy of the cross attaches to us, as speaking against God and against Moses.
J.S. "Flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom", (@1 Corinthians 15:50).
A.R. So it is not only sin in itself that is dealt with, but also the man that sinned.
J.T. Yes; our old man is crucified with Christ,
{51}
(@Romans 6:6). If we are to be in the land of Canaan we must be thus dealt with and accept the crucifixion as our due. That is how terribly bad we are, and very few of us admit it. The five kings taken at Makkedah, as representing this solemn side of the truth, were hanged on five trees; (@Joshua 10).
Rem. Man in nature must be entirely removed.
J.T. In sinful nature; man's utter incorrigibleness is proved beyond doubt in that after all the grace shown to Israel, they spoke against God and against Christ -- "He that hates me hates also my Father", the Lord says; (@John 15:23).
A.F.M. "Our soul loathes this light bread" (@Numbers 21:5), would further prove what has been said.
J.T. Quite so; thus He must be lifted up, vicariously. It refers to our state. He must be lifted up, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
F.H.L. Do you link the thought of the curse with this?
J.T. Yes; He became "a curse for us (for it is written, Cursed is every one hanged upon a tree)", (@Galatians 3:13). That is the principle. The Canaanitish kings were hanged on trees, as already remarked; it says, "Cursed be Canaan", (@Genesis 9:25). The curse was on *Canaan*, not on Ham; that is, that land should be thus cleared of that kind of man. It applies to man as such. Hence while man in hatred crucified Christ, God in this act expressed *His* judgment of man; so that in a sense *we* are crucified. Paul says, "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me", (@Galatians 2:20).
Ques. He accepted that his own state had been dealt with?
J.T. Yes; so that Christ is, in personal right, the only One fit for Canaan. We come in through Him, His death having met God's judgment of our sins and our state.
{52}
A.P.T. "For I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified", (@1 Corinthians 2:2).
J.T. That exactly states the truth in this respect; 1 Corinthians is based pretty much on that statement.
A.B.P. Does this connect with Luke where the thief says, "we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this man has done nothing amiss", (@Luke 23:41)?
J.T. It does in that way. If we keep in mind what John has before him in relation to the indignities heaped on Christ and the ignominious character of His sufferings, we shall see what is meant. Personally, He was immune. He could have got out of the way of any attack if necessary. We are told in chapter 8 that He hid Himself. The Jews could not have taken Him had He wished to avoid them; so that His greatness is apparent. In the garden, when He said to them, "I am he", they went backward and fell to the ground; (chapter 18:6).
Applied ordinarily, it suggests that if one is distinguished of God, the same kind of opposition will appear. How are we to humble him? We must bring him down. That was the tenor of the spirit that was opposed to Christ all through John -- to humiliate Him at all costs. So you see with Pilate, at first he had no animosity towards Christ, but when the time came, he was forced into the strong current of opposition to Him, for he scourged Him and brought Him out to the Jews in derision, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and said to them, "Behold the man!"
J.S. Pilate was caught in the current of Satan, whose design was to humble the Lord.
J.T. That is the thought; using men to this end, for Pilate scourged Him, and the soldiers in mockery "having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head, and put a purple robe on him ... and said, Hail,
{53}
king of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face". The murderous answer of the chief priests and the officers to Pilate's presentation of Him was, "Crucify, crucify him". All this shows the strong current of ignominious persecution which flowed under the devil's influence to humiliate Christ.
C.A.M. Whatever position Christ was in, He was always unique and great!
A.N.W. The statement in @John 3:16, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son", is an offset to the lifting up of the Son of man in verse 14.
Ques. Does not the teaching in the early part of chapter 3 show that if the moral state of man is affected, he would come into the new sphere that God would establish?
J.T. If Nicodemus understood those statements, "It is needful that *ye* should be born anew", (verse 7) and "thus must the Son of man be lifted up" (verse 14), it would mean that he would recognise that he deserved nothing better than crucifixion himself.
A.F.M. I would like to ask where these thoughts regarding the sufferings of Christ lead us. I am not quite clear as to the further object of the sufferings recorded in John.
J.T. As applied to the saints generally, it is the personal distinction that attaches to those in the ministry. The enemy will do all he can to humiliate them, which, of course, they should accept, and God will bring glory out of it. That is a point in John. The saints are great relatively as Jesus is. The one hundred and fifty-three great fishes in chapter 21:11 allude to this. The Philistines envied Isaac as he became great. Isaac said to them, "ye hate me", (@Genesis 26:27).
Ques. Why do you get the manifestation of grace so much more in John's gospel than in the other gospels?
{54}
J.T. It is more love than grace in this gospel, "God so loved" is what comes out. The great Person given is the testimony to the love of God. Luke is the great grace gospel.
Ques.. In @John 1:17, we have, "grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ". Why do we get that in the gospel of John rather than in Luke?
J.T. "Grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ". That is essential as making way for the display of love. It shows the greatness and effectiveness of what was in Christ as compared with what came out through Moses. But the point in John's gospel in this respect is the love of God as attested in the gift of the only-begotten Son.
Rem. In @John 4 you get the incident of the woman at Sychar's well.
J.T. Of course, grace is in that, but there is more than grace; "If thou knewest the *gift of God*", (chapter 4:10), which refers to God's love.
W.B-w. The brazen serpent is one aspect typically of the death of Christ. How does the crossing of the Jordan fit in as a type with this?
J.T. It is the end of human life in flesh and blood, and our death and resurrection with Christ there; death as the judgment of God was against us, but it is cut off and out of sight. In this sense death is viewed as an enemy of the people of God. "The last enemy that is annulled is death", (@1 Corinthians 15:26). Judgment is typified in the brazen serpent, which is *more* than death, as we have noted.
W.B-w. Is it our side in the brazen serpent, and then going through into the land by way of Jordan?
J.T. *Going through* is as on dry land, no water in sight -- cut off by the power of God, as in Christ's resurrection. All human life as in flesh and blood comes to an end at the Jordan; the twelve stones were taken out of the bed of the river where the feet
{55}
of the priests that bore the ark stood. That is, we are risen with Christ as having been buried with Him in baptism; we are risen with Him in His life, the life belonging to Canaan. Then there is circumcision; that is, all of the flesh that might attach to you in the new place is dealt with *in toto*; but Jordan is the end of all human life, as in flesh and blood.
W.B-w. Why had the Jordan to be rolled back if there was no evil there?
J.T. To let the people in. It typifies the power of death standing in the way of the purpose of God, as hindering us from going into the land.
J.S. The Lord dealing with death itself at the Jordan.
J.T. Yes; with the thing itself, the last enemy that is annulled is death. Death is viewed as an enemy there.
J.T.Jr. The brazen serpent rather contemplates our further movements in the wilderness.
J.T. Yes; but the Jordan is the counterpart of it. We are viewed now as having eternal life by faith, and therefore going into the scene where it belongs; but death -- literal death -- is in our way, and it is for us to see that God has dealt with that in the death and resurrection of Christ; so there is nothing to hinder us now from going in.
G.McP. Would the Spirit of God in @John 4 be the answer to the sufferings of Christ in chapter 3?
J.T. Just so; the Spirit moves us to come into eternal life -- "springing up into eternal life", (verse 14).
But the subject we are now considering is the sufferings of Christ -- the ignominious character of those sufferings.
F.H.L. Might I ask whether the betrayal by Judas did not have a peculiar place in the sufferings? In Matthew and Mark, it says, he covered Him with kisses; whereas, Luke barely refers to this; and John does not refer to Judas's kiss at all.
{56}
J.T. Judas is exposed in John as early as chapter 6. This sort of man must be exposed in the presence of all the light that is shining. He is tolerated, but he is exposed and called a devil -- "and of you one is a devil", (verse 70). Any allusion to Judas after that is what you might expect, but in the synoptic gospels, his state is not exposed till the end. John would show that Judas caused extended humiliation and sorrow to our Lord. It is not simply that he had a demon, he was a devil -- *diabolos*.
C.A.M. That is instructive because the kind of man that has to be brought to an end is exposed at the beginning of John's gospel.
J.T. Man is not on trial in John's gospel; he is exposed at the very beginning of it, and God comes in through the brazen serpent, so that we might have everlasting life. Therefore a man like Judas cannot escape in John because the light is shining. "He that practises the truth", the Lord said, "comes to the light", (chapter 3:21). Judas did not do this. John says, "he was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was put into it", (chapter 12:6).
J.S. It is helpful to see that the Jew, the religious man, was in opposition to Christ from the outset.
J.T. You get far more opposition spoken of in John; there is nothing mentioned about stoning in the synoptic gospels; whereas, in this gospel, twice at least they took up stones to stone the Lord. It was personal opposition to the great Person who had come in. The three references to His being lifted up and many other references, show that the enemy would humiliate the Person, and in like manner he humiliates the saints. God virtually says, If you will humiliate my people, I will bring glory out of it. In the first instance, as to Christ being uplifted, God brings in everlasting life; in the next uplifting, the great truth of the Lord's Person is in view; and in the third, He is the great Centre of gathering for
{57}
everyone. So that it is victory after victory, and the overwhelming of the enemy and his power in his attempt to humiliate God's Son.
C.A.M. The amazing thing is that such a Person should come into such a position at all. Our eyes are focussed on His greatness from the beginning.
J.T. Why should He be in such positions? He could extricate Himself from them at any time. He "hid himself", it is said, and He could do so at any time.
N.McC. How does the *assembly* come in as a sufferer? Is it worked out individually?
J.T. Yes. It says, Saul persecuted the assembly; he did it himself by shutting up in prisons many of the saints and giving his vote when they were put to death. No doubt attacks were made on the saints as together also. Later the Lord says to Smyrna, "Behold, the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life", (@Revelation 2:10). That is what Satan did, and we need not expect to escape. There is, perhaps, no persecution today, in a corporeal sense, but it is there, nevertheless. Those who "live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted", (@2 Timothy 3:12). Some doubtless would rather suffer physically than spiritually; but where the spirit of Christ is manifest, persecution will surely appear.
N.McC. Those who do suffer for Christ's sake and for the testimony should regard it as a privilege.
J.T. Quite so; I think the apostle Paul had in his mind that suffering in this sense is necessary to bring the assembly into accord with Christ. As you read the list of his sufferings, which is given in @2 Corinthians 11, you marvel at it; the list was written comparatively early and does not include
{58}
more than a small portion of the sufferings he endured.
A.P. Does not the expression, "the Lamb's wife", infer that she suffers similarly to the Lamb?
J.T. It does.
A.F.M. How do you think Paul was enabled to suffer so much? He was just human like ourselves.
J.T. The Lord had constituted him for it; not that he did not *feel* everything. He was not superhuman, so that it was real human suffering in every case of testing, but in the suffering God helped him. We should be encouraged in seeing that the help he had is available to us. "When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee", (@Isaiah 43:2).
A.R. The constant persecution of the Lord came from the Jews. Does it not show that they saw something different from any other man in Him?
J.T. That is right. They said, "How knows this man letters, having never learned?" (@John 7:15). Where does He come from, they ask, and Who is He? They did not like the superiority that was there. "Never man spoke thus, as this man speaks" (@John 7:46), said the officers to the Pharisees and chief priests. But the Pharisees said, "Are ye also deceived?" (verse 47). They could not bear His superiority and the testimony that went with it.
H.E. Do you not find the same superiority in the case of the blind man, in @John 9?
J.T. Exactly; how visibly he rose, and rose as superior to the Pharisees! They said, "and thou teachest us?" and they cast him out.
J.S. I suppose the apostle Paul saw the need of the governmental side in connection with his suffering. He had caused many to suffer.
J.T. Yes; the Lord says, "I will show to him how much he must suffer for my name", (@Acts 9:16). In John's gospel there were certain ones standing by the cross of Jesus. That is John's beautiful way of
{59}
calling attention to the true followers of Christ, and he is the only one who accredits them with so doing.
J.S. Are they witnessing His sufferings sympathetically?
J.T. Yes; Paul says of Onesiphorus, "he has often refreshed me, and has not been ashamed of my chain", (@2 Timothy 1:16). Those whom John speaks of were not ashamed or afraid to be there, but faced the danger of it.
W.B-w. They were not ashamed of the cross.
J.T. No; it was "the cross of Jesus". There was no jeering of the thieves on the part of the Jews, as far as we know; the jeering would be hurled at Jesus, who, as on the cross was in this ignominious position, and these women were identified with it.
A.N.W. This feminine feature at the cross is encouraging to sisters who are open to have part in suffering as much as the brothers.
J.T. That is what is seen in the verses read; it says, "by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala". You could hardly get a more beautiful and touching picture than this group of sisters standing by the cross of Jesus.
A.F.M. Why is the mother of Jesus mentioned, and then the sister of His mother?
J.T. I think it shows that they had overcome what is natural. Mere natural affection would not stand in a place of such reproach. @John 9:18 - 23 and many other scriptures prove this.
C.A.M. John himself was there.
J.T. The Lord sees them there, which is another thing. It says, "Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son", (chapter 19:26); showing, as in keeping with this gospel, that He was always superior and could direct things. He could
{60}
give directions as superior to the sufferings. That is always important. However severe the persecution, we are to be superior, so that divine things are looked after; they cannot be let go. When Paul was in prison, he might have said, I can do nothing now; I am in prison; others must look after things. But he was constantly engaged in ministering to the saints. That is the principle seen in Paul, and depicts the greatness of the believer as corresponding with Christ in persecution.
A.F.M. The Lord left John a fine legacy, would you say, in giving him His mother as his own mother?
J.T. Yes; and we should notice how as superior to His sufferings, He was able to direct these things. That is what you get throughout this account in John. It is His superiority to the ignominious sufferings that were heaped upon Him. When smitten by an officer in the presence of the high priest, the Lord would regulate the man by the principle governing such a position; (@John 18:22,23).
We must not be diverted by pressure, on account of our ordinary duty, from doing what is needed to be done in the testimony. We are apt to neglect the Lord's interests for the sake of business. A brother says, I have to work tonight, or, I must attend night-school, or, I am too tired to go out, and so his responsibility as to the things of God is shelved; but you see in the Lord's movements here that in the greatest stress of circumstances the things of the testimony were looked after. So He says to the officer in the presence of the high priest, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?" (@John 18:23); they smite the Judge of Israel on the cheek, but is the Judge of Israel going to be silent? No, when judgment had fallen to the ground, He sets out judgment, and lifts it up again in the presence of him who should have maintained it. All through these chapters, the Lord is
{61}
in complete control, and the testimony is maintained.
Ques. The women standing at the cross are sympathetic. What would they represent today?
J.T. The saints standing by in relation to the reproach of Christ. The words, "bearing his reproach" (@Hebrews 13:13), refers to His cross, which He bore, for He went out bearing His cross.
A.P. Would you say there might be the suggestion of defencelessness with them in the presence of such a large mob?
J.T. Outwardly there was no one to defend them, but though defenceless, they stood there, nevertheless, and nothing happened to them, as far as the record shows, for the Lord was in charge and not man.
A.P. The people of God in their fewness are defenceless, and hence this service of the Lord on their behalf is very precious.
A.R. On the cross, the Lord carried out every detail right to the end. "After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished ... says, I thirst", (@John 19:28). His mind was perfectly clear right on to the end.
J.T. When all was done He said, "It is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his spirit". In John, He does not expire as in Mark and Luke, but delivers up His spirit; that is not properly dying; expiring is that your breath leaves your body, you having no control over it. The Lord is also said to have expired, meaning just that He died. But in John, He delivered up His spirit; He gave it up of Himself, as an act of power.
A.F.M. After all this is finished, John is there to render his testimony with regard to what the Lord could not do or arrange, having died; he renders the very important testimony that the soldier pierced the side of Christ, and blood and water came from it.
J.T. It confirms what we are saying. Things are attended to in John, and nothing is left undone.
{62}
You would be sure that if a divine Person came into manhood, He would do every needful thing; when the Lord delivered up His spirit, John was there, and he saw what happened afterwards. He bore witness, and his witness is true; what he said about the blood and the water is true. And then we have the characteristic statement, "that the scripture might be fulfilled".
W.G.T. The Lord put the obligation upon John to care for His mother. He did not ask John if he wanted to do it.
J.T. The Lord gave His mother to John to be his mother; and, of course, that carried certain obligations with it.
A.P.T. Referring to Paul's sufferings in @2 Corinthians 11:28, I was thinking about your remarks as to obligations. It says, "Besides those things that are without, the crowd of cares pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies". He had the care of all the assemblies. Does that fit in with what you have in mind? Paul was a day and a night in the deep, but he did not overlook his obligation to the assembly even then.
J.T. Quite so. The assembly must not be overlooked. John shows the greatness of the persons in the testimony; they are great in *every* sense, and so will not be neglectful; but it is to be feared that with many the things of God are secondary.
C.A.M. We must not be victims of circumstances; that would not be in keeping with the greatness of the persons.
J.S. Is not the greatness of the Person of Christ seen in this last act in giving up His spirit?
J.T. It is a divine Person coming into evidence. He *delivers* it up. No creature could do that. This act is typified, I think, in Moses and Aaron, who both *went up* to die; that is, they did not die of weakness.
C.A.M. The Lord was not between the two
{63}
thieves, in @John 19:18; it is "two *others* ... and Jesus in the middle". He was the central Object on which every eye was focussed.
H.E. Do you think the *overcomer* is emphasised in Revelation?
J.T. Yes. The overcomer is never a victim of circumstances. John is an overcomer, but he is thinking about the saints. In @Revelation 1:9 we read: "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus".
A.P. Paul's last words to the elders of Ephesus show how he corresponded with the Lord in caring for the saints, as seen in John: "Wherefore, watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I ceased not admonishing each one of you with tears", (@Acts 20:31). Suffering went along with it.
J.T. The most remarkable thing is that the caring for the testimony enters into the Lord's position on the cross, as we have been seeing.
C.A.M. With all that was transpiring at that moment, time is permitted for everything needed.
J.T. I think it is a word to us, because there is a great deal of negligence among us. Not that one would accuse anyone, but call attention to the fact. There is a solemn word in @Jeremiah 48:10, which says, "Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently".
R.A.L. Which is the greater -- to suffer *with* Him or to suffer *for* Him?
J.T. I think suffering with Him is a more elevated thought. Every Christian suffers for the Lord in some sense; but suffering with Him is the greater thing -- the fellowship of His sufferings. You are brought into a bond in suffering with Christ and with the brethren.
{64}
A.P.T. Does Nicodemus suggest anything on the line of coming into the suffering?
J.T. Yes; and Joseph of Arimathaea. John alone mentions Nicodemus. He would teach us to include in our thoughts every item of the work of God. John mentions Nicodemus three times, in chapters 3, 7, and 19.
W.F.K. It says, "And I, if I be lifted up ... will draw all to me". These women and the thief on the cross are amongst those drawn.
J.T. Yes, that is the idea; they are held there.
Ques. You said Peter would glorify God in the kind of death he would die; I was wondering why he, being instructed to follow the Lord, immediately fails.
J.T. To show the untrustworthiness of the flesh, even in those most distinguished in the Lord's service. But then, the Lord said that he would glorify God in his death, which he did, so that he finished well. In @1 Peter 5:1 he says, "The elders which are among you I exhort, who am their fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ". He does not say that he is a *partaker* of them; not that he was not, but I think there is delicacy in his saying he was just a witness. In exhorting the elders, he refers to the sufferings of Christ; this would confirm what has been said as to the Lord looking after things even as on the cross. But Peter says, "who also am partaker of the glory". Partaking of the glory should deeply encourage us to be elders -- to care for the flock.
A.F.M. How, according to John, do we acquire this dignity of which you have spoken?
J.T. The work of God is seen in those who receive Christ. "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God", (@John 1:12). You are taught at the very outset to take up a right -- involving family dignity -- to be one of the
{65}
children of God. That is the ground you take. Underneath all that is your birth, you are born of God, that indicates your parentage; there is no family on earth that has such a lineage as the children of God -- who are born, not of the will of man, but of God. That is at the beginning of John's gospel; it teaches you how to take a place of dignity. Then at the end of the gospel the Lord recognises us as His brethren. "But go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", (chapter 20:17). Hence the unique dignity that attaches to us.
A.F.M. That is very helpful, and should encourage us to respond to the dignity conferred upon us.
C.A.M. What impresses one in connection with the present ministry is that the Lord would have us apprehend the family setting as seen in the gospel of John.
J.S. The hymn by J.N.D. expresses it well: 
<blockquote>"And now, as sons before Thy face, With joyful steps the path we tread!" (`87:2)</blockquote>
A.R. I suppose the dignity you are speaking of would work out in the way things are done in our localities; they are not left undone. The Lord *finished*. Sometimes it is far otherwise with us.
J.T. Just so; the finishing of things is a great point, so that things are done, and done well. The Lord said, "I have *completed* the work which thou gayest me that I should do it", (@John 17:4).
W.B-w. Does Peter glorifying God in his death refer to Jordan?
J.T. It is the *kind* of death. "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire". The Lord is not referring to what he would do immediately, but to what he would do when he became *old*. When the brethren get older
{66}
they should be wiser, and more like Christ. Normally, experience makes us more resigned to the will of God. I think Peter represents the ministers: It is, "First ... Peter", (@Matthew 10:2); he is the leading man in the ministry, and he portrays the failures which brothers that are ministering are liable to.
C.A.M. The assembly will not appear in incompleteness at the end. What is given to the saints today is not haphazard; it has the perfecting of the saints in view.
J.T. That is one of the points of this meeting -- to call attention to the obligation resting upon everyone; so that what we do should be marked by completeness, and no appearance of loose ends.
{67}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (4)
@Acts 4:1 - 3; @Acts 12:1 - 17; @Acts 7:54 - 60; @Acts 8:1 - 3
J.T. The sufferings of Christ as worked out in the first days of the assembly's history, in relation to the twelve *apostles*, would, I thought, be instructive for our consideration at this time. What is seen in this respect in the Acts may be profitably connected with the heavenly city in @Revelation 21, where the twelve foundations of the wall were adorned with every precious stone. Paul alludes to such sufferings as the sufferings of Christ; he says, "even as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us", (@2 Corinthians 1:5); they may therefore be regarded as characteristic.
We may look at the sufferings of the apostles from the beginning of Acts, extending on to chapter 12. Later we may have opportunity to consider the sufferings begun in Stephen, who introduces the *heavenly* thought as seen in the expression of his countenance. It drew forth the most bitter opposition; for when he said that he saw the heavens opened and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, they stopped their ears! Saul, who was present at Stephen's martyrdom, took the lead in the persecution, ravaging the assembly; so that the assembly itself is formally seen as suffering in the most excruciating way. Saul went into the saints houses one after another and dragged them before tribunals. The attack is now on the assembly.
Another thing that is instructive is the kind of persons that were employed by the devil in these persecutions. Firstly, we have the Sadducees, who were fitted for such opposition as was designed to set aside, if possible, the truth of resurrection; for as a sect they did not believe in the resurrection. Satan thus secures instrumentalities suitable for his purposes. {68}
Then in chapter 12 we have in Herod a second feature of the persecution; he represents the *political* side of it -- a man having no conscience. Such persecute, not because they hate the saints, but in order to serve their own ends. Then, thirdly, those who attacked Stephen; they are more general in character. They are of the *synagogue*, and are inclusive of many from distant lands. It is a purely religious opposition and becomes notorious in its able champion -- that very religious man, Saul. He was an out-and-out religious man, and in his zeal he carried on a bitter persecution against the assembly as *such* -- to exterminate, if possible, that which was dearest to the heart of Christ. If the persecution, under these three heads, is kept in mind we may be helped in the subject before us.
F.I. Do I understand by your reference to the precious stones in the foundations, that they represent the sufferings of Christ in the apostles?
J.T. Yes. That which @Revelation 21:9, etc., contemplates is the Pentecostal assembly; the names of the twelve apostles are on the twelve foundations; the twelve are called the apostles of the Lamb -- the *suffering* One. Paul is not in view here. It appears that there is some link between the precious stones, viewed symbolically, and suffering. Precious stones are, no doubt, the product of heat, pressure, and other such influences.
J.S. I suppose the Acts would show us just what pressure and suffering the apostles were subjected to so as to form the foundation, and thus become spiritually able to support that which rests upon it?
J.T. Yes. In their great sufferings, they were formed and refined, and made in every way capable of withstanding pressure.
C.A.M. It says that their names are on the
{69}
foundations. Would "names" here suggest some renown?
J.T. I suppose each of them represents something distinctive. Whilst, of the twelve, Peter and John shine most in the Acts, *all*, speaking generally, are in view, and each of them had his particular distinction. Peter, James, and John received special names from Christ, but no doubt a similar honour marked all the apostles, each representing some phase of Christ worked out in apostolic service.
A.N.W. Why is it the foundation of the *wall*?
J.T. I suppose it corresponds with what goes through the time of Christ's rejection; the wall denoting fellowship and protection; so that what was of God was protected against all evil power.
A.F.M. Do you think in the chapters we have read, the apostles proved the qualifications for suffering which they had acquired as with the Lord?
J.T. Yes, they had seen how He suffered. Peter said he was a witness of the sufferings of Christ. We learn things by witnessing them. The Lord said they had continued with Him in His temptations He was Leader in sufferings as in all else.
J.S. Would you say the defensive features of the testimony are seen in the wall?
J.T. Yes, the power to stand collectively against the greatest opposition. The early converts continued in the apostles fellowship. There was protection for what was of God there.
A.N.W. Will you explain further what you mean by regarding the assembly in Revelation as the Pentecostal assembly?
J.T. I use that expression to distinguish it from Paul's assembly -- the assembly that he speaks of, the foundation of which he laid amongst the Gentiles. The foundations of the Pentecostal assembly were laid in Jerusalem; Satan hated it and attacked it, as seen in @Acts 8. The linking of the twelve apostles
{70}
of the *Lamb* with the city is significant because the Lamb is the sufferer.
A.F.M. What part would you say Paul would have that is foundational in the city in @Revelation 21? In @Ephesians 2:20 we read: "being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the cornerstone".
J.T. No doubt he is included there, for the assembly in Ephesians contemplates his work indeed, he gives character to it. But @Revelation 21 presents the assembly founded by the twelve apostles and the early part of the Acts shows how they suffered. Paul's work would be seen in what is inward, what is for God and for Christ. Revelation does not present this aspect of the assembly. Here it comes down from God out of heaven. Paul had placed it there, as it were.
F.H.L. Does Stephen fit in anywhere with what you are saying?
J.T. I think not; he is more one of the people, one of the saints developing -- purchasing to himself a good degree, and is persecuted because of what he is personally. Those of the synagogue could not resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke as they contended with him. Then his face was as the face of an angel to all who sat in the council. But when he speaks about Christ in heaven, they stop their ears. He represents, therefore, what is available to any of us. No one can hope to be apostolic today, but Stephen is a beautiful example for any saint -- what one may acquire for oneself by faithfulness -- a good degree; and that leads on to the persecution of the assembly, as we see in chapter 8. Nothing is said about the official side; that is dealt with in these other scriptures. It is the generality of the saints as the assembly in Jerusalem that Satan is aiming at here. I think it is helpful to differentiate in that way; firstly, suffering being endured by the
{71}
apostles of the Lamb and then by those developed by the Spirit. These may appear at any time in the history of the assembly, as devotedness, intelligence, and faithfulness in any one will bring in suffering. "And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted", (@2 Timothy 3:12).
F.H.L. In Philippians, does not the apostle refer to suffering as a gift?
J.T. Yes; "to you has been *given*, as regards Christ, ... the suffering for him", (@Philippians 1:29).
A.P. Would not Paul's side be seen in the earlier part of chapter 21, as connected with what is eternal?
J.T. You cannot leave him out; the fact that he is not mentioned does not mean that he is not there. It is only a question of seeing the link with what is primarily introduced by the twelve apostles; that is, it is a perfect thing in itself. It might be said, Why should there be a Paul, or a Barnabas? Did the others fail? The Lord would not have that said, so He shows that the testimony of the twelve is perfect. It is what was presented in testimony at Jerusalem. Like its Head it suffered and like Him it goes to heaven and comes out all-glorious. It is the *Lamb's* wife.
C.A.M. Perhaps the idea of the foundation helps in that there was a vast deal of initial work and suffering in connection with the city, was there not?
J.T. Yes; there was also the interior work of which we read nothing in Revelation as to who did it. From the epistles we can understand it was Paul's work; then the twelve gates respectively were "of one pearl"; these would be Paul's work also.
F.I. With regard to Stephen, does the extent of his sufferings correspond with the state that was in him as being filled with the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so; it is a question of paying tribute to what a man attains to as full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and therefore it is available to any one of us.
{72}
F.I. That would depend on ourselves. Some of us may think we do not have much suffering, is that because we do not come under the hand of the Spirit?
J.T. Just so; I think it is a tribute to the Spirit's making way for later things. The Lord said to the twelve that they should bear witness of Him as having been with Him from the beginning; also that the Holy Spirit would come forth from the Father and that *He* would bear testimony of Him too. That witness to Him would be in such persons as Stephen, Philip, and Paul. It is the Spirit's side of the service; but the Lord would show in relation to the early assembly that the twelve were perfect in their work as seen in the foundation of the city.
J.S. What have you in mind when you say the Lord would protect His early workmen, such as are seen in the twelve?
J.T. We might assume that such men as Stephen, Philip, and Paul had to be brought in because the others were remiss. It may appear so in a certain way, but I do not think the Lord would allow us to so speak of them. We have to go by their work, as seen in the twelve foundations, each has a precious stone and each stone has an apostle's name; the *twelve* are there.
J.S. Would the formation of precious stones be the result of intense heat?
J.T. It would seem so from what is known from their formation. I apprehend they are the product of some internal pressure, involving heat and other powerful influences. Of course, there are pearls. That is another matter; these form the gates. Precious stones, because of their formation and quality, afford God a language which, as part of His vocabulary, is intended for our instruction.
A.R. In the gates, the twelve pearls were alike; but in the twelve foundations, each stone is different.
J.T. I think it supports what we were saying, that
{73}
each of the apostles had his own suffering; as giving character to his own experience, with a view to his divinely designed place. They may have suffered together, but each had his own peculiar experience.
C.A.M. There is a remarkable thing about these stones, that while they are formed in the earth, their distinctive glories are only known after they are brought into the light.
J.T. Just so; that helps too; the light brings out the beauties. The fact that they are in the breastplate and in the heavenly city confirms what we are saying.
A.P.T. Would Matthias be included in the foundations?
J.T. Yes; there were twelve apostles, and he was one of them.
R.W.S. Is it to their credit that they remained in Jerusalem and were not scattered, in connection with Stephen's persecution?
J.T. I should think so; they may have been governed by metropolitan motives, which hindered later; but at any rate they stood their ground; the attack was at Jerusalem. Had they left definitely, the special testimony at Jerusalem might have ended, and this would be according to the righteous judgment of God because of the death of Stephen and the terrible persecution that ensued; but the great long-suffering of God is seen in the continuance of the testimony there.
J.S. Does chapter 12 show us that Satan would make bold to attack the twelve through Herod?
J.T. Well, the apostles are now identified with the assembly. "At that time Herod the king laid his hands on some of those of the assembly to do them hurt". They are identified with the assembly and he would do them hurt; it says that he "slew James, the brother of John, with the sword". Herod represents the political element,
{74}
which has played such a part in the persecution of the assembly. Here he pleased the Jews; just as a political leader will do to gain favour with the people. This policy is largely seen in persecution recorded in the history of the assembly. I believe this section points not only to what was imminent then, but is prophetic as showing how the principle of suffering has come down, involving the limitation of the ministry.
James represents the ministry; but Peter does especially, and I think what we see in his release from prison is the release of the ministry in and subsequent to the Reformation. Peter, I think, has a great place prophetically in the history of the assembly, representing not what is official, but being the leading apostle -- "first ... Peter" -- what would represent the ministry. Satan would destroy or control it.
A.P. Do you think Peter's imprisonment was governmental on account of the state of the people?
J.T. The assembly was waning. That has to be noticed -- they prayed for Peter's release, but then when it came they were not prepared for it. It was a humbling thing; but it affords a prophetic view of the history of the ministry in the assembly.
A.F.M. Going back to the end of chapter 4, I would like to ask what is the character of suffering which the apostles endured in that chapter?
J.T. The aim of the Sadducees there was not so much against the apostles as such, but because of their teaching the people. The Sadducees hated the idea of the resurrection, and of course, the resurrection is fundamental; without Christ risen we have no foundation. This is what Peter and the apostles taught and preached, and the Sadducees would get rid of that at all costs. This first attack is to get rid of the resurrection and the consequent suffering for
{75}
the witnesses of it. We shall come into suffering if we hold to another Man; Christ, in resurrection.
W.G.T. Do the Sadducees represent modernistic teaching?
J.T. Yes, they were materialists -- they did not believe in the resurrection, angel, or spirit. We have to meet that today.
J.S. They leave out the power of God entirely.
A.P. Would you say that the intensity of suffering is measured by the importance of the testimony; and the resurrection was a very important part of the truth to be maintained?
J.T. We should have no foundation or wall without it. What is before us now is the testimony of the twelve and the suffering it entailed. Their testimony was foundational. That is quite obvious, and what they particularly stressed was the resurrection, that is the triumph of God; the evidence of His power.
A.P. A great lie of Satan had preceded this testimony, in the end of Matthew.
J.T. Quite so; which shows how important a matter this is. The apostle Peter stated in @Acts 5 that they were witnesses of Christ's resurrection and exaltation.
R.W.S. The Sadducees did not believe in what they could not see. Because they could not see the resurrection with the naked eye, or an angel, or a spirit, they would not believe.
J.T. Whereas Christians are blessed as those that have *not* seen, yet have believed. That is how we reach the foundation, and it is a most important thing with us today to have our feet on solid ground and be there as suffering for it.
A.R.S. Why is Satan allowed to break the ranks by killing James?
J.T. We must assume that the time was fixed, and his testimony was finished. I think we can learn
{76}
from the Lord's remarks to Peter that the apostles had each a fixed period to remain here. Later the Lord says, "Behold, the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days", (@Revelation 2:10). No doubt James's testimony was over. The Lord would not have allowed him to be killed otherwise; but He needed Peter further. The Lord determines everything; He lets loose the enemy as He sees it necessary.
A.N.W. Herod was just a tool in Satan's hand for the moment.
W.B-w. Then as to John, do we get a prophetic view also -- in him we have the suffering in patience?
J.T. Yes. The Lord had said, "but if I will that he abide until I come", (@John 21:23). He is our "brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus", (@Revelation 1:9).
A.F.M. Both James and John drank of the Lord's cup.
J.T. That confirms what we are saying. The Lord had promised James and John that they should drink His cup -- "Ye shall drink indeed my cup", (@Matthew 20:23). So James drinks it here.
W.G.T. It would seem that Herod had it in mind to give a spectacular death to Peter.
J.T. He intended to buy the Jews favour with him. That is characteristic of a politician. He does things to gain favour with the people. Note, he purposed to bring Peter out to the people after the passover; that is, he would respect their religious scruples.
R.D.G. Did not Pilate do the same thing in the case of the Lord Jesus, and Felix in the case of Paul? Pilate released Barabbas, and Felix kept Paul bound for Festus.
J.T. All to please the Jews. The Spirit thus exposes the politician.
A.F.M. Do not Pilate and Herod reap a very
{77}
sad harvest? In the case of Herod we see that when God is pleased to bring in judgment, He does it in a most humiliating way.
J.S. It is helpful to see the character of any opposition and the suffering accompanying it.
J.T. I thought we might get help from it because you can gauge what you are suffering for. Herod was an Edomite; he was a false brother, a politician. We have not far to go to find that type of opposition.
J.S. He was a religious man, using the State to curb the testimony. The Jew would really be seen as a tool in the hand of political power.
J.T. That is what has marked the history of the assembly; its history included what is recorded here of Peter. Any thoughtful Christian will inquire, Why have we so much detail about Peter? Herod "slew James, the brother of John, with the sword". That is a brief statement of the death of a great apostle. The Spirit of God has not seen fit to give us any details. We have no details of the death of the other apostles; and, of course, Peter is not slain here, but we have great detail as to this imprisonment. Why should that be? Why should we have details right down to the name of the maid that listened at the door as he knocked, and many other apparently minor things? It is a question of the *ministry*. Peter is viewed as one of the assembly -- because that is the setting. He is not simply an apostle, but *one of the assembly*. He is included in the assembly, and therefore it alludes to what is history now; how the ministry, although bound for a while, is released, and in the releasing, the minister is not fully conscious. He does not know what is happening.
J.S. Why do you say ministry and not minister?
J.T. Because Peter represents that. He is the leading man in the ministry.
C.A.M. I think that is very interesting. When we
{78}
read the history of the assembly, we might be almost overcome with the amount of suffering endured, but we see here that God must have gained much in it all.
A.N.W. I think what you say throws light on the words, "unceasing prayer was made by the assembly to God concerning him".
A.F.M. The brethren in the house of Mary were not up to the answer that the Lord had given.
J.T. Showing that the decline of the assembly is in mind. After apostolic times it was most rapid, but the ministry is never lost sight of by God; it was in His mind, although seen here prophetically, as confined and sleeping -- not that one would say anything to reflect on Peter personally, but I think that one reason for his suffering here is for our instruction in the history of the assembly. You might say that Peter, sleeping in the prison, shows he was superior to the suffering, and it does, but I think it serves also to bring out the state of the ministry. He was unconscious; whereas Paul and Silas were wide awake at midnight in the prison at Philippi, singing praises to God!
A.F.M. The obstacles to Peter's release were miraculously removed; what would you say about that?
J.T. I think that it illustrates the history of the assembly; the intervention is angelic. You will notice what is said: "having delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep, purposing after the passover to bring him out to the people. Peter therefore was kept in the prison ... And lo, an angel of the Lord came there, and a light shone in the prison". Where the ministry was bound up, whether by Romanism, Lutheranism or Anglicanism, light shone in.
J.S. Chains, guards, and soldiers!
J.T. How shall the prisoner be extricated? "Lo, an angel of the Lord *came there*, and a light shone
{79}
*in the prison*". What I think is very touching is that the angel smote Peter *on the side*. Who can fail to see that there is some allusion in this action to the suffering love of Christ, whose side was smitten for us? In connection with this the light shines; it is the testimony of suffering love. It has taken centuries to work all this out, but we are getting the benefit of it now! Note the period in which all this occurred -- "the days of unleavened bread"; the time when a faithless and hence divinely abandoned religion was celebrating its feasts.
J.S. @Acts 16 would be more normal than this?
J.T. There it is *characteristic* suffering by active ministers of Christ. Peter was not suffering excessively; of course he *was* suffering, as bound with two chains, but he was able to go to sleep. Those at Philippi were awake, and able to sing praises to God. They went through the most excruciating sufferings, but they turned the prison into a temple of praise.
A.F.M. The word to Peter was, "Rise up quickly". Would that suggest the urgency of the moment?
J.T. The mind of God was that his release should be immediate. The prison was gloomy, and Peter's presence did not cause any light, for he was asleep.
C.A.M. The deliverance in @Acts 16 was another evidence of the power of God -- He intervened by an earthquake.
J.T. Quite; but the aim there was not only to deliver the servants, but to get the jailor through the gospel. It represents the normal and literal side of the sufferings of Christ's servants; very extreme, of course, in this case. But the jailor was converted. The facts of this imprisonment and release are strikingly different. There is no light in the prison; not indeed, that Peter would not have prayed before he went to sleep, but all that is left out. It says he
{80}
was sleeping between two soldiers and the light shines in the prison from, or accompanying, the angel. Active ministry, although suffering, has different features, as in Paul's imprisonment throughout.
A.P. I do not understand what is conveyed by light coming in through the angel.
J.T. It is God coming in sovereignly, but in the sense of distance; not that they had no ministry in the middle ages, but the ministry was shackled. It is God coming in Himself, and all that happened as far as Peter was concerned, was a dream. That is not ministry. We are not to minister as dreaming, we are to be awake, and in our sound mind; all this therefore, I think, applies to what is prophetic. It is not to discredit Peter, but he has to suffer in this sense so that the saints might get instruction as to this feature of assembly history.
H.E. You find here that light shone in; whereas, with the jailor, he called for lights.
J.T. His use of the plural shows how strongly the thought of light had entered his mind. Nobody calls for lights in this prison. It comes of itself, as the angel comes in from God.
W.F.K. What about the prayers of the assembly being answered?
J.T. Well, unceasing prayer was made; God heard their prayers and answered them, as He answered Zacharias's, but they did not expect the answer. That is a sorrowful thing; but it introduces Rhoda, who is an overcomer. She has "an ear to hear".
F.I. I was wondering whether prophetic ministry is the result. It had been under the influence of what was political.
J.T. That is right. Immediately after apostolic days, the ruling power began to take charge of things; for instance, Constantine presided in church
{81}
councils. Well, what could you expect of the ministers?
F.I. And the release side came in under the providential dealings of God, as we see here.
J.T. All would be lost if God did not come in sovereignly, the angel and the light shining in.
A.R.S. Was it the prayers of the saints that moved heaven to send the angel down?
J.T. No doubt; that is the way it is mentioned, but, of course, God would act of Himself too.
A.R.S. Then in the Reformation, if they had used prayer instead of calling in secular power, there would have been a different result.
J.T. Yes. I think the fact that the assembly prayed shows we are to view it from a prophetic side. Throughout the history of the assembly there were prayers somewhere. I believe there were devoted people right through that prayed to God.
A.F.M. In this instance, if the saints expected an answer to their prayers, they brought it down to the idea of Peter's angel.
J.T. Yes; they did not really believe God would answer their prayers, for his angel is not Peter, but his representative.
A.B.P. I wondered if the way the light of justification by faith came to Luther, would be an indication of the providential dealings of God?
J.T. He got light directly from God. When Luther visited Rome, as he was superstitiously ascending "Pilate's staircase", he heard a voice, crying, "The just shall live by faith". This dispelled his superstition. God speaks to us today. We cannot tell how He may have worked in men of ability throughout the middle ages. Doubtless there were devoted persons who prayed but were weak in their prayers; but God heard them and
{82}
answered them far beyond their expectation. The Reformation must have been far beyond the expectation of godly people in those days.
J.S. There is something concrete in Mary's house.
J.T. Yes; they are actually engaged in prayer, in the house of one who, no doubt, was a godly woman, the mother of Mark. It is well to keep the prophetic side in mind, so that we do not discredit these people; they have to suffer in a way so that we might have this prophetic teaching.
F.H.L. The Lord said to Peter in the garden, "dost thou sleep?" just before He was to be delivered up.
J.T. And on the mount of Transfiguration he slept, too. I do not think it is mentioned to discredit him here exactly, but for prophetic reasons; really, in one sense, it was an indication of his superiority to the suffering.
A.P. Would you say there are three periods here: the time he slept, the time he walked before he came to himself, and then the period after he became conscious and reached the house of Mary?
J.T. Yes. In sleep the ministers are not conscious of their bondage. Then when God intervenes and they actually move, they are not in a normal state; Peter did not know that what was happening was real. I believe that under these circumstances the ministers did not arrive for a long time at the sound mind of which the apostle speaks, "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise discretion", (@2 Timothy 1:7). That implies spiritual intelligence and proper balance. Well, this abnormal state continued until Peter got outside, and he got to the "one street". The angel left him, and Peter is certain that the Lord has taken him out of the hand of Herod. I think there is something in that "one street": there is some
{83}
thought of unity in that; it links up with the heavenly city.
A.F.M. He now becomes really conscious.
J.T. That is what you see. "And going forth he followed him and did not know that what was happening by means of the angel was real, but supposed he saw a vision. And having passed through a first and second guard, they came to the iron gate". How would he get through? "Which opened to them of itself"; that would be some unseen power acting. It opened of itself, "which leads into the city" -- I believe we ought to notice that, too. Why should that be mentioned? A gate leading into a city is a very common thing. It is mentioned for a prophetic purpose, that the ministry is being led into the city. The city has its own meaning in the book of Acts. Then we read, "and going forth they went down one street, and immediately the angel left him, And Peter, being come to himself, said ..". That is a fine position reached. The angel has left; the minister is now in one street of the city. He is standing on his own feet now, and he said, "Now I know certainly that the Lord has sent forth his angel and has taken me out of the hand of Herod and all the expectation of the people of the Jews. And having become clearly conscious in himself, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together and praying". He had come to the prayer meeting. This seems to me to be a clear prophetic outline of the history of the assembly with regard to those who should minister the truth.
C.A.M. What have you in mind about this city?
J.T. The city is the place of light, order, and rule. In the recognition of it ministry is carried on. The release of ministry synchronises with the recognition of Christ as Head of the assembly; He has given the
{84}
gifts which are for the work of the ministry, for the edification of His body; (@Ephesians 4:10 - 12).
J.E.H. Would you link this on with the street called Straight?
J.T. Yes.
A.R. You would not have any administration in the city if you did not have Peter -- what he represents as having the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
A.P. There is one street in the heavenly city, too. Is that your thought?
J.T. Yes; I think it means mutuality and unity. It is unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. One street in the heavenly city would mean the mutuality of dignity; that there are no streets for the rich and poor respectively.
A.P. We are all able to *walk together*.
W.G.T. The clerical idea would destroy the thought of unity.
J.T. It would. All this is significant as showing the setting of ministry; and that the minister as released knows what to do. The next thing is, Who will *listen* to it, who will know the voice of the true minister? Rhoda knew Peter's voice.
A.F.M. Do you think in this chapter, the ministry of Peter merges with Paul's? You spoke of the one street, connecting it with the city and the Head in heaven. That would illustrate what occurred a hundred years ago.
J.T. I think so; the one street sets aside the distinction so long maintained between the clergy and laity, and brings all on to the same level of mutual dignity. Mutuality can be carried down to the degraded level of socialism, but mutual dignity is implied in the one street of gold in the heavenly city.
F.I. He says that he is taken out of the expectation of the Jews. I was thinking with regard to what you were saying as to the clerical system: the ministry has been delivered from that. Peter can
{85}
see the expectations of the Jews as being frustrated, and himself delivered from Herod.
J.T. Peter understands the whole position now, and he knows where to go. As remarked, the next thing is, Who will discern his voice? Will one in such circumstances be recognised as a minister of Christ? The apostle had to labour hard to maintain his ground at Corinth, yet he said he was a minister of Christ.
A.Pf. Would that not be seen in Peter's continued knocking?
J.T. Yes, the true servant continues knocking. The Lord continues knocking, "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking", (@Revelation 3:20). There is a maid here who "recognised the voice of Peter", and maintained it, although they said she was mad. They ridicule her and she has to suffer. A tender-feeling person like this would be very conscious of such ridicule.
J.S. Would this show the Lord beginning another generation?
J.T. I suppose so. We see how she supersedes all that were there; she is the leading person, as being certain that Peter was at the door when the others were unbelieving.
A.F.M. Would that apply to the Spirit's voice to each of the assemblies? -- "He that has an ear, let him hear". The one who has an ear is an overcomer.
J.T. Yes; that is what I thought. She has an ear to hear; and is an overcomer. She represents those who hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
R.A.L. She did not open the door.
J.T. You must not open the door until you have listened. John says, "If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into the house", (@2 John 10).
A.P.T. Rhoda considered for all in the house.
{86}
She went and told them before she even looked at Peter.
J.T. She did not keep the thing to herself. What is emphasised is that she recognised the *voice of Peter* and that it caused her joy.
A.R.S. Why is the opening of the door left to the saints that were in the house? You would have thought that the overcomer would open the door.
J.T. You must bring in those who are in responsibility; she did not own the house. It says, "And when he had knocked at the door of the entry, a maid came to listen, by name Rhoda". I do not suppose she would open the door under ordinary circumstances. You want to know to whom you are opening. "And having recognised the voice of Peter, through joy did not open the entry, but running in, reported that Peter was standing before the entry. And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she maintained that it was so. And they said, It is his angel. But Peter continued knocking; and having opened, they saw him and were astonished". They did not open because of her report only, but also because of the continued knocking.
A.R.S. Peter's continued knocking had an effect upon them.
J.S. Are you still viewing this prophetically as the Lord dealing with the hearts of His people through the ministry?
J.T. Yes. "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking".
C.A.M. It would surely be safe to say that the ministry given in these last days is vastly beyond the thoughts of those who prayed throughout the earlier history of the assembly.
J.T. Quite. Besides oral ministry, there is great gain in circulating what God gives, and speaking of it at every opportunity. The knocking by the Lord is mediate and is largely through such service.
{87}
J.T.Jr. We get signs in this book -- something that marks the person. Peter makes a sign to them and tells them to be silent. Is that to bring about a like state of soul?
J.T. A sign always signifies something; here subjection is required. It was a *downward* motion of the hand. Paul also made a similar sign with his hand; (@Acts 13:16).
A.N.W. What is the position of James and the brethren?
J.T. I think James is the responsible one; his place in Jerusalem is very marked, as representing responsibility. He was capable of having power by himself, he stresses what one man can do. He tells us what Elijah did, and therefore it is a question of distinct men of that type who had such individuality about them. He acquires power on moral lines. I believe he wrote the striking epistle of James, and gave the decision at Jerusalem in @Acts 15. You can never omit the idea of special responsibility amongst the saints. While the mutual thought is always present, there should be the responsible side accompanied by moral weight.
{88}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (5)
@Acts 7:54 - 60; @Acts 8:1 - 3; @Acts 16:19 - 33; @Revelation 21:21
J.T. At our last reading we dwelt on the sufferings of Christ as seen in "the twelve apostles of the Lamb", and recorded in the early chapters of Acts. On this occasion we might look at the same sufferings endured by Stephen and the assembly itself; also the sufferings sustained by Paul, which link our thoughts with the gates of *pearl* of the holy city.
The precious stones were alluded to as probably being the outcome of great pressure in the earth. They are seen in the foundations of the wall of the city as answering to the twelve apostles. @2 Corinthians 1:5 was alluded to as showing that the sufferings of Christ were rightly connected with the apostle and with the assembly; he says, "even as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us"; so that we are entitled to speak of the sufferings of the saints as the sufferings of Christ. Reference to the twelve precious stones specified by name in @Revelation 21, as the twelve foundations of the wall of the city (each stone bearing the name of an apostle) is very suggestive of the pressure of suffering passed through, having in view the formation that God intends shall appear in the heavenly city; that is, what is foundational and stable. Then there is the pearl, which is well known as the product of suffering. I believe that we may rightly regard Philippi as answering to the pearl. It stands peculiarly in relation to suffering experienced by Paul, Silas, and others there, and was the gateway to Europe from the East, viewed in relation to the testimony. The sufferings endured at Philippi peculiarly correspond with the heavenly city, and the apostle stresses *sufferings* and *unity* in his letter to the Philippians.
{89}
A.N.W. Is it of value to point out that the pearl is identified with the sea, and these precious stones with the earth?
J.T. That is quite suggestive; it shows God's great resources from which He draws, as occasion demands, when addressing us.
A.F.M. The epistle to the Philippians confirms what you were saying about the formation of the pearl, and is very suggestive. The work at Philippi was rich in fruits, so that the apostle could write to them as he did.
J.T. Well, I thought the wording of the letter to them, being so full of affection and tender, personal feeling, through links being formed in suffering, would point to the pearl, and inasmuch as the assembly was marked by unity, what was lacking in that respect was urged fervently by the apostle; and then that assembly was marked by fellowship in the gospel from the very beginning, which is the administrative feature, as to that in which God shines out, and this corresponds with the gates of pearl.
J.S. In the opening of @Acts 8 all are scattered "except the apostles". Do you regard the apostles as having withstood the pressure?
J.T. It would seem that they stood their ground. The pressure must have been very great in Jerusalem, and, as we were remarking previously, they may have been influenced by metropolitan sentiments; yet I think the Lord would protect them from criticism, and would show that their work was perfect.
J.S. Their foundation remains stable.
J.T. Quite; so that the further work extending out was also on a solid basis, and the subsequent part Jerusalem took in relation to the work abroad among the nations confirms this. There is no doubt, however, that the metropolitan spirit soon became fixed at Jerusalem, and it was more and more
{90}
manifest as the testimony proceeded, as the epistle to the Galatians witnesses, also Paul's final visit there.
C.A.M. Why do such adverse forces focus themselves so much on one man -- Stephen?
J.T. It looks as if the Lord took him up and fitted him as one suited to reflect what He had in His mind at *this* juncture; instead of taking up one of the apostles, the Lord took up Stephen. It was no reflection on the apostles, because Stephen was the fruit of their labours. He was not an independent element, but one appointed by them for deaconship. He was distinctly an assembly man, carrying the confidence of the assembly and commended by them for deaconship, so that the apostles laid their hands on him; he fully represents the assembly and the apostles; then we see how the work of God in him prepares for the heavenly side of the truth; his face was "as the face of an *angel*" in the presence of his persecutors.
C.A.M. Deaconship as exercised by Stephen would imply that he is a representative of those that serve the saints?
J.T. Yes; a deacon is not necessarily a gift, but one who serves in a material way, in visiting the saints and in ministering to their temporal needs.
W.G.T. The apostles established the deacons in @Acts 6, and gave themselves up to prayer and ministry of the word. That is how Stephen, one of the seven, came into prominence.
J.T. Yes; he qualified; but took no short cuts to prominence in his service. He obtained for himself a good degree and much boldness in the faith. That is the way it is presented; it is what Stephen was personally; so that this spiritual dignity and honour of suffering is, we may say, within the range of any Christian. Deaconship may be exercised by sisters as well as brothers, see @Romans 16:1. Philippi was
{91}
peculiarly distinguished in that way. The deacons are mentioned in the apostle's address (@Philippians 1:1).
W.G.T. Would it not appear that the apostles looked on Stephen's work as inferior?
J.T. It *was* inferior, but still was essential. In fact the deacons were appointed to meet an effort by the devil to force cleavage among the saints.
A.B.P. Does not chapter 6 show that Stephen not only graced the position, but he developed in it; because when he was chosen, it says he was full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and then later it says: "Stephen, full of grace and power". Evidently he had used the Spirit.
C.A.M. One striking feature about Stephen is that he knew the history of God's people including their sufferings, from the beginning, and spoke of them in a remarkable way.
J.T. He is an example for young brothers in view of ministry; that they should be acquainted with the history of the testimony. There is nothing more important than the testimony, and hence the history of it is of prime importance; nor can any brother serve effectually without having a full outline of it in his mind.
A.R. Stephen started with the God of glory and finished by seeing the glory of God. One might say it is a complete outline.
J.T. One starting with the God of glory is not thinking of his own glory. Moses says to God, "Let me see thy glory" (@Exodus 33:18); it could not be shown *then*; but Stephen "saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God".
W.G.T. What does that involve in the ministry -- seeing the glory of God?
J.T. Well, it is God shining out; for glory is the shining out of what He is in love, all that shone out in Jesus; hence it is said, "the glory of God in the
{92}
face of Jesus Christ", (@2 Corinthians 4:6). It is brought to us intelligibly in that way.
A.F.M. Do we not need to avail ourselves of any reliable account of the history of the testimony in suffering?
J.T. Of course, we have only a tithe of the martyrs and of the history of their martyrdom, but they will all appear and shine in the heavenly city, and we must wait for it. But any authentic records of the sufferings of Christ in the members of the assembly down through the ages, are pure gold. The ten days of tribulation the Lord speaks of to Smyrna allude to an extended period of suffering by the saints -- the sufferings of Christ in them.
C.A.M. I suppose those sufferings in themselves have a purifying effect in a general way on the spirits of the saints. Is it not encouraging to see that in Stephen there is a man who can sketch the line of faith all the way down?
J.T. Yes. It is an unbroken line.
J.S. The cutting off of Stephen here does not break it. It still goes on; and I suppose you would link that on with the apostle Paul?
J.T. Stephen, in a sense, begins a line of suffering, and his martyrdom has a great place, for we read of the tribulation that took place on the occasion. It was a beginning of a persecution as distinguished from the twelve; and I think it culminates in the heavenly city, but converging on the gates rather than on the foundations.
J.S. What do you have in mind when you say, a new kind of persecution since Stephen?
J.T. Well, it is on account of the more heavenly side of the truth. His face was as that of an angel and those in the council saw it, which I think should be noticed.
J.S. Was it because the traits of the heavenly
{93}
man were shining out in Stephen that the enemy became so infuriated against him?
J.T. Yes. That is met by the same grace that shone in Christ on the cross; and, I believe, is involved in the "one pearl" of the gates; i.e., the unity of the assembly developed in sufferings is the answer in grace to the malice of man's heart. Stephen knelt down and said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge". What a testimony that was! It was the heavenly character of the testimony harmonising with what the Lord said on the cross "Father, forgive them" (@Luke 23:34). It was the fulness of the heavenly side of the testimony, as @Ephesians 1:7 says, "according to the riches of his grace", and "God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love", (chapter 2:4).
J.S. The Lord would have sustained him in a special way, so that he displayed this marvellous spirit.
J.T. That is what we should count on in any suffering for Him -- that in whatever little measure we may share in it, we should maintain the spirit of grace, because persecutions are apt to provoke us. In @Acts 16, you see how great the apostle Paul and Silas were in the prison, but there was a drop in Paul's testimony later when he required the magistrates to come and take them out of the prison. So we need to watch ourselves lest we be resentful when things happen which occasion persecution.
A.Pf. Why is the thought of vengeance introduced in @Revelation 6:10 in connection with martyrs?
J.T. They belong to another family of saints, not to the assembly, and correspond more to the Psalms; the subjects of suffering in that book frequently cry for vengeance, too, but those that form the assembly are on a higher plane, and that is what is before us just now. The grace that is to mark us in suffering
{94}
is in correspondence with the gates of the city, and what God is as in administration there.
A.N.W. @Psalm 21 calls for vengeance; whereas @Psalm 22 does not.
J.T. @Psalm 22 is grace; the answer to God forsaking Christ on the cross.
A.N.W. You have the deepest sufferings, but no vengeance.
A.R. Stephen did not whisper but "cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge". He was powerful in testimony and marked by *grace* in his suffering.
J.T. Yes; no doubt all present heard. What a testimony it was in answer to the stones of hatred hurled at him! That is what he says, and he knelt down to say it, showing the composure of mind he had. In the terrible ordeal of stoning he knelt down to pray for his murderers.
W.F.K. He was *full* of the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Yes; showing what power was there!
F.N.P. As was said, Stephen corresponded to the Lord on the cross. The Lord said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do".
J.T. That is the idea of the pearl; the assembly itself being the expression of Christ -- not in judgment, but in grace.
J.E.H. Would you say that the attitude of mind, expressed in the rejection and crucifixion of Christ, was continued here in relation to Stephen?
J.T. That is what is meant. I think Stephen represents what was to be developed. The assembly was to be the vessel for the display of Christ -- His body -- and the Lord alludes to that when He says to Saul, "why dost thou persecute me?" As if to say, What are these people doing against you? Grace was in the assembly, seen in suffering without resentment.
N.McC. One was thinking of the suddenness of the ending of Stephen's testimony. Would it indicate
{95}
that sufferings are not to be confined to distinguished men, but also to be distributed, and experienced by all?
J.T. That is just what comes out here. First it says, "Saul was consenting to his being killed"; and then it says, "there arose a great persecution against the *assembly*", the whole body is now to be brought into it; Saul entered into the houses in his persecuting zeal, dragging off men and women and delivering them to prison.
A.N.W. It is the assembly which was in Jerusalem in verse 1; and evidently the whole assembly is contemplated in verse 3.
J.T. Just so. Saul entered "into the houses one after another". That is to be noted. What did he find in those houses? He found Christ in *character* -- brothers and sisters and their children permeated with the spirit of Christ.
J.E.H. He was, as it were, looking for Christ, to persecute Him.
J.T. Paul tells us later that he thought he ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazaraean, and he found in the houses of the saints what was in character Jesus the Nazaraean. That is what the Lord alluded to when He said, "Why dost thou persecute me?" As if to say, Saul, you went into such a house, what did you find there? He would have to say, I found there a beautiful spirited man who did not try to drive me out of his house. As James said, "ye have condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not resist you", (chapter 5:6).
N.McC. So that what we have of Stephen, Paul, and Silas is written not only for a record, but to show us what we should be like.
J.T. That is right. If the Lord allowed physical persecution today, what would some officer of the law find who might enter your house to drag you before a tribunal?
{96}
C.A.M. Saul would see in those houses of the saints rays of the same glory he had seen in Stephen.
F.H.L. The record of Stephen's burial is short and striking.
J.T. We do not get much account of the burial of the saints in the New Testament; this one being the exception. I suppose Stephen's burial has a dispensational significance in that the hopes of Israel were for the moment buried there; God was taking up something else now in relation to the assembly.
C.A.M. I suppose the martyrdom of Stephen was the Jews answer to God's presentation of Christ to them in resurrection. They would not have that Man to reign over them.
J.T. Exactly; the stoning of Stephen has that significance.
A.F.M. In verse 1 of chapter 8 we read that "Saul was consenting to his being killed". I was wondering whether the spirit of Christ exhibited in Stephen caused Saul to consent to his death, and possibly to start on the terrible course of persecution he pursued.
J.T. Quite so; in that paragraph the Holy Spirit makes the incident stand out. It says, "And Saul was consenting to his being killed". He was consenting to the death of *such* a man.
Ques. Would you say the death of Stephen with its environments was really the birth-place of the apostle Paul?
J.T. I think that is right. He came into contact with the spirit of Christ there. Undoubtedly some impression was made which linked with later events.
A.B.P. The Lord was putting the "goads" there -- "it is hard for thee to kick against goads", (@Acts 26:14).
J.T. Yes; some impression had been made on Saul, for his conscience was pricking him, but not until the Lord brought him down did he give way to
{97}
his conscience; the Lord says, "it is hard for thee". I think that is one of the finest expressions of grace you can get. Saul was the Lord's greatest human enemy, and yet He said to him "it is hard for thee" -- as if the Lord sympathised with him.
J.S. So you see God's ways in grace, in judgment, and in government. His conscience was no doubt reached on this occasion.
J.T. In His governmental care for His people the Lord removed Saul as a persecutor, but in His grace He converted him. The allusion to the goads is touching as showing the Lord's sympathy even for such a man.
W.G.T. Would you regard Saul as a figure of the remnant?
J.T. Yes; he said he was an abortion -- saved before the time. Paul was "a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal", (@1 Timothy 1:16). The Lord appeared unto him as one born out of due time; that is, not born *after* the time, but *before* the time. If it were an allusion to Pentecost, he was born *after* the time, but it was an allusion to the coming day when the remnant will be brought in; as such he was born before the time. I judge this latter is what Paul means.
C.A.M. It puts a greatness of meaning on the word "delineation", especially if it includes those who follow the assembly.
J.T. You can see how God's earthly people will be brought in by and by -- on the ground of pure mercy. No one deserved mercy less than Saul, but God took him up to make him a delineation, so that the blackest sinner on earth need not fear, since such an one as this has been taken up; I believe it will be of great comfort to the remnant by and by when they are convicted of the murder of Christ. In @Leviticus 23 the memorial of blowing of trumpets takes place before the day of atonement, which is for conviction
{98}
of sin. It will be the awakening of the Jews by some powerful testimony, and their conviction will be deep; but they will have encouragement by examples such as this. Paul is a delineation for them, as mercy was shown him, so it will be shown to them.
C.A.M. With reference to the pearl of @Matthew 13, I wanted to ask whether it would be right to say that the Lord saw its glories when here upon earth?
J.T. I think He saw it in the disciples. He had come in as the Messiah; the porter had opened the door to Him and He would confirm the promises made to the fathers; but in doing that this precious thing, greater than Israel ever was or could be, came to His mind; He saw it in the disciples in some way, so that the Lord could speak of "having found one pearl of great value".
W.G.T. With regard to the houses Saul entered in his persecuting zeal, would they correspond with the passover night in Egypt -- the same spirit seen in all the houses of Israel is now found in the houses of the saints in Jerusalem.
J.T. Yes, it was the spirit of Christ in the houses, and indicates the place the houses of the saints have in the testimony, and hence @Acts 16 corresponds. The household of the jailor was secured and becomes the depository of grace, as also the house of Lydia. It is a question of what is found in the households of the brethren, should an agent of persecution enter; would he find the house full of novels and newspapers and that sort of thing? That is the world itself; it is not Christ; there is nothing there to persecute!
A.R. Saul of Tarsus would have passed such a house by!
J.T. Yes, he would have looked in and said, This is not the house of a Christian.
A.R. Does not the power of the testimony largely lie in what our houses are?
J.T. It does. It is remarkable the place the
{99}
household has acquired in the history of the testimony in recent times.
A.F.M. The first allusion to the pearl is connected with "the kingdom of the heavens", as if to show that the saints in this setting must come under the recognition and *rule* of heaven.
J.T. Matthew is the assembly gospel. It is the only one in which the assembly is formally mentioned. It contains a great deal about *houses* and the Lord Jesus as in them. The wise men from the East found Him in the house. So one important question today is, What is in one's house? If a persecutor comes in and looks around and sees worldly things on the table, cards and what not, he would say, This is not the house I want. The world loves its own and would commend that, but it will not commend holy conversation and prayer and the reading of the Scriptures in the morning.
N.McC. One would ask whether you confine the sufferings of Christ as seen in the assembly to the believer standing for Christ and His rights. Or does it mean inward hidden suffering?
J.T. Sufferings endured inwardly, as the result of bad teaching, or want of deliverance, are not included. On the other hand, keen suffering comes from your near relatives, neighbours, fellow workers and the like. The keenest kind is endured from them as you are faithful to the Lord -- "And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted", (@2 Timothy 3:12). That is, those who are of the new order of man seen in Him. The world abominates it, and hence you find yourself ostracised in spirit by it.
A.N.W. Would you mind explaining the use of the word "testimony"?
J.T. Testimony is what God presents, and means the same as witness; hence you find the *ark of the testimony*, and the *tent of the testimony*. The ark of the testimony implies what was in the ark, presented
{100}
on God's part to men. What was in the tent of testimony, too, was what God would present to men. Christ is it and it is presented in the saints now in the power of the Spirit. What we are engaged with now is, that if we suffer from men because of this presentation, what spirit do we manifest? We are to exhibit *grace*, like Stephen did, who, I believe, is the prototype of this for all of us. He was like each one of us, just a sinner taken up by God, and he comes into this grace and prominence through faithfulness. No doubt he had special support, but it is not said of him, as it is of Paul, that he was an elect vessel, or that the Lord stood by him and strengthened him, and that is what, I believe, the Lord would teach us. He is therefore an example for us all, to maintain the spirit that was seen in Christ, and also seen in Stephen, in suffering. The passage before us would stress that this spirit of Christ should be seen in the houses of the saints.
A.B.P. Is there not a great deal about us that is *not* according to God? And in order to be brought into line with the testimony we have to be brought through sufferings or trials, which are disciplinary, but is it possible that if we accept these sufferings at the hand of the Lord, they may be turned into profitable sufferings that might even be called the sufferings of Christ?
Ques. Is that where we get on to the administrative side -- as suffering we exhibit grace?
J.T. The "administrative side" is good, because that is the climax of what we are talking about. As persecuted I become an administrator of grace. That is the principle -- "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do". The Lord is administering grace: Stephen was administering grace when he said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge". In all these circumstances of suffering, the thing is to maintain the spirit of dependence on God, and
{101}
thus acquire moral power to administer His grace to men. This principle is strikingly exemplified in Joseph.
J.T.Jr. Is that the result of the Lord breathing into the disciples; (@John 20:22)?
J.T. Yes.
A.F.M. Paul and Silas got the jailor through the manifestation of this spirit.
J.T. The jailor says, "Sirs". He is very respectful. A little while before he would have addressed them very differently. Now he says, "Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?" They are administrators now, and they are that collectively. That is the idea of the pearl, the administration of grace meets the hatred.
A.N.W. So that in the heavenly city, although there are twelve gates, whatever gate I arrive at, the *one thing*, grace, is suggested to me.
J.T. That is what I thought. Each gate "was of one pearl", and complete in itself, but uniform with the others.
A.P.T. The jailor laid the table for Paul and Silas.
J.T. Now he is administrating in his house, but they had administered the grace of heaven to him first. "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house".
F.H.L. There are three gates on each side of the city.
J.T. The bearing is universal.
A.R. Do you mean that administering grace now equips the saints so that they will know how to do it perfectly in the millennial day?
J.T. Exactly; the apostle's letter to Philippi indicates unity among the brethren there, tempered with suffering. I believed they answered to the pearl.
A.P.T. The jailor brought Paul and Silas into his house; it had become, through grace, a suited place for them and for the brethren.
{102}
J.T. Exactly; I think Lydia had gained the first place in this sense in Philippi. In @Luke 10:5 - 7, you get, "And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace to this house. And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it ... and in the same house abide". I think the house of a "son of peace" implied headquarters for grace, and Lydia acquired that place. So that when Paul and Silas left the prison, "they came to Lydia". The jailor's house was another institution opened up to the apostles where their needs were administered to.
A.F.M. The suggestion of "a son of peace" is helpful, yet I suppose that Paul with headquarters at Lydia's house would have gladly accepted an invitation from the jailor for a meal, had he remained at Philippi; and he would have been open to have fellowship with other brethren in like manner.
N.McC. Do you think we have it in mind enough, when we are tested for the Lord's sake, that as we go through the testing with the Lord, He will give us a place in the day of administration?
J.T. You do not want to put it off until that day! The thing is to administer to the persecutor when persecuted. The jailor was the persecutor, he put their feet in the stocks; but when the time came, they administered to him in grace.
W.G.T. There was a testimony to all the prisoners, but I suppose the Lord really had in mind the jailor and his house.
J.T. The prisoners heard the singing and praise, which was a touching testimony, but the administration was to the jailor, which brings out the true position. The immediate persecutor is administered to by those whom he persecutes. It is a wonderful triumph of the grace of God in His people.
C.A.M. The result in Philippi was an assembly marked by sympathy with Paul and sustained fellowship in the gospel.
{103}
J.T. They had fellowship in the gospel from the "first day until now". That is the pearl in the gate; they were with Paul in the administration of grace.
J.S. In Stephen and in Paul you see more the qualities of the pearl; whereas in the twelve, the distinctive features of the precious stones.
J.T. I think so -- the twelve are foundational. What was set up at Jerusalem stood; and that is, I believe, what is meant in the "twelve foundations" -- the apostles work was perfect.
A.F.M. Will you tell us in what particular way the twelve apostles ministered in relation to the city, besides being foundational? There was not only the foundation of the wall of the city, but the street?
J.T. The apostles are not connected with that especially. The point is that they laid such a foundation that a superstructure such as the heavenly city could rest upon it! In @Acts 8, when the work of God spread into Samaria, the apostles cared for it; they "sent to them Peter and John". Then when the work of conversion took place at Antioch, tidings of these things "reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem", showing what was there -- energetic sympathy that would stretch out to them and to what God was doing everywhere.
W.B-w. There is no other foundation today.
A.Pf. "The firm foundation of God stands", (@2 Timothy 2:19).
Ques. @Acts 16:26 refers to the foundations of the prison and to the doors. Would it not suggest that the world's system has its foundations and its doors, but there was being introduced into Philippi new foundations and new gates, as it were, which would entirely overthrow what was there?
J.T. That is right. The foundation of God stands; the foundation of the world does not.
A.P.T. I was thinking about God as seen in this chapter. It says that Lydia *worshipped God*, and that Paul and Silas *sang praises to God*, and finally
{104}
the Philippian jailor *believed in God*. That is a glorious result of the testimony as presented, is it not?
J.T. It is in keeping with "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever", (@Romans 11:36).
C.A.M. The singing seems to be an intimation of the mind of God as to what was to be found in the assembly in Philippi.
A.P.T. There would hardly be an organ in the jail!
J.T. Well, the saints singing is greater than an organ. The only instrument of music in heaven is a harp -- a *stringed* instrument. I believe that Paul and Silas were stringed instruments. The Lord would regard them as His stringed instruments -- instruments of the Chief Musician; the singing of these sufferers was thus an exalted testimony to the prisoners.
J.E.H. They were in "high places", (@Habakkuk 3:19).
A.B.P. This was praise that developed out of suffering and prayer. Is there not a peculiar quality to such praise -- suffering, prayer, and praise? Is that not a remarkable ascent?
J.T. Yes I think that is very suggestive. It says in @Habakkuk 3:1 "A Prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth", and then it ends with: "Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation. Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, And he maketh my feet like hinds feet, And he will make me walk upon my high places". To the "chief Musician. On my stringed instruments" (verses 18,19); that is, he rises from prayer to praise.
A.N.W. Habakkuk begins with a *burden* and follows with a *prayer* and ends with *praise*.
J.H.E. In @Psalm 22, we have the Lord saying,
{105}
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (verse 1), and then singing: "in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee", verse 22 ...
A.B.P. Psalm 22:3 says, "thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel". The Lord had that before Him on the cross in His suffering, and praise out of suffering seems to be of the most excellent quality.
J.T. I believe the instruments are developed in suffering, but @Psalm 22 is the basis of the praises of Israel.
{106}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (6)
@Genesis 4:3 - 10; @Genesis 21:9; @Genesis 37:2 - 24; @Genesis 39:19 - 23
J.T. Having covered in a general way the great subject of the sufferings of Christ, as seen in the New Testament, it seems to be in order that we should look into the Old Testament to see the amplification in detail of all that we have been engaged with. We should begin with Abel, who is the first sufferer mentioned. The Lord Himself refers to him in this way speaking of "the blood of righteous Abel", (@Matthew 22:35).
A.N.W. Would you mind first saying a word for us as to that character of the Lord's death to secure the church, as seen in Adam's deep sleep?
J.T. It is a question if any *sufferings* are foreshadowed there. It took place before sin came in. The deep sleep of @Genesis 2 in itself hardly suggests suffering. What had you in mind?
A.N.W. I wondered whether it might not be seen in the epistle to the Ephesians: "Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it", (@Ephesians 5:25).
J.T. Yes. Eve being taken out of Adam in such a remarkable way is evidently to call attention to the fact that God would have life of *that* kind -- life out of death. God intended that the life that should enter into eternity should not be what Adam had by God breathing into his nostrils, but a life derived from Christ as having entered into death -- that *kind* of life.
C.A.M. Would the "lower parts of the earth" of @Psalm 139 synchronise with the deep sleep?
J.T. Yes; *formation* was in view, as Eve was formed -- "curiously wrought". The Psalmist seems to confine his thoughts to that side -- what God
{107}
effected there; that is, the bone was taken and built while Adam slept. It is not the suggestion of the cross, but of a state; that is, Christ in actual death not the suffering side, but the state out of which the life should come.
A.P. How does @John 12 fit in -- the grain of wheat falling into the ground?
J.T. It is a similar thought; not the idea of suffering, but the state that was reached -- falling into the ground and *dying* -- a state was reached without which there could be no fruit. *How* the state is reached is not given in @Genesis 2. It is simply that God caused the deep sleep; there is no suggestion of suffering in that.
A.P. Referring to Abel and the Old Testament saints in a general way, were the features of Christ reflected in them?
J.T. Yes. Faith was needed for the reflection of what should come out later. Peter says "Concerning which salvation prophets, who have prophesied of the grace towards you, sought out and searched out; searching what, or what manner, of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these", (@1 Peter 1:10,11). Faith laid hold of what should come out in Christ. Hence: "By faith Abel", and so throughout @Hebrews 11.
J.S. The sufferings were consequent upon sin having come in?
J.T. Faith is not alluded to until sin came in, because sin contemplates the complete breakdown of what was inaugurated on the principle of sight; faith contemplates another order of things.
A.F.M. So that Abel, knowing the fall had come in, approached God suitably.
J.T. Yes, Abel's action would be based on death involving suffering in some way which must have taken place in order to procure the coats of skin for
{108}
Adam and Eve. He got his light that way, rather than from the deep sleep of his father and the origin of his mother.
A.N.W. The latter was in counsel before sin existed.
J.T. The light shone as sin came in. Adam no doubt had light, because in naming his wife "Eve" it was implied. But it would not do to make Adam the first in the line of faith; it must be Abel.
J.H.E. Did you say that light was given in the death of the animals in order to supply suitable clothing?
J.T. Yes. You can understand how Abel would ask his parents about the clothes they wore. Young people do think of clothes, but is it a question of the right kind of clothes, such as Adam and Eve wore, or the fashions of the day? The fashions of the day come by another way, and appeal to the young mind, but the fashions of Abel's day came in through death. Whether Abel enquired of his parents or not, they would, no doubt, tell him of the clothes God made for them.
C.A.M. The priest who presented the burnt-offering had its skin.
J.T. The significance of which would be covering. Sufferers in the line of faith were clad in sheep-skins and goat-skins; (@Hebrews 11:37). The clothes Adam and Eve wore would be unlike the beautiful skin coats of today. There is usually no idea of death in the minds of those that wear them, for death is put as far away from the natural mind as possible.
A.P. Would the clothing that Adam and Eve had be suggested in @Romans 13:14 -- "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ"?
J.T. Yes. It is Christ as having died that you put on; not Christ as He was, but as having died. Abel brought to God, we are told, the firstlings of
{109}
his flock; that is, the best, without saying how many -- the firstlings of his flock and their fat.
J.S. Do you couple suffering with sacrifice?
J.T. Yes; this is clearly the beginning of the great sacrificial order of things that comes out in Exodus and Leviticus.
J.S. So that Adam and Eve were clothed as a result of suffering and sacrifice; Abel followed this.
J.T. That is the thought. As the required and voluntary offerings were made at the tabernacle or temple, the court would be a regular shambles; a constant stream of blood flowed. Naturally we do not like that, but the divine thought was sacrifice, that *death* should be in evidence; testimony to the judgment of God marked the whole scene. Cain did not consider that, nor think there was anything wanting in the offering he brought.
G.McP. Why do you emphasise the sufferings of Christ rather than His death?
J.T. Because "the sufferings of Christ" is our subject. Abel was killed, but by the hand of his brother, who rose up against him. There would be that awful feeling of a murderous attack, which would involve suffering, before the actual death. Cain rose up against him when they were in the field.
A.P. With regard to the verse, "He shall crush thy head" (@Genesis 3:15), does it not give the idea of a *man* coming in? Faith would look for him.
J.T. Quite. I have no doubt that is why Eve called Cain "a man" when he was born. "I have acquired a man with Jehovah", (chapter 4:1). She undoubtedly took up the thought of the previous chapter -- that her seed would bruise the head of the serpent.
However much Abel understood instinctively, the features of Christ were beginning to show themselves in him. I think that Cain failed Eve; she said, "I have acquired a man *with* Jehovah" (not *from*
{110}
but *with*, meaning that God helped her); she linked Cain with the promised seed, undoubtedly. She is the first person, as far as Scripture records, to name the name of Jehovah, and she connects Him with Cain. But in the time which elapsed between the births of the two children, she changed her judgment of him. Eve had "acquired" Cain, as though he were of great importance, but the next child was regarded as just a breath -- a vanity. It was undoubtedly the result of a judgment based on what Cain was; the parents at the time of Abel's birth would have come to a truer understanding of their own state.
A.F.M. You would connect Eve's name -- "life" -- with Abel, not with Cain?
J.T. The life line is in Abel; so that Seth comes in instead of Abel in chapter 5, and the life line is in Seth. According to @Genesis 4:25, Eve evidently had the mind of God in naming Seth. "God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him". It is another *seed*, not "son" or "man".
Then Seth calls his son Enosh, that is, "man as weak, mortal". "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah". Light thus broke in for man.
C.A.M. In naming Enosh, Seth seemed to have the same kind of intuition that Eve had, that man was a passing creature.
J.T. That is right. It should be noted with regard to Abel that he was just a passing breath -- transitory.
J.S. In naming Cain, was Eve still acting on the line of sight?
J.T. I think so; there may have been some light in her soul, but her words as to Cain were not spoken in faith.
A.P. Did not the Jews expect things to be set up here in the flesh when the Lord Jesus was here? It is much like Eve's naming of Cain.
{111}
J.T. Very much. This only brings Abel into clearer light. He saw that things must be on a new basis, that of sacrifice through death, and so he offers "the firstlings of his flock and of their fat".
J.S. The features of Christ are thus developed through suffering, as we see right through Genesis.
J.T. Yes. The mind immediately goes to the man that is identified with these offerings. He saw that there must be a new line, a new world really, which Cain did not see. He did not accept God's judgment on man, showing he "was born according to flesh" merely, and hence had no divine instincts. "He that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit", (@Galatians 4:29). Abel was, in principle, born according to the Spirit, he had spiritual instincts, and hence understood what was suitable to God. "Cain was of the wicked one", (@1 John 3:12).
J.T.Jr. Persecution thus marked the whole way down "from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias", which the Lord alludes to; (@Matthew 23:35).
J.T. Yes. Abel is the first martyr. The Lord calls attention to the blood of *righteous* Abel.
W.B-w. It would seem that Abel profited by the accumulated light of his parents.
J.T. Yes. He begins the life line, God, as it were, basing everything on righteousness. Sin having come in, life must be based on righteousness.
A.F.M. Do you think that as Abel brought these offerings to Jehovah, they had a formative effect upon him, so that he would not only see Christ there objectively, but that his walk was to be according to what they expressed?
J.T. Quite so. Indeed, divine formation was already there, for the Lord calls him "righteous", and John says his works were righteous. The offerer is merged in his offering.
{112}
A.P. He was ready to go the same way as his offering.
J.T. Quite. He saw that that was the only way, and God honoured him in it. He was *accepted*. Besides, as slain by his brother he was a type of Christ, who suffered death at the hands of His brethren, who hated Him.
J.S. Sin, having come in, developed in this way.
J.T. That form of sin -- hatred of a brother -- is seen fully in the Jews as they put Christ to death.
A.F.M. Sin in the garden was directly against God, but sin here outside of the garden is directed against the neighbour, the brother. These are the two great features of sin that come to light, are they not?
J.T. That is the way John works it out in his first epistle. He deals with things radically and shows that these two men are the heads of two families, as already noted. So he says the devil sins from the beginning, and this goes right through. Cain, Balaam, and Core are seen as three great leaders in sin. The Lord says, "Ye are of the devil, as your father", (@John 8:44). The Jews as putting Him to death were brothers of Cain. So today, hatred of a brother, as God views it, is murderous.
A.P.T. "These are spots in your love-feasts", (@Jude 12); those marked by those three elements -- Cain, Balaam, and Core.
F.H.L. If we offer to God, we must be prepared to go the whole way, which implies suffering and death.
J.T. That is the principle. Thus, Christ having suffered for us we are to arm ourselves with the same mind; (@l Peter 4:1).
C.A.M. Does it not impress you with the marvellous way of God that His end should thus be reached?
J.T. Yes: "For it became him [that is, God], for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the
{113}
leader of their salvation through sufferings", (@Hebrews 2:10). Abel, in principle, is one of the sons. Adam is said to have been "of God", but he is not led "to glory". There is no thought of it; whereas the counsels of God require that sons should be led to glory, and led this way -- through suffering.
W.B-w. Is one point in Cain that he does not take the line of suffering?
J.T. He is quite a respectable worshipper, but he does not bring blood. People generally do not like the thought of blood; they ridicule it.
W.B-w. We find offerings in the world today that answer to Cain's.
J.T. Quite so; it is bringing what I work out myself, ignoring the judgment of God.
J.E.H. Is that why it is called "the way of Cain"?
J.T. Yes, it is a terrible way, and there are a great many on that way.
A.N.W. John calls Cain's works "wicked", even before he slew his brother.
A.B.P. While Cain would slay Abel and shed righteous blood, he did not accept death as a penalty on himself as a child of Adam.
F.N.P. Why does it say that Jehovah looked on Abel and his offering, and upon Cain and upon his offering He did not look?
J.T. There was no divine complacency in Cain and his offering. God was complacent in Abel, as identified by faith with Christ in his offering. God's complacency is in us on the ground of sacrifice: "we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son", (@Romans 5:10).
F.H.L. Is it not possible to make the right offering yet not in the right way? The Lord stood over against the treasury and saw how they cast in.
J.T. *How* they did it. Quite so. Here, Cain brought the wrong offering -- not that the meat-offering is not right in its place. There is full room
{114}
for a meat-offering in Leviticus, but it must come in after the blood-offering; that is, God must be appeased first, and no meat-offering can appease Him vicariously. Christ was perfectly delightful to Him as a Man here, but He could not bring us in on that ground at all. "Without blood-shedding there is no remission", (@Hebrews 9:22).
R.W.S. Is there any point in the fact that Abel suffers in the field and Zacharias, of whom the Lord remarks, suffers in connection with the altar? The suffering is getting closer; compare @Matthew 23:35.
J.T. That is suggestive. Zacharias suffered in the *religious* sphere, between the temple and the altar.
Ques. What kind of offering is Abel's?
J.T. A burnt-offering. It was a burnt-offering with the fat.
A.F.M. It would suggest that sin had come in; (@Leviticus 1:4).
J.S. I suppose Satan would quickly detect the features of Christ in Abel and hence attack him.
J.T. Quite so. It is Christ that he is attacking. He always attacks Christ, either personally or as seen in His people.
W.G.T. Did not God anticipate that there would be an attack on Abel? The way in which God spoke to Cain of His offering seems to suggest this.
J.T. Yes; He would forestall it and save Cain from his awful crime. God is gracious; the passage shows how long-suffering He is. He says, "why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, will not thy countenance look up with confidence?" God, as it were, encourages us to look up. And then He says, "and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door". It is said by authorities that this word "sin" may also be translated "sin-offering", in this there may be an allusion to Abel's offering. It is very affecting that God would forestall the murder by encouraging him to do well. If he did not do well
{115}
there was a sin-offering at the door, which he could avail himself of and hence could retain his place of dominance. Very often when people do evil they do not avail themselves of the divine provision for restoration, and the sin remaining unjudged, the conscience becomes hardened and they turn definitely to do their own will.
A.R.S. Why did God put a mark on Cain that he should not be slain?
J.T. It alludes to the Jews. That mark today is to be seen around us. There are no people like them. Take the Greeks, Romans, or any of those ancient races -- you cannot find them today. You may know historically what has come down, but they are not to be found *characteristically*; whereas, the Jew is characteristically what he was; God has put a mark on him, and nobody can efface it, nor can anyone harm him with impunity, murderer though he be. Some nations have suffered because they have touched him. He comes back at the end; Lemech says, "For I have slain a man for my wound", (verse 23). He acknowledges his guilt; that is the Jew in the last days.
A.F.M. The slaying of Abel would be implied in the acknowledgment.
A.R.S. So that Cain is a type of the Jew.
C.A.M. Lemech, in speaking of avenging, implies that Cain's posterity had suffered.
J.T. He alludes to God's promise as to Cain in verse 15; the seventy and seven fold avenging would be a reference to what will be inflicted on the Jews enemies in the latter days; compare Esther and @Matthew 25.
A.F.M. The vengeance shows how the Jew will be protected in the coming day.
A.B.P. How do you explain the last part of verse 7 "unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him"?
{116}
J.T. The allusion is to Abel, I think. Cain was the elder, and under these circumstances Abel would take his place in subjection and be a true brother. "Unto thee shall be his desire" agrees with this -- there would be brotherly love. That we are to love each other as brethren and be subject one to another is in keeping with this. What a great thing to have a real brother? -- one who is submissive to you, whose desires will be toward you. It seems Jehovah said this as an incentive to Cain to do well.
J.S. Abel comes in as morally first through his offering.
J.T. He does; but still he would be a real brother, and honour Cain, as Gideon honoured Ephraim when he said: "What have I done now in comparison with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?" (@Judges 8:2).
A.B.P. So Peter enjoins the younger to submit themselves to the elder.
A.F.M. Would Enoch's prophecy (@Jude 14,15), indicate that others in the life line suffered similarly to Abel?
J.T. I think so. He saw the Lord coming amidst His holy myriads to execute vengeance; that would show that he felt the state of things then existing.
A.F.M. "Ungodly sinners" had spoken hard things against God, which would cause Enoch and other saints suffering.
J.S. In developing the testimony on the line of suffering, is it to show us what God can do in sustaining those who suffer?
J.T. Yes; and His work is of such a character that it stands the test of suffering. That is what God would bring out -- what the enduring quality of the divine nature is in sufferings; maintaining its own positive character at the same time.
C.A.M. So that every man that is livingly in the testimony has been baptised for the dead.
{117}
J.T. That is right. In the expression, "bringing many sons to glory", (@Hebrews 2:10) we must include all the Old Testament saints, because they will appear in glory. Enoch and Elijah were translated to heaven without dying. The twenty-four elders in Revelation include all these saints, as well as the assembly. All are brought in through suffering, as @Hebrews 11 and 12 show.
W.F.K. It says, "the voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground". Say a word about the *voice*.
J.T. It shows how valuable to God a death of this kind is. It is God honouring martyrdom, and particularly in those early times as foreshadowing the sufferings of Christ. Abel's sufferings and death present a remarkable type of Christ's sufferings and death.
A.F.M. What was the character of Abel's voice crying to God from the ground?
J.T. I think it was that of vengeance, for the blood of the new covenant speaks better things. It is a testimony because vengeance followed here. The Lord says of it, "the voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength", (verses 10 - 12). That is the answer, I think, to the cry of Abel's blood.
A.P. Does it fit in with @Revelation 6:10: "dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth?"
J.T. It is a similar cry.
W.B-w. In what way does the blood of the new covenant speak better things than Abel?
J.T. Abel's death presents an aspect of Christ's death, as we have said. The blood of the Lord Jesus has brought down judgment on the Jews. They said,
{118}
"His blood be on us and on our children" (@Matthew 27:25); it came on them and is on them now. But then *the blood that speaks better things than that of Abel*, is not presented as the blood of a murdered Christ but of Christ *given in love* by God. The blood of the covenant testifies to the love of God, not to the wrath of God.
Rem. So that the voice of Abel was vengeance, but the voice of Jesus was forgiveness.
J.T. That is, viewed from the standpoint of the covenant; but then the covenant does not extend to the Jews until they come in and repent nationally. They have to take their place as being among *men* now to receive blessing. This can only be in an individual way; nationally they have to repent of the murder of their Messiah collectively before they come into the promised blessing. They will look on Him whom they pierced and wail because of Him; compare @Zechariah 12.
W.B-w. It is the same blood only viewed from a different aspect.
J.T. It is the same death of Christ, but you may look at it as bringing down the wrath of God and as a testimony of the love of God. That the Jews might come into the gain of the latter aspect, they were regarded as slaying Christ *ignorantly*, but wrath came on them viewed as slaying Him *wilfully*, Stephen s death being the evidence of this.
C.A.M. I suppose the remnant will put these two things together, when they afflict their souls.
J.T. They will. On the first day of the seventh month is the memorial of blowing of trumpets; and the tenth day of the seventh month the day of atonement. The feast of trumpets implies their awakening and that they afflict their souls -- they repent, and come in for the good of atonement; that is, the blood of the covenant.
A.P. The two go together, the blood on the door
{119}
post in Egypt keeps out the destroying angel, and it corresponds to the blood of the covenant in @Exodus 24.
A.P.T. It is said that "Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother". Is there any suggestion of suffering in that aspect?
J.T. Without doubt, Cain's hostile attitude would be there. I was thinking of what a feeling there must be before a crime. The Lord entered into and felt all that fully when He instituted His supper and His murderers were all around Him outside.
J.S. He could say, "They hated me without a cause", (@John 15:25). There was nothing there to call forth this feeling.
J.T. Indeed, that would be prefigured in Joseph. His brethren hated him without cause. They hated Joseph because he was loved. There is no real cause for hatred in that. Isaac also, one born after the Spirit, was persecuted by one born after the flesh. There was nothing in Isaac to draw out persecution or suffering, for a babe is delightful normally, so that the idea of "without a cause" is there, as bringing out the capability of the flesh, that without a cause it persecutes Christ.
A.F.M. Isaac also suffered later, as a sacrifice upon the altar by Abraham; (@Genesis 22).
J.T. What feelings he must have had as bound on the altar!
T.H. The Lord Jesus suffered from His most familiar friend. He must have felt it keenly!
J.T. The Lord's life was one of almost continuous suffering. The consciousness of what was there in Judas must have occasioned Him constant pain. He calls him "a devil", (@John 6:70) that is, an accuser.
W.G.T. We read that "neither did his brethren believe on him", (@John 7:5). I was thinking that it fits in with the suggestion of Joseph and his brethren.
{120}
J.T. Yes. His relatives said at one time "He is out of his mind", (@Mark 3:21).
R.D.G. In @Micah 7:6 it says: "a man's enemies are the men of his own household"; and in @Matthew 10:36, "And they of his household shall be a man's enemies". That would set forth the sufferings of Christ as you are now speaking of them.
J.T. That is an important feature. You can see that right through, particularly in Genesis. It appears in Cain, Ishmael, Esau, and Joseph's brethren. It is persecution from one's nearest relatives.
C.A.M. Would it be emphasised in Edom in a particular way?
J.T. Yes, Edom represents this character of persecution down to Malachi's ministry.
W.B-w. Were you suggesting the idea of the false brother coming out in Edom?
J.T. Yes. It is also developed in the New Testament. Paul says, "it was on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty", (@Galatians 2:4).
J.T. We cannot speak at length about Joseph on this occasion, but he links on with the Lord's statement, "They hated me without cause". Possibly the first thing to consider is this, he was loved by his father, who made him a vest of many colours, and thus *honoured* him. He is a type of Christ as loved of the Father and honoured. Joseph's father loved him but his brethren hated him, and could not speak with friendliness to him, and yet he had done nothing against them.
A.R.S. He is a type of Christ in incarnation; not as some would have us believe in absolute Deity.
J.T. Quite so. He is a type of Christ in incarnation, loved by his father, and honoured by the gift-vest of many colours; these facts alone bring out the hatred of his brethren, and the next thing is that he is hated *because of his testimony* -- concerning his
{121}
dreams. They called him "this dreamer", derisively, but the title was true and meant that he was a witness, he testified to the resurrection of Christ "Behold we were binding sheaves in the fields, and lo, my sheaf rose up, and remained standing; and behold, your sheaves came round about and bowed down to my sheaf". That is typically the resurrection of Christ. He remains standing. Then of the next dream he says, "behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me". That is Christ in ascension. He is hated all the more for that, and even Jacob in this instance is somewhat against him, showing the more heavenly our testimony, the greater will be the opposition. Even those that are spiritual may oppose us as witnessing to such a line of truth.
J.S. Is this testimony prophetic?
J.T. Yes; it is Christ in resurrection and in ascension; One who is supreme.
A.F.M. Was not this testimony actually fulfilled later in the life of Joseph?
J.T. Quite so. His brethren bowed down to him, and his father, too, we might say. You can see how indicative it is of Christ. What other sheaf but His could rise up and stand as others bow down!
A.F.M. It says: "behold, your sheaves came round about and bowed down to my sheaf".
J.T. How gladly we do that as we know and love Him! The type contemplates Israel converted, standing round about and bowing down.
J.S. That will come to pass in the day to come.
J.T. It will; Israel is viewed here administratively, and then the sun and moon and the eleven stars bow down to Christ.
A.R.S. Jacob did not appreciate this, but rebuked him; still it says he "kept the saying".
{122}
J.T. There is hope for a brother like that. There is hope for a man that observes a saying, although he may oppose it at first.
W.G.T. Mary "kept all these things in her heart". Although she understood not what the Lord said in the temple; (@Luke 2:51).
F.H.L. What is the thought of the sheaf, does it suggest a combination, a plural idea?
J.T. Connecting it with @Leviticus 23, the children of Israel were to cut down a sheaf and wave it before Jehovah. That would mean that Christ died and was waved before God as risen. That was after the passover, and then at the feast of weeks or pentecost that followed, Israel was brought in, in the two loaves that were baked. In the type of the sheaf there was no need of *baking*, but He was cut down in death. I think the sheaf means the Lord cut down in death, and raised in power. Inherent power is indicated in Joseph's sheaf rising up and remaining standing. It says, for He has life in Himself; and He says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up", (@John 2:19). That testimony will come out by and by for Israel and they will bow down to Him. Of course, now, every converted person does this.
The next dream is not so much a question of the host of heaven, but Israel viewed in a position of administration, the sun, the moon, and the stars.
A.F.M. This is fulfilled in @Revelation 12.
J.T. Yes, the woman is clothed with the sun, the moon is under her feet, upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
J.S. So the sun, moon, and stars would suggest rule and administration in the world to come?
J.T. That is the idea. It is Israel's place in the world to come, and all is subservient to Christ; all bow down to Him.
J.T.Jr. His brethren say, "we will see what becomes of his dreams".
{123}
J.T. That is similar to the way they jeered at Christ on the cross -- "Let the Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross", (@Mark 15:32).
C.A.M. In Revelation there are the sun and moon and *twelve* stars.
J.T. Israel will be complete then by Joseph taking his place as a tribe, but the Man-child is over all. He is to rule the nations with a rod of iron. Things in heaven and on earth will be truly subject to Christ.
A.P. What do the sun, moon, and stars represent?
J.T. It is an allusion to supreme government which is in the hands of Israel, but subservient to Christ.
A.P.T. His father says, "Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother and thy brethren, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?" His brethren envy him, but his father kept the saying. I suppose he was getting help.
J.T. That is what I was remarking. A brother like Jacob may be opposed to some heavenly line of thought at first, but if he takes the ground of considering the matter he is not allowing his will in it. That was Jacob's salvation; the others allowed their wills and adverse feelings to govern them.
A.F.M. The apostle said, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things", (@2 Timothy 2:7).
J.T. If I allow my will to work, there is no hope for me, but if amenable to any little bit of light I may receive, even though I do not understand it, there is salvation for me.
A.P. With regard to Israel, it says: "Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, Terrible as troops with banners?" (@Song of Songs 6:10).
J.T. That is Israel.
{124}
W.G.T. What about the coat of many colours?
J.T. It is a symbol of the *varied* glories of Christ.
J.S. His distinctive glories.
J.T. The glories conferred by the Father -- "the glory which thou hast given me", (@John 17:22). There are the *inherent* and the *conferred* glories.
A.N.W. Then it says, "His brethren *saw* that their father loved him more than all his brethren". These varied colours would indicate the father's love for him.
A.B.P. Would it be like:
<blockquote>"All the Father's counsels claiming <br>Equal honours to the Son"? (`14:4).</blockquote>
J.T. That is really the highest thought of it; they are inherent glories. "The glory which I had along with thee before the world was", (@John 17:5), is inherent glory; it belongs to Deity; but then the "glory which thou hast given me" is conferred, in which we can share.
J.S. Then there would be *acquired* glories.
A.P.T. In @John 1, Nathaniel calls the Lord "Son of God" and "King of Israel", and then the Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these", (verse 50). I was wondering whether that would fit in here as to what the Father does. The passage further says, "Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man", (verse 51). Does not that allude to these varied glories?
J.T. The angels *begin with Him*; they *ascend* first. If they had descended first I should call them conferred glories, but they began with Him, which I think refers to His deity -- "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels", (@1 Timothy 3:16). It is the testimony to His deity that they began with Him.
{125}
C.A.M. "He inherits a name more excellent than they", (@Hebrews 1:4), is a very remarkable expression.
J.T. We shall have to start with this chapter in Genesis at our next reading, the Lord permitting. Joseph is one of the greatest types of Christ as a sufferer.
{126}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (7)
@Genesis 39:19 - 23; @Genesis 49:22 - 24; @Exodus 2:11 - 15
J.T. In our consideration when last together of the sufferings of Christ, as seen in Joseph in @Genesis 37, we noticed that he was loved of his father and distinguished by a vest of many colours, and because of this he became the object of the resentment of his brethren, he is a type of Christ as loved of the Father, and hated "without a cause". Then because of the light that Joseph had through his dreams, he was further persecuted by his brethren. These features of the subject that we have had before us amplify what is said in the New Testament as to Christ and the apostles, and have a bearing on ourselves as beloved of God, as is said of the Thessalonians, (chapter 1:4). If they speak the truth fearlessly, Christians come into persecution because of their relation with God and because of the light they have.
We may be helped on this occasion in seeing that Jehovah is said to be with Joseph as in prison. Man is against us and does his utmost to carry out his evil intention, and we may have certain of our brethren against us; but Jehovah was with Joseph, which is a very significant fact. I think it is alluded to four times in the chapter. God's presence with us, whatever the outward appearances, settles everything. He made Joseph prosperous. Whatever his hand touched, prospered. Those who are true to the light are also prospered of God in spiritual things. He honours them in that way. Faithfulness brings us into the position of suffering, for it is said of Joseph: "They afflicted his feet with fetters; his soul came into irons", (@Psalm 105:18). But God was with him.
A.N.W. The Psalm from which you quoted goes on to say, "Until the time when what he said came
{127}
about: the word of Jehovah tried him", (@Psalm 105:19). How does that fit in?
J.T. It would mean the government of God in these circumstances. He turned them into blessing. The word of God tried him; "word" here refers to some specific divine saying, testing him for his good. He would be questioning why he was in prison. "Until the time when what he said came about", would refer to the fulfilment of his dreams. Under God's ordering, prophetic truth occurs with perfect accuracy. In the meantime the discipline of love goes on, so that we may be fitted for our place according to God's counsels.
C.A.M. That would be a sort of proof that God was with him, inasmuch as he could hold out.
J.T. Yes; many of us suffer under the government of God other than by His word. To be tried by the word of God involves spirituality on the part of those tried. Joseph was not overcome by the trial; he was buoyant and so able to help others with him in prison.
A.F.M. Which is figurative of death in Joseph's case -- his being in the pit or in the prison house?
J.T. I think the pit. There was no water in it; had there been water, it would suggest that it was death as *penalty*, like the death of the Lord on the cross. But it was more to show the attitude of his brethren towards him. It is said of the remnant in Zechariah that they were "prisoners of hope". They were in a "pit wherein is no water" (@Zechariah 9:11,12); that is, the pit was not penal. It was not like the lake of fire; they come out of it.
A.F.M. His brethren purposed to slay him; that would connect with the pit.
J.T. That was the testimony they brought to his father. They said he had been slain, and that was the understanding Jacob had.
{128}
J.S. The report of Joseph's death was carried through to his father.
J.T. That is how the matter stood publicly. Jacob accepted the false report of his sons and mourned for Joseph "many days".
J.S. The persecution here in chapter 39 is because of his faithfulness.
J.T. Yes; and what comes out before this attack is that he is prospered, even as a slave. I think it is to show that the greatest limitations do not hinder faith from operating, or hinder God from supporting faith. We may chafe under the limitation, but limitations in themselves do not hinder spiritual prosperity. They rather add to it where faith is active.
W.G.T. The prosperity did not turn him aside.
J.T. No. He was sober in his circumstances, although he had emerged practically from slavery into governorship over Potiphar's house. This passage shows how God can promote us in spite of external limitations.
C.A.M. Is Satan able to use such prosperity? Do you read that into the snare laid for Joseph here?
J.T. Yes, but there is no evidence that it succeeded. Hardly anything is mentioned save the prosperity. That is what is stressed in the early part of the chapter, and I think the object of this is to show that however limited our circumstances may be outwardly -- if God is with us, we shall be prospered. That is the lesson for us. A brother may say, I have a hard job; I have to work early and late, and it is difficult to get to the meetings; I could get on better if I were not so limited. The truth is that, generally speaking, the limitations that I chafe under are intended to help me. As I accept this, God is with me, and I shall prosper.
J.H.E. Would Paul be an example of this? He says, "I would to God, both in little and in much,
{129}
that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bonds", (@Acts 26:29).
J.T. He was greatly limited outwardly, but morally greater than Agrippa. We get the greatest teaching from Paul while he was in prison.
F.H.L. If the pit was a step towards the prison, was not the position in Potiphar's house a step towards supreme rulership?
J.T. It was preparatory to it. The prison was, of course, a trial, but this was in view of the great service for which Joseph was destined.
A.F.M. Both Potiphar's house and the prison house were most testing.
J.T. Yes, and he prospered in both. The lesson for us is that in certain circumstances we are apt to chafe, saying, The demands made upon us are too irksome, while others are in easier circumstances and can devote themselves freely to the things of God, and we cannot. But God can overrule the most adverse circumstances and make us prosperous in spite of limitations -- more prosperous even than those who are in easy positions.
A.P. What is the difference between Joseph suffering at the hands of his brethren and suffering in the prison? What does the first refer to?
J.T. The first refers to the persecution Christ received at the hands of the Jews. That is typically what it meant. But it is what any of us may receive at the hands of our brethren now. The Scriptures always bear on the *present* time.
W.F.K. In the second instance, is Joseph a type of the Lord Jesus being falsely accused?
J.T. Yes; the first is the treatment he received at the hands of the Jews out of envy. Pilate knew they delivered Him up because of envy, but there was also false accusation. The Lord was immaculate; He was absolutely free, being always apart from sin.
{130}
"Which of you convinces me of sin?" He asked (@John 8:46). Nevertheless He was accused most grievously.
A.R.S. What do you make of the fact that while the Jews rejected Christ and finally crucified Him they never put Him in prison? He was not imprisoned like John the baptist or like Joseph here.
J.T. That was all divinely ordered; every effort to take Him was frustrated until His "hour" came. Everything with regard to Christ was necessarily ordered in the most minute way -- even His burial; but, nevertheless, it is said, "He was taken from prison and from judgment", (@Isaiah 53:8). The word "prison" in the Authorised Version may not be correct, but the thought is there. He was limited in that sense. He was a Prisoner, even if only for a day.
J.S. The moment the band led Him away, He was their Prisoner.
W.B-w. Would Potiphar's wife represent false accusation?
J.T. Yes, and this is nowhere seen more than at the judgment seat of Pilate and in the house of the high priest.
W.B-w. Why is Judah's misconduct mentioned in chapter 38?
J.T. To expose the state of Israel seen in Judah, who represented the leading tribe. It comes between the apprehension and selling of Joseph, and his imprisonment in Egypt. It is typically the low moral state of the Jews at the time when Christ was crucified.
J.S. What element would Potiphar's wife represent?
J.T. Remorseless false accusation. It is the spirit of false accusation in one of no integrity; a terrible thing to deal with because conscience is given up.
A.P. She was quite unscrupulous.
{131}
J.T. Quite; the Jews were utterly unscrupulous in the way that they accused the Lord.
J.S. That comes to light after the Spirit of God brings out the traits of Christ typically in Joseph.
J.T. Quite; he *kept himself*. "Every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him", (@1 John 5:18).
J.S. After the account of his prosperity in Potiphar's house, the passage says, "And Joseph was of a beautiful form and of a beautiful countenance", (@Genesis 39:6). Then we have the attack of Potiphar's wife.
C.A.M. I wondered whether it was in that way that Satan was able to get so near to Joseph. Paul warns not only of the reproach of the devil, but of the *snare* of the devil; compare @1 Timothy 3:7.
J.T. Just so. If a brother is promoted, he is the more exposed. Joseph, being true, had the power to keep himself.
J.S. As promoted, one becomes a more distinctive target for Satan.
A.N.W. I wondered what took place in the Lord's life that would correspond with Joseph's soul coming into irons?
J.T. I think the pressure of Gethsemane. That was the supreme test to Christ, when Satan came back to Him with all his force. I suppose that was what Joseph typified when the word of Jehovah tried him. "The word of Jehovah" governed Christ in Gethsemane. "Lo, I come (in the roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will", (@Hebrews 10:7). He *had* taken up that position. Now He says, "not my will, but thine be done", (@Luke 22:42).
J.S. So He tastes death in His spirit in Gethsemane, but not the article of death, yet.
A.P. Would you even extend it on to His being held by Pilate? "Pilate therefore says to him,
{132}
Speakest thou not to *me*? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee?" (@John 19:10).
J.T. The imprisonment is from the time He was apprehended until He died. Even in death He was held, but He came out of it in glorious liberty.
J.S. "The bars of the earth closed upon me for ever", (@Jonah 2:6).
A.N.W. His soul being in irons is a strong term, and would show that it is typical of Gethsemane.
J.T. "My soul is very sorrowful even unto death", (@Matthew 26:38).
W.G.T. "The word of Jehovah" would date back to the dreams that he had.
J.T. Instead of the sun, moon, stars, and sheaves bowing down to him, he is now a prisoner. How trying that was!
C.A.M. It seems a very affecting thing that the One who came to bring the captive to the end of his sorrows, had to feel all those sorrows Himself.
J.T. That is very affecting because it brings out the moral qualification of Christ to preach. "Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, in which also going he preached to the spirits which are in prison, heretofore disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noe" (@1 Peter 3:18 - 20); that is, the Sufferer is the Preacher. The Lord's suffering is suggested in the smiting of one of the sons of the prophets who witnessed to Ahab. He was wounded violently before he spoke to Ahab, see @1 Kings 20. The Lord went through all that those in prison have to go through, and knows what it means more than any of us; so Jonah, the great preacher of the Old Testament, typically, went down to the bottom of the mountains, and was vomited up, and went to preach to Nineveh.
A.P.T. The butler and the baker offended the
{133}
king; whereas, there was no offence with Joseph.
J.T. In that fact he is also a type of Christ. What comes out emphasises what is possible in the limitations of a prison. Instead of pining there and giving up as John the baptist did, Joseph was superior and ready to help others. John said to the Lord, "Art thou the coming one? or are we to wait for another?" (@Matthew 11:3). How could he preach Christ in that prison?
J.S. He had no converts in that situation, so different from Paul and Silas. They were in prison with their feet fast in the stocks, but they preached, and the jailor was converted.
J.T. Look at the Lord Jesus; as we were saying, He was in prison from the time of His arrest. He spoke the truth to Pilate, to Caiaphas, and to the thief on the cross; He converted the latter and that day he was with Him in Paradise. That is the idea. It is what one may do in prison; but John the baptist could do nothing while in unbelief. With Paul and Silas it is faith working through love in suffering and limitation.
F.H.L. With John in Patmos there was much for God.
J.T. See what he did there! That is another excellent example. You get it constantly through the Scriptures. Take the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. See what happened in the fiery furnace!
A.N.W. How interesting that the first male convert in Europe should have been a *prison* keeper!
A.F.M. It is remarkable that through Joseph, in those prison conditions, the question of good and evil was to a large extent solved; that is, in the butler and the baker. Then it comes out later with regard to Pharaoh's two dreams -- the seven years of good, and the seven years of evil.
J.T. Also out of this prison the thought of the
{134}
cup is developed. Pharaoh's cup is the introduction in Genesis of an idea; that thought runs right through Scripture and enters into the Lord's supper. Joseph was where the *king's prisoners* were kept. I apprehend they were not ordinary prisoners, but represent Christians who are under the discipline of God. It is a remarkable kind of position, and Joseph immediately gained favour with "the chief of the tower-house", and is at once promoted. It was not a very rigorous prison. I doubt not that Christians of any spiritual account have experienced that prison, or what corresponds with it now.
J.S. Is that how the apostle Paul would regard himself -- "I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you", (@Ephesians 4:1).
J.T. That is right. He was one of the king's prisoners. First, he was "prisoner *of* the Christ Jesus", (@Ephesians 3:1). He was not merely a prisoner of Caesar, although he had appealed to Caesar. Then he was "prisoner *in* the Lord", (chapter 4:1). It worked out thus. The Lord was keeping him in prison for Himself and for the saints.
J.S. Because of the testimony.
J.T. Quite so; we have the greatest things coming forth from that prison; the epistles to the Philippians, Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Timothy are examples of this.
W.F.K. Joseph said to the butler, "Only bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well with thee, and deal kindly, I pray thee, with me", (verse 14). How do you apply that to Christ?
J.T. That applies to you when you are in prison. The Lord requests that when you are released you might think of Him. He would impress you with the fact that He has been there too. This prison in Egypt is a remarkable place; the king's prisoners are confined there, and Joseph was promoted there and everyone is under his hand. Then the cup-
{135}
bearer and the baker of the king are put in custody there; and what comes to light is a dream of a vine and the king's cup; and further, a dream of bread and all manner of victuals for Pharaoh that the baker makes. It is what you might speak of as the bread and the cup. The butler is released and the baker is hanged. All that is very searching, because it comes to light in the prison; in the place of testing I find that I have not been ministering to Pharaoh, that the things I made were of my *head*, and exposed, so that Satan came and took them away.
C.A.M. That is very striking. Will you say more about that? Paul and Silas at Philippi did not have the truth merely in their heads, but in their hearts, and the atmosphere of liberty came into the prison.
J.T. In prayer, they sang praises to God. The king's prison, I think, discloses where we are in our service; we must look at Pharaoh here as *supreme*, and as typical of God Himself. But what have I ministered to Him? Is it a head matter or a heart matter? That is the question for our consciences.
J.S. It will not do if what is presented is a mere mental thing. We must have our minds controlled by our hearts.
J.T. That is the thought. According to his dream, the butler pressed the grapes into Pharaoh's cup, and hence he is restored.
A.F.M. What the butler gave to Pharaoh, having pressed the grapes into Pharaoh's cup, would be *fresh*.
J.T. That is very important. The Lord's supper is not stale; what is celebrated in Christendom *is* stale -- the same forms and words are used today that were in use three hundred years ago; whereas freshness should mark every celebration of the Lord's supper. The grapes are, as it were, pressed into the cup as the saints are rightly in assembly.
W.G.T. Why is the bread not presented?
J.T. The bread in the Lord's supper represents
{136}
Christ's body in which the will of God was effected. The baker did not answer to this. What marked Christ as Man was the doing of the will of God. He says, "thou hast prepared me a body ... Lo, I come ... to do, O God, thy will". (@Hebrews 10:5,7) Romans is the great epistle for young Christians to become grounded in; it results in: "I myself with the mind serve God's law", (@Romans 7:25). That is a fundamental element in the soul with a view to functioning in the assembly.
A.R. I notice with regard to the vine here, there is development until you get the ripened grapes. Might it suggest what is seen in the Lord Jesus?
J.T. Yes. He is "the true vine". It is a question of how the truth works out now, spiritually. The cup is the love side. There is the energy of life here "its blossoms shot forth, its clusters ripened into grapes", (verse 10). Joseph carries forward the thought of the cup afterwards, when he puts his cup into Benjamin's sack. We have to link this on spiritually, so that Joseph's cup tested the brethren as to where they were. The one in whose sack it was found had to go back to be tested in Joseph's presence and be retained by him. This leads to the disclosure of Joseph's relation to the sons of Israel.
C.A.M. That helps us to understand Joseph's remark in chapter 44:15. He puts it in the form of a question.
J.T. Just so. Such a man as he divined.
W.B-w. Do you look at Joseph from one point of view as a bondman; and then from another as a free man? The latter seen in the liberty in which he was spiritually.
J.T. He is free as superior to his circumstances. There is the gradual emerging on moral lines until he is ruling Egypt. We have to follow the Spirit's trend. There is a wonderful opening up of the truth typically in this prison.
{137}
A.F.M. Would the three days that are frequently mentioned with regard to these two bondmen refer in any way to the resurrection of Christ? "And it came to pass the third day -- Pharaoh's birthday -- that he made a feast to all his bondmen", (chapter 40:20). It was the third day that the butler's liberation came into effect.
J.T. The resurrection of Christ brought release and clarity typically to the butler. The three days would be *completed* exercise as to what is presented. The hanging of the baker on that day would, I suppose, allude to the judgment of God in the cross on what the baker represents.
A.P. Does it infer that there was not a work of God in the baker's soul?
J.T. I think so. The hanging is a type of God's condemnation of what is seen in him. His products were not preserved for the king, but taken by the enemy. Abraham had set an example of what God approves in such circumstances. He watched his sacrifice, so that when the birds came he scared them off. That is carefulness as to what you offer to God.
N.F.P. For this a measure of divine formation in our souls is needed.
J.T. Yes; the things of God are too precious to be exposed to the enemy. "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted", (@2 Timothy 1:14). Keep it by the *Holy Spirit*. The baker was not doing that typically.
W.G.T. Three baskets would not suggest one loaf.
J.T. No; it is just the general principle that the kind of humanity suggested is not according to God. General principle also applies.
A.P. It says in @Deuteronomy 28:26, "And thy carcase shall be meat unto all the fowl of the air", referring to those who disobeyed the voice of Jehovah.
J.T. Which shows what is meant here. The verse
{138}
says further, "there shall be no man to scare them away".
A.R. The cup would suggest what is circumscribed. The basket is something open. There is a difference, is there not?
J.T. Open vessels are always exposed. So that in the types, if one dies in the house, the open vessel is rendered unclean; even the wagons that the Levites had for carrying the heavy things of the tabernacle, were covered.
G.MacP. Would not the butler's forgetfulness correspond with many believers at the present time?
J.T. Yes; he was asked by Joseph to remember him, but he did not. Many do not remember the Lord according to His wish, although they owe all to Him; Joseph said, "bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well with thee", (verse 14).
A.R. The recovery of the butler was in the cup. The recovery for the brethren is in Joseph's cup. It is a silver cup. Is there something in that?
J.T. There is; it is a further thought, involving the claims of love. The true brother, the overcomer, is brought to light in Benjamin. It was in Benjamin's sack that the cup was found, and that brought to light the brethren. They are restored on these lines, and recovery of what is for God today is in relation to the Lord's supper. It is a test as to whether one loves the Lord. If I love Him, I want to remember Him. The butler forgot Joseph.
C.A.M. This is testimony to what God gets out of prison conditions. At first sight it looked as if the enemy had the advantage, but subsequently we see that God gains immensely out of it.
J.T. The cup has a great place; even though the butler forgot Joseph, the thought is carried forward in chapter 44, where the cup effects much. It brings Benjamin to light, the true brother. Benjamin had never done anything against Joseph; he is the overcomer,
{139}
and the cup is found in his sack, which was an advantage to him, for it led to the brethren coming to light in Judah, and to Joseph making himself known to them. The Lord's supper is contemplated in this section.
A.P. Would you say that the greater part of Christendom is represented in the cup-bearer, who had received a measure of light from Joseph but did not go on to the remembrance?
J.T. Christendom has forgotten Christ; as was said of Moses, "the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt -- we do not know what is become of him!" (@Exodus 32:1).
W.G.T. Many professing Christians have disregarded the covenant. There was, in a sense, a covenant between Joseph and the cup-bearer.
J.T. If he had been a man with a heart, he would never have forgotten such a benefactor.
A.R.S. Do you mean that Christians today that are not remembering the Lord through His supper have forgotten Him?
J.T. Yes. It is His appointed way of remembering Him.
A.F.M. As regards the order of the Lord's supper, whatever instructions are given in the synoptic gospels, they are all put together in what the Lord indicated to Paul from heaven; nothing is left out; as if the full thing should be before us.
J.T. Yes, that is important to remember. Paul speaks about eating and drinking as well as the memorial. The Lord, in instituting His supper, did not eat and drink of it; He formally separates the Supper in Luke from the passover, of which He had partaken. The eating and drinking is Matthew's side.
A.R. In referring to the recovery; do we come to a point where the feelings of the Lord Jesus come into evidence typically? Scripture says, "And Joseph could not control himself before all them that
{140}
stood by him, and he cried, Put every man out from me!" (chapter 45:1). Would it imply the intimacy of Christ's relation with His brethren when He said, "Come near to me", (verse 4)?
J.T. The Lord's supper is intended to bring us to that point. That is a collective idea between the Lord and His own. It may be that there are persons in the room that are unconverted, but they cannot enter into the spiritual side.
J.H.E. Is there a spirit of judgment in this king's prison? The chief of the bakers is taken from it and hanged. The book of Revelation also shows this spirit of judgment.
J.T. Yes; here it is not only a place of penalty, but of light involving judgment.
F.H.L. Out of this prison came the "Saviour of the world", which is implied in the name Pharaoh gave to Joseph.
J.T. Quite so. Now another view of Joseph is his tribal relation. It comes in late in the blessing in chapter 49, but he gets the greatest place. The archers shot at and hated him; he is a fruitful bough by a well; his branches shoot over the wall. He is not a narrow-minded brother; his outlook is wide; he is not stinted, but is by a well, where there is a constant supply of refreshment. Why then should he be shot at? This is another view of Christ and of the saints, too, but as prospered. If the Spirit is recognised, there is fruitfulness, and if fruitful, why should saints in such circumstances be shot at? That is another consideration.
J.S. Are the Gentiles in view here in connection with the branches going over the wall?
J.T. That is the principle. It is the largeness of view. We are not narrow in our outlook.
C.A.M. Why should the Lord or the saints be shot at? That seems to be the point.
{141}
A.F.M. The more prosperous the saints are, the more they are persecuted.
J.T. Exactly. It says, "Joseph is a fruitful bough; A fruitful bough by a well; His branches shoot over the wall. The archers have provoked him, And shot at, and hated him; But his bow abideth firm, And the arms of his hands are supple By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob. From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel".
J.S. Was not the Lord shot at in the fulfilment of this in @Luke 4, as He spoke in the synagogue of Nazareth and began to testify of the blessing of God outside of Judaism?
J.T. Yes. Then they led Him up to the brow of the hill to cast Him down.
C.A.M. I suppose an archer is a *distant* enemy. People who attack in this way are not near the blessing.
J.T. Yes, I suppose that is what archery means spiritually. It is a means of attack from a distance.
A.N.W. It is rather remarkable that the combat in @Ephesians 6, in which there is wrestling, should also have darts, which suggest a long-distance attack.
J.T. In warfare generally you have hand-to-hand conflict as well as artillery. Wrestling is a very hand-to-hand matter. Close combat tests us most, but there is the long-distance conflict, too, which is harrowing.
G.MacP. Would you mind saying a word distinguishing between Joseph being in prison and being a fruitful bough by a well?
J.T. The position at the well implies the Spirit,
{142}
prominent in Genesis. The Lord in @Luke 4:18 says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me". There He is a fruitful bough by a well. He is serving in the power of the Spirit.
W.G.T. Saul was brought down by the archers at the end of 1 Samuel; whereas David taught the men of Judah the use of the bow.
J.T. David is a man that learned by experience. Archery was known early; Ishmael was an archer. Jacob also, for he speaks of using his bow against the Amorite (@Genesis 48:22), and here in chapter 49:24 it is said that Joseph's "bow abideth firm". Ishmael would attack the fruitful bough by a well; as born after the flesh, he persecuted him that was born after the Spirit.
A.N.W. Joseph has his own bow, and it abode in strength, and he was victorious.
J.T. God is never at a disadvantage. The enemy can never outdo Him in weapons or in any strategy of war, and He always chooses His own battlefield and weapons.
R.D.G. Is it not remarkable that Joseph is outstandingly superior, whether in his father's house, in Potiphar's house, in prison, or in Pharaoh's house?
J.T. Very true. Writing also has the character of a long-distance weapon. It was evidently present in the world before God used it; but He can take all man's weapons and turn them against him. The first record of writing we get in Scripture, as far as one knows, is in @Exodus 17, which is written for young Christians specially; on the occasion of the battle of Rephidim. The account of the battle was to be written in the book, and rehearsed in the ears of Joshua. Then later God wrote on the tables of stone, which had a widespread effect. The law convicted men everywhere. Writing, today is a long-distance weapon, and the Scriptures are a weapon in a very special way.
{143}
J.S. The word of God is said to be quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword.
A.R. In hand-to-hand combat you have no difficulty in knowing where the enemy is. In long-distance warfare there is often difficulty in locating him.
J.T. That is right. But the arrow "at a venture" reached Ahab. That is divine archery; the word of God does not return void to Him; it always reaches its object.
A.F.M. Two thoughts would be found here: "But his *bow* abideth firm, And the *arms* of his hand are supple By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob". The bow is held in the hand and needs strength to keep it firm, but accuracy of aim is also needed.
J.T. Quite so; the suppleness would imply dexterity in handling the weapon, supported by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob.
C.A.M. It is remarkable about Ahab, because as far as the archer was concerned, the bow was shot at a venture, but God directed the arrow accurately.
J.T. That is the ground you take in preaching the gospel. You do not know what is going on in the hearts of your hearers, but God knows.
Rem. Here it says Joseph was shot at. It does not say that he was hit. Of the assembly, it says that "hades gates shall not prevail against it", (@Matthew 16:18).
J.T. They took the Lord out to the brow of the hill to cast Him down, but they did not do it. "He, passing through the midst of them, went *his* way", (@Luke 4:30).
F.H.L. This military feature of Joseph is striking.
J.T. It is a very fine passage, referring to Christ as suffering in this way; but He overcomes in the conflict. "From thence is the shepherd, the stone of
{144}
Israel". He will take care of the sheep, and being "the stone of Israel", things are stable.
A.P. Does Joseph represent the highest feature of truth in the idea of fruitfulness, and is he thus the particular object of the enemy's attack?
J.T. Comparing this passage with @Deuteronomy 33 -- Moses blessing of the tribes -- we see that Joseph represents Ephesians, the heavenly side of the truth, but in the tribal setting. Moses sees the land as occupied anticipatively by the tribes; Ephesians contemplates heaven with the saints in it. It is a great thing to be able to bear the attack of the enemy and hold your ground, as Joseph did in relation to the tribes, that is, in relation to the saints.
A.N.W. What did you mean when you spoke about Joseph representing Ephesians tribal-wise?
J.T. Well, it is the Lord seen in relation to the tribes. It is the *love* setting. @John 17 is that He has the saints with Him.
J.S. So the blessing of Joseph comes in here in relation to the other tribes.
J.T. Yes; and he holds his ground as attacked. "Let these go away", the Lord said; (@John 18:8). He protected the brethren, confronting the enemy alone.
J.S. So He is the Stone of Israel. *All* are included.
J.T. Yes; a permanent order of things would now be established, which opens up the truth of the assembly.
{145}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (8)
@Exodus 2:1 - 16; @Exodus 32:15 - 19; @Numbers 12:1 - 10; @Numbers 16:1 - 4
J.T. Our consideration of the sufferings of Christ at this time refers specially to those who are engaged in the ministry. Moses represents those who minister amongst the saints. He is said to have been faithful in all God's house, and it is in that connection that he is envied and spoken against by his sister Miriam and his brother Aaron. We should bear this in mind, for the sufferings Moses endured illustrate the sufferings endured by those engaged in serving the saints, as amongst them.
A.P. Do his sufferings here link with those of his parents, occasioned by the edict of Pharaoh seen in chapter 1?
J.T. Yes; all parents in Israel suffered with regard to the male children at that time. Stephen says their infants were *cast out*, showing the vehemence of the attack of Satan on them. Moses, too, was cast out; (@Acts 7:21). The Lord Himself suffered from infancy.
A.F.M. Do you refer to the statement, "the boy wept"? Not so much from a point of intelligence as from sensitiveness, feeling his lonely position.
J.T. I think the weeping is mentioned to show he had part in the suffering. The Lord had part in the sufferings, too, He was laid in a manger.
A.N.W. Would you touch on the suffering that he *chose*? "Choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God than to have the temporary pleasure of sin", (@Hebrews 11:25). That would be in contradistinction.
J.T. "When Moses was *grown* ... he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens", (@Exodus 2:11). It was deliberately choosing affliction with
{146}
the people of God; becoming identified with them. The passage says, further, "he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, *one of his brethren*". I think the "reproach" (@Hebrews 11), lies in the word "Hebrew". The people of God were despised, but he was a prince, so that he is choosing now not only to be with his brethren, but to suffer with them in their position.
A.F.M. According to @Hebrews 11:24, he "refused to be called son of Pharaoh's daughter". Would this movement with regard to his brethren follow upon that?
J.T. I suppose his refusal to remain in the court of Pharaoh was involved in his going "out to his brethren"; he looked on their burdens and identified himself with them, which meant that he would have to break with the royal house.
C.A.M. It is remarkable that sufferings in very infancy should include the Lord, as you were saying. The mother-heart of Israel wept in connection with Him. There is a connection with the weeping here.
J.T. "Rachel weeping for her children" (@Matthew 2:18), was the outcome of Herod's attack on Christ as a little Child. The weeping of Moses here when he was "cast out" was before he had any intelligence as to the position, but God put him in the way of suffering; he was sharing in it already, as many children of Christian parents do now. They have the advantage of being "holy" (@1 Corinthians 7:14), and necessarily suffer with their parents. They naturally do not like it, but in later years when the Lord is known by them, and they identify themselves with Him as Moses did, they will value the fact that they had the privilege of sharing in the sufferings of the testimony from their infancy.
R.W.S. Moses was "fair to God" -- what a suggestive background to his suffering!
J.T. There was *something* there which the enemy would persecute.
{147}
A.R. In @Hebrews 11 it says the parents hid him three months. Is that like the Lord being hid, (@Matthew 2)? He was taken to Egypt by Joseph to be out of Herod's reach.
J.T. Yes. Moses parents valued him, "because they saw the child beautiful" -- the mother's exercise is prominent here.
A.F.M. Is the position of Moses in the river equal to the position of believers children today, in that they have been put into the place of death? Moses mother anticipated his being thrown into the river by placing him there in the ark.
J.T. Yes; the ordering of God is, I think, illustrated here in behalf of young people whose parents are in the testimony. God orders it that they should have part in suffering early, which would be to their credit.
F.H.L. Pharaoh's daughter recognised a *Hebrew* child, and I suppose the world should take account of our children as belonging to the people of God.
A.N.W. Are you allying this suffering with the servant, or has it a different phase?
J.T. It is the suffering of a potential servant. God takes account of what a man is to be, knowing the end from the beginning. Paul speaks of God setting him apart from his mother's womb.
A.P. Are you suggesting that "one of the *Hebrews* children" is under reproach?
J.T. Yes; such are in reproach in the world. You get the word 'Hebrew' involving reproach in Egypt, more frequently in this section than in any other.
J.S. I suppose the change really comes about in the opening of Exodus. Another king arose that knew not Joseph; hence the testimony is under reproach, and it was under those conditions Moses was born.
J.T. Yes; that is how Stephen links this period with the general history. Under these conditions of
{148}
reproach Moses was born, and became an outcast. That is the principle; his parents being identified with the testimony occasions this suffering position. The man in @John 9 was an outcast, in keeping with the position of Christ at that time.
J.S. In the end of Genesis the testimony was in favour, but here you have a complete change of government. The testimony of God is in reproach today, which brings about suffering, if we are identified with it.
J.T. The children of parents in the testimony suffer; it is an advantage they have as having such parents.
C.A.M. God encouraged Jeremiah at the outset -- He thought of him before he was born.
J.T. Just so. "Before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee, I appointed thee a prophet unto the nations", (@Jeremiah 1:5).
A.F.M. What would you suggest to help our young in such circumstances? Of course, they have to feel these things. What is the compensation for them?
J.T. Well, there are the joys of the house of God -- the music and dancing; these should be apparent. They should be regarded as potentially of it. Of course, they may not value these, but as participating with their parents in the things of God formation goes on, and upon their identification with the testimony, when they come to years, they have an education equal to it. Income has been accruing to them all the time, and they are richer than an ordinary adult convert would be.
C.A.M. This makes household baptism of great importance.
F.H.L. So the potentiality in our young is very great, and suffering rightly goes with it.
J.T. Moses gained immensely by it. The application now is where children grow up and finally do
{149}
as Moses did. When he was grown, he went out to his brethren. Young people today look at the brethren; sometimes it is to criticise them severely. They say, They are narrow and there is nothing for young people amongst them, and similar things; they are apt to forfeit their accrued wealth by these remarks, and the feelings behind them. The wealth only becomes confirmed to them as they, like Moses, when come to years, make a decision to identify themselves with the people of God. They have an income already as we said, but it will be all forfeited if they go into the world, for it is of no use *there*.
A.N.W. Being "cast out" is a wonderful qualification for Christian fellowship. Fellowship is very little understood or enjoyed unless there is something of this in our experience. The man of @John 9 qualified in that chapter for the fellowship indicated in @John 10.
J.T. Children, as breathing the godly atmosphere of the Christian household, may in one way or another witness in school, and in measure acquire the experience of being cast out; the attitude of worldly young people toward them would be, You do not belong to us.
Ques. Would you connect the thought of "grown" here with intelligence?
J.T. Yes; "grown" means maturity, and intelligence goes with it.
Rem. So that you would look for intelligence in any person that is grown.
J.T. Yes; he is mature. Moses knew what he was doing as grown. Earlier he did not know, but he wept, showing that he *felt* things.
W.G.T. In the house of Pharaoh he would have every comfort; whereas, among the brethren it was a question of burdens.
J.T. Yes; there was nothing for the flesh in such conditions. Moses well knew what the Israelites had to go through at that time, but "he went out to his
{150}
brethren and looked on their *burdens*". Young people generally shrink from the burdens of the saints. Moses looked on them, undoubtedly with a view to *sharing* them.
A.P. Would not the nursing time until he had grown and was brought to Pharaoh's daughter have a great bearing on his later choice?
J.T. I think so. It was in the ordering of God that he was given to his mother to nurse.
A.MacN. Does the word to Timothy sustain what you are speaking of with regard to young believers?
J.T. Yes. He is a choice New Testament example of one who had to do with the testimony from his infancy. Paul could say to him, "that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters", (@2 Timothy 3:15). We should emphasise this point, because there are so many young people amongst us now, and this thought of Moses and of Timothy applies to them from the outset. They have to be taken account of potentially. In after years Moses would look back to his position in the river and say, I am thankful that I suffered from the outset. God honoured him in that way, for it was a great matter. It would enter into his constitution in view of his service; God would also turn to account what he had received from his mother in his early days.
J.S. So that his decision, having come to years, to cast in his lot with the suffering people of God, would really justify his childhood training.
W.G.T. Would this going out to his brethren mark a crisis in his history?
J.T. It was a crisis, and he was moving rightly in it. Pharaoh's daughter "called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water". She is presented as saving Moses and becoming his foster-mother, but her counter influence notwithstanding, did not stifle the instincts divinely developed
{151}
in him in his youth. Thus the Spirit goes on to say: "when Moses was grown, ... he went out to his brethren and looked on their burdens". That is a very fine record. He would know well enough from the conversations in the palace the reproach in which the Hebrews were held, but at length he went out to them as his brethren and looked on their burdens.
A.P. It is not a little remarkable that the feature of assuming burdens should be taken on by Moses as belonging to the levitical family before it is officially given a place.
R.W.S. It is a beautiful touch that Stephen gives to the movement of Moses here, making it a heart matter. He says, it came into his *heart* to look upon his brethren.
A.N.W. Moses "saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren" -- not one of *the* brethren.
J.T. That is a beautiful touch. Oftentimes young people say, We belong to the brethren. It may be they do not care much about having to say it, but feel they have to say something. Sometimes they even call them the Plymouth brethren, which makes them a sect and discredits the testimony; but with Moses it was "an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew"; those despised people, to Moses, were his brethren.
G.MacP. What element would Pharaoh's daughter represent?
J.T. She was not to be despised. To a point she was Moses saviour, and was of a different mind to Pharaoh, her father. She drew Moses out of the water, and gave him a name which conveyed this act; light was in it. She also acceded to the suggestion of Moses sister, so that he was returned to his mother.
J.S. I suppose we see God's overruling and providing hand in Pharaoh's daughter.
{152}
J.T. I think so. There was something of moral value in her. She was not governed by her father's influence, for Moses became her son. Of a race despised, the objects of murderous persecution, she sympathised with him, and took him as her son. She represents elements that God uses providentially; which are favourable to a point.
F.H.L. Moses mother coming in at the outset of Moses life, had a very formative effect on him; so today it is a question of affections being formed in the young, so that they may recognise the brethren as *their* brethren.
J.T. There is thus a very great deal of practical instruction in this passage. As regards our subject, Moses suffers first as a babe, and now he suffers as a grown-up man from his brethren. It is a sorrowful consideration that those whom he would serve, persecuted him. This marked his whole life, as we shall see later.
Stephen says, "He that was wronging his neighbour thrust him away, saying, Who established thee ruler and judge over us?" (@Acts 7:27). God links this with Moses commission, saying, "This Moses, whom they refused, saying, Who made thee ruler and judge? him did God send to be a ruler and deliverer with the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush", (@Acts 7:35). All this shows that Moses in suffering represents those who serve the saints.
J.S. As misunderstood here.
J.T. Exactly; but then it was the man who *did wrong* that caused the suffering. You may be sure if there is persecution of a servant, there is some previous unrighteousness in those who persecute.
C.A.M. Not in the servant.
J.T. No, but in those that persecute him; here the man that did the wrong is the persecutor.
C.A.M. Satan has thus something to work on.
{153}
Rem. The Lord when here was persecuted much from His brethren in connection with service.
J.T. Yes that is the point we are at here. Moses is on that side; it is a question of those who are formally in the service of God.
W.G.T. David delivered Keilah, but the people there turned round and sought to deliver him up to Saul.
J.T. Quite so; the men of Judah, in like manner, delivered Samson to the Philistines.
W.B-w. Moses smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. What would that represent?
J.T. He had a wrong point of view as to the deliverance. God intended to deliver them in another way. The excellency of the power was to be His and not man's.
W.B-w. Moses had to learn what the flesh was. He had not learned that at this point.
J.T. The dead Egyptians were not to be hidden in the sand, but to be exposed on the seashore as testimony of the judgment of God.
J.H.E. Peter would be on that line when he cut off the servant's ear. He would smite with the sword, but the Lord says, "Return thy sword to its place", (@Matthew 26:52).
J.T. Quite. But at the same time Moses understood that God would use him; his brethren did not. Many a servant is misunderstood, yet knows himself that he has a mission from the Lord, even though the brethren do not know it, and he suffers accordingly.
Rem. Was that the case with the Lord -- His mother and Joseph had sought Him sorrowing, and found Him in the temple? He says to them, "Why is it that ye have sought me? did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?" (@Luke 2:49). He was totally misunderstood even there.
{154}
J.T. But He was already conscious of being here on His Father's business.
A.R. If Moses brethren had been with God, they would have recognised that he was their deliverer.
J.T. I think so. They would have said, There is something in this. Why should a prince of the house of Pharaoh come out to us? This is worth inquiring into.
A.P. @Acts 7 would substantiate that; the onus of the refusal was on *their* part.
J.T. Yes. Stephen, in his arraignment of Israel, links it up with their resistance of the Holy Spirit.
A.N.W. The whole burden of Stephen's address placed the responsibility of their resistance to God on the persecutors.
C.H.H. In all this Moses corresponds strikingly with Joseph. He had "genuine feeling" for the people of God, although suffering from them. The word of the Lord tried Joseph in the meantime.
J.T. This shows what younger brothers who seek to serve might have to endure through being misunderstood, but if they have a commission, it is to be discerned and will not be revoked; thus they may well submit, and patiently wait on God. It is for them, of course, to commend themselves, and to show themselves approved of God.
F.N.P. Moses was allowed to remain forty years in Midian. Was that to complete his education, and to verify that he was Israel's delivered?
J.T. Yes. The number forty has a great place in this section of Scripture; the forty years that Israel sojourned in the desert are all reckoned and are valuable; although Israel used much of that time in lawlessness, but God used every minute of it for Israel's good. This applies also to the forty years Moses spent in Midian.
{155}
J.S. Has Moses to begin his forty years over again in Midian?
J.T. That is the way the truth stands. He went to Midian and *sat by the well*. He thus made a good start there, meaning that he depended upon something outside of himself. "The excellency of the power" (@2 Corinthians 4:7) now is to be of God.
C.A.M. Do you mean he was to be there those forty years in view of being commissioned to lead the people of God forty years through the desert?
J.T. Yes; I think God saw that he needed that, but according to Stephen he had knowledge of it already himself, so that the word of the Lord would try him as it tried Joseph. The word of the Lord would be the understanding we have from the Lord as to our path in service.
A.R.S. Moses weapons are to be spiritual, not carnal.
J.T. I think that is what is meant in sitting by the well. The Holy Spirit is to be the power in him.
A.F.M. In @Hebrews 11:27 it says of Moses, "By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king", which was a good finish to that phase of his service.
J.T. @Exodus 2:15 says, he "fled from before Pharaoh", but the Spirit of God says, he did *not fear* the wrath of the king, "for he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible", (@Hebrews 11:27). His whole history proves this.
A.F.M. It was clearly at this time, in affection for Christ, that he turned his back on Egypt. It says, "esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he had respect to the recompense", (verse 26).
J.T. Yes. All these cases should be read in the light of the New Testament. That is where we get the spiritual touches as to the mind of God -- what underlay the happenings as God saw them.
{156}
A.F.M. Where do you think the thought of sovereignty in the selection of the servant came home to Moses? He must have had a sense at some particular time of his call.
J.T. I think he had it in mind as he went out to his brethren. Stephen, in @Acts 7, would indicate that God had communicated to him in some sense that he was to be the deliverer.
F.H.L. We see that he had lost a lot of self-confidence at the end of the second forty years. He says, "Who am I, that I should go?" (@Exodus 3:11).
J.T. I think he lost ground in a way, too. Very often we become unduly timid. It is well to keep a good balance. Whilst God breaks down our wills, He does not intend to weaken our faith and confidence in Himself, and consequent assurance.
R.W.S. What value do you place on the first forty years?
J.T. It was a mixed experience. The early influence of the parents, I think, gave him a great advantage. Our young people should see today in their parents houses what an advantage there is in the way of influence and formation before they have much knowledge of the truth, their constitution being built up and affected by the influence of a godly house.
A.R. Coming into fellowship, they can be effective from the outset in serving the saints.
J.T. In Moses there was in this way, what overcame the influence of the court. "Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds" (@Acts 7:22); but the early training through grace overcame all that.
A.MacN. The second forty years were, no doubt, needed to fully prepare Moses for his service as deliverer and to prepare the people for deliverance.
J.T. Yes. God saw what was necessary; it was no accident, Moses being in Midian or Israel being still in Egypt. God overrules all circumstances, and
{157}
He turned these fresh exercises into account. It was necessary for Moses to go through these forty years in Midian, and it is remarkable what a spirit he manifested; he looked after the sheep of another, without the slightest suggestion of any thought of wages. Jacob wanted wages, but Moses had no such thought. I believe during all that period, he was developing unselfishness which God would use.
W.G.T. Paul was some time in Arabia. He would be developing similar sensibilities.
A.F.M. Sitting by the well in Midian was a good start for the second forty years upon which Moses was entering.
J.T. The whole forty years are in keeping with it. He had slain an Egyptian, but there is nothing of that in Midian. There is no evidence that he used violence towards the shepherds. He helped Jethro's daughters to water the flock, and the Holy Spirit says, he consented to dwell with Jethro, which implied that there was something in him naturally that resisted that thought, but he was subject and accepted the circumstances.
J.S. The first forty years would not be lost after coming under the Lord's hand in Midian. God could now effectually use his prior education.
A.F.M. Do you think that the crowning feature of these second forty years is seen in Moses leading the flock and coming to the mountain of God where he saw the burning thorn-bush -- and yet it was not consumed?
J.T. I think it was God coming in at that juncture and honouring the formation that was there.
A.R. Before he came to that point, he was tending the flock of Jethro. Would that go with what you have been saying, that all that was selfish had been judged by him?
J.T. Quite; the flock he tended was never his own flock. Jacob acquired a flock under similar circumstances
{158}
A true minister among God's people today never thinks of acquiring a flock; the clerical idea of "my flock, my people", is a false thought. The true servant cares for the flock of God.
A.B.P. Would that link on with what Moses said to Jehovah later -- "thy people"?
J.T. Exactly.
A.P.T. Does Moses synchronise with Paul up to the point where the Lord appeared to him? Moses slew the Egyptian, Saul slew the saints, both thinking they did God service.
J.T. I think there was something in Saul that condemned him, indefinable, possibly, to himself. He says, he persecuted the saints ignorantly in unbelief. The Lord says, "it is hard for thee to kick against goads", (@Acts 26:14). There was something going on inwardly in him which the Lord noticed; and then instead of occupying him with the saints one by one, He occupies him with them *all*, saying, "why dost thou persecute *me*?" (@Acts 9:4). That is, *one* idea, which is the germ of the mystery put into his soul at the very outset. His training from that point was very much like that of Moses, including the period in Arabia, until he was formally commissioned.
A.N.W. Tell us again why you place such importance on this word "by the well".
J.T. Because the Spirit of God mentions it in that way. The article is before "well". "Moses ... dwelt in the land of Midian. And he sat by *the* well". There must have been several wells in Midian, but spiritually there is only one. It refers to the Spirit. "Sitting" would denote a *permanent* attitude of mind.
Rem. Corresponding with "What shall I do, Lord?" (@Acts 22:10).
J.T. Just so; added to that is the word of
{159}
Ananias that the Lord had sent him to Saul that he might be filled with the Holy Spirit.
A.N.W. You made a remark that Moses activities in Midian were not formally in opposing the shepherds, but in the support of what was of God. What a difference there would be in church history if that had been maintained throughout!
J.T. Moses position suggests the *positive* side; occupation with the flock was enjoined on the elders of Ephesus -- "Shepherd the assembly of God".
F.H.L. What is said of Gershon by Moses, as naming him is in the light of his return to his brethren.
J.T. Yes, he was a *stranger* in Midian.
We have now to go to chapter 32 -- a most distressing chapter in the history of God's people, and therefore coming into the sufferings of the true servant; even what arises amongst the saints through their lawlessness, becomes the occasion of the servant's suffering. Moses had nothing to do with this idolatry; in fact, they rejected him, saying, "for this Moses, the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt, -- we do not know what is become of him!" (verse 1). There was, of course, suffering for him in that. He had not been long away, and they saw where he had gone. It is the state of the *people* in this chapter, and its results in causing suffering to those who serve. It is of great importance to see that this is the order of the day for those who are in the service of God. Paul, in speaking of the mercy shown to Epaphroditus, regarded it as mercy shown to *himself*, saying, "that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow", (@Philippians 2:27).
A.P. Would you connect the thought of Moses anger here with suffering?
J.T. Think of the *feelings* he must have had, in being compelled to break the tables! Think of what they must have been to him! We are told here expressly that they were written on both their
{160}
sides, that the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God graven upon the tables. There was nothing in the whole earth like those two tables of the covenant.
J.S. They are called "the tables of the testimony".
J.T. Think what it must have been to Moses to break them That is one item of the sufferings. This section, chapters 32 and 33, is full of what a servant who is for God has to endure -- not because of what he does or has done, but because of the state of the people and what they do.
A.F.M. He had no command to break the tables; yet he does it instinctively.
J.T. Well, what could he do with them? It brought out clearly that he was not the Messiah. Had he been the Messiah, he would have had the testimony in his *heart* and would die to establish it. He was just a man of like passions with ourselves, but real and inexpressible sufferings were endured by Moses in spirit, who took God's side of the position. The state of the people was so bad that he could not bring the tables into the camp.
C.H.H. In the presence of the effect of sin the Lord was "deeply moved in spirit", (@John 11:33). When they brought the deaf man who could not speak right, Jesus groaned; (@Mark 7:34). All this shows what servants of the Lord have to suffer.
C.A.M. You feel that also in relation with Paul.
J.T. He thought of certain ones "with tears", (@Acts 20:31). They were thinking of themselves. The servant has to go through these things, and God takes account of it. Jeremiah's eyes were consumed with tears. His lamentations are the outcome of the exercises he had to endure as a servant among God's people; because of their state and conduct.
A.F.M. In this scripture, we find that before Moses came down from the mountain, he made
{161}
intercession to God, and says, "Why, Jehovah, doth thy wrath burn against thy people?" But when he gets down to the foot of the mountain, *his* wrath burned, too, and he broke the tables. Would that show the depth of his feeling?
J.T. I think so. You can picture what terrible agony he must have endured in this crisis. Think of what it must have been to Moses, three thousand people slain in the camp, and hundreds of things like it were endured by Moses in the desert; they are endured also more or less by every true servant today. It is well to take account of those whom God puts forward in His service having to carry these things, for they are obligated to suffer and should be regarded in this light.
A.R. So that what Moses says to God on the mountain shows what exercises he went through in his own soul.
J.T. Quite so, and he is willing to be blotted out of God's book for them, as the end of the chapter shows, which enables us to see what a man he was. In this he rises to be a great type of the true Mediator.
T.H. Jeremiah says, "Remember thou mine affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and the gall. My soul hath them constantly in remembrance, and is humbled in me", (@Lamentations 3:19,20).
J.T. The Lamentations of Jeremiah are most wholesome for a servant to read. They teach us to feel with God. "Remembering thy tears", was said by the apostle to Timothy. (@2 Timothy 1:4).
R.D.G. Would you take it that Moses sufferings would be accentuated by the fact that Aaron was leader in the sin; the one with whom he had been so intimately linked as representing God to Pharaoh?
J.T. Quite so, the fact must have been most painful to Moses. This section is fairly well known to us.
{162}
We can only touch on it as showing what a servant has to go through, as with God; to take account of what is coming up every day as a result of a low spiritual state of the saints. As we *feel* these things we suffer, and that is what God values.
A.F.M. Moses kept the passover, and that must have occasioned suffering on his part; and then the position he took of being ready to be blotted out of God's book here must have caused suffering of the deepest kind.
J.T. How nearly it touches the vicarious position of Christ as ready to be blotted out of God's book! That would mean separation from God for ever for Moses, because he was but a creature. Paul says, "for I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren", (@Romans 9:3). That would mean eternal separation from Christ. It shows what a man Paul was, and that is what Moses comes to here. He would give up his eternal welfare for the sake of the people of God. What a challenge to us as to whether we can lay down our lives for the brethren; that is what a servant is called upon to do! He is in the forefront, and discerns what Satan is doing and that the saints are giving way to him, and this causes him to feel things before God.
J.S. Would you say this affection is really necessary in the servant, that he would be prepared to sacrifice himself, if it means the blessing of the people?
J.T. We cannot serve fully according to God save as we correspond with Christ; the nearer we get to the forsaking, the more we correspond with Him. That is what God had in mind here.
C.A.M. It gives a very elevated thought of the servant to see this, especially as we might think the greatness of the servant lies in the part he takes in active ministry. In making too much of the public
{163}
side we might under-estimate his greatness in the presence of God.
J.T. Exactly; I believe this is the greatest position that Moses occupied -- his saying to God that he was willing to be blotted out of His book for the sake of the people. Morally the greatest position the Lord took was when on the cross, He took it to glorify God -- to do the will of God.
{164}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (9)
@Numbers 12:1 - 10; @Numbers 14:1 - 10; @Numbers 16:1 - 24, 41 - 46
J.T. Those who will come under our attention in this reading, which makes this part of our subject especially important, are those who minister. The persons persecuted represent the ministry, which is a matter of the greatest consequence in the history of the testimony, and is inclusive of all those who in any way serve the Lord in serving the saints. The first feature of persecution to be noted here arises from near *natural relatives*, then we see it as from fellow servants -- Korah also being a Levite -- and finally from the people of God generally.
W.B-w. The word "against" seems to be characteristic in each of the three passages you read.
J.T. As in chapter 16:3: "against Moses and against Aaron". The two names are not covered by the one preposition; each person is pointed out as an object of the attack. Aaron is personally distinctive as representing the priestly side. But in chapter 12 he drops from his high office and general characteristic spirit to the level of a persecutor, showing how the most honoured of the Lord's servants may become a persecutor of another servant of the Lord.
A.P. What is the root of this difficulty?
J.T. I think it lies in their remarks in verse 2: "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only to Moses? has he not spoken also to us?" They claim equality with Moses; which God would never allow; He will not allow any distinction that He affords to a servant to be impugned. He maintains that servant in relation to the distinction He has given him, whatever others may think.
A.N.W. What is the significance of a female taking the lead in the movement?
{165}
J.T. I think it is to bring out the characteristic weakness of the female side, which had its inception in Eve. But Miriam was also a minister; she was a prophetess, and evidently fostered the feeling of rivalry against Moses more than Aaron; and it became accentuated in the taking of an Ethiopian wife. Possibly in Miriam's case there was deeper feeling on account of the marriage, a certain amount of pride; in any case, these are the elements that Satan acts upon in near relatives or in fellow servants -- persons who are more *closely* associated with us.
C.A.M. Satan seems to work where self has place. They use the word "us" here, and that seems to be a weakness.
J.T. "Has he not spoken also to us?" or "through us", as much as to say, We are on an equality. That is, they are infringing on God's sovereign appointment.
A.P. Do you think there is ofttimes a side issue brought in to cloak the real issue as in Moses marriage here?
J.T. It seems so. It may have had more weight with Miriam than with Aaron, but I think the real issue lies in what they say.
J.E.H. It does not say to whom they uttered these words; but it says immediately, "And Jehovah heard it".
J.T. "Jehovah heard it"; that is to be noted, as affording comfort to all in such cases. No doubt they did not conceal their feelings. People in this complaining state do not fail to make their criticisms known pretty generally.
W.F.K. Do you think that jealousy is the root of this trouble?
J.T. What they say discloses what had been at work. Doubtless, it extended back considerably.
A.N.W. When you speak of the family, do you mean the natural or the spiritual family?
{166}
J.T. The natural relatives who have part in the ministry are likely to be affected in such circumstances. If a servant is entirely free in himself from natural influences in his service, he is sure to suffer in this way. The Lord Himself is an example. He suffered from His relatives; even His mother at times had part in this.
A.F.M. What would be the cure for such a condition of things as we find here?
J.T. Well, the cure for all these things, of course, is drastic self-judgment. "Has he not spoken also to us?" they inquire, showing what was current in their minds. They were thinking possibly that they were not sufficiently considered by Moses; because persons in this relation are apt to be expectant of some special recognition, and disappointment arises unless it is there. In the Lord's own case His perfect spirituality implied that while He recognised nature, His life properly was outside of it. That would be for the flesh an occasion of resentment from the outset in His near relatives. The flesh, as in Ishmael, persecutes what is born after the Spirit.
J.S. You have breakdown in the priesthood here, have you not?
J.T. Well, it is very sorrowful that persecution should arise in persons in such exalted offices, the one a high priest, and the other a prophetess -- Miriam being the only prophetess mentioned up to this time.
A.F.M. Do you think that Aaron recovered from this, as evidenced in the part he took with Moses later?
J.T. Obviously; and the judgment of the Lord was directed against Miriam. The root of the evil was apparently in her.
G.McP. Do you think that Miriam's opposition suggests that the subjective state of the people was bad?
J.T. I think that is right. They had to stop
{167}
journeying until she was restored. She is singled out as a subject of the judgment of God.
W.B-w. In the New Testament, Barnabas and Paul, two ministers, found difficulty in serving the Lord together. Would that be similar to what we are now considering?
J.T. I think so. They were persons of an exalted position in the service. It was a very sorrowful thing, but it was allowed of God. So with Peter too; he, you might say, persecuted Paul as led away by those who came from James. For a time there would be a feature of persecution at Antioch.
A.F.M. Would this leprosy, *as snow*, be significant? We find in Gehazi, he was a leper similarly.
J.T. I think it is the absence of spiritual life, white hairs in the instruction as to leprosy imply the absence of life.
C.A.M. It was a thing calculated to arouse the attention of a priest. Aaron seems to be affected by it at once.
A.N.W. What is there about Aaron that succumbs to this type of failure? He succumbed to the influence of the people at the foot of the mountain, and here he succumbed evidently to the influence of Miriam.
J.T. It is a feature of *man*, in spite of the fact that he is a priest. His priestly office should have prevented it. This incident shows that the most spiritual may give way. Vigilance is needed in the most honoured of the Lord's servants, or he may come under sinister influence.
J.H.E. Do you think Paul was fortified against it? He says, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell", (@Romans 7:18).
J.T. Exactly, as *maintaining* that, he was preserved. The flesh was capable of such failure in Aaron, and is capable of the same thing in the most honoured and spiritual of the Lord's servants.
{168}
A.P. Do you think we are all aware of the important place that a minister chosen by Christ has in His service?
J.T. Perhaps not. This chapter is to remind us that in the sovereignty of God He makes distinctions amongst His servants; and, here, attention is called first of all to the kind of man Moses was. Aaron was valuable, and was commended earlier by God Himself; he was a man who had brotherly affections, a characteristic Levite. But he was not equal to Moses, meek above all the men that were upon the face of the earth. God had given Moses a distinction that no one else had, and He would not let that be ignored. Moses made no effort to defend himself here. In this he is an example for us when personally attacked. No doubt he was exceedingly distressed that the attack should come from his sister and brother. They were two of the three leaders that are spoken of later as those by whom God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt.
J.S. Why do you think *meekness* is stressed here?
J.T. I think to bring out into greater prominence what was at work. The Lord said, "They hated me without a cause", (@John 15:25). There was no cause for this attack. I believe that is why the Spirit mentions it. Besides his meekness, Moses had a distinction in the service that no other had, as Jehovah says, "If there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak to him in a dream. Not so my servant Moses he is faithful in all my house. Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah doth he behold". Jehovah was not going to let that slip. He would maintain the position, as He had ordered it.
C.A.M. God seems to assume that they would understand that Moses had that place with Him.
J.T. No doubt they did. Look at the number of
{169}
times the Spirit of God said, "Jehovah spoke to Moses"; and Moses had twice been on the mount for forty days. Aaron was on the mount, but never in the sense in which Moses was there.
F.H.L. The *servant* is stressed here -- the Lord says, "against my servant, against Moses".
J.T. Yes. His *personal* characteristic is stated first; he was not a man that lived in his service. He was personally a great man, that is, he was like Christ. The apostle says, "I ... entreat you by the *meekness* and *gentleness* of the Christ", (@2 Corinthians 10:1). It says, "But the man Moses was *very* meek".
W.G.T. This incident brings out that a servant does not need to defend himself against personal attacks.
J.T. That is the lesson to be learnt. It is for one attacked in this way to be "as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs", (@Psalm 38:14). The Lord defends such a case.
E.B. What was involved in Moses taking this woman to wife?
J.T. The Ethiopian woman is, I think, a type of the assembly in the wilderness, not in the counsels of God. The assembly in this setting is not attractive. Normally the saints will admit this fact. But the Lord takes us on, whatever others may think of us, and that, I think, is the point. It is the assembly in the wilderness, "This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness", (@Acts 7:38). As in the wilderness, she is very unlovely from the outward point of view, but there is something there that the Lord sees, that possibly others do not see. Miriam may not have seen anything pleasing in this woman, but evidently Moses did. We have only the fact here that he had taken her. There is nothing said as to her appearance; the nationality only is mentioned.
A.F.M. Moses had taken her, and that was sufficient.
{170}
J.T. The type is very clear, that if the Lord had taken us, He sees something that others do not see. Outwardly there is, alas! much that exposes the saints to criticism, but then the Lord sees the divine formation.
J.S. As those that are called out from among the nations. The Lord views the assembly in this connection.
J.T. Yes. Neither Zipporah nor this woman is presented as attractive. The assembly in the wilderness is contemplated. Moses had "taken" her, then why should Miriam or Aaron challenge what the wisest man in Israel had done? If you apply it to Christ, how evil this speaking of Miriam's and Aaron's was!
A.R.S. In reality, they were sinning against Jehovah in finding fault with Moses. Miriam's position is sorrowful here -- one who shone so well earlier, when she led the praises of the Lord's people after they crossed the Red Sea! It is a solemn lesson.
R.W.S. Did not the words of Miriam and Aaron expose them when they said, of Jehovah, "has he not *spoken* also to us?" referring to past history? Whereas of Moses, Jehovah says, "Mouth to mouth do I *speak* to him".
J.T. Quite so. What he says about him is very beautiful and really overwhelming, as to the point at issue. He says, "Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak to him in a dream. Not so my servant Moses: he is faithful in all my house. Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly, and not in riddles; and the *form of Jehovah* doth he behold". It is what is always characteristic of Jehovah's communications to His great servant.
A.F.M. Moses meekness was his greatness; hence
{171}
we all should be characterised by this quality, so that when attacks come, we may leave it to God to defend us.
A.B.P. Would you say that the worldly adornment of the professing church today is an indication of how little understood this action of Moses was? The Lord is prepared to be associated with that which is outwardly of no repute in the world. The worldly adornment only takes away from the moral greatness of it.
J.T. Yes. I think this incident is to bring out that He sees what is there spiritually, which the natural eye does not see.
W.G.T. The great intimacy that existed between Jehovah and Moses is brought out here, that would otherwise not have been disclosed.
J.T. He is a very full type of Christ here, and not like an ordinary prophet. Jehovah would speak to Moses mouth to mouth and the form of Jehovah he beheld. This is a remarkable word. We may thus understand what a man of God he was.
J.S. What do you understand by the form of Jehovah?
J.T. It is not the corresponding word to that in @Philippians 2:6, where Christ is said to have subsisted in the form of God. The form of God, in such a case, is invisible, for He is the invisible God. The form of God in the New Testament signifies what is substantial, involving His manner of existence. "Similitude" or "form" here is more external. It is what Israel did *not* see, as expressly stated in @Deuteronomy 4. Over against this, Jehovah says here of Moses, "The form of Jehovah doth he behold". "Doth" is characteristic and not merely historical, and so it may allude to what Moses saw in his immediate relations with God; probably in the holiest, into which he always had access. I suppose he is a type of Christ in this, for no one could
{172}
see God in His essential being but Jesus, who was Himself God. "No one has seen God at any time", (@1 John 4:12). The Lord says to the Jews that they had not seen the Father's "shape"; but the Lord even *as* Man had seen it. So Moses here in this respect is a type of Christ.
A.P. And does not the verse substantiate that -- "Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?"
J.T. Yes; they ought to have known how faithful and how honoured of God he was.
A.P. Is that not important today that we should know?
J.T. I think it is a principle in the testimony, that there are always those whom God puts forward, like Peter -- "*first* ... Peter". But as we see here, it is not only a matter of ability, but the kind of man -- "the *man* Moses". As appointed of God, Moses could go into the holiest at any time. The going in there would tend to make him meek.
A.N.W. That is what I thought in connection with Moses superiority in these various incidents. His nearness to God and liberty of access within gave him rightness of judgment.
A.B.P. It is also suggested that his greatness is indicated by his intimacy with Jehovah rather than his works of power?
A.N.W. "Mouth to mouth" would suggest mutuality.
J.T. Yes; that is very beautiful.
W.B-w. Evidently one's personality is greater than one's service.
J.T. "The *man* Christ Jesus" -- what He is, underlies everything; and so it is with any of us. It is a question of what we are and not of what gift we may have; our place in the testimony always works out according to what we are. The apostle says,
{173}
"But by God's grace I am what I am", (@1 Corinthians 15:10). That refers to his personality.
C.N. How does Moses remark, "Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him shall ye hearken", (@Deuteronomy 18:15), fit in with what you are saying?
J.T. It shows what a full type of Christ he was -- "like unto *me*".
A.F.M. These great typical thoughts in this chapter were, no doubt, the result of growth with Moses. He starts in a small way, but grows up to this remarkable type of Christ.
J.S. So this is a great evidence of moral development here in a servant.
J.T. It is an evidence of the wisdom of God that there was such a man; one faithful in *all* God's house. He stands higher than all other men in the Old Testament.
R.D.G. Would you say that Moses justifies God's appointment in all that God says about him, that under personal attack he immediately turns to be an intercessor?
J.T. Quite so; he is saving the position here, and that further brings out his greatness. We are to pray for those who persecute us.
J.S. Moses intercession here is the more remarkable because of the fact that Jehovah's anger is kindled against the offenders and He turns away from them.
J.T. God leaves the whole matter in suspense. He withdraws from them, so that everything now would depend on Moses. He loved the people, he loved Miriam, and Aaron, and so intercedes for Miriam.
A.P.T. At the end of verse 9 it says, "Jehovah ... went away; and the cloud departed". God, as it were, has to leave; whereas, in verse 14, through
{174}
intercession, Moses brings Him back. Is that a feature of the man of God?
J.T. Exactly; everything hinges on Moses. So right through here -- we shall see in chapter 16 that the same qualities of the man come out.
A.N.W. The Man Christ Jesus as Mediator is typically before us here.
A.P. What is the difference between the demeanour of Moses in chapter 12 and in chapter 16?
J.T. We may see now in chapter 16 another phase of suffering in the servant, in an open effort to set him aside. There is no thought in Miriam and Aaron to set Moses aside, but rather that *they* should have equality. But now there is an open attack on Moses and Aaron, as if they were governed by wretched human ambition, as if Moses were an aspirant to kingship, as a man that would lord it over God's heritage; and not only that, Dathan and Abiram say: "wilt thou put out the eyes of these men?" What an imputation to the meekest man, that he should resort to such cruelty! It is a bold effort of the devil to discredit by false accusation the man through whom God was caring for His people. That is the feature of evil that servants have to contend with. The truth is that in attacking Moses and Aaron, they would virtually overthrow the whole system that God had set up for the display of Himself.
C.A.M. In such circumstances, the question is, Who is great enough to intercede? If those that criticise what God is supporting today were to think seriously of this matter of intercession, they might dispense with their criticism.
J.T. Jehovah proposed twice in this chapter to destroy the people. First in verses 20 and 22, "Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the
{175}
spirits of all flesh! Shall *one* man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with the whole assembly?" And then in verses 44, 45, "Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Get you up from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces". The intercessory spirit is in both Moses and Aaron, here in the presence of the most terrible uprising. Typically, it is an uprising of the hierarchical system of Christendom, against Christ as Apostle and High Priest. It was a most exercising thing for Moses to go through this attack; for not only was it against him personally, but he well knew that it meant the overthrow of the whole system he had inaugurated, which would be more serious to him than anything.
A.P. Is not the essence of apostasy in all this?
J.T. Quite; it is an uprising against the whole divine system, but then Moses and Aaron have to go through it. The enemy was attacking the whole position with a view to destroying it. That is a most dreadful experience to any true servant.
A.F.M. This uprising, answering to the clerical system, has already been experienced and resisted by the assembly; so that there has been recovery to what is of God, as represented in Moses and Aaron.
J.T. That is what is so triumphant here. It says in verse 42, "it came to pass, when the assembly was gathered together against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked towards the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared. And Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting". That is, the *whole* position is secured; the tent is covered by the cloud, and the glory of Jehovah appears; then place is made for Moses and Aaron. That is the position today. However obscure outwardly, the testimony is protected, and Moses and Aaron are ministering; that is, Christ viewed as seen in them. It was a
{176}
great triumph, but then how painful the process of reaching it!
N.P. Why was the wrath of Jehovah against the whole assembly, whereas a limited number only attacked?
J.T. We read in verse 19 that "Korah gathered the whole assembly against them"; then again in verse 42: "And it came to pass, when the assembly was gathered together against Moses and against Aaron". The whole assembly was in revolt, and so today, the whole of Christendom is in revolt against Christ through the clerical system, the Levites; that is, persons who because they are preachers and teachers assumed to be priests.
J.S. This attack is from that source.
J.T. Yes; it was Korah allying himself with the sons of Reuben and others. It was a party attack. It says of Korah that he made *bold*, as originating it.
J.S. Over against this, the glory of Jehovah appeared.
J.T. That is the thing to see. We can always count on that if we are in the attitude of Moses and Aaron. They fell on their faces, and thus brought God in.
W.B-w. "Separate yourselves" -- is not that a strong feature in all this attack?
J.T. That is the point. Instead of attempting to execute discipline, we have to leave the opposing position today. The testimony is secured by the cloud, as was said, and Moses and Aaron are ministering before it.
C.A.M. It is a marvellous thing; these two men are again serving!
J.T. That is the point of triumph. The cloud covered the tent of meeting, "And Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting". They are at liberty to go back to their assigned
{177}
positions to minister there. That is our position today; we are at liberty to carry on the service of God, in remnant character.
A.F.M. Verses 47 and 48 speak of Aaron's valuable service. He stood between the dead and the living. The *living* would be the recovered ones, would they not?
J.T. Yes; Aaron shines here, acting quickly according to Moses urgent order. "They fell on their faces. And Moses said to Aaron, Take the censer, and put fire thereon from off the altar, and lay on incense, and carry it quickly to the assembly, and make atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah: the plague is begun. And Aaron took as Moses had said, and ran into the midst of the congregation", (verses 45 - 47). I think it is very beautiful to see that Christ, typically, is seen at this point. Moses urges haste, and Aaron carries out the injunction in haste. There is no delay. There is perfect accord of action between the two men.
J.S. The spirit of intercession is seen, so that, typically, Christendom is not consumed.
J.T. Quite; how great a thing it is to stand between the living and the dead! The living are preserved.
W.B-w. What does the "plague" refer to, in which 14,700 had died?
J.T. I think it would be moral death now, such as we get in Thyatira: "her children will I kill with death", (@Revelation 2:23).
J.S. Is that not in evidence today?
J.T. Yes; and the true Priest stands between the living and the dead.
W.F.K. What feature of the sufferings of Christ would this suffering of Moses represent?
J.T. The attack of Korah and his company is typically against Christ viewed as Apostle and High
{178}
Priest. It affects all those truly in the ministry, and, in principle, all the saints are affected.
A.P. It is described in verse 10, "he has brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee; and seek ye now the priesthood also? For which cause thou and all thy band are banded together against Jehovah".
J.T. Quite so. Those truly recovered now to the divine position become the subjects of this persecution.
F.H.L. The opposers accuse Moses of going to "put out the eyes of these men"; whereas *they* did that by their darkening influence.
J.T. Moses was not going to put anyone's eyes out. He would rather *open* people's eyes, like Paul did, which is a great feature of true ministry.
W.B-w. Why does it say the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the assembly?
J.T. *All the assembly* is a priestly expression. The glory appearing thus points to the shining out in these latter days of God in Christ through ministry in which all Christendom is contemplated.
W.B-w. The glory is shining for all.
A.F.M. Do you think we have Moses distinguished in chapter 12, and Aaron distinguished in chapter 16?
J.T. Aaron is greatly distinguished in chapter 16, as true in this terrible crisis, and that he stood between the dead and the living. God further honours him in taking his staff and causing it to bud and bring forth fruit. He is a living priest; that is Christ, typically.
J.S. Do we not see the recovery of the priesthood today?
J.T. Yes; there are those who are alive spiritually, thank God. The principle today is staying the plague. Presently the living will be removed, and the whole system will be left as dead.
{179}
A.N.W. Why is incense only connected with this atonement?
J.T. It is a question of what Christ is personally. That is what was obscured. There was a terrible exposure of the flesh in Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and here of the assembly. The incense emphasised is the fragrance of Christ as a Man before God. It is atonement, as by fire off the altar, but it is incense; *i.e*., Christ is as Man tested in relation to the testimony.
W.B-w. Is the plague the activity of man's will in opposition to God as in Christendom?
J.T. I think so. It is death in a moral sense. The book of Revelation enlarges upon it; it is current now, and is met by a priestly state of things among the saints.
C.A.M. It is remarkable how quickly death in this way comes in. As soon as people go against the testimony, every spark of spiritual life goes.
A.N.W. How Moses is honoured! It says, "Aaron took as Moses had said". The Spirit emphasises that. There would be the recognition of the apostolic authority in Aaron's movements.
W.G.T. The Lord is called, the "Apostle and High Priest of our confession", (@Hebrews 3:1). Would that be in keeping with this chapter?
J.T. It is Christ seen in that light, only it is worked out down here now by the Spirit. It appears in all that is authoritative according to God amongst the saints.
Now the final thought at this time is in Caleb and Joshua, (chapter 14). Moses and Aaron come in here, too, but Caleb and Joshua are specially prominent in the persecution. They represent the heavenly side of our position typically. It is a question now of whether we are heavenly men. If we are, we shall suffer peculiarly.
J.S. The heavenly side comes in after the twelve spies had gone into the land.
{180}
J.T. Yes; they had gone into the land, but Caleb and Joshua came out in testimony as to it, and their speech is beautiful.
A.P.T. Do they represent the younger element in the service that God is going to bring through?
J.T. Yes; they go into the land finally, and represent the work of God that goes right through from Egypt into Canaan; and on the way they go in and see the heavenly land for themselves, and understand what is there.
A.P. Whom do those who are ready to stone them, represent?
J.T. It says, the whole assembly said they should be stoned. How terrible it is that an attack on heavenly testimony should so spread. You have "the whole assembly" twice in chapter 16. Here we have them ready to stone the heavenly men.
A.F.M. These heavenly men were united in act and word, were they not? "They spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it out, is a very, very good land. If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land, and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey; only rebel not against Jehovah; and fear not the people of the land; for they shall be our food. Their defence is departed from them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not". In their testimony they included every Israelite.
J.T. It is beautiful to listen to persons who can talk about heaven as having been there.
A.B.P. Paul could do that.
J.T. Yes; he represents this literally. He had been caught up to the third heaven.
A.P. When Paul says, "all who are in Asia, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes, have turned away from me" (@2 Timothy 1:15), does he refer to people like these who wanted to return to Egypt?
{181}
J.T. Yes. They evidently despised, or were not prepared for, the heavenly side of the truth.
C.A.M. Is there what corresponds with this in the history of the assembly, that brings heaven into view in some way?
J.T. Ephesians represents the heavenly side of the truth. We are blessed in the heavenlies in Christ, and are said to have been raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. That is a beautiful touch. I think it corresponds somewhat with Moses view from Pisgah. He sees the land as the territory *of the tribes*; as much as to say, That is where Judah is, in the purpose of God. That is where Ephraim is in the purpose of God; and so where *all* the saints are, each having his own place in the purpose of God. We are there already in our affections and estimate of things. In our view we should see heaven full of saints. Already we are regarded as *raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies* (not *with* Christ, but *in* Christ). It is the status of the saints up there. We shall be with Him, of course, as conformed to His image, He the Firstborn among many brethren.
C.A.M. It is very interesting about Ephesians, the thought of that glorious world is brought into this present time, and lights it up.
J.T. The Holy Spirit having come down, gives us light as to the heavenly side of things; that is, those you love -- all the saints -- are there. You would not be there without one of them. In the purpose of God, they are all there. Ephesians is thus anticipative of the whole result of the work of God in the assembly. The Lord's word to Ephesus, "thou hast left thy first love", would include *love for the saints*.
J.T.Jr. Those Israelites who wanted to return to Egypt had no regard for the heavenly company.
J.T. Just so; they have no regard for the land.
{182}
What would they get in Egypt? What kind of people would they have there? Young people cast their eyes at the world longingly. Whereas when you look into the land, you find that not only are God and Christ and the Spirit and the angels there, but the saints too, those we have learnt to love down here.
C.A.M. You were alluding to John's letter to Ephesus. The fact that there is an overcomer would show that Paul's letter to Ephesus is known at the present time, would you say?
J.T. That is really the point of recovery. The saints were brought back to the heavenly side. "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones" (@1 Corinthians 15:48), not such *shall they be*; it is present and abiding.
C.A.M. The truth of Ephesians has not faded among the saints, it is being emphasised at the present moment.
J.T. I think so.
A.P. Do you think the heavenly ministry in book form, may not be read; and possibly if read, not enjoyed; would this indicate that we are bordering on the state of Israel as seen in @Numbers 14?
J.T. Yes. We have to follow what the Spirit gives us. It is very humbling when you make inquiry as to what is read, to find how little many of the saints do read ministry.
W.G.T. Would "If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us, a land that flows with milk and honey", show that Joshua and Caleb understood the Ephesian position?
J.T. Exactly; typically they grasped it; not that they could speak of Ephesians as we do, but God delights in His people and the very best is for them; and He puts them in possession of it.
A.R. Why is it that Joshua and Caleb were the only ones that went into the land?
{183}
J.T. I think, as was said, they represent the work of God, in virtue of which we reach Canaan. All that came out of Egypt did not fall in the wilderness. They represent the fact that the work of God is in agreement with the purpose of God. The purpose of God is effectuated, however many may fall in the wilderness, and that is the only way we can understand chapter 15 of this book. The chapters before and after are full of lawlessness, but in chapter 15 it is, "*when ye come into the land*". There is no doubt about it.
J.S. Would you say the testimony of Joshua and Caleb corresponds with the testimony of John's gospel?
J.T. I think so; that gospel speaks of heavenly things brought to us.
J.S. There is a character of the work of God in the man of @John 9 that subsists and goes through; and in these two, as you said, we see similar evidence of the work of God.
J.T. It is very beautiful that they could speak about the Lord delighting in Israel. He has a people He delights in and He will bring them in, for His purpose is going through.
A.F.M. Jehovah said, Your little ones, them will I bring in; an entirely new generation goes in. Is that not what we have to come to experimentally, the change from Adam to Christ? So that we, in principle, reach the brazen serpent and the springing well and journey on as set free in the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.
J.T. Yes. There are two numberings, the first is of those who came out of Egypt at Horeb; and the second is nearly forty years later, which is the numbering for the inheritance. But then there are these two men; they were not born in the wilderness, nor were they under twenty years old when they came out of Egypt; for although Joshua is called a "young
{184}
man", yet he was able to lead an army. These two represent the mature side of the work of God going right through from Egypt to Canaan.
R.W.S. What is the point of milk and honey as food, and the Canaanites being food?
J.T. I suppose the latter would be food in the sense of spiritual exhilaration of victory over the enemy. Canaan is a type of heaven to be realised at the *present* time, and hence the warfare in heavenly places. You will overcome if you are a spiritual man, as you do so it will be one continual triumph. That is food in dealing with the enemy. The apostle says, "thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ", (@2 Corinthians 2:14). It is continuous triumph. There is also the milk and the honey. There is no death connected with the producing of milk and honey. It is the food of the Messiah. There must be some allusion to Christ living on food that did not require death. Personally He was immune from death. I think that principle would apply to saints in heavenly places, as having no sinful past history.
A.P. Caleb says he was forty years old when Moses sent him to search out the land, and he says, "I brought him word again as it was in my heart", (@Joshua 14:7).
J.T. That is a fine speech, and it confirms that he was a full-grown man, as already remarked, when he came out of Egypt, as was Joshua.
F.H.L. How do we get this form of suffering as heavenly men?
J.T. I think it is that you are always conscious that the world does not like you. You are of another order and nationality. "Our commonwealth has its existence in the heavens", (@Philippians 3:20).
A.N.W. They do not mind about your going to heaven by and by.
J.T. But they do not like you *here* and *now*. This dislike by the world is brought about by persons
{185}
who recognise *no nationality here*. The retention of nationality here is inimical to this. Heaven is our land; we are like Abraham and others, of whom it was said: "Now they seek a better, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city", (@Hebrews 11:16). That is the principle of it.
{186}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST (10)
@1 Samuel 18:6 - 9; @1 Samuel 19:9 - 17; @1 Samuel 23:6 - 12
J.T. Brethren are aware that in our consideration of the sufferings of Christ in the Old Testament, we have dwelt upon certain men who suffered, beginning with Abel, and following on with Isaac, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Caleb, and Joshua. It was thought that in this reading and the subsequent ones, we should consider the *prophets*, including David, for he was a prophet as @Acts 2:30 shows. The Lord calls attention to the fact that the prophets suffered at the hands of Israel, and Stephen says, "Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?" (@Acts 7:52). So that they come in for special consideration in the New Testament, as sharers in the sufferings of Christ. David, however, was more than a prophet, he was also king. The first mention of David in the New Testament is in @Matthew 1:6; we meet him in the generations from Abraham to Christ as "David the king"; that he is to be considered also in that light, as a type of the Messiah. This affords opportunity to speak for the first time in these meetings on the sufferings of Christ in His relations with Israel as their King.
A.P. The Lord says in the end of John that He was *born* King. Do these sufferings date from that time?
J.T. He suffered peculiarly as King, the representative of the nation. Scripture says the Messiah was to be cut off, and have nothing; (@Daniel 9).
J.S. Is it jealousy of David that we see here on the part of Saul; he being superseded by David?
J.T. I thought the first verses read would show that. There was no thought on David's part to eclipse Saul, but he was already recognised as
{187}
superior. He had slain his *ten* thousands, whereas Saul is regarded as slaying only *thousands*.
A.F.M. Going back again to your remark that the Messiah was cut off and had nothing, in what part of David's life is that exemplified?
J.T. His attempted murder by Saul would correspond, but Christ actually suffered death. He was smitten by God as the Shepherd of Israel; (@Zechariah 13). David represents that side of the sufferings of Christ which culminated in His being cut off -- a side that is perhaps little understood by us.
A.F.M. You refer now to the sufferings that David endured through Saul generally?
J.T. Yes, Saul, and those who joined with him, represent the opposition that arose in Israel against their Messiah. It was envy. Scripture says that Pilate knew that the Jewish leaders delivered Him up because of envy. That was at the root of their opposition to Christ as King.
W.M. It is striking that persecution of Christ as King began almost at His birth, and then at His crucifixion, over His head was set up the superscription, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews". (@Matthew 27:37).
J.T. Yes, the magi came up (@Matthew 2) from the east to inquire about the King which had been born; this aroused Herod's jealousy, so that he "slew all the boys ... in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under" (verse 16); designing thus to destroy the King.
C.A.M. The sufferings of those who possessed the Spirit of Christ in the Old Testament would prefigure certain sufferings of the Lord Jesus in His pathway before His death, would you say?
J.T. Yes. The prophets testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow. This testimony would be seen in David, not only in word prophetically, but in actuality. He suffered as exhibiting the spirit of the King. As was
{188}
remarked, the King was attacked soon after He was born. He is sought out by those who valued Him; but Herod's animosity was aroused by the inquiry of the magi as to where Christ should be born, and learning through the priests and scribes that it was in Bethlehem, he sent the wise men there and asked them to return and report to him when they found Him; his object being to destroy the King.
A.F.M. Would you tell us just where the opposition of Absalom came in, which called forth so much suffering on the part of David?
J.T. That would be covered in our subject, but is connected with the *government* of God, on account of David's own sin. The sufferings of Christ endured by David as primarily representative of Christ as King are, I think, in the first book of Samuel, and the first verses read here give the clue to what underlie them. Those in the second book are more typical of what has occurred since His exaltation in heaven.
W.B-w. Do you link the sufferings from Saul with the sufferings from Herod?
J.T. They have the same character.
A.N.W. In both cases the antipathy is in *kings*; Saul is mentioned as king, also Herod.
J.T. They were thus qualified to be tools of the enemy in that particular line of persecution. Displacement of them arouses their hatred.
J.H.E. Herod was an Edomite, was he not?
J.T. Yes, but he acted as a Jew. Herod built the temple. He represents, I think, the spirit of Saul -- that of rivalry. The title and office he held rightly belonged to Christ.
A.F.M. So in our passage, Saul says, "and what is there more for him but the kingdom?" Does that explain it?
J.T. Yes, that verse gives the key to the position. Jonathan reminds his father that when David wrought
{189}
the great victory, he rejoiced, but these acclamations of the women in Israel provoked his envy.
W.B-w. As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistines this suffering began. Do you fit that in with any part of the Lord's life and testimony?
J.T. Well, it would be when He met the devil in the wilderness. Of course, that was not anti-typical of Goliath's death, but the devil was in principle overthrown then. There is the principle of power against the enemy from the very outset of the Lord's ministry. What these chapters 17 and 18 bring out is the *power* of David against the Philistines. However he attacked them, or whatever the circumstances, he always triumphed.
C.A.M. You were going to say something about the fact that the celebration of these women became the occasion of the opposition of Saul.
J.T. That is how the truth stands. It was hard for the flesh in Saul to endure the people ascribing superiority to David. The women doing it showed that appreciation of the true king was taking root. Presently it is said that all Israel and Judah loved David.
W.M. Do you not think there was a kind of envy when the Lord's activity was noticed by the Pharisees, and when the favour of God rested on Him, they said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance", (@Matthew 21:38). Saul had the same in his mind when he said, "and what is there more for him but the kingdom?"
A.B.P. Is not the same thing seen in the chief priests and Pharisees, saying, "If we let him thus alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation", (@John 11:48)?
J.T. Yes, it came out constantly, not only in such a man as Herod, but in the chief priests and Pharisees, who also represent the ruling class.
{190}
A.F.M. Are these women here suggestive of a subjective element in Israel? It reminds us of the women who at the Red Sea sang the chorus of the song led by Miriam.
J.T. Yes. David was already gaining the affection of the people, and that is what the ruling class -- those who are already in power -- cannot endure. As we were remarking, David suffered from his youth; even when Samuel came to Bethlehem to anoint the king, provided by Jehovah, David was not there. Why was he not there? Surely, it was the enemy that kept him away. His father was not equal to the moment, neither were his brothers. This is often the case today, that a meeting is not equal to Christ; it is wanting in what is needful for His presence. Jehovah said to Samuel, "go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons ... And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee", (@1 Samuel 16:1 - 3). Samuel went, and instead of waiting for the Lord to tell him, he began at once to select Eliab. He did not wait for Jehovah that is, he was below the standard. He did not wait, and that is, I think, a reminder to us that if Christ is to command our affections, there must be the spirit of waiting with us. Samuel would anoint Eliab; but Jehovah says, "Look not on his countenance" (verse 7); that is to say, we often think of the distinguished men present at a meeting, and are misguided. David in this instance, was not there at all; instead of being there he was suffering. He may not have felt it much, but in looking back upon it, he would surely feel it.
W.M. He was publicly slighted by his father and his brethren.
J.T. I think so. Were we to go into the different
{191}
churches in Christendom we should find that Christ is not there.
A.P. Do you think Saul allowing the Amalekite to live, as recorded in chapter 15, would represent the general condition preceding this scene in Bethlehem?
J.T. That is right; that element was not *thoroughly* judged. David was a very attractive young man, and yet he was *not* at the sacrifice. You may be sure the devil saw to it that he was not there for as present he would attract Samuel. Moreover whilst you could not attribute hostility to Jesse, yet there must have been that in him which the enemy could act upon so that he did not bring David in. On this account Samuel was at a great disadvantage, and was not equal to the moment. Jesse's seven elder sons passed before Samuel, but not one of them would Jehovah approve. Samuel says, "Jehovah has not chosen these", (verse 10). Well, you can understand how exercised Samuel would be about this, being a spiritual man. We too should feel exercised if in a meeting there is no room for Christ. Then Samuel asked, "Are these all the young men?" Jesse says, "There is yet the youngest remaining, and behold, he is feeding the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither", (verse 11). Now they are all standing waiting for this young man to come in.
W.M. That would arouse the jealousy of his brothers.
J.T. Surely it would.
J.S. In such circumstances the *prophet* shines. He makes definite room for Christ.
J.T. Yes; that is where Samuel shines; he is able to recover himself. He is not going to smooth the thing over and make the best of it, which often happens in a meeting, without the true David. He says, in effect, we will just wait; we will do nothing; we will not sit down until he comes. Jesse has to
{192}
send for David, and when he comes in the Spirit of God tells us how beautiful he is. And so in chapter 18 David is attractive as a type of Christ.
W.M. Do you not think the celebration of the women was rather mixed? They attributed much to Saul, but yet a great deal more to David.
J.T. That is right. Later on, however, Saul is omitted altogether; all Israel and Judah loved *David*. That is what we all need to come to.
A.P. @Psalm 78:70 would emphasise what you are saying; it says, "he chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds".
J.T. You can understand how Satan had kept David out, and now he is keeping Christ out of hundreds of gatherings for the professed worship of God. The state and principles of the people are not such as to admit Him.
C.A.M. Satan always seeks to have something to displace the Lord.
J.T. Jesse no doubt made things look as good as possible on that occasion, from Eliab down. I have no doubt they were all at their best, which meant that David was not wanted or needed. But God intended to bring His choice forward.
W.M. It is imposing men that shut Christ out.
A.F.M. What gatherings do you refer to in which Christ is kept out?
J.T. I am speaking generally of Christendom. They make big men in colleges and seminaries, and regard that as enough. Of course, there are exceptions, but generally speaking a man head and shoulders above others is desired and secured, and Christ is left out as not being needed.
A.P. That might also mark such occasions as fellowship meetings where there is too much made of human ability and arrangements.
N.McC. The kind of man you mention does not slay many Philistines!
{193}
J.T. Big men flatter one another. The Philistines represent the big men of today in Christendom. David slew the Philistine and cut off his head. Bigness in the sense implied is in the head -- mental ability. Eliab was of that kind, and even Samuel for the moment was a little on that line, but Jehovah saved him from anointing the wrong man. In fact Eliab, a little later, became a persecutor of David; he says, "with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle", (@1 Samuel 17:28). In his persecution he would turn David aside from delivering Israel.
W.M. "For neither did his brethren believe on him", (@John 7:5). Eliab would represent that principle in the sufferings of Christ.
J.T. What is said about David is that "he was ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance". Ruddiness suggests that he was *living* spiritually, and that is the test in such circumstances whether we are living; whether those in authority amongst the saints are living. Christ was thus marked. "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life", (@John 6:63). So you get David's name immediately, meaning, "beloved". God had found much pleasure in David before this, he had already slain the lion and the bear by his power, but at Bethlehem they were endeavouring to have a good time without him. As brought in and anointed, "the Spirit of Jehovah came upon David from that day forward". His name is now *formally* given: David or "Beloved", designating the *person* already known and loved of God. How vivid is the type of Christ here?
A.F.M. The chapter goes on to show that not only do we have the Spirit's description of David, but there are others besides who took notice of these
{194}
attractive qualities in him. Verse 18 reads, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilled in playing, and he is a valiant man and a man of war, and skilled in speech, and of good presence, and Jehovah is with him".
J.T. Do we not see in all this how the Spirit of God is bringing the attractiveness of Christ before us? That is largely the testimony; the ministry of the Spirit is to present to us the attractiveness of Christ personally. Now David gives us in the form of Psalms how he *felt* in his sufferings. You find Psalms written on salient occasions of suffering; so that we get his own point of view, which is very important in this matter. There are about thirteen such @Psalms: 3, 7,18, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, and 142. These Psalms greatly help us as to David's feelings and sufferings.
A.P. In @2 Samuel 22:6, he sums it up by saying: "The bands of Sheol surrounded me; the cords of death encountered me".
J.T. That is one in the list of Psalms just mentioned: it is the longest of those Psalms. You will observe that it is called a "song" in 2 Samuel, but it is a "psalm" in the book of Psalms, and in the latter it begins with the statement, "I will love ... Jehovah"; that is, David is a *gainer* in all his suffering. He does not say that in @2 Samuel 22. That helps us as to this great matter, showing how David grew, because that Psalm was written at the end of his life when he was delivered from all his enemies and from the hand of Saul; it is very comprehensive. Those Psalms that speak of his experiences show how he progressed. @Psalm 18, I think, is last historically -- not the last in the book. It is in the first book of Psalms, which is David's book peculiarly depicting his sufferings, and it shows us the consummation of his exercises, that is, that he *loved Jehovah*. He had not lost ground in all his
{195}
exercises and sufferings, but had gained through them.
W.F.K. Is there a feature of Christ in His suffering, that He suffered without cause?
J.T. That is what comes out. "They hated me without a cause" is quoted by the Lord, from @Psalm 69. Returning to @1 Samuel 16, why should David, a beautiful young man, the eighth and youngest of Jesse's sons, be kept out of this great occasion? What was the cause?
N.McC. I would like to ask about Samuel's failure in distinguishing God's chosen one; what was the reason for that?
J.T. It shows that a most spiritual man may miss the mind of God in a given circumstance. Samuel missed it at a most important juncture; and so did Joseph when his father would bless Ephraim instead of Manasseh. All this is to remind us of the need for *dependence on God under all circumstances*.
A.F.M. Do you think Samuel needed yet to be weaned from the spirit and manner of Saul? The features of Eliab that came before him were similar to those of Saul.
J.T. I think so. He had been *mourning* for Saul unduly. Evidently there was something there that had not been judged in his apprehension of Saul. God says to him, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?" (@1 Samuel 16:1). He was slow to get on to the divine line, to change over to another order of man.
A.N.W. Something similar to Abraham's feelings as to Ishmael.
J.T. Just so; and Isaac's as to Esau.
J.S. There had been some movement in the testimony that Samuel missed. God was, so to speak, ahead of him.
J.T. That is what we should learn -- the need for dependence at *all* times; otherwise I may be right today and out of line tomorrow.
{196}
R.W.S. The outstanding head and shoulders are likely to pervert our judgment. The Spirit seems to exhaust adjectives to describe David's beauty; but of Saul He speaks only of "his shoulders and upward", (@1 Samuel 9:2).
N.P. You get in this verse that Saul was afraid of David.
J.T. That is the most solemn thing, that in envying and hating David he became afraid of him, for he knew that the Lord was with him.
C.A.M. You were referring to the fact that his ruddy countenance showed that life marked David; and being able to play skilfully with the hands he foreshadows further glories of Christ.
J.T. It points to the chief musician. He is not only a warrior, he is also a refined and skilled man. His musical ability was in view of the service of God; it would work out in the service of God as seen in 1 Chronicles.
C.A.M. For that the Psalms were necessary.
J.T. The Psalms are even a greater tribute to David personally than his military triumphs. He is not only king, he is head and leader in God's service.
C.A.M. So in chapter 16:18, skilled in playing is mentioned before the fact that he is a valiant man, and a man of war.
F.H.L. Is there not a background to this, in that he was "with the sheep"? Even Saul's message to Jesse refers to that fact.
J.T. Quite so. He was "with the sheep". That is testimony to Christ as caring for the saints.
F.H.L. I was thinking of how the Spirit of God in magnifying what David was personally, bears witness to his service in humility.
J.T. In that service he delivered the lamb from the lion and the bear. All that was in secret.
A.R.S. Although the enemy may do everything he can to keep David, that is Christ, out of sight, the
{197}
moment is coming when He will be manifested in glory as supreme, and the enemy will be defeated.
J.T. God takes the matter in hand, and Saul sees that Jehovah is with David, and Jonathan is with David, and all Israel loved David. Triumph is in view, but suffering also; so that in the next chapter Saul's hatred is becoming more energetic. Chapter 19 is very remarkable as to the agencies by which David in his sufferings was preserved from destruction. First of all, Jonathan is an agent in this. "Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said ... Let not the king sin against his servant, against David", (verse 4) "And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan" (verse 6), that is, Jonathan becomes the means in Jehovah's hand of saving David. Then it says, "And there was war again; and David went forth and fought with the Philistines, and smote them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him", (verse 8). David is coming into greater prominence. Then it says, "And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul". A terrible character of opposition is seen in this. It says, "And he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David played with his hand. And Saul sought to smite David and the wall with the spear".
J.T.Jr. The slaying of the Philistines by David seems to bring out the hatred of Saul.
J.T. The evil spirit is from Jehovah. It is governmental, but Satan is active. As sitting in his house where David, his son-in-law, was playing there should have been the very best feelings. But Saul sought to smite him and the wall.
A.F.M. David here is playing with his hand in order to soothe Saul, and yet it seems to be of no avail.
A.B.P. Is that not a warning to us in our local settings? Is there not a tendency oft-times to jealousy, and even refreshing ministry is not valued,
{198}
for Satan comes in to disturb and uproot what is of God?
A.N.W. Would you say a little more why the Philistine character of the enemy goes along with this?
J.T. Applying it to modern circumstances in Christendom, I think it is an age of big men. The Philistines refer typically to big men in the history of the assembly. That principle started early and developed rapidly after apostolic days. Philosophy and learning generally acquired a great place in the nominal service of God.
A.P. Would you say even before the Reformation there were men who stood against the Philistines, and that there were Jonathans to protect and support them?
J.T. Yes; there were many like Jonathan. He never left Saul's system, but he was a lover of David.
W.M. It is very beautiful to see that while there was murder in Saul's heart, there was music in David's heart.
A.F.M. How would you apply Michal's support of David in this deception?
J.T. Michal is the next instrumentality for his preservation, and we have to understand what these instrumentalities mean. Jonathan never left Saul's system, and Michal never left it until Saul's death, and yet each saved David.
J.S. Do you not think that such are the only preservative elements in the "systems" today -- those that love Christ?
J.T. Yes; they have influence. During the Reformation and the centuries following they are very noticeable. I think Michal may be illustrative of the Anglican system. There has been a certain protection of Christ there, even up to the present
{199}
time. Merab is seen more as Rome, she was given to *another*; she never helped David at all whereas Michal loved David.
A.P. Michal stays with "the image", whereas *David* had left.
J.T. There is a great deal in that as to the Anglican system, but she let David down through the window. Indeed, it was through Michal's advice he left the house so that he might escape Saul's messengers, so that she was used to save him.
W.M. Why was there any necessity for the image, when she let David down and he had escaped?
J.T. It was part of the effort to save David, but there is in it undoubtedly an allusion to what takes the place of Christ in the system we have referred to. We must not discard *any* consideration for Christ in Christendom. We should recognise and be thankful for anyone that would protect His Person.
W.M. Even if He is absent, they have a kind of image, would you say?
J.T. Well, He is protected anyway. I recall quite a flurry here some years ago, in relation to a discussion in Kentucky, when a certain well-known politician publicly defended the Bible against modernism. That was not to be despised. While the image was intended by Michal to save David, the manner of the Spirit's account of it indicates a hidden, prophetic meaning.
G.MacP. Was Nicodemus like Jonathan and Michal?
J.T. Yes; Nicodemus would represent that side in John's gospel. John is the only one that mentions Nicodemus. He spoke on Christ's behalf in the Council. Like Michal, he sought to protect Christ at a critical time. The fact that Michal let David down through a window so that he escaped, puts her in the line of Rahab, and the saints at Damascus -- she
{200}
belongs to that class. But she despised David later, which is a solemn thing.
Now as we read down the chapter we see how David was preserved by the Spirit of God, which is the final thought. It comes out in the end of the days, that Christ is preserved where the Spirit of God is recognised. In the end of chapter 19, we read, "it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth by Ramah. Then Saul sent messengers to take David; and they saw a company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as president over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Sechu; and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, at Naioth by Ramah. And he went thither to Naioth by Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth by Ramah. And he himself also stripped off his clothes, and prophesied, himself also, before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?"(verses 19 - 24). I think that is a most remarkable paragraph: it may be applied to the present time, as showing how Christ is protected where the Spirit of God is. David comes to Samuel, and Samuel is with a company of prophets who are prophesying, and he is presiding over them, and these messengers come, one after another, and they prophesy, and Saul comes and he prophesies, but *he* is exposed. That is the point, I think, in these last days, that there is some room for the Spirit of God, whose presence is marked by prophecy, and what Saul represents is exposed there. We see him now just as he is, but the Spirit is in such power
{201}
that even he prophesies, and David is preserved.
W.M. What do you mean by saying Saul was exposed?
J.T. He lay naked. The Spirit of God exposes everything. The spirit of prophecy exposes the thoughts of men's hearts.
J.E.H. Caiaphas prophesied in relation to the death of Christ, and he was exposed as falsely judging Him later.
J.T. The fact that he prophesied did not prove that he was a lover of Christ. He was an opposer, but he prophesied.
C.A.M. I suppose God allows what seems to come under the power of the Spirit in this way to be shown up in its proper character before it comes to an end.
J.T. I think that is most important. As positive ministry in the power of the Spirit is maintained, current opposition will be exposed. "Their folly shall be completely manifest to all", (@2 Timothy 3:9). That indicates what God is doing, I think.
W.G.T. Would modernism be a form of opposition?
J.T. Yes; and opposition by imitation. I think one of the greatest services that can be rendered in the testimony is to expose what is current in Christendom -- what Satan is doing.
J.S. You mean for the deliverance of the people of God that are already in bondage through it?
J.T. Quite so.
W.B-w. If the flesh is active in any one of us, it is better to have it exposed than to cover it up.
J.T. I think it is more important that the evil should be exposed. As it says in @1 Timothy 5:20 "Those that sin convict before all". That is, what one is guilty of is manifest.
W.M. I think J.N.D.s writings are a great exposure of Christendom.
J.T. I am sure that is what they are intended
{202}
be. They are of such a character as to expose current evil.
A.P.T. John's epistle helps us: "prove the spirits, if they are of God", (@1 John 4:1). Your reference in prayer to @1 Corinthians 12:3 "no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", makes one wonder whether that would not be a test with regard to those in system, as to how far they could go in that direction.
J.T. The Holy Spirit is the test; whether they can say "Lord Jesus" not merely in word, but in the power of the Spirit.
R.D.G. The exposure is brought about by going on with what is positive, they were prophesying.
J.T. Quite; so you are struck with the greatness of the Spirit of God in this section. There is nothing said about Him with regard to Michal and Jonathan. They did a certain service but no service such as this. There is complete exposure here, and in the exposure Saul is weakened. What could he do? He could not slay David *there*.
F.H.L. It is the head of the whole system that is exposed, as with the Philistines. It was the greatest man among them that was slain.
J.T. So that you find in @2 Corinthians 10:10 that the apostle approaches the root of the matter. He says, "because his letters, he says, are weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught". The one referred to was; a minister of Satan. Satan himself was working at Corinth, and he was exposed. That is what, under God, is going on today, I believe.
N.McC. Giving full credit to such service as Michal and Jonathan rendered David, it was not normal service.
J.T. It was not. God uses what is available; but we see that Jonathan and Michal could have had no power at Ramah. Ramah means "moral elevation".
{203}
It was Samuel and a company of prophets, and Samuel was presiding over them, and the Holy Spirit speaking there. I think it would be well to see in chapter 23, that those who were specially benefited by David, the inhabitants of Keilah turn against him. He delivered them from the Philistines, but they failed him. It seems to me a very sorrowful thing that persons specially delivered, specially indebted to Christ, should fail Him. David finds this out by prayer, and through service of the ephod. This *city* is indebted to David in a particular way, yet was ready to deliver him up to Saul.
A.F.M. How would you apply that to ourselves?
J.T. I think it would apply; it is a question of the secret state of our souls. It says, "And when David knew that Saul devised mischief against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod. Then said David, Jehovah, God of Israel, thy servant hath heard for certain that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. Will the citizens of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? Jehovah, God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down. And David said, Will the citizens of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up". It seems to me that is very touching; that David learned from God that these men would be faithless and deliver him up.
C.A.M. Would it be like Paul appealing to the saints to pray for him that he might be delivered from men. "That we may be delivered from bad and evil men, for faith is not the portion of all", (@2 Thessalonians 3:2). I wondered whether in that way our prayer meetings would indicate how we regard what is precious to Christ, and the preservation of it.
J.T. I think they do. You are comforted at a
{204}
meeting for prayer to discern that the prayers express intelligent loyalty to Christ. Here is a city that has just been delivered by David, and yet the inhabitants would deliver him up to Saul. It is a challenge to our hearts, as those who have been so benefited by the Lord in these last days.
A.R.S. Is this not like the poor wise man that delivered the city, yet no one remembered the poor wise man?
J.T. Yes, very much like it; those of Keilah are going to deliver him up.
R.D.G. Is it not beautiful that David should be so dependent immediately following a victory?
J.T. Yes; he is *priest* as well as king. He prays in confidence, "Jehovah, God of Israel".
W.B-w. What about Doeg, the Edomite?
J.T. He is specially referred to in @Psalm 52.
A.F.M. Would you speak of the citizens of Keilah going as far as betrayal?
J.T. Yes; it was the state of their hearts. I think the Lord would speak to us as to where we are in our hearts, as to where circumstances might arise and we betray Him, in spite of our indebtedness to Him. Doeg would be different from a citizen of Keilah; as an Edomite, he was an hereditary enemy of Israel. The Lord's supper is *the test* of our hearts, which He reads, as to where we are. Jehovah tells David where the hearts of those of Keilah were.
W.B-w. @Psalm 52 is written about Doeg, the Edomite. David says, "I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God". Does that not show how superior David was to the suffering, in his spirit?
J.T. Quite so. He had been to the house, to Ahimelech, and asked him what he had under his hand. He was ready to use what there was. He was a green olive-tree there. That is very beautiful, corresponding to what he always was, full of life and freshness.
{205}
J.S. Here you see the place that prayer has with David. His lines of communication with heaven are kept open.
J.T. Quite so; who can overcome a man like David? God tells him what the enemy will do. It was said later of Elisha that he told the king of Israel the words that the king of Syria spoke in his bed-chamber; (@2 Kings 6:12).
W.M. It is striking that Jehovah did not tell him any more than his question required. This left him in dependence.
J.S. David then goes into the wilderness and abides in the strongholds. I suppose there is some feature of help in that for us?
J.T. That opens up a lot of history; the wilderness, the caves, being like a partridge on the mountains -- what the experience implied is covered in special Psalms already referred to. I would encourage the brethren to look up these Psalms to get David's own thoughts in these circumstances.
G.MacP. He did not go alone; he departed with about six hundred men.
J.T. Which showed he was not losing ground nor influence. @Psalm 18 shows that he lost no ground spiritually either.
C.A.M. It is one thing to see these things in history and another thing to see that the emotional side has been preserved -- really for ever.
J.T. His experiences are almost entirely in the second book of the Psalms. Three of them are in the first book, and most of the others are in the second, so that we might know the sufferer's own feelings.

GOD'S GOVERNMENT, DIRECT AND INDIRECT
@Zechariah 6
J.T. This chapter has a marked prophetic bearing on the last days. What is in mind now is not to dwell on the application of the chapter to God's earthly people and the nations as such, but to see what is the current bearing of it. "No prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation". Scripture, indeed, always bears on the time in which it may be read, it has always a present voice. The instruction for us here is as to *government*. God governs directly and indirectly. "The powers that be", as they are called in @Romans 13:1, are God's indirect government; but there is a direct government of the saints which is vested in Christ viewed as a royal Priest, and carried on mediately by the Spirit in suitable persons, (verse 14).
J.H.B. Is it your thought that the first part of the chapter has to do with indirect government, and the last part with the more direct government?
J.T. Yes.
J.H.B. Would you open out a little the figures used, the mountains, and the horses of different colours?
J.T. From the time of Noah the principle of magisterial government has existed. The thought was introduced in @Genesis 9, and there was food given suitable to sustain such a responsibility -- flesh was allowed to men in addition to herbal food.
The government God intended, in taking up Israel, was to be direct. The providential government of God is under angels, and direct government in and through Israel; both of which are mentioned in the heavenly city in relation to the gates. There is nothing in the gates of the heavenly city to correspond
{207}
with these horses and chariots, for they are provisional; that is, from the time of Israel's failure and consequent captivity to its reinstatement through the sovereign mercy of God. Until direct government is re-established God resorts to what these horses and chariots represent.
C.O.B. Are you referring to Elisha's remark as to the chariots of Israel?
J.T. "The chariot of Israel" is a greater thought than these. "The chariot of Israel and the *horsemen* thereof", "the horsemen" refer to the power of direct government in Israel. These in Zechariah are indirect; the riders are not mentioned.
J.A.P. Would the chariots in this chapter correspond with Daniel's four kingdoms?
J.T. Quite so. The chariots and horses would represent a systematic government. There would be energy as in the horses, and the chariots would allude to what is subservient in the way of principles and means. They are regarded as standing before God. "These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth". They are not presented as governed intelligently by men in their movements, but as if needing external pressure to order them.
H.B. What is the thought in the mountains of brass?
J.T. The judgment of God is involved. The principle is the same as it is in Christ. It is a question of righteous judgment. Evil is to be dealt with.
R.S.C. Do we get the contrary element in Job, where Satan goes to and fro?
J.T. That is right. These horses and chariots are to restrain or check that movement. After the millennium the opposition comes up under Satan "on the breadth of the earth" (@Revelation 20:9), meaning that there is no restraint. That is not existing now; there is no such latitude given to evil. The breadth
{208}
of the earth implies undisputed right of way. These chariots signify that that is checked: they are God's ministers; (@Romans 13:6).
W.R.P. What do you mean in saying that this is only provisional? Do we see it exercised in the millennium when the heavenly city comes down?
J.T. It is not a primary thought in government. It is provisional, pending that time when God will take up the reins in Christ. He will judge the world in righteousness. These chariots do not represent what God has in His mind for government; He intended it to be direct as seen in Noah.
J.H.B. Is it your thought that indirect government has become necessary because of the failure of those to whom direct government was committed?
J.T. Yes. God committed Himself openly to David and Solomon, for instance, in relation to rule, but it is not open committal here. It is mysterious; they are *spirits* that stand before Him. They represent provisional government, pending the day when God will take up direct government in the world in Christ. In the meantime, the testimony of this is in the assembly. The second part of @Zechariah 6 shows direct government, and every Christian should know that he is directly under the government of God, not only under these powers, but directly under Christ, "legitimately subject to Christ".
W.R.P. Is that where judgment beginning at the house of God would come in?
J.T. That is where the direct government of God is.
Ques. Will the direct government of God end in the millennium or will it go into eternity?
J.T. It is stated that when Christ has subdued all things, He delivers up the kingdom "to him who is God and Father", (@1 Corinthians 15:24). There will always be government, but finally in His hands who is said to be God and Father. The thought of "Father"
{209}
means that love will prevail -- but government will be there. The Son Himself it is said "shall be placed in subjection to him ... that God may be all in all" (@1 Corinthians 15:28).
W.R.P. Would you make any difference between rule and government?
J.T. Not much. The Lord is said to rule, and the promise to the overcomer in Thyatira is, "he shall rule them [the nations] with a rod of iron", (@Revelation 2:27). Government is a great general principle that belongs to God. Although it awaited Noah for magisterial government to be formally committed to man, the principle of government was present at the very outset in the relation of Adam to the lower creation. He was to have dominion over them.
C.A.C. There is a certain divine check upon evil in view of the testimony going through to the end, in spite of its weakness.
J.T. I was thinking that. For instance, this great empire in which we are is evidently held together to maintain a highway for the testimony, that is, for those who would continue in it. That is what the first section of the chapter represents.
C.A.C. Would it answer to the Lord's word to Philadelphia, "I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut"? (@Revelation 3:8).
J.T. That is good. These great powers are used of God to maintain the public highways, but then there are the spiritual highways, too, belonging to the Priest on His throne.
C.A.C. That would be the purely spiritual side of the matter.
J.T. Yes. That comes into our care meetings. I thought we might see through our inquiry, how the direct government of God is carried on, and whether any of us are capable of wearing crowns in our executive service.
This fourth great power seeks to walk to and fro.
{210}
No doubt there were other influences to check it, but in the main it did succeed in going to and fro and making its great roads. Even the great Roman roads which we see in this country and the continent of Europe are a standing witness to this sort of thing. They check Satan's direct action against God's people, not that they are intelligent as to that, but that is the *divine* intent. Satan walks up and down evidently with a view to damage the people of God; (@Job 1:7).
C.A.C. But for that we should not have assembled thus today.
J.T. That is what I thought. This peculiar power referred to in verse 7 will be more or less permanent until the coming of the Lord, either in the old imperial form of rule, or under the ten kings, throughout the assembly's history on earth. It represents what God uses to check the direct action of Satan. He goes about, Peter says, as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Anything that checks that is of God, and it keeps the way open. For instance, in Romans, where you may get the leading allusions to this side of the truth we get Phoebe, a lone sister setting out to travel from Cenchrea in Greece to Rome. How could she get to Rome unless the highways had been kept open? How could Paul have carried on the service of the gospel, fully preaching the gospel of Christ "from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum", (@Romans 15:19) -- an immense distance -- without these highways? So today the principle remains; even in pagan countries the principle is there.
J.N.L. What is the reference to those that go forth to the north quietening the Lord's spirit in the north country?
J.T. It refers to the overthrow of Babylon by the Medes and Persians.
W.R.P. In @2 Thessalonians 2:6, there is "that
{211}
which restrains", and "He who restrains", (verse 7 N.T.).
J.T. "That which" is probably the very thing we are thinking of. "He who" would be more personal, referring, it may be, to the presence of the Spirit here.
C.A.C. The one is the external, and the other is spiritual power.
R.S.C. Does this correspond with what the servant of Elisha saw? His eyes were opened to see the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
J.T. "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them", (@Psalm 68:17). That is the spiritual side, which we think of in conflict for the truth. But we reckon on the great external powers in a subordinate way; no doubt Paul prayed for them, although he suffered from them. The Lord suffered from Pilate. But what the young man saw was the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire: that is what we need our eyes open to, as seeking to maintain the testimony here.
J.H.B. You would scarcely call these chariots in @Zechariah 6 the chariots of God; they are powers which are being used.
J.T. No, God would not call these His chariots. They are, however, subservient to Him and used in His providential government.
J.H.B. Is it your thought that a recognition of this would be a comfort to us in days of external pressure and difficulty?
J.T. This passage ought to be a comfort to us that there are spirits standing before God, or as the margin says, they "present themselves", as if they are there and held accountable by God; so that the highways are held open. The great oceanic and continental highways are held open through God's
{212}
ordering, so that we can move about and hold meetings and serve the Lord -- a great matter. But then, in addition to this power, we have "the chariots of God", which are invisible, but known to those who have their eyes opened by God; (@2 Kings 6:17).
J.R.U.B. Would the earlier part correspond with @1 Timothy 2:2, praying for kings and all that are in authority?
J.T. That is what is in mind -- "that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty". The bearing of the testimony in this section is very distinctly on ourselves.
"Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; ... then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord: even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the Lord".
The Lord may help us to see from these verses, that certain who returned from Babylon, from the captivity, had silver and gold of which crowns were to be made. These persons had returned from the captivity, it says; and the word is, "come thou the *same day*, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah". It is when they had come from
{213}
Babylon. They have means, too, silver and gold, and they have come to a particular house: what they had was to be made into crowns. I think the Lord would help us to see something of this, and search us too, as to whether we are really returned, and as having returned what house we have come into. Then, as the crowns are made for the high priest who sits on the priestly throne, there are also these crowns for Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen. Three had come back from Babylon, but there is a fourth person.
J.H.B. What do you mean by having returned?
J.T. That I am thoroughly out of the system of captivity. It is alluded to elsewhere as "the pit wherein is no water", (@Zechariah 9:11). That is a place where people are not regarded as swallowed up by judgment; there is hope for them; they are called, "prisoners of hope". The question here is as to whether we are really returned and into what house we have come.
H.B. What would be the thought of Josiah's house?
J.T. It is evidently a spiritual place, a suitable house like Lydia's. There are many who are professedly delivered from Babylon, but what are their associations?
J.H.L. What would be the distinctive features of those who have left Babylon?
J.T. Those who have left definitely and are in such a house as is suggested here, are available for the Spirit. The great moral point of the chapter is that all this shall come to pass "if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God", and in this way "ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you". That is the great moral point in the chapter, that the divine will pervades; there is somebody moving under the divine will. The point is that one is "sent". That
{214}
is seen in the gospel of John. We are not to do what we like; there is so much disregard of divine rule and the will of God. The great principle running right through the gospel of John is that there is one who is *sent*. A man who gets his eyes opened, is one who goes to Siloam, meaning Sent. What is effected is not of our own planning or doing at all; all is of the sovereign will and power of God. Our position is a question of the will of God, one has been sent by Him, who does all God's will; that is the point to make clear; all will come about on the principle of men hearkening to the word of God.
Ques. Is it the continuation of @Exodus 3:15?
J.T. Moses was sent; "I AM hath sent me unto you". That was his commission, and the more one adheres to that the more one is like God. Moses was to be for God to Aaron; (@Exodus 4:16).
H.B. David said, "was it not laid upon me?"
J.T. Exactly. His father had sent him.
J.A.P. Do you mean that in the recovery of the truth, the temple has been built in that way?
J.T. Yes. The builder is Christ. That is the great general principle. "He shall grow up from his own place, and he shall build the temple of Jehovah: even he shall build the temple of Jehovah". Note the repetition. He "shall sit and rule upon his throne". Kings of today sit, but they do not rule, upon their thrones -- not that I am saying a word against them. But here it is direct rule that is contemplated. He sits *and* rules. The lesson is, that the persons returned from the captivity go to a certain place, a house; they are available there and they have wealth, they are known to be there available to God; and their wealth is available for a purpose, for making crowns for the high priest. These crowns being for the high priest are the recognition that everything that has been done, is done by Christ. Whether He uses any of us, he has done it. He is
{215}
doing a work, and He will do it. Then four men come in after that and crowns are for them. I was thinking of those words and whether one in any little way corresponds with the Lord in this sense.
C.A.C. It is most wonderful to think that there should be a spiritual government in the sphere of holy things, which corresponds with the government of God and expresses His government.
J.T. The only assembly that is definitely said to have a crown is Philadelphia. In that case there is a danger of losing it. "Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown", (@Revelation 3:11). The point is, let no one take it. The crowns will go on, somebody will wear them, but we want to keep what we have.
C.A.C. Is that what we need in view of local difficulties and exercises?
J.T. That is what I had in mind in regard of the care meetings; the Lord is making much of them lately. Earlier, the elder brethren used to hold things more than they do now. Care meetings imply experienced brethren; but it is important to see that these crowns are priestly, and the priestly side includes *all* the saints, brothers and sisters. It is a throne, but it is a priestly one, so that all are brought into administrative matters.
F.W. I think you drew attention to the fact that these horses in @Zechariah 6 had no horsemen. Now the thing seems to be established in men.
.J.T. It is all a question of men in the second part of this chapter; it supposes spiritual intelligence in the handling of the things of God. It is the thought of spiritual intelligence and sympathy. Priests are supposed to be sympathetic as well as intelligent. Our conclusions in care meetings will be greatly augmented by bringing in all the saints; that is, in assembly. If any sin is discovered, let him that discovered it be the first to cast the stone. Supposing
{216}
a sister comes into the knowledge of something that should be dealt with in the assembly, she should put the information where it should be, but she does not say, It is *your* matter now -- it is still *her* matter.
J.A.P. Is priestly rule in that way in contrast to the rod of iron?
J.T. It is. We are moving in sympathy. The sin is not modified, but it is dealt with in a gracious way. The shirking of responsibility is what must be dealt with. The person who finds out the evil should cast the first stone. If that person is a sister, she cannot stand up in the assembly and declare what she knows; but the fact that somebody else has to do it does not relieve her of having to cast a stone.
F.W.W. Would the household of Chloe be an illustration on that line?
J.T. Yes, they showed the matter to the apostle Paul. What do you think, Mr. C., about bringing in young brothers and sisters in the exercise of judgment?
C.A.C. I think it would lead to a great development of exercise. The failing is to let everything of the nature of government rest with the brothers, perhaps the older or gifted brothers, but we should bring them all in.
J.T. The sister John addressed as "the elect lady" is brought into the exercise of discipline.
J.H.B. How do brothers or sisters qualify for the wearing of a crown?
J.T. In the exercise of priestly authority. Anyone who has the Holy Spirit is a priest -- a person with priestly authority as to the discipline of the house of God. Priesthood includes all.
C.O.B. You would encourage every brother to be present at the care meetings.
J.T. Yes, and all the sisters to enquire as to what happens. There is a great deal of weakness because the sisters do not make inquiries. Of course in the exercise of discipline they should be present. Scripture
{217}
shows that the exercise of discipline belongs to the assembly. Where it is exercised in @Acts 5, which is the most drastic discipline we have in the New Testament, it speaks of all the saints being in Solomon's porch after that, as much as to say, We are all in this: we are thoroughly with what has happened. Solomon's porch suggests the place of judgment. Are we all going to be there? There is so much need for this kind of dealing with evil amongst us.
Eu.R. Do you mean that every brother and every sister should show their practical sympathy and support with what is done?
J.T. Yes; and all in a locality should be present in a meeting for discipline.
Rem. That judgment would continue in our attitude towards the offender.
J.T. Yes, and that is one of the conditions for addition. There may be a cutting-off, but it is a condition for addition. A multitude of believers, both men and women, were added to the Lord after that discipline in @Acts 5. God honours discipline; it maintains conditions suitable for addition. It is "added to the Lord", in @Acts 5:14. The authority of the Lord was vindicated in the discipline.
Eu.R. Do these two features run parallel, the recognition of spiritual ministry and the maintenance of government in localities?
J.T. Yes. The prophetic word is greatly needed, and hence the ministry meetings are owned of God. The intent of them is the prophetic searching of hearts. The ministry of prophecy is shown to produce that effect. One falls down and owns that "God is in you of a truth", (@1 Corinthians 14:25). These meetings are of great value if we take them up in that way. God searches our hearts through the ministry.
C.A.C. Would that give us silver and gold for the crowns?
{218}
J.T. Yes; I think silver would indicate the redemptive rights of Christ over us. Every one would feel that the Lord had bought him, that he is not his own; his body belongs to the Lord, and the Lord has a right to wear that crown in dealing with him. Silver here is a question of love. It is a crown of that kind. It speaks of the death of Jesus, which is the full expression of love. But there is also the gold, that is the divine side; what is distinctively of God. This would involve His authority as asserted in the prophetic word.
J.H.B. What would be the difference between the crowning of the high priest and the crowning of these four men?
J.T. Joshua is Christ typically. Whatever wealth we have, we use it to make a crown. We say, What is being done, Christ is doing it. Everything we do that God owns, you say, The Lord is doing that. The more you know yourself, the more you attribute it to the Lord, but He gives you credit for it.
It is instructive to see here that locality is in view; in that "he shall grow up from his own place". That is where one is known. One does not use his own will to spread abroad his own influence, he grows up out of his own place. The word "Branch" would mean that He is a dependent Person; it might be rendered "Sprout", there is the thought of freshness in it. This must be worked out now mediately. We see Christ coming out, as Paul says, "a proof of Christ speaking in me", (@2 Corinthians 13:3). He lived by Christ, and Christ lived in him towards the Corinthians. It is what Christ is in this respect. But He is in view here personally also.
P.S. Why are these four crowns spoken of as being for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah?
J.T. First, it is said that "the crowns shall be for Helem, and for Tobijah, and for Jedaiah, and for Hen the son of Zephaniah"; these four men are
{219}
distinguished by them. You will observe the change of names here. There are two changes; the first one, Helem, evidently alludes to Heldai, and the fourth one, Hen, alludes to Josiah. There are changes without any notification, which are to be understood spiritually. It shows how a man changes in his service if there be this energy of life which is contemplated here. Brethren will change, and their names will consequently change; for a name expresses what one is. So that we have four persons for whom the crowns are for a memorial; three persons with wealth, and one with a house in which they were. The one with a house becomes a fourth person to be honoured. We are in the presence of the activity of life in the second part of the chapter, illustrated by the Branch, or Sprout, which is the energy of life in which Christ is seen; and then the individuals in service, two of them with their own names changed, showing how energetic life is.
Ques. Do you connect what is said in verse 12, "He shall grow up from his own place", with @Luke 4:16, "And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up"? Does that not bear on us as to growing up in our own place?
J.T. It does. It works out in what God has so stressed in recent times, local responsibility. What a man is, shines out in his own place. "The Branch" means a person who is dependent, fresh, as drawing from his normal source.
Rem. We read in verse 11 of the previous chapter, that the women carry the ephah "to build it a house in the land of Shinar ... upon its own base".
J.T. There we see evil in its own place, in the same way as the man of sin will go to his own place; it is what is proper to him in an evil sense. But the thought in the Branch is someone growing up, that is life. A brother is changed; he is not what he used to be. He has a name now and a memorial
{220}
in the temple of God, as to what he has done to honour Christ. The name signifies that he is worthy of a crown. How could he have a crown for a memorial if he had not a name? It is a question of life.
W.H. Has @Revelation 4:4 any bearing upon it, the four-and-twenty seats and the elders with crowns of gold?
J.T. They are more official than these. These are persons come from Babylon, but they are rich and people of means, and you know where to find them. Their names are available to honour Christ. What they have reflects back on themselves. These men are known; the crowns are for them "for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah". What is going on is not forgotten. The history of God's work in His people is wonderful! Nothing of it shall be forgotten. You sometimes hear exaggerated stories of those who have served before us; but here what you get carried forward is accurate, not legends we cannot be sure of. The temple is enriched by these things.
R.S.C. What does "the counsel of peace" refer to?
J.T. It refers to Jehovah and Christ. That is how things are carried on.
R.S.C. Is it the unity between the Father and the Son?
J.T. Exactly. The one on the throne is in perfect accord with Jehovah. The Lord says, "I and my Father are one", (@John 10:30). The great source of all in our service, is that infinite unity between the Father and the Son.
C.A.C. Is it something like "him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God", (@Revelation 3:12)? Are the crowns on that line?
J.T. I thought so. What you cherish is your crown. Our chapter contains the most important instruction for the present time: the first part
{221}
treating of the wise provision of God in government during the times of the Gentile; the second part dealing with God's direct government, seen, as applied today, in His discipline and care generally of the believer, and more particularly in and through the assembly. "The four spirits of the heavens" are employed generally for the restraint of evil in the world and the maintenance of such order as is needed for the continuance of the testimony of God, including livable conditions for His people in carrying on His service here. "The mystery of iniquity" has worked from apostolic times, as we learn in @2 Thessalonians 2, but these powers check it. From time to time, indeed, certain leaders among the nations have arisen more or less uncontrolled, representative of this mystery, and foreshadowing him who is to come in his own name, but they were held in check. So it is today, and this service by agencies provided of God will continue until the time fixed for the translation of the assembly to heaven (@1 Thessalonians 4), and the termination of this dispensation. We are steadied and quieted by these comforting facts as considering current events among the nations.

Pages 222 - 451 -- "Notes of Readings in New York", 1936 (Volume 133).
THE WARS OF THE LORD (1)
@Exodus 19:1 - 21
J.T. In taking up this subject of war, we have, as in all others, to learn from God. This chapter, it seems to me, affords a good beginning, because in it we have God presented as in war. We learn from God as to everything, through Christ, and in this chapter God is definitely called a "*Man* of war" -- not a God of war.
J.S. Why a "*Man* of war"?
J.T. I think it is to bring the thought down to our understanding. Exodus is a foundational book in which the young believer is contemplated. The earlier chapters have young believers in view, and so in this section the children of Israel are led away from war; that is, from war with *certain* enemies, such as the Philistines; they are deliberately led of God away from these out of consideration for His people. In the first conflict the young believer is contemplated as being fought for -- somebody is fighting for him. But in chapter 17 he is attacked, and is called upon to fight. Here he is deliberately kept out of it by God's wise leadership, until he is equal for war. Therefore it seems to me that the book is foundational as to this subject, as it is to other subjects, but to this one particularly, as indicating how young believers are fought for by God in delivering them out of Egypt. He overthrows our enemies in our sight, and in that way we learn war objectively. Numbers will bring out how we are brought into it formally, we are enrolled as we reach manhood. But this book shows what God does *for* us in a military sense and *how* He does it.
{223}
A.McN. What you are expressing would fit in with the word in chapter 14:14: "Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall be still".
J.T. That is the thought exactly. It helps as to what we have said: the song celebrates God's military power, and so we are told in chapter 13:17 that as Pharaoh is obliged to release the people that *God* led them, and He led them in a most considerate way. Perhaps we have never heard of a military leader exercising such consideration for his army, in that He leads them away from a certain kind of war, so that they might not be discouraged by engaging in it; yet they are to see the most wonderful exploits of war in Another, even in God Himself!
C.A.M. It is remarkable that they came out in "rank".
J.T. It says "the children of Israel went arrayed out" (footnote, N.T., "five in a rank"). It does not say they were *told* to fall into line in that way, but I suppose the military instinct is recognised in what they did. They realised that this was the best way to move, and this is easily understood spiritually.
A.N.W. Would you make a suggestion as to the distinction between scattered battles and war? Regular warfare by the saints is not seen in Genesis.
J.T. We see in Genesis usually the outcome of divine work in men's souls; what they do is viewed in that way, so that the first real military exploit is that of Abraham, and the significance of it is that it was to *recover a brother*. That is a very good start, in which he succeeded.
A.B.P. Is there any suggestion in the five in rank, in that they did it of their own accord? Would it suggest they felt their weakness?
J.T. You refer to the numeral five? No doubt. I think it is the outcome of the divine work in young souls coming out of the world, they see that they ought to *move together*. If I am saved through a
{224}
gospel address, I call upon the name of the Lord, and I am very glad to find another with whom to join up in the workshop or the office. I believe that is the idea. It is instinct as an effect of the divine work.
J.E.H. Speaking of the Lord considering for young believers; as the military age was twenty, at this early stage the people could not be regarded as called upon to enter into warfare. Would that be in keeping with your thought that they should avoid warfare with the Philistines?
J.T. I think it is God's consideration for young people, although recognising that as converted they have military instincts. The military age in Numbers not only implies that one is born anew, but that one calls upon the name of the Lord. That is the beginning of the military position. @Exodus 13 and 14 contemplate such early instinct in young people that they seek one another. They are glad to link up with each other, and then God is overruling everything and keeping them out of Philistine warfare. This latter is included in the wars of Canaan.
A.F.M. Regarding the education of the Israelites, would it be a matter of what they saw? For instance, in the end of chapter 14 it says, "Israel saw the great power with which Jehovah had wrought against the Egyptians", (verse 31). Would that be an educational part -- what they saw?
J.T. Exactly. God is fighting for us. That is what the young Christian sees. What is happening is God's ordering, and the song here is to bring us into this *feelingly* -- what we have experienced in our conversion and deliverance from the world, what God has been to us; and that God is for us. It culminates in chapter 19, where it says, "I have borne you on eagles wings and brought you to myself", but the initial suggestions are military.
{225}
J.S. How do you regard the plagues in Egypt prior to this?
J.T. Well, they are all military. I think all in this respect that preceded is alluded to in chapter 15; God's military wisdom and the means He has of bringing down the world; what means He has at His disposal to bring down the world, so that the believer is released from it. The hand of the world is relaxed because it says that "Pharaoh let the people go". He was forced to release them, and then God takes the leadership definitely.
J.S. So that the young believer would see that God has a controversy with this world in view of his deliverance from it.
J.T. That is what we should see in Exodus. Therefore this book is intended to help young brothers and sisters as having confessed the Lord. I may be born anew and say nothing -- fail to confess the Lord. But when I confess Him as such I am in a military position, and that is what the early part of this book teaches; God is showing me that He is on my side and acting for me. I see that in all that He is doing nationally and internationally, economically, and socially, all is in my favour.
C.A.M. If, when we were powerless, God gained the victory for us, it should colour every strife we encounter afterward.
J.T. Yes. This is the beginning. There are a great number of wars throughout the Bible, but I believe Exodus is our start, where we learn the art of war from God, as a Man of war. It is thus brought down to the level of the youngest Christian.
A.F.M. Would you tell us what place Moses had? It says in the end of the chapter 14 that they believed in Jehovah and in Moses His bondman, (verse 31).
J.T. That is the beginning, I think, of the believer's apprehension of divine authority in man -- delegated authority. The believer begins to see that
{226}
at this juncture. In chapter 17 he sees *Joshua* as the leader, that is Christ *spiritually* apprehended in view of Canaan. You thus get great elements of the truth typically in these chapters. Moses represents outward leadership amongst brethren, particularly as seen in the Lord Himself. Joshua is also a type of Christ, first in relation to Satan acting on the flesh -- Amalek -- and then entrance into Canaan.
F.H.L. Reference was made to Israel seeing and believing, then the song begins -- "I will sing ... .". Is that the individual exercise or the collective thought of Israel?
J.T. It is, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel ... I will sing unto Jehovah". It evidently includes Israel and Moses and thus is collective. I suppose the singular pronoun would be to stress the idea of oneness in the singing.
J.S. In chapter 15 have we got the celebration of victory relative to the first great conflict? They have the sense of how God has triumphed.
J.T. That is the truth to get into our souls -- the Lord is a Man of war. It is what every young believer ought to see, that God wars in an intelligible way on his account, and it is for us to see how He does it. I think that beginning with chapter 13 we see how He does it and what consideration He has for those whom He delivers.
J.S. God had a long controversy with Egypt, and here we have its complete overthrow. Later in @Isaiah 43:3 Jehovah says, "I gave Egypt for thy ransom".
J.T. Here Egypt's hand was weakened, first by isolated measures, so that it is forced to relax its hand, to release God's people; that was all that was needed for the moment, because God was seeking only to deliver His people out of it. But in this further effort Pharaoh, after letting Israel go,
{227}
attempts to overwhelm them; that is the cause of his overthrow in the Red Sea.
A.N.W. Have you in mind the death of Christ itself?
J.T. That is the point. The passage of the Red Sea is Christ delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification. It is the overthrow of Satan's power in death. But what every young and older person should get into his soul is that the *Lord is a Man of war*. This is manifested before our eyes *in our own deliverance*, so that God acquires such a place in my mind militarily.
A.F.M. The Red Sea, figuratively is the death and resurrection of Christ, and inasmuch as Israel passed through the sea it was really their baptism. So we leave the world by baptism, and are prepared initially for the conflict, as being in the confession of Jesus as Lord.
J.T.Jr. The Lord in Gethsemane was in conflict in prayer -- is there the thought of war there in that sense?
J.T. Gethsemane records the greatest battle ever fought, and brings out the military position of those whom the Lord had under His hand. He says to some of them, "Sit here". That is His disposition of them for the moment. Sisters have to sit and say nothing. That is His mind for them. They are to think, of course; they are in this way to have part in what is proceeding. Those directed to sit in Gethsemane are in the greatest battlefield conceivable. Then He takes three others with Him and they are to "*abide* here and *watch*" -- not simply to sit in a certain position. Then, later on, He says, "Watch and pray". Then *He* goes forward, see @Mark 14:32 - 38. That is the general position; the Lord goes forward, but He has disposed of each one according to His wisdom. He is now in combat
{228}
with the enemy. The greatest possible conflict ever undertaken was then in hand.
C.A.M. I was struck with the words in prayer that the Lord went on His way. He moves on to a definite end. It would seem that that is suggested in these foundational aspects of this scripture we are considering. In this chapter there is a great objective reached.
J.T. There must be an objective in all divine conflicts, and God always moves on to it. The Lord in @Matthew 28:18 came up to the disciples on the mountain; some had doubted when they saw Him, but He did not stop because of that. He says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth;" and He sends them out to make disciples of all the nations, baptising them. He is *going on* and *will* go on; He does not stop because of our poverty or weakness.
C.A.M. I have been much impressed with that, because it gives such an assurance that we are not just beating the air; moving with the Lord, we shall arrive at a definite result.
J.T. That is what we should have in mind. At a meeting like this the inquiry in our hearts should be, Are we moving on with the Lord? Are we keeping pace with His movements?
W.B-w. There are many believers in the world still entangled in its system. Christ has died for them on the cross. God, in acting governmentally with the world would help these people out of it.
J.T. Just so; @1 Chronicles 29 speaks of the times that passed over David, over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries. What times have passed over the world in the past twenty-five years! What are these trying times for? They are to cause the world to relax its hold. The thought implies a work of God in His people, that they begin to see the unrighteousness of their position and break away from
{229}
the world. That is what God has had in mind in these years of unusual pressure.
A.N.W. It is striking that the "five in a rank" formation was in view of that in coming *out* of Egypt.
J.T. They went thus out of Egypt. They were definite and did not leave in disorder. Then, in chapter 14 the movement was strategic, illustrating God's skill in relation to us. It is a most interesting chapter from that point of view -- God kept them away from a certain position, telling them where to encamp, etc. All that is military strategy, just as we were saying in relation to Gethsemane.
W.G.T. I suppose Pharaoh made a great blunder when he said the wilderness had hemmed Israel in.
J.T. Quite so. God knew what was going on in Pharaoh's heart. What could Pharaoh do against a military Leader as this?
C.A.M. The matter of time entered into it. I suppose that is an element today?
J.T. You can see how much time and distance enter into the location of meeting-places and the arrangement of meetings in what the Lord has been bringing before us in recent years. We do well to notice the prominence given to *position* in chapter 14.
A.B.P. Would you say the thought of strategy as well as shepherding care enters into the Lord's words, "if therefore ye seek me, let these go away", (@John 18:8)?
J.T. Yes. He *cared* for them, but He caused His enemies to go away backward and fall to the ground. This was a flash of military power. What could they do against that? A great element against the enemies of God's people is seen in that they have to do with what they cannot understand. Indeed, they have to do with God, whom they do not know. When in the garden, the band could not understand
{230}
what it was that caused them to go away backward and fall to the ground.
A.F.M. Do you think the position into which Israel were brought through the strategy of Jehovah, whilst it brought about the defeat of Pharaoh, was to bring about in them the sense of the salvation of God? It worked both ways.
J.T. It says of Pharaoh that he pursued after them. This has to be regarded as additional to his earlier wicked treatment of God's people. "And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; and the children of Israel had gone out with a high hand. And the Egyptians pursued after them -- all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them where they had encamped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, opposite to Baal-Zephon", (chapter 14:8). It is to be noted that Pharaoh was in another position now. His power had been so broken that he released the people. God did not intend to destroy Egypt for the moment, but Pharaoh changed his position, and is now attacking the people, who are directly under God's control and ordering; they are God's army. This meant Pharaoh's destruction. So it says in verse 7, "And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them". It is the whole power of the world marshalled against the people who are now under God's direct ordering. So the position is changed. After Christianity had been inaugurated, Satan brought the world forward to oppose it. That is the position today. The world is definitely in opposition to the ordered state of things through which God is operating. Here we are told that Pharaoh "took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them". Notice the great care to have military authority and leadership. "And
{231}
Pharaoh approached; and the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and the children of Israel were much afraid, and cried out to Jehovah ... And Moses said to the people, Fear not stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you today; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for ever. Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall be still", (verses 10,13,14). That is the position just now. It is one army against another; one nation against another; and God, the great Leader of His people. That is a great lesson for all young Christians to learn. God is going to fight for us, but *we are to learn how to fight through what He does*.
J.S. God brought them into this position of outward danger to show what He could do for them.
W.F.K. In verse 19 the Angel changed his position. Would that show that the Lord was in command?
J.T. Exactly. It says, "And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before them, and stood behind them. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and was a cloud and darkness, and lit up the night; and the one did not come near the other all the night", (verses 19,20). The people of God were in the light, and the enemy was in the dark -- God was between them.
J.S. So the young believer is to observe all the movements of Jehovah. He is to be still and see Jehovah's salvation.
J.T. That is the lesson for us tonight: we are to know God as a Man of war.
A.P.T. Is this a rearguard action?
J.T. It is; the movement of the Angel of God is suggestive of that after Pharaoh approached and the Egyptians marched after Israel. Israel were to go
{232}
forward; they were not to turn round to fight, but to leave the matter with God.
W.B-w. Why is Joseph brought in here, (chapter 13:19)? He had said, "God will be sure to visit you".
J.T. It reminds young believers that God is gathering up all His belongings. He is not leaving anything in the world. We must not look back, like Lot's wife. When one is born of God, he begins to think of what belongs to God, such as the men of faith who went before and what they said and did. Joseph represents the faith that would go into the land. His thought was not to be buried immediately, like Jacob was; his *bones* must be carried up "with you hence"; when God visited the children of Israel for their deliverance.
A.R. "By faith they passed through the Red Sea", (@Hebrews 11:29). I was wondering whether Joseph would be a testimony to that?
J.T. It is the only act of faith attributed to Israel. They went through the Red Sea by faith.
W.B-w. Joseph gave commandments concerning his bones, by faith.
J.T. That should have been an incentive for the people. It should stimulate their faith.
W.G.T. God will make a way for His people, whatever the obstacles.
J.T. Quite; the point was first to "stand still", and then "go forward". We are still under military control. That is what we have to learn in our early days, to stand still or to go forward under command.
W.G.T. Do not these circumstances sometimes bring forth hard feelings and complainings?
J.T. They do, but God's gracious consideration for us, seen in these chapters, ought to soften us. They had very hard feelings in their attitude towards Moses; (chapter 14:11,12). We, too, are apt to get such feelings; young believers are often harassed
{233}
with them, but God bears with them, and uses the circumstances experienced for their formation.
A.R. But in moving this way and confessing the name of the Lord Jesus publicly, do we not find God in the idea of the cloud, which is indicative of the divine presence with us?
J.T. Yes; they are said to be baptised, first in the cloud and then in the sea; (@1 Corinthians 10). The cloud is the positive thing on my side; the sea may seem to be against me, but the cloud assures me of the *presence of God*.
J.S. The cloud came into view as Israel moved out of Egypt.
J.T. It did. It is a feature of God's presence with His people as having delivered them or as delivering them. You do not find it in the land; it appears in these circumstances and is a feature of the wilderness.
A.B.P. Although this was a beginning with those who moved out, would the link with Joseph serve to link on their faith with all the previous work of God?
J.T. Just so. The idea of burial begins with Sarah, and it is said that she died at *Hebron*, which is very significant; that is, she died in the light of another world. It was not death without hope; but a death full of hope, and so the burying-place comes in immediately. There is more said about the burying-place in @Genesis 23 than about Sarah, because it is a question of *where the saints* are buried; that is, in relation to "that world, and the resurrection". All this stands connected with the carrying up of Joseph's bones.
A.B.P. It is significant that Hebron antedates the world.
J.T. The world of God's purpose is in view. It is based on resurrection from among the dead. Hebron was built before Zoan in Egypt. It was "before the world", (@1 Corinthians 2).
{234}
J.E.H. Why did Abraham say, in that connection, that he wished to bury his dead out of his sight?
J.T. The allusion is to corruption, in which the body is "sown", (@1 Corinthians 15:42). We must thus bury it out of our sight. The more we *accept* the fact of corruption, the more wonderful resurrection is. This is implied in Lazarus being four days in the tomb; in Martha's thought corruption had begun.
J.E.H. Abraham had the light of resurrection?
J.T. He had. However corrupt we may be, the more we dwell on it and accept it -- and it is very humbling to accept it -- the more wonderful resurrection is to us, for what is sown in corruption is raised in incorruptibility; a spiritual body, and in power and glory.
A.R. Is there any significance in that the children of Israel went through the Red Sea on dry land? Pharaoh is overthrown in the sea. God takes account of them in these circumstances.
J.T. Yes; He annulled him who has the might of death. If you go by the actual wording of this chapter, Pharaoh's personal destruction is not mentioned. It is inferred, but it is definitely spoken of later. I suppose the allusion is to the fact that Satan is already annulled, although he still retains power; but later on, we shall see that he is actually deprived of all power as cast into the lake of fire.
A.N.W. God says, "I will glorify myself in Pharaoh", (@Exodus 14:4). Would you say that all this is first to establish Himself as God in the souls of His people rather than the mere destruction of their enemies?
J.T. That is right. There are many concurrent thoughts here. The military feature is very prominent. We shall get later how God has brought us to Himself, bearing us on eagles wings. That is not military; it is because He loves us and would have
{235}
us with Him. Here it is the military side, God is celebrated as a Man of war. He is exalted as such, and that goes right through into Canaan, bringing them in and planting them in the mountain of His inheritance.
J.S. This would be seen not only in the movements of the cloud, but in His speaking. He commands the people in military authority.
J.T. That is important; everyone is to know what is to be done and to take up his position, moving according to orders given.
J.S. Moses is told to speak to the children of Israel that they go forward. God says, so to speak, I will take care of the enemy.
J.T. Moses is there like a subordinate officer. It is very assuring and instructive to see Jehovah as a Man of war -- He comes within our range, in that sense, so that we may see what He is doing against the enemy with a view to our deliverance and protection.
A.F.M. Is that why the *right* hand is mentioned here?
J.T. Quite so. His best is exercised on our behalf -- "the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe", (@Ephesians 1:19).
G.N. God had said to Moses, "I am come down to deliver", (@Exodus 3:8); and God had authorised Moses to say to Pharaoh, "Let my people go, that they may serve me", (@Exodus 8:1). Would you say that that declaration precipitated the conflict?
J.T. Yes; He had *come down* to deliver, which involved conflict.
G.N. So the young believer when he declares himself by confessing the Lord, understands that the conflict must follow.
J.T. That is right. We ought to keep clearly in mind that Jehovah here is a Man of war; in the book of Joshua we have the captain of Jehovah's
{236}
hosts; this latter is the *heavenly* side of the conflict.
C.A.M. From a military point of view, death, that is, the Red Sea, seems to be used as a weapon for the destruction of the Egyptians.
J.T. Yes. Christ has, through death, annulled him who has the might of death; (@Hebrews 2:14). Seen as in the Red Sea, death is a very *extended* thought. It "reigned from Adam until Moses", and is used at once against the world and overwhelms it, for what can the world do in the presence of such a power? It is in the hands of Satan, but if God turns it against man, it is overwhelming.
C.A.M. So that death is ours in that way?
J.T. Yes; death is ours. Goliath's sword was that typically. "There is none like that", David said; (@1 Samuel 21:9). The Jordan is more in view, however, when death is said to be ours.
J.T.Jr. Is the Lord viewed as a Man of war in @John 11?
J.T. Yes; I think we have to take @John 11 as military. He is approaching death -- one He loved was already in it four days. The Lord deliberately stayed away until death took place, but He is approaching the enemy in a military way; and on the way to the tomb, He adjusts Martha and speaks to Mary. Then, when at the tomb, He says, "Lazarus, come forth". But in approaching death, the enemy was before Him. He "was deeply moved in spirit, and was troubled". The latter word in the original denotes resentment, or indignation, and undoubtedly expressed His feelings as to the power of death as an enemy.
C.A.M. The Lord delaying until Lazarus died shows how the time element enters into these great things -- the marvellous accuracy of everything.
J.T. God is a God of *measure*.
A.B.P. The fact that He stayed where He was for two days after having heard of Lazarus's sickness --
{237}
would it show the Lord's submission to God, or suggest military strategy?
J.T. Both. It was that God and the Son of God might be glorified in the resurrection of Lazarus.
R.A.L. Do we learn the power of God first, or His love?
J.T. His power is known before His love. If you are dealing with an enemy, you are thinking of the power on your side. Love is not so much the point. When He says, "I ... brought you to myself", that is more the love side. Jehovah's proposal to enter into covenant with His people enlarges on the thought of love. The order in which the truth stands in Romans is the righteousness of God, chapter 3; the power of God, chapter 4, and the love of God, chapter 5. The same order is seen in Exodus.
R.D.G. What is the force of Jehovah's name being emphasised after the statement that He is a Man of war? It says, "Jehovah, his name".
J.T. Is that not in keeping with Exodus? Exodus mentions that this is His name. You do not get "Jehovah, his name" until you come to Exodus. The people are here celebrating that name. God said of it, "This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations". They are thinking of Him here in that precious name that He includes in His covenant relations with them.
J.T.Jr. The power is connected in Acts with "the name" of Jesus.
A.F.M. Do you not think, too, that the way Jehovah introduced the name in chapter 3 helps? Moses says in verse 13, "the children of Israel ... shall say, What is his name?" Then God brings in the name of Jehovah. The Name is so remarkable in itself.
J.T. It fits in with Exodus, God having come down. Preliminary to that, of course, is the bush
{238}
where God brings out who He is, and having come down, He is to be honoured. The humiliation of the incarnation involved that the Lord would be under reproach, He took such a lowly attitude. And I think the idea of the Name is introduced at once. Matthew takes care of that side, in the names *Emmanuel* and *Jesus*. Both of these names imply Deity in the lowliest of men, God protecting the incarnation, that the Name is there, and never to be overlooked. That is God, preserving the majesty of the Deity in the lowliest circumstances. Later in Israel, a man "blasphemed *the Name*", (@Leviticus 24:11). We are not told what it was. It is as though everybody should know that although Jehovah has come down and walked in this lowly way, the Name must be honoured; and hence the man was stoned. I think that is what is in mind. Exodus brings out the Name. The name of God entered into the down-stooping of God. He had come down in the thorn-bush, to a lowly position. God says in effect, I am coming into these lowly circumstances, but My Name remains; in fact, I never made known My Name in such a way as I am making it known now; and He looks for His people to highly regard it; not belittle it; for "Jehovah, his name".
W.B-w. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in chapter 3 would mean that He had come in to fulfil all the promises?
J.T. Exactly; it is a question of His faithfulness, but it is really the Deity because He says, "I am". That is what is meant -- "the existing One". Whatever He does in the humiliation of Himself, He is the ever-existing One -- "Before Abraham was, I am", (@John 8:58) God ever takes care of His majesty: In @Genesis 3 He made clothes for poor sinful creatures. That was a wonderfully lowly service, but what follow are the cherubim with the sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. That
{239}
is the government of God and protects His rights, maintaining His majesty.
F.H.L. Is it not remarkable that young believers (contemplated here) are seen as having learned to use these names -- Jehovah, Jah, Lord.
J.T. It is a very full but precious thought, these names being employed as the saints are just delivered out of the world. The first mention of "Jah" is here. All this shows the place God may early acquire in the young believer's heart. Although there is a leader in this song, Israel is early to have part in collective singing. Another important lesson here is that young believers are brought into this first song.
G.MacP. Would this celebration be in contrast to the lowly conditions into which Jehovah had come?
J.T. It would indeed. He was "highly exalted"; that is, morally exalted, having come *down* to deliver His people.
A.P.T. "Having a name written which no one knows but himself", (@Revelation 19:12). Is that Deity?
J.T. I think Deity is implied. The Lord said, "no one knows the Son but the Father", (@Matthew 11:27). I think these statements go together.
J.H.E. You said earlier that God coming in and delivering Israel is the beginning of warfare. Would the devouring of Gog and Magog by fire from heaven be the end?
J.T. That is right. @Revelation 20 records the last great conflict. The enemies come up on the breadth of the earth against the beloved city, and fire comes down from God out of heaven and devours them. That is final. It is affecting to see that in the beginning and at the end it is God acting for His people.
J.S. The song here goes a long way. Not only do we see the overthrow of the enemy and deliverance from Egypt, but He would bring them in and plant
{240}
them in the mountain of His inheritance; it goes right to the end.
J.T. The faith of the singers goes on to Canaan and the sanctuary. It says in verses 14 - 18: "The peoples heard it, they were afraid: A thrill seized the inhabitants of Philistia. Then the princes of Edom were amazed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling hath seized them; All the inhabitants of Canaan melted away. Fear and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, Jehovah, Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place that thou, Jehovah, hast made thy dwelling, The Sanctuary, Lord, that thy hands have prepared. Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever!"
J.E.H. Is verse 19 part of the song, or does it follow it?
J.T. It is an historical statement, the basis of the song. It comes after what Moses and the children of Israel sang, and before what Miriam and the women sang. It tells of the overthrow of the Egyptians and that the children of Israel went on *dry ground* through the midst of the sea.
A.F.M. According to the passage, not only was Pharaoh overthrown, but *every* enemy laid low.
J.T. It is the one great stroke of God to take us out of the world and place us on heavenly ground.
A.B.P. How do you account for the fact that Israel evidently understood the enemy's thoughts? Pharaoh's thoughts are known, and then the enemies
{241}
in the land were known to fear. Should we reach that stage as young believers?
J.T. There are some six things (verse 9), the enemy said he would do. His strategy and general purpose are known; all that he intended in his heart to do is known. The effect of God's great power on Philistia, Edom, and Moab, and the inhabitants of Canaan generally, is known.
J.E.H. "We are not ignorant of *his* thoughts", (@2 Corinthians 2:11).
A.B.P. In view of all this, should we say, "If the Lord should so will and we should live, we will also do this or that", (@James 4:15)?
J.T. Quite so, and to have spiritual discernment of things. The devil cannot discern a spiritual man. He can discern an unconverted man or an unspiritual Christian, but he cannot discern a spiritual Christian. "The spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one", (@1 Corinthians 2:15).
J.S. Does the word, "Till the people pass over" allude to Jordan? In which case the Red Sea and Jordan would coalesce.
J.T. It seems so; they are brought together in that way. It is faith in the people -- "by faith they passed through the Red Sea". But in verse 16, entrance into the land of promise is immediately in mind.
A.P.T. Does this view of God being for us link on with the first five chapters of Romans? Would it be right to say that the end of the war is contemplated here? They say, "Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever", but literally the conflict was only beginning.
J.T. Yes. The dwelling of Jehovah is in view and this was built by Solomon as the subjection of all enemies was effected. "There is neither adversary nor evil occurrent", (@1 Kings 5:4).
{242}
W.G.T. Rahab had the light in her soul of what Jehovah did at the Red Sea.
J.T. Yes; you could link this on with her.
T.H. It says, "For we have heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when ye came out of Egypt" and "all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you", (@Joshua 2:9,10). She really had the testimony of all this.
J.T. What Jehovah did at the Red Sea and what *ye* did to Sihon and Og. She understood, too, what the saints did.
G.MacP. Does it help us to see the break up of the world's system, and according to the Lord's words, "hades gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16:18)? The assembly is going through undefeated?
J.T. We touch Ephesians in these last words of the song.
F.H.L. This seems a very wonderful vision for a young believer. Is it normal?
J.T. Well, if he gets a glimpse of it in the assembly, he is carried along, with the faith of the older ones. It is the faith that is current there; that is largely how one gets on spiritually as being rightly exercised and helped in that way.
W.F.K. The man in @John 9 would teach us how to become good soldiers of Jesus Christ. He learned warfare in that he asserted the truth as he knew it.
J.T. He is an excellent example for us all.
W.B-w. Does the sanctuary here and Jehovah reigning go on to David and Solomon? The song seems to carry one on to Solomon and the house.
J.T. Yes. The sanctuary is brought in by Solomon. That is what is alluded to. I think it helps us as to the service of God in the assembly and the house, to see that David and Solomon are the counterpart of Moses; they add to Exodus. Joshua does not inaugurate the sanctuary. That is not his side;
{243}
it is David and Solomon. The sanctuary stands in relation to them.
J.S. It might be helpful to open up the two positions as seen in Exodus and then under David and Solomon.
J.T. Exodus brings in the authority of God in Christ; it is the *authority* side of the truth. David and Solomon contemplate headship and sonship, so that Moses and David and Solomon link up the assembly. Exodus is the first thought, involving authority and the covenant, including the Lord's supper; and David and Solomon are in relation to the assembly, viewed Godward in the land.
W.B-w. Moses is on the line of commandment.
J.T. Moses answers to Corinthians; David and Solomon to Ephesians.
A.F.M. Israel in Egypt had little thought of what God had in view for the satisfaction of His own heart. They thought more of release from the enemy, but God had before Him a sanctuary where He should be known and approached.
A.R. Do you mean that as we enjoy salvation, the Lord would remind us that this is only the beginning; there is much more beyond?
J.T. Yes, and there is the heavenly position and God's service in the assembly, which is bound up with David and Solomon, as already remarked.
W.F.K. Does Miriam bring in the subjective side?
J.T. That is the thought; the song, to *some* extent, pervades the whole people; verse 19 gives us a historical statement. It is to settle our souls as to what has happened, and then Miriam and the women come in. She represents what is subjective, as you say, not merely a matter of light.
J.S. She is on the spiritual side. She is definitely called a prophetess.
{244}
J.T. Yes she is called a *prophetess and a sister of Aaron*. There is much spiritual significance in this. It is the first time we have her name and her relation to Aaron mentioned.
W.G.T. We must note the women with her.
J.T. Yes; it is the subjective side, the love side. At the end of this song the people would not say, That is all over our heads; we do not understand what we were singing about! The part of Miriam and the women signifies that the people generally understood what is meant.
W.G.T. You get the same thing in David's day, the women came out to sing unto David. He had slain his ten thousands.
A.N.W. Miriam repeats the first note of the song that Jehovah is highly exalted. Is that not important for us as young souls to realise, that in becoming our salvation, God is highly exalted?
J.T. Yes. He had come into such a lowly place in the bush and has acted in such power, that faith sees Him exalted. Miriam just repeats in her response what had been said at the beginning: "Miriam answered them, Sing to Jehovah, for he is highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea". She is in accord with that note, but it does not include Canaan.
A.B.P. Is it right to say that the state of the people is represented by the last verse?
J.T. Yes, quite so. It says, "Miriam, the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances". It would seem as if all the people were brought into this.
{245}
C.N.P. Would it be like @Romans 5, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts"?
J.T. A little. They were all to *some* extent in the good of the song. God was acquiring a great place with them. "He is highly exalted", they sang.
W.B-w. The first part refers to God personally, and the latter part to His work -- "The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea".
J.T. Yes; it is His military prowess that is in mind.
J.S. Would all this pave the way for the assembly?
J.T. I think so. This is the beginning of the service of song.
F.S.C. Is this the song referred to in @Revelation 15, and will it be sung again in heaven?
J.T. Yes; the song of Moses and the Lamb; those that gain the victory over the beast, and over this image sing this song. It is the song of triumph by which deliverance is celebrated, showing how the scripture is linked up in the praises of Israel.
R.W.S. A great change has come about in the Israelites between the time of this complaint against Moses for leading them out of Egypt, and the time of this glorious song of triumph.
J.T. It is accounted for by the believer coming into the understanding of the death and resurrection of Christ. You are not beyond Romans here. It is not *our* resurrection here. It is what God has done in Christ. Compare @Romans 5.
J.T.Jr. Does Peter's first gospel address in @Acts 2 correspond with @Exodus 15 in some way? "Having therefore been exalted", Peter says, then the assembly comes immediately into view.
J.T. Just so. How great a thing it is to have in your soul that God is exalted! It is a moral thought I think, because of what He has done. It is according to Romans. Christ comes into our souls in Romans
{246}
because of what He has done. It is more His moral greatness.
A.F.M. Jehovah occupied the place as exalted, that Pharaoh had in the people's mind when they were in fear and dread -- what a change!
A.N.W. He has stooped to secure my blessing. He secures it and exalts Himself through this great service of His love.
J.T. That is right. It adds moral glory to Himself; and then God "highly exalted him", (@Philippians 2:9).
{247}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (2)
@Exodus 17:8 - 16; @Numbers 1:1 - 4; @Numbers 2:1 - 9
J.T. It came before us at our last reading that the children of Israel were not called upon to fight in @Exodus 14. Jehovah would fight for them. They were to learn war from what they saw, and inasmuch as we learn everything from God in Christ so they would see how *God* led in war; this is the first great lesson in this respect to be learnt by us. Israel had part in it, in the sense of being present, but the word was, "Jehovah will fight for you", and they celebrated in their song that He did fight for them.
The thought before us on this occasion is that we should see how the *people* are brought into the conflict. Moses directed Joshua: "Choose us men, and go out, fight with Amalek". The people are now brought into conflict formally, although not yet ordered militarily. They are under Joshua, chosen by him, but in @Numbers 1:3 we have the statement, "all that go forth to military service;" not all that *should go*, but all that *go*; that is, the principle of going forth in military service is now acknowledged. I think that if we keep these thoughts before us we shall see, by the Lord's help, how the saints come into the conflict and how they are numbered militarily from twenty years old and upward. Each is to take his place, as it says in chapter 2, "every one by his standard, with the ensign of their father's house; round about the tent of meeting". Numbers contemplates that we are set in relation to the testimony; not yet in aggressive warfare, but defensive warfare.
J.S. This position, then, as seen in Numbers is a defensive one.
J.T. Yes. The attack of Amalek, of course,
{248}
required an offensive attitude, but the wilderness attitude in the main is defensive. There is a change in this respect in wilderness warfare in @Numbers 21 and onwards. War there begins to result in acquired territory. This comes in after the judgment of the flesh in the brazen serpent and the drinking of the springing well.
A.N.W. Will you place wilderness warfare for us in a New Testament setting?
J.T. Well, it is seen generally in Romans and in the letters to Corinth. In @Romans 13:12 the armour is said to be that of *light*, and in chapter 8:37 the saints "more than conquer through him that has loved us"; but this is in moral power overcoming every opposing element. Romans is the individual side of the position, but it bears towards the collective side. The letters to Corinth contemplate the position we occupy in defence of the testimony. So that there is a great deal made of *order* in those epistles.
A.F.M. Would you distinguish for us the difference between warfare inwardly and warfare outwardly?
J.T. Well, @Exodus 17 is inward warfare really. It refers to the presence of the Spirit as typically presented in that chapter, that is, the Spirit is viewed as present, through the sufferings of Christ. Moses was to use the rod and Jehovah was to stand there on the rock. There is nothing said about the water flowing or the people drinking, but the Spirit is in principle seen as present with us. In @Numbers 20 we have a like occurrence, only in that instance it is said that the people drank. In @Numbers 21, the Spirit is appreciated as the outcome of the flesh being judged in the brazen serpent. Israel sang to the well; and would drink of it according to divine direction: "Assemble the people, and I will give them water", (@Numbers 21:16). Then they moved from
{249}
point to point, reaching "the top of Pisgah". But in our chapter the Spirit is just alluded to. What is stressed rather is the smiting of the rock and then the attack of Amalek, which, I think, typically means Satan working through our fleshly propensities as if to set aside and nullify the effect of the Spirit's presence amongst the people of God, implying that He was not there. Satan would seek to overcome us in this way, and would thus deny the Spirit's presence, as if there was no power to resist him. Whereas what is clearly seen is that there *was* power -- but power through a certain unique procedure; that is, Moses on high, with the rod of God, supported by Aaron and Hur. It is an inward warfare, warfare that especially refers to young Christians. That is the import of the great battle of Rephidim; the name Rephidim means "plains"; it is a level position, probably implying exposure.
The people are brought into it. "Choose us men", said Moses to Joshua, who is the general -- a man that we have not heard of before, a man of secret history with God, or he would not get an appointment like this. He is here a type of Christ as the spiritual Leader of God's people. The *issue* of this war is not manifest, but its *continuance* is emphasised.
W.G.T. Victory in the conflict depends upon the intercession of the Lord on high.
J.T. Yes; there are however *three* figures on the top of the hill. Rephidim means "plains", but the hill denotes moral elevation. Firstly, Moses is there; he says, "I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand". Then the passage says, "And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill". Aaron and Hur are secondary considerations; Moses does not mention them to Joshua; which indicated that there was more needed
{250}
than had been anticipated. The conflict was more severe than had been expected.
A.P.T. Would you say a word as to why this incident is more amplified in @Deuteronomy 25?
J.T. It is introduced there to call attention to Amalek's *character*; the passage shows incidentally that it was the *weak* ones who were attacked; they are described as "all the feeble that lagged behind thee". Amalek took advantage of Israel's weakness for he "feared not God". The further point there is that Israel were not to forget to blot out his name under the heavens.
C.A.M. You were saying that there is more needed than we might think of in conflict: it is a mistake to underrate the power of the enemy.
J.T. Yes. Moses mentioned only himself with the rod of Jehovah, but there is more than authority needed in this matter. You might tell young Christians they should not go here or there. We have to be constantly exhorting them as to this; but authority is not enough, and that is what Aaron and Hur signify here. Aaron is the priest, although he is not yet formally designated as such; his inauguration is recorded in chapter 28. Hur is somewhat of a mysterious man. It is a question as to what his name means; the general consensus of scholars is that his name signifies "white" or "white linen", and hence speaks of *purity*.
A.F.M. What does Aaron's name mean?
J.T. It is said to denote one "enlightened", "lofty", "teacher".
A.F.M. Are these elements requisite for us in addition to Moses as in authority?
J.T. That is what is to be gathered. Notice that Aaron's work and Hur's work are to support the arms of *Moses*; that is, the action of Moses arms would be of an up-and-down movement, which is very characteristic of the experience of young
{251}
Christians -- a bright day today and a dark one tomorrow.
F.H.L. This experience of warfare is necessary before the numbering for war later.
J.T. Yes, those that go forth to war are thus known; they include young Christians who have confessed the Lord and stand by their confession if attacked. They also have learned or are learning to resist the devil and his temptations.
W.F.K. Would you say that every Christian has to pass through this combat before he can advance?
J.T. I think so. We should notice the allusion to Rephidim in chapter 19. It says, "In the third month after the departure of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai: they departed from Rephidim, and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness", (verses 1,2). They thus had come through this great experience before reaching the place of the covenant and the ordering of the camp in relation to the tabernacle.
G.A. Is it not important to regard this foe as implacable, for every generation has to meet it?
J.T. That is right; wherever there are young Christians, he will oppose them, even although their parents are most spiritual. The offspring of such are exposed equally as others are. Every successive generation has to deal with Amalek. God has unfurled the standard against him and He will maintain it.
A.R. What is your thought of Joshua coming forward as leader? The meaning of his name is given as "Jah the Saviour".
J.T. He appears in this chapter for the first time. There is comfort in the thought of the Saviour. He answers to the cry, "who shall deliver me out of this body of death?" The answer is, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord", (@Romans 7:24,25).
{252}
J.S. Would Aaron and Hur stand for the priestly element of the meeting that would uphold the authority of the Lord?
J.T. Yes, that is right -- that which has been said in the way of admonition to the young people is supported. Joshua is evidently to be regarded here in the light of the change in his name in @Numbers 13. "Jah" enters into this name, and in this connection it is suggestive that Moses says of Amalek, "the hand is on the throne of Jah", (verse 16).
C.A.M. As this scripture is addressed to us when young in our souls, the way these characteristics come before us is evidently an intimation of what will be. I was thinking of what you said about Aaron. It seems to be the same with Joshua. These things are going to be very great.
J.T. They are going to become great in our souls; for all of them typically refer to Christ, in one way or another; as we progress He advances in importance in our spiritual vision; the thought of His authority is the first thing to take into account here.
A.Pf. What about the older Christians -- the fathers, for instance?
J.T. Exposure to Amalek's attacks exists while we are down here; the flesh is in us always; but the allusion here, I think, is to this early stage of our history as having just come out of the world. We shall have warfare forty years later, so to say, which is more a question of older Christians, but this is like the letters to the Corinthians. At Corinth the believers were only young Christians, not more than eighteen months or two years old when the apostle wrote to them.
A.N.W. What does the blotting out of the remembrance of Amalek mean?
J.T. God will do that, although it will take centuries of time. He has been at it for nineteen centuries now. We are *responsible* to do it, as we
{253}
see in Deuteronomy, as already stated. As long as there are young Christians, Amalek will have special opportunity of opposing them, but that will not go on for ever. We shall reach a perfect state presently when Amalek will be no more. Balaam speaks about him as "the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be for destruction", (@Numbers 24:20).
A.P. Tell us the difference between what we are *naturally* and what we are as in the *flesh*.
J.T. We have to use these words as they appear in Scripture -- that which is first was not spiritual but natural. The natural in that sense may be regarded as legitimate, but it is the first; afterwards that which is spiritual. The spiritual supersedes the natural. But the flesh in the sense in which we are speaking of it now is evil. The word, however, is also used as expressing physical condition, which is of God. The Lord was here in the flesh, and Paul speaks of himself as being in the flesh, but what is before us is flesh in a moral sense as that on which Satan operates in us. We are told what the *works of the flesh* are. There are sixteen of them mentioned in @Galatians 5:19 - 21; there are ten kinds of *wicked persons* mentioned in @1 Corinthians 6:9 - 11, and there are thirteen "*wicked things*" going out of the heart of men, mentioned by the Lord Himself in @Mark 7:21 - 23. @Romans 1 gives a terrible description of the flesh -- man after the flesh given up to vile lusts, and @2 Timothy 3 gives a like list, as appearing in the sphere of Christian profession. If we carefully *read* all these scriptures, we shall see portrayed what the flesh is.
A.P. In @Romans 7:15 Paul makes no allowance for good in the flesh at all. He says, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell".
J.T. That is flesh in the moral sense, and of course the relation between it and the literal flesh is very intimate (except in Christ here), because that
{254}
which is born of flesh is flesh. We cannot make anything else out of it.
A.P. Relations in the flesh in a literal sense, such as children, husband and wife, etc., are of God.
J.T. "But in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God", (@Galatians 2:20). That shuts out the flesh in a moral sense altogether.
W.G.T. It is viewed here as antagonistic to what is of God.
J.T. That is the ground on which it is dealt with in our chapter. Amalek is typically Satan working through it.
W.G.T. "The hand" is said to be "on the throne of Jah". Would that refer to Amalek?
J.T. I think so. It alludes to Satan's power which may control the Christian. The throne alludes to God's place in the Christian. God has rights in him, and these are acknowledged at the end of @Romans 7: "I myself with the mind serve God's law".
W.B-w. The flesh acts in older Christians, too. What feature of the flesh is that?
J.T. It is the same flesh. Normally, the older Christian is less exposed to Amalek; Satan would attack him through other means. Of course, if an older Christian weakens spiritually and lags behind, he also is exposed to Amalek. There are the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit -- one fruit. The fruit of the Spirit is the beautiful growth in the Christian that God would have unmarred. It is a combination of nine different features of fruit on one stem. "The works of the flesh" are enumerated; then "the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, self-control", (@Galatians 5:19 - 23). That is the beautiful growth that God would preserve and nourish in every Christian from the very outset.
{255}
N.McC. You spoke of warfare with Amalek. What is the character of this warfare in us?
J.T. It is defensive. It is on a plain, according to the meaning of Rephidim. "Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim". He takes the initiative; it illustrates a Christian just come out of the world, having gone thus far comfortably; then God allows Amalek to come up at a certain point. He specially sheltered the believer at the outset. But now he has been through the Red Sea and has drunk of the bitter waters of Marah; he has had part in the refreshment afforded by the twelve wells of water, and the seventy palm trees; and further he has eaten the manna; that is, God has taken good care of him. Up to this, he has been wonderfully protected and nourished. The idea associated with manna in the previous chapter is *rest*, that is, God has brought the Christian into the sabbath; Christ has been brought vividly before him in the manna; he has had occasion to prove that God is for him, and now he is at this place, signifying *plains*, where Satan has a point of attack. What has been alluded to in Deuteronomy shows to us what really the difficulty here was, that some had waned; some had grown feeble in the three months. They had come out of Egypt in strength. When they came out of Egypt every one was baptised to Moses in the cloud and in the sea, but some had waned in endurance, so there were weak ones and stragglers, and God allowed that to be brought to light. These were smitten, according to @Deuteronomy 25. God is really in charge of all this. He allowed the exposure and Satan took advantage of it. It is a painful and, in a sense, an uncertain struggle at the outset, but God through an extraordinary combination of exercises gives final victory. At the beginning things are not going well; we have to learn the character of the flesh. Satan gets in and that exposes where we are.
{256}
It sometimes occurs that young people turn away and walk no more with us on this account.
C.A.M. It is a great encouragement that God is not taken by surprise by this oncoming of the enemy. It may be a surprise to us.
J.T. Let anyone read chapters 12 - 17, and he will see what wonderful provision has been made for the believer; Christ is touchingly before us in chapter 16 in the manna. It is a wonderful manifestation of Christ, and the sabbath is associated with it; for the first time the Christian is brought into rest. Well, how is he getting on? Possibly he is thinking of the world; it may be he is secretly allowing the flesh, and God exposes that; since it will be for his salvation. Thus the enemy attacks.
Ques. How do you account for the fact that Moses was not *instructed* to go against Amalek? He takes the initiative.
J.T. I think it shows that Moses had been learning. He knew what to do, and the fact that Aaron and Hur are brought to light shows he has learned to *meet an emergency*. It is a great evidence of experience that Aaron and Hur are brought in to augment the position.
A.R.S. Do you not think Amalek found this a very good time to make an attack? Israel had just been *murmuring*.
J.T. The murmuring here explains the weakness spoken of in @Deuteronomy 25.
A.C. In this remarkable conflict there is an allusion to writing. What is the suggestion in this?
J.T. It is the first mention of writing in Scripture. It is Jehovah who says, "Write this for a memorial in the book". The book is already there. Persons and things needed are seen here peculiarly as existing -- as if the result of normal experience. It is a great thought to grasp, that in the divine system of things, everything is ready.
{257}
Apparent emergencies and crises serve to bring this out. The writing was for *Joshua*; we are to keep our eyes on him from this point onward.
F.H.L. The secret history with God which Joshua must have had was open to all Israel, was it not?
J.T. Yes. Exodus stresses this great principle of secret history. You get it in Aaron as one who was not brought forward until he was eighty years old. Miriam is another. She was even older before her name is mentioned. Now we have Joshua brought forward. We learn later that he was a young man, but this is not stated here. As to secret history with God, the Lord says, "But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret", (@Matthew 6:6).
J.J.J. Do these four -- Moses, Aaron, Hur, and Joshua -- represent the Lord, or elements amongst the saints?
J.T. They represent elements amongst us. Secret relations with God are much wanting in the Lord's people. Meetings like this are most essential, but we do not get much out of them unless we have personal history with God.
W.G.T. Is it not remarkable that Moses left Joshua to make the choice of the army?
J.T. It shows there was experience with God with him. The fact that a young man is put in charge of an army, and the selection left to him, shows how fully he is trusted. One has to be with God to be trustworthy. We must be in the divine school.
F.N.W. @James 4:7,8 says, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you".
J.T. A man who knows how to draw near to God in secret will resist the devil.
G.A. Is it lack of secret history in Christians that
{258}
accounts for their breaking down the hedge and so getting bitten by the serpent; (@Ecclesiastes 10:8).
J.T. Yes. Young Christians will do things slyly which they should not do, and Satan has thus opportunity to damage them.
C.A.M. What is the hedge?
J.T. A legitimate limitation which I should not break down.
A.N.W. This matter of learning is very important. I suppose we are to detect the failure in the drooping hand, and the victory in the uplifted hand. Moses, Aaron, and Hur were discovering it.
J.T. It almost suggests the idea of "the body". That hand being lifted up, Israel prevailed, as if it was moving Israel. It is a mysterious allusion, having the *state* of Israel in mind. Joshua's outstretched hand with the javelin at Ai (@Joshua 8:18) may be compared with this chapter; there no support of the hand is mentioned; it was stretched out by divine direction. In our chapter it is an undulating state of things that God would bring to light, and then the necessity for the other two men is evident. We have a stone, too, which "they took" and put under Moses -- an additional thought. There is the suggestion of solidity in it.
A.F.M. What is the meaning of the staff? In chapter 17 Moses was commanded of God: "Take with thee of the elders of Israel, and thy staff with which thou didst smite the river, take in thy hand, and go". In the next section Moses says, "tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand".
J.T. It is divine *authority*. The smiting of the river proved the efficiency of the staff; it had history, too. It denotes the history of Moses. When it was cast on the ground it became a serpent. Then when he took it in his hand by the tail, it became a rod again. It is thus typical of humanity according
{259}
to God -- Christ abstractly. Moses says, here, "Choose us men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand". The staff signifies the authority of God. But then we have *hands* later. The staff in the hand is not enough; Moses must bring in the other hand. The whole man is to be brought into this exercise; the two hands are to be supported, the one by Aaron and the other by Hur. I think it is important to see the value of this position on the hill-top. It is well to exercise authority -- to say to one, you should not do this or that; that is illustrative of one hand with the staff of God in it, but you need the other hand. The latter implies that you seek to support and help the Christian to judge and avoid evil things.
J.E.H. I suppose Eli (@1 Samuel 2) used the one hand with his sons -- he said, You should not do thus.
J.T. Quite so. But they continued their evil course. He did not influence them to judge and forsake it. For this, priestly grace and power is needed.
Rem. How would you apply the holding up of the hands in order that Amalek might be defeated?
J.T. You can see that everything here depended on Moses; he began with one hand and the staff of God in it, but as you proceed in this chapter, exigencies arise; the situation is more difficult than it appeared to be; but it is met by an Aaron and a Hur -- who were not mentioned at first -- and by the two hands, which were not mentioned at first, either; that is, the idea of meeting the emergencies, so that although the thing is more difficult than we expected, it is fully met nevertheless.
This serves to bring out latent conditions showing that everything is ready, but ready on the principle of experience, that these men all had to do with God beforehand. The idea is that there is latent experience
{260}
that God will bring out by this attack. There is weakness which He brings out and exposes, but He also makes manifest what He has effected in His people. That is what a battle always evidences -- what God has effected and what the enemy has effected.
J.H.E. Would this latent experience lead on to "present your bodies a living sacrifice", in @Romans 12:1?
J.T. Yes; first it is the believer's body, then it runs on to the saints viewed as "one body in Christ". The apostle says, "For I say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every one that is among you, not to have high thoughts above what he should think", (chapter 12:3). It is, "through the grace which has been given to me", he says this. What he is bringing us to in the epistle is: that the work of God should come out and that we should not go beyond it; each should think according to the measure of faith God has given him.
W.G.T. Would it be further developed in @1 Corinthians 12, where you get the members of the body? Do you think the Corinthians were leaving out this matter of the hands?
J.T. The foot says, "Because I am not a hand I am not of the body". That is an *independent* attitude. It would be seen in a brother who would withdraw from us because he is not getting the place he thought he should have. He thinks he is doing the drudgery of the meeting. The hand is an honourable member. Well, the eye says to the ear, I do not need you. That is like a brother who would refuse another because he does not like him. These features come out in wilderness experience.
J.J.J. Is there anything suggestive in the expression, "Joshua broke the power of Amalek *and his people*"?
J.T. When we come to 1 Samuel we see that Saul
{261}
was directed to destroy Amalek; but he reserved the *best*. The king himself a delicate, cultured man, with the best of the cattle, was reserved. Joshua made no reserves here; he broke the power of Amalek and his people.
A.N.W. Referring to vacillation, one would ask for the benefit of the young here, if you are suggesting that it is legitimate to vacillate to a certain extent?
J.T. It is the effect of one's spiritual state. It is not that we should be vacillating. Moses hands were held up, as if his actual physical condition reflected this state in the people -- an undulating condition; but that up-and-down condition does not continue; it ceases by *another* provision, that of a stone provided for him to sit on and Aaron and Hur holding up his hands so that he did not need to let them down again. Hence it is the *steady* condition that triumphs, and the victory is attributed to Joshua.
A.B.P. Would you say that Peter in @Matthew 16 has his ups and downs? He confesses, "Thou art the Christ", but later rebukes the Lord for what He said about His sufferings. The Lord met the Amalek state in Peter by saying, "Get away behind me, Satan"; but He also brought in adjustment by saying, "thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men", (@Matthew 16:23).
J.T. That is suggestive. In his confession, Peter, you might say, is in full strength "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". You can hardly look for anything better in a Christian than that. He is addressed as *Peter*; he is material for the building. But presently he says, "God be favourable to thee, Lord", (@Matthew 16:22). That is like a brother who says, It is raining tonight and I am not going to the meeting, or I am tired, I will not go to the meeting, not minding what the brethren will suffer, in that there are only two or three there, so long as
{262}
he does not go. He is thinking of himself only. That is what the flesh in us is capable of.
C.A.M. Moses hands became steady until the going down of the sun; they were steady to the end.
J.T. Yes; the service of Aaron and Hur in supporting them is remarkable. There is no command as to this; their position and service on the hill seems to emanate from themselves, as the outcome of interest and experience, manifesting ability to meet the exigency. "Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on this side, and one on that side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun". That is the end of the exercise, in relation to which it is said, "Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword". That is, he did it in a truly military fashion. He finished his work excellently, and there is not a word to be said against Joshua.
J.S. It was with the edge of the sword.
J.T. Yes; in the antitype it is the word of God.
F.H.L. Had you any thought about Moses saying, "*To-morrow* I will stand on the top of the hill"?
J.T. "To-morrow" usually alludes, I think, to an *exercise* that should ensue, in view of what is going to happen. We have to go through the night before it happens. Thus we have the "evening" and the "morning", (@Genesis 1). Scope must be made for "the night seasons".
A.P. What about the altar and the name of it -- Jehovah-nissi?
J.T. It is Moses moving in response to the victory vouchsafed -- his contribution to Jehovah. The altar signifies that there is actual gain, and that this is to return to God in worship. It is a landmark in this sense, showing that the service of God is enriched through the conflict.
It says further that "*Moses* built an altar" -- it was of his own accord, and not as being told to do it.
{263}
It would mean that he would think for God now, that a definite point in this respect had been reached through the pressure and victory. One has noticed in conflicts, whether great or small, that if we all go through the exercise with God, there is more for Him in result. I think that is what the altar means here. Moses names it Jehovah-nissi; and he says further, "for the hand is on the throne of Jah; Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation". That is, you have an altar which signifies what is for God, and then what He is going to be for us in the further exercises that lie before us.
J.T.Jr. Do David's psalms illustrate that -- what he had to say to God after the exercise he went through?
J.T. Yes. The historical psalms signify what God got out of the crises mentioned in them. There is always something for God from pressure, so that after his great sin, David waited until the child died, and then he washed himself and anointed himself and went into the house of Jehovah. It resulted in what is for God.
A.C. Would Moses be somewhat akin to Noah? After the flood he built an altar and offered of every clean animal.
J.T. That is the idea; he is unselfish. All the altars reared up without any direction from God would mean that His work is showing itself and resulting in something for God. As to worship issuing from God's work in His people: Abraham plants a grove and calls on the name of the eternal God. The Philistine king sought a covenant with him to include himself, his son, and grandson. Abraham could accept the obligation desired of him as a worshipper of the *eternal* God who would sustain him in righteousness throughout all generations. So here, "Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation". That is the light Moses
{264}
had, as representing the intelligence of the position.
J.S. I suppose we see how the Lord consolidates the position by defeating the effort of Satan to discourage the believer, and now there is a real forward movement.
J.T. That is right. The altar and banner denote that a point had been reached in wilderness history from which we are not to go back. We are to go on to something in addition to this, and we can reckon on God to be with us.
R.W.S. What does the first part of verse 16 mean, "For the hand is on the throne of Jah"?
J.T. I think it refers to God's rights in your soul. Your soul is like a throne, and Satan would get there. @Romans 7, I think, works this out. It works out the problem as to who is going to have the right of way in your soul; who is going to have place there. The apostle says, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with the mind serve God's law", (verse 25). That is, the throne is there, God's right to it is recognised. Now when you come on to Horeb, it is specially stated there that they "departed from Rephidim", (@Exodus 19:2). This is a great landmark in the history of the believer; the battle with Satan acting in the flesh has been experienced and in result God has His place in the believer's heart, and *He* will have war against Amalek from generation to generation. I have no doubt that these things were all segregated later and put into the book of the wars of the Lord, but this is "*the* book", as if God *had* begun the history of His people. This war with Amalek could be regarded as an item in it.
A.R. We really can never be organised in the light of Numbers unless we have gone this way.
J.T. As already said, the persons numbered are those who *go* forth to war. They are known in that way. The verb is in the present and the past tenses in the New Translation. There are those who *go*
{265}
forth -- that is characteristic -- and there are those who *went* forth; (@Numbers 1:3,20).
A.P.T. Does not this victory at Rephidim make us good soldiers? We are ready to go on now as seeing the victory -- "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord", (@Romans 7:25).
J.T. That is the idea. Then you come to Horeb, where the covenant is made. You are now to listen to God at Horeb, where He discloses His great thoughts of love to His people.
J.S. Not now merely on the principle of conscription, but having a desire to go forward with Him.
A.P. Would you say that such a person is twenty years old?
J.T. That is exactly what is meant. That is what is alluded to in @Numbers 1: he has taken his sword and has gone forth.
A.P. Does not the idea of fellowship come in at Horeb? So that at twenty years of age one would be ready for fellowship.
J.T. Yes. Fellowship involves the covenant.
A.F.M. These believers as seen in Numbers are comparatively young, they are only thirteen months out of Egypt; it is not a very long time in which to come into the *good* of the gospel. They have moved on in a remarkable way, so that they are able to declare their pedigrees in view of being numbered for military service.
J.T. I think what we have said helps; that they go forth to war. This experience will be known immediately after conversion to God, as the converts are true to the Lord. They go whenever there is a battle, because they are ready.
A.P. Would attendance at the care meetings include this?
J.T. Yes, in the sense that counsel is there taken to meet Satan's efforts against the truth. Of course there should be no war *in* the care meetings.
{266}
A.Pf. Would defensive warfare in the wilderness fit us for offensive warfare later on?
J.T. I think so. After the flesh is exposed in its true character as prefigured in the brazen serpent and judged, and the Spirit is experienced as seen typically in the springing well, we are led on to aggressive warfare. The springing well is *upward*. This thought enters into later wars; warfare in the wilderness is on the plain, as it were. It is not aggressive, but just going through. If you are attacked, you defend yourself. But the Spirit in the Christian, according to @John 4, springs up into everlasting life. It is an upward movement, and I think it means that I have to dislodge the inhabitants of the land. Eternal life belongs to the land, and as soon as the Holy Spirit begins to move in *that* direction, then I begin to attack, because that territory is occupied by the devil.
N.McC. @Romans 8 speaks of the flesh and the Spirit, and @Galatians 5 refers to warfare between the flesh and the Spirit. In view of this, I am not to be a silent partner, so to speak, but I should have part in this conflict.
J.T. It is important to see that we are brought to the side of the Spirit. The passage you quoted from Galatians speaks of an *abnormal* condition; and such condition is to be done with in principle. The victory at Rephidim leads to this, and @Numbers 21 points to complete deliverance. The victory at Rephidim is attributed to Moses and Joshua, the behaviour of the people is not stressed, whereas in @Numbers 21 *Israel* sang to the well. In Galatians there is this constant conflict -- the flesh against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh, but Romans teaches that we *overcome*: "I myself with the mind serve God's law". I am on the side of God and the teaching following shows that the Spirit comes in *to support me in that position*, in that I give God His place in
{267}
me. The mind is the greatest faculty the Christian has -- it is the intelligent faculty, and by it you see it is right that God should assume full control over you. In Romans the believer is viewed as an institution, and the mind determines that the law of God must rule there. When we take that attitude, God will support us to the utmost. He comes in for us to this end by the Spirit; chapter 8 develops this support in those who give themselves up to Him. The "I myself" of chapter 7 implies that I have got my footing; I have reached solid ground. As to my responsibility, "I myself with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law". This latter clause does not mean that *I* am going to serve sin's law. Sin is served by the flesh characteristically, and I have thus judged it, for God has condemned it: "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh", (@Romans 8:3). It has thus no *right* to act at all. It has no right to a voice in me, and I maintain this, "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death", (verse 2). That is the position of the believer. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set him free.
A.P.T. Romans 8:9 says, "if any one has not the Spirit of Christ he is not of him".
J.T. That is a hypothetical "if", used there in a negative sense, but also used positively in the same verse: "if ... God's Spirit dwell in you"; certain things mark those who have the Spirit.
W.G.T. You linked @John 4 with @Romans 7.
J.T. Rather with @Romans 8. @Romans 8 is the springing up, so that we are regarded as sons of God. God is bringing many sons to glory. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God",
{268}
(verse 14). It is an upward movement. The top of Pisgah is reached in @Romans 8. After singing to the well Israel reached this point.
N.P. "But if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live", (verse 13). Has that reference to conflict?
J.T. Yes. It is by the Spirit not merely an effort of the mind or legal restrictions. It is calling attention to the Spirit, as we were saying, showing that it is the great power that God furnishes. It does not say here, If *ye* put to death the deeds of the body, but "if, *by the Spirit*", ye do it. I think if we reach the platform of "I myself", resolving to serve the law of God with the mind, we shall then see that @Romans 8 is God's side in the way of furnishing us, so that we are always conquerors.
A.P.T. Is the teaching of Romans entirely connected with the wilderness setting?
J.T. Yes; but we must remember that @Romans 7 and 8 apply to a later type than @Exodus 17; that is, chapter 8 contemplates the uplifted serpent of brass, the condemning of sin in the flesh, and the Spirit not only received but owned -- given full place, as superseding the flesh. Hence the ground is laid for Ephesians. Romans links on directly with Ephesians. Colossians is really a corrective epistle, although in advance of Romans.
A.F.M. The point of @Romans 8 is *living* in the sense of power; it is exactly what we get in @Numbers 21, resulting in a regulated and victorious life.
J.T. Israel sang this song, "Rise up, well! sing unto it". It has the dignity of a *song*, i.e., deliberately composed, implying full recognition of the Spirit.
J.S. Springing up would be an evidence of the Spirit in the believer to turn our thoughts and minds heavenward, as wholly for God.
J.T. As soon as you look heavenward, there are
{269}
enemies. It is no longer Amalek, but spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies.
A.R. @Romans 8 says, we cry "Abba, Father". Is that what you mean by Romans linking with Ephesians?
J.T. Quite so; it takes you directly on to Ephesians.
{270}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (3)
@Numbers 21:16 - 35
J.T. We noted this afternoon that in @Numbers 1 such as "go forth to military service" were to be numbered, meaning that there were those in Israel known in that way; they already had part in the wars of the Lord. The second reference in chapter 1 is to "all that *went forth* to military service", which is historic; but the first reference is to what was characteristic; so that at the numbering that took place thirteen months after they left Egypt they had acquired the character of warriors, and are numbered accordingly.
A.P. The position is still Horeb.
J.T. Yes, in @Numbers 1 to 10 the people are at Horeb.
A.N.W. Would you please say a word about the males being especially mentioned? That is not intended to exclude the sisters, you would say?
J.T. No. It is important to include them, because it should be made clear that the sisters are warriors also.
J.T.Jr. It says that Deborah went with Barak against Sisera; and she spoke of those who did *not* go to the battle; @Judges 4:9 and 5:23.
J.T. Which shows that the sisters are brought into the divine wars. Miriam and all the women of Israel are said to have joined in the song of celebration of Jehovah's victory; (@Exodus 15).
J.W.C. The women are also included in @Romans 16, the New Testament book of the wars of the Lord.
J.T. The age given in @Numbers 1 -- "twenty years and upward" -- is an allusion to spiritual age; that is, to those that have the Spirit. The chapter we have already considered contemplates the presence
{271}
of the Spirit. The Spirit is seen typically in the smiting of the rock in @Exodus 17, so that the calling into the war depends upon those called having the Spirit. There could be no spiritual discernment of what Joshua, Moses, Aaron, and Hur meant in that chapter, aside from the presence of the Spirit.
A.F.M. Normally speaking, there would be much encouragement given to those spiritually twenty, by being in the company of those more spiritually advanced. It says, "from twenty years old and upward". Those "upward"would have more experience of God than those who were twenty years old.
C.A.M. This numbering is based upon previous spiritual experience or status that has already been acquired.
J.T. That is the setting of it. There is a numbering in @Exodus 30, too, having the foundations or bases of the tabernacle in view. All those who were numbered on that occasion offered a heave offering to Jehovah of half a shekel; that is, the people were to be represented in the divine dwelling, in the silver sockets. They are there on the ground of redemption. The same persons evidently are in view in @Exodus 30 as are numbered in @Numbers 1. The heave offering of @Exodus 30 would bring the saints in as having affection, God being before them.
C.A.M. But here the numbering is in a military setting?
J.T. Exactly, and they are referred to as persons known to be military.
F.L. The actual conflict with Amalek would be by all those who go forth. This numbering comes after, so they start with a certain measure of practical experience before they get their full status. Is that the idea?
J.T. Yes. A young believer unfurls his standard as on the side of Christ in confessing the Lord with his mouth. Amalek will attack him. Will he haul
{272}
down his colours, or will he stand his ground? If he stands his ground, he is regarded as characteristically a military man; he has been to war. The attack of Amalek brought to light those who had failed to maintain the standard and were lagging behind. According to Deuteronomy, a certain weakness is disclosed, and God brings out these weaknesses in an attack. On the other hand, as we have had it before us, an attack also brings out the wonderful resources of God amongst His people, as represented in Moses, Aaron, Hur, and Joshua. These men were a divine provision, and they came to light as the need existed.
A.P. With regard to soul history, do I learn to overcome Amalek by myself -- to personally stand the attack? Whereas, in Numbers, I am called upon to fight the enemy with others.
J.T. You are enrolled in Numbers. At the battle of Rephidim, the warriors were *chosen* by Joshua rather than enrolled; that is to say, a trustworthy spiritual state is contemplated. Every conflict brings out a certain state of things, and Joshua represents the spiritual element that knows where the persons are who can be relied upon. It is left to Joshua to choose them. It is not a question of age there; but of Joshua's choice.
F.L. "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth" -- is that characteristic of those likely to be chosen?
J.T. That is the idea; they stand their ground. They are characteristically men that go forth. It is not one incident merely.
A.N.W. Will you explain how the military spirit blends with the "son of peace" feature that is desirable for us all?
J.T. The "son of peace" has to do with internal assembly conditions; but when there is an attack the order of the day is war. @Luke 10 is the instructive chapter as to a son of peace. It alludes to a person
{273}
who becomes, or whose house becomes, a nucleus for divine operations; a son of peace is there; and you stay there, you do not move away. It is, as it were, headquarters for divine operations, and it works out in assembly conditions as seen in @Luke 11.
F.L. So external war would be with such elements as Moab, Sihon, and Og.
J.T. That is the thought; and if one unfurls his standard in confessing Christ and then runs away, he is not a man that "goes forth to war". It is the man that goes forth to war that is numbered; not one that simply says, I was converted two years ago. That is of no value in this matter. The point is, what you are *now*. As a person that *goes forth* you are known. Then @Numbers 1 says, "that went forth". Historically you have had part in conflicts while others held back.
A.P. Are those that have taken up the responsibility of fellowship marked out as those who go forth?
J.T. That is right. It is a defensive position in the wilderness.
@Numbers 1 shows that there are persons who are known as those that go forth to war. It is in *Israel*; that is, you belong to that class of people and you go forth to war; and then, "that *went* forth to war". These persons who are so numbered in relation to the standards of their fathers houses are seen in certain positions in relation to the tabernacle. That is the next thing. Now the testimony of God is involved, and each takes up his position in regard to that. It is the fellowship, really.
A.R.S. Numbering the people means that God is taking account of me, so that makes me responsible to go forth to war. We have to see that we are fulfilling our responsibilities.
J.T. Yes. Heaven specially regards those who take part in the conflicts. They are the warriors of God.
{274}
C.A.M. Does not this encampment correspond with the stones on the breastplate, as to the setting of it?
J.T. Yes, the position of the tribes round the tabernacle corresponded with their positions in the breastplate.
A.P.T. @Acts 16 says that Paul would have Timothy go forth with him. I was wondering whether he represented one about twenty years old.
J.T. That is a good illustration of the type. What a conflict they had at Philippi following upon that! Paul made a good selection in Timothy!
J.S. Is the great object in the wars of the Lord that there might be more for the Lord? Wars among men are destructive all round, but in the wars of the Lord you are thinking of what accrues to God, are you not?
J.T. We shall reach that in Numbers. All that had been appropriated in the great falling away in Christendom during the centuries is recovered on the principle of the wars of the Lord, as seen in chapter 31. For the moment, we are getting the young believers to see that they are taken account of by the Lord when they go forth to war. They are not dragged into it; they are known to be persons that go forth in all weathers. They do not say, There is a lion in the way; or, It is a cold or stormy night, and I shall not go to the meeting. They are military men, under orders, and hence go forth.
C.A.M. The reference to Timothy is very good. After a certain point, he had a place to fill as of divine ordering.
J.T. He was a young man commended by the apostle, and later enjoined to take his "share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ".
R.W.S. Would a contrast be John Mark, who went not forward with them to the work?
{275}
J.T. Quite so; he did not go forth. He went back from the conflict.
G.A. Yet John Mark made a good start. Would you say there may be a time when we should heed the exhortation: "take to you the panoply of God ..."?
J.T. Yes. There is always danger with the most advanced of us of drawing back. Demas had been warring; but the apostle says, he "has forsaken me, having loved the present age". The young men in John's epistle are enjoined as to this: "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you". They were military men, but the apostle further says, "Love not the world, nor the things in the world". The world is the danger to which the young men are exposed; (@1 John 2:14,15).
Rem. Paul had in himself the scars of war.
J.T. Yes; he says, "*I* bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus", (@Galatians 6:17).
A.R. @Numbers 1:4 says, "with you there shall be a man for every tribe, a man who is the head of his father's house"; later he is said to be a prince. That would be like Paul's relation to Timothy; the young man is under the influence of a prince.
J.T. Quite so; the princes are men habitually summoned, already known to be reliable. The idea of reliability is of immense importance in all these matters.
W.B-w. @1 Samuel 19:8 says, "And there was war again; and David went forth and fought with the Philistines".
J.T. "David went forth" is a characteristic expression. It refers to his "warlike raids", see note to @1 Samuel 18:5 (N.T.).
J.J.J. Is there any suggestion that Moses commissioned these heads of the tribes?
J.T. Yes; that is the idea; they were known to
{276}
be reliable; Moses could put his hand on these men at any time. They were summoned as needed.
F.L. In the divine military system, are there not two elements -- the "voluntary" and the "compulsory"?
J.T. Quite so. The divine war levy is on the principle of conscription. But in the conscription there is interest and readiness to serve.
A.R.S. Did David not volunteer to meet Goliath?
J.T. He had said before to Eliab, "Was it not laid upon me?" evidently meaning that his father had sent him, with perhaps a deeper meaning involving his sense of responsibility to God. That was the principle! He was on the battlefield as a sent one.
G.MacP. Peter had a sword and energy, too, but he misused both; would he represent those unfit to be numbered?
J.T. Quite so. He was ready to fight, but was not under proper military direction. The Lord had said, "let him sell his garment and buy a sword", and they said to Him, "Lord, behold here are two swords". He says, "It is enough", (@Luke 22:36,38). They did not apprehend His meaning. It is of all importance in warfare to get the thought of the leader correctly; taking an order erroneously is most disastrous in military operations.
A.R.S. Peter was not subject to the command, was he?
J.T. He did not get the Lord's thought. He was just *literal*. But we have to learn that divine utterances are to be understood spiritually.
A.N.W. We do not cut off men's ears in this warfare!
J.T. We want to keep their ears on so they can *hear*. This is particularly the case in Luke, who had the priestly side of the service of the gospel especially in view.
J.E.H. Would these military men have the
{277}
effectual sword -- the word of God -- girded on themselves?
J.T. That is what is meant. "Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword". Typically this is the word of God.
F.L. There is much of importance in what has been said as to Peter's acting without orders, because in military service an individual soldier in the presence of his commander doing what he pleases is a disastrous thing; in Christendom, there is the idea generally of, I will do what I think will be of service, when at the same time there is a lack of being under the spiritual control of the commander-in-chief.
A.B.P. In connection with what has been said, would it be right to say that in each of these three conflicts -- particularly in the last two -- there seems to be an increased recognition of the Holy Spirit? The well is springing up now. In the first case, it would scarcely seem as if the Christian, in type, has the Spirit characteristically.
J.T. That is right. One would enlarge on what has been said about @Exodus 17, that the conflict brings out latent conditions -- firstly, the latent conditions as seen in Moses. There is no word of such conditions in the early part of the battle; it is then just what Moses *said*; then Joshua is mentioned for the first time and entrusted with the selection and command of the army; and then Aaron and Hur, who are not mentioned in the beginning of the matter, but appear later, as if to meet the exigency that had not been foreseen.
In @Deuteronomy 25 we are let into the secret of the other side; that is, a decline had taken place amongst the people. When they came out of Egypt; the Psalmist tells us "there was not one feeble among their tribes" (@Psalm 105:37); but @Deuteronomy 25:18 speaks of "all the feeble that lagged behind thee"; although it was only three
{278}
months since they came out of Egypt. That is what the conflict brought to light in @Exodus 17; the Spirit, however, is there, in answer to the sufferings of Christ. Jehovah says to Moses, Take thy staff with which thou smotest the river. Behold I will stand before thee upon the rock on Horeb: and thou shalt strike the rock. It is not said that the water actually flowed or that the people drank; but there is the statement that water should come out of the rock, "that the people *may* drink". Thus typically the Spirit was there. That is the position, but now here in @Numbers 21 we have the conflict with Sihon. This is after they sang to the well: "Spring up, O well". It is now an *upward* movement of the Spirit. The Spirit is known to be there, and is recognised by the people as being there, in the sense that they sang to it, and the movement alluded to is upward. We are now moving toward Canaan; hence the Amorite immediately comes into view. So that we have the Holy Spirit now typically, not only in an abstract way but in a concrete way, as *known and enjoyed*. Rephidim means, "plain", as we have seen, but when they came to Beer, they were going up, and they reached the top of Pisgah; it was an upward movement. It suggests that we are going out of the world now, as no longer of it, but as having a heavenly portion. As soon as we move in that direction we meet the Amorite, Sihon and Og; indeed the Canaanites are seen in @Numbers 21 from the outset.
F.L. The conflict increases as they near the land, but the power is equal to it.
J.T. The springing well, as we saw, alludes to the believer as in @Romans 8. At the end of @Romans 7 he takes up a definite position individually: "I myself with the mind serve God's law". In @Romans 8 it is God coming in with almighty power to support the believer in that position. The land is now in
{279}
prospect. Hence in @Numbers 21 the well springs up and the Amorite is at once in view.
F.L. So the singing is connected with exultation in the saints; they are triumphant in the sense of power. Is that the thought of singing to it?
J.T. Yes; it is a beautiful song. The whole chapter is buoyant; the book of the wars of the Lord is mentioned and what the poets say; but as to Beer, it is what *Israel's* poets say. That is the thing; Israel sang this song, "Rise up, well! sing unto it!"
A.F.M. It is noticeable, in the reference to these enemies, that Israel does not take the initiative in attacking them, but when the enemy comes against them they meet the attack and overcome them.
J.T. The thing to observe is, they *took territory*. There is nothing like this earlier. It says of Sihon that "Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon".
F.L. Pisgah would suggest, so to speak, a backward look at territory that had been traversed in soul history, while pressing onward to the inheritance.
J.T. I think so; what is said of Pisgah here implies that you get a retrospective view; you are thus reminded of what God *has been* to you. It "looks over the surface of the waste". It is all over now, but there is no regret as to the experience gone through. We remember what God was to us in that waste, and now we are going on into Canaan. I think as soon as you acquire territory spiritually, you are in principle in another world. The indwelling Spirit is the *earnest* of the inheritance.
J.H.E. Paul says, "I pursue".
J.T. "I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus", (@Philippians 3:14). That is now my outlook.
W.G.T. Would you bring in Paul and Barnabas
{280}
going to Jerusalem in view of the conflict they faced in regard to Judaism?
J.T. Quite so; it all works out in Paul's ministry, particularly what we are speaking of now. It is the believer taking up the inheritance.
A.C. On previous occasions we have had the murmuring of the people, but in this section the word of Jehovah is, "Assemble the people, and I will give them water"; then the springing up of the well comes in.
J.T. The springing *up* is in @John 4; @Romans 8 scarcely gives us that, but suggests looking towards the wilderness, which is the Deuteronomy side of it. It is the righteous requirement of the law fulfilled in us; compare @Deuteronomy 10:12,13. @John 4 is the water that Christ gives springing up into everlasting life. @Romans 8, however, speaks of those led of the Spirit being sons of God, and this corresponds somewhat with @John 4.
A.F.M. How do you regard this territory acquired. It is not Canaan, but is near it. Is it requisite for us to occupy so long as we are here?
J.T. Certainly; it is the territory acquired, answering to @Romans 8.
A.N.W. Is not the serpent of brass an important point in this chapter?
J.T. It is. It is typically the condemnation of sin in the flesh. The man in @Romans 7 says "I myself with the mind serve God's law". He has found his feet; he is standing up like a board in the tabernacle. God says, as it were, I am with you in that; hence the next chapter is God coming in in *power*, the Holy Spirit supporting me in that position, which leads on to Canaan as stated; it says, "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God". The sons of God are going to glory. Notice in the beginning of this chapter that "the Canaanite king of Arad, who dwelt in the
{281}
south, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim, and he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners". Arad had an advantageous position as against the people, and "Israel vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If thou give this people wholly into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. And Jehovah listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them, and their cities", (verses 1 - 3). That is the result. One of the finest things that can come into our beings is the principle of *resolution*; they made this resolution, asking God to help them, and there was complete victory. But, alas they "spoke against God, and against Moses". They had not yet discovered what the flesh is. God met this in the serpent of brass, answering to @Romans 8, which says, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh". That is what God has done.
A.R.S. Amalek stands for the flesh. What does Sihon, king of the Amorites, stand for?
J.T. It is something you discover after you recognise that God has condemned sin in the flesh; not simply that the flesh is bad, that no good dwells in it, but that God has disposed of it and you need not take any account of it; it is to have no voice to us at all. The next enemy to overcome is this man Sihon. The point is, he is an Amorite; and is related to the inhabitants of the land. He is not actually in the land, but belongs to the seven nations of Canaan, and is typical of the natural man in divine territory -- that is, in the setting seen in this chapter. He may appear in one who is a believer, but who thinks much of himself, who is big in his own eyes.
F.L. This territory once acquired is permanent, it
{282}
is not surrendered, but links on to the environment of the Jordan.
J.T. That is right; it is never given up, but is essential to our heavenly position, although not Canaan.
A.F.M. The two and one-half tribes settled down there.
J.T. They did, but this territory should be held from Canaan. When Ammon attacked this territory later it was pointed out by Jephthah that it was divinely given to Israel, and must not be given up.
N.MacC. Is the Amorite as an enemy more dangerous than the flesh?
J.T. Yes; he is another kind of opponent; he belongs to the seven nations of Canaan.
N.MacC. This warfare is typically not against flesh and blood?
J.T. It is not yet heavenly warfare, but leading to it. The conflict in this chapter (@Numbers 21) is largely with Satan as occupying the believer with himself, his own bigness. This is especially seen in Og. It says, "And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, for battle to Edrei. And Jehovah said to Moses, Fear him not! for into thy hand I have given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon. And they smote him, and his sons and all his people, so that they left him none remaining, and *took possession* of his land". There is thus further acquired territory in Bashan.
A.E.S. Would you say that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were good soldiers, prepared to lose even their own lives to maintain the territory?
J.T. That is very beautiful -- their steady fidelity to the truth and how the Lord identifies Himself with them in the heat of the furnace. Nebuchadnezzar
{283}
says, "I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire ... and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God", (@Daniel 3:25). That is the companionship and support we come into in suffering for the truth. You might say they were really sons of God; they were in *liberty* in the conflict, and were there supported by the Spirit of God.
W.G.T. Does it appear that these two kings, Sihon and Og, occupied strategic positions obviously needed to go into the land -- not the land itself, but the positions that are needful?
J.T. Yes. Deuteronomy helps us and gives us information which Numbers does not cite; it also gives us the wilderness as Christ entered it. The Lord takes Deuteronomy ground as soon as He is anointed by the Spirit. Deuteronomy also tells us the size of Og's bed; you get in that an indication of what is meant. It means one's big self as in the believer, which has to be overthrown -- one's idea of one's importance, which is apt to come up at this juncture in spiritual history, and is a hard enemy to overthrow.
J.S. Why do you think he comes up at this point?
J.T. At the end of @Romans 7, you are standing on your own feet and acknowledging God's rights in your soul; then you gain a few victories in preaching, teaching, and the like, and may acquire a place in the minds of the brethren; so that you are apt to become a greater man in your own mind than you have hitherto been. This presents a most difficult man to overcome.
F.L. Like Sihon and Og, would you say?
J.T. Yes; Sihon is an Amorite. That is what is stressed in him. I think he alludes to a man assuming heavenly clothing, although not according to it inwardly. He is big in his own eyes, but it is Satan working and hindering in that way. If I do not
{284}
overcome these two men, I will not make any headway.
A.P. We were distinguishing between the flesh and what is natural. Is not the test as to what is natural seen more in this area than at the beginning? Here it was a question of children, cattle, and ease that surrounded them legitimately and became a test to them. The two and one-half tribes were overcome by this later.
J.T. There is a point reached in the progress we normally make; we may acquire a place in our own minds because of what we are spiritually. We may have made great headway, and be known as militant men, as having gained victories. I may be successful in preaching and in other distinguishing services, but I may be clothing myself with all this. I believe that is the application of this to ourselves. As to himself, Paul says, "no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me", (@Galatians 2:20). It is a complete displacement of myself for Christ. It is not simply the throne of Jah as in @Exodus 17, that is, God's rights in me, but I come to see that *I* am gone as to what I have been as a man in this world; that is to say, I am not living in my fancied greatness; that is all over. The instruction as to Sihon and Og refers, I believe, to the way I may be regarding myself at this stage of my spiritual course.
A.G.D. David stayed at home from the battle at Rabbah. Would that be the Og feature?
J.T. Yes. Og's bed being mentioned would point to selfish indolence, and this marked David at the time referred to. It was "when kings go forth"; he did not go, and therefore failed.
J.W.C.B. We are to be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may
{285}
dwell, through faith, in your hearts", (@Ephesians 3:16,17). The big man goes and Christ takes his place.
J.T. Og is displaced in that way. The book of Deuteronomy furnishes deeper spiritual instruction as to what we may see in Exodus and Numbers. As on Deuteronomy ground I see things differently from what I saw them earlier. In Deuteronomy I see what kind of man Jesus was in the wilderness, and how He met the devil. I abandon myself for Him. I learn thus how to fight when attacked by the devil.
W.G.T. In Deuteronomy, the matter of Og and Sihon comes in early as compared with Numbers. Do you think that it is a matter of experience with us?
J.T. I think so; the Spirit as you give Him place would take you on to Deuteronomy ground; that is, if you recognise Him as seen in the springing well. You are thus prepared for heavenly ground.
F.L. There is nothing more subtle than what you have referred to in speaking of Og. I suppose one of the hardest things to discover in ourselves, and probably some of our brethren discover it before we do, is the elements that have their application in Sihon and Og.
J.T. I think it is a most searching thing: one may clothe oneself with Christianity as seen typically up to @Numbers 21, *adding* it to what one is as a man of this world. One is thus bigger than ever in one's own estimation.
A.R. If I do not judge these features of Og in myself they will hinder me in taking divine territory. I may also stand in the way of the saints in my locality.
J.T. It takes a good while to see that one has to be displaced altogether as to what he may be according to his own reckoning. Thus Og comes in at the end of the wilderness journey. Adding my Christianity to what I am in this world will prevent my entrance
{286}
into Canaan. It was "a man in Christ" that was taken into the third heaven. In Philippians Paul pours contempt on what he was as a man in this world.
A.F.M. That was the outcome in Paul of the truth of Ephesians, the appreciation he had of the heavenly calling.
J.T. It is peculiarly hard to get clear of Og. It is more difficult than sin in the flesh. It is not simply the flesh in me, but *myself*. I learn to deal with myself, which is the most difficult of all. "Of myself", says Paul, "I will not boast, unless in my weaknesses". (@2 Corinthians 12:5).
C.A.M. It seems to come home to us in a solemn way, because it is not only a hindrance to oneself, but it hinders the saints because Christ will be hindered in coming in through us until Og is gone.
R.D.G. Is there anything in the fact that Og's *sons* are mentioned?
J.T. I think that in these circumstances a man's family adds to him; he is apt to think much of his sons. Haman had ten sons, and their names are mentioned; (@Esther 9). Sons add to their father. A man who thinks of himself and his importance will not leave any asset out.
W.G.T. Haman's sons were all hanged with him.
C.A.M. Jair (@Judges 10), had thirty sons who rode on thirty ass colts; he was not much distinguished otherwise.
J.T. Ibzan and Abdon (@Judges 12), were also distinguished in this way. In @Numbers 21, we are where children and cattle are specially considered, as we see in the two and one-half tribes later. What I possess in this way is employed to add to me in this territory. We are all susceptible to this; not one of us is exempt. We know well enough how it works; it may cause one to say, I am a godly man and have some gift; God has used me in the Lord's
{287}
service and has prospered me in my business, and I have creditable children. These things are very subtle in their influence, and they *occasion the conflict* we are now considering. It is striking that this is the territory where these things acquired too much place. They kept the two and one-half tribes out of Canaan.
J.H.E. They are never thoroughly judged unless we cross Jordan.
J.T. Quite so; there is nothing said about children or cattle as Israel were going over Jordan, not that they did not go over, but the point is what I am *spiritually*; for children and cattle do not add to me there; nor do I wish them to. But the territory we are now considering enables me to shine in them.
J.S. How are we going to rightly hold on to this territory?
J.T. It has to be held *from Canaan*. It is territory that we need. Romans and Corinthians are essential in holding Ephesian ground. I must keep this territory clear, and that is the point Jephthah makes. It had been Israel's for three hundred years, and it must be held. But it does not afford our living associations; they are over Jordan.
J.S. Rightly held, this territory adds a certain kind of spirituality to us. We thus go into the land as spiritually wealthy.
J.T. Quite so; you acquire wealth there.
J.H.E. The Colossians were exhorted, "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above", (@Colossians 3:1).
J.T. That is beyond the Jordan; hence we seek the things that are above -- not our cattle or name, or hereditary importance. If we seek the things that are above, we leave these behind.
A.P.T. Peter and John said, "Look on us"; later Peter said, "Silver and gold I have not", (@Acts 3). I was wondering if he had arrived at this point. He was shorn of everything that would add
{288}
distinction to him in this world. He was a heavenly man, and could say, "what I have, this give I to thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk", (@Acts 3:6). Would that be on the line you are suggesting?
J.T. That is right -- "In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean" -- the despised Man. It is a heavenly testimony in Peter there in principle.
{289}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (4)
@Numbers 31:1 - 12, 21 - 24, 48 - 54
J.T. At our last reading in this book, we came to the end of chapter 21, in which the title of our readings appears, namely, "The Wars of the Lord". We considered the overthrow of Sihon and Og, that is typically @Romans 8, which contemplates the believer as in Christ and as having a new state in the Spirit, so that the big "I" is overthrown. Whilst one may be delivered from sin in the flesh, he may still be clothing himself with his gift, his means, or his ancestry, etc.; thus increasing his distinction in his own mind. The overthrow of these things is seen in Og, and it was noted last time that his sons also were smitten; (chapter 21:35). Therefore the way is now clear for the believer, as thus freed of *himself* to say, "I am crucified with Christ", (@Galatians 2:20). The "I" now is gone from one's vision. No one can withstand Israel in an open battle now.
In chapter 22 a new and *hidden* attack is introduced in the form of *accusation*. For this purpose Balaam is employed by the king of Moab to *curse* Israel. Balaam was a man with a religious reputation, being regarded as a prophet; but amenable to *hire*, and ready to curse the people of God if he could. This is a new mode of attack -- a hidden conflict in which the people have no part, for God takes the matter up, and lets us into the blessed secret that He is *for us*. "If God be for us, who against us?" (@Romans 8:31). Then when the effort to curse fails, Balaam's counsel is used of Satan to *corrupt* the people of God, and that leads to this war with Midian in chapter 31, which is now before us. Many of the saints may not be conversant with this feature of warfare, this hidden effort of the devil in using persons who do
{290}
not come out openly, but who are, nevertheless, opposers and would like to see things amongst us weakened and corrupted.
A.N.W. Balaam would seem to be dismissed at the end of chapter 24, and yet according to this chapter he is involved in the matter of Peor.
J.T. That is right. We are told in @Revelation 2 that he *taught* Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel. It was a matter of teaching, and what is stated in our chapter shows that his counsel caused Israel to sin; hence Balaam was slain in the battle against Midian, with the five kings of Midian.
A.F.M. How is it that in enumerating the kings of Midian, Balak is not mentioned? He had set Balaam on to curse the people of God.
J.T. He was the king of *Moab*, of course. The Midianites are more in mind in this war. They were, as descended from Abraham, more nearly related to Israel than Moab, and social equality, as entering into the corruption, is in mind. God, in chapter 25, directs that Israel should harass Midian, and now they avenge themselves on him. So that we are to understand what Midian means. Moab represents the pride of man, but Midian is a power that is allied with Moab, but more religious and showy. In fact, it is the social element in Christendom as allied with the religious.
C.A.M. The fact that this war came at the end of Moses career would show that this is one of the last enemies dealt with.
J.T. It is the last *wilderness* enemy.
A.P. Would you say something more about Balaam? In @Revelation 2 it speaks of his doctrine, and those who held it at Pergamos.
J.T. Well, he taught Balak to cast a snare before Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication; it was idolatry and social relations with
{291}
ungodly people. It was a *doctrine*. Where you have teaching you have what satisfies your conscience, although the conduct flowing from it is wicked. Your conscience is quite satisfied because of the teaching. If I accept it as right, my conscience is at ease, although I am guilty of the grossest evil.
A.N.W. Is there a reason why Balaam's counsel should be stated in verse 16 of our chapter, and not in chapter 25?
J.T. I think it is to show that no one guilty of wickedness escapes. Balaam was well hidden in his profession of godliness. The ordinary eye could scarcely discern that there was any hostility to Israel. He would not do anything without Jehovah, and yet if you closely read chapter 22 you will see that he really did wish to curse them in order to get the reward of unrighteousness, and he was ready to go to Balak as soon as he was released. Balaam said at first, "Jehovah refuses to give me leave to go with you", but then he wanted to go, and as soon as released he went with the princes of Moab without having the least conscience that God had told him at the outset that His people Israel were blessed. An undiscerning eye would not suspect anything in Balaam but a fair man. He only wanted to do what Jehovah wished him to do; but God had told him that the people were not to be cursed, for they were blessed, and yet he goes to Balak, who sent for him expressly to curse them. The second message is sent to him, which brings the matter up again, and there is more honour given, and increased reward offered. Yet Balaam says, "I shall know what Jehovah will say", but it does not say he went to Jehovah. God came to him in each case, for He knew what was in his heart, and that explains why He stood in the way to resist him, for God was angry with him, because of his going. In chapter 22 the enemy is hidden, he assumes that he will not be detected, but the facts
{292}
show that he is detected, that Jehovah knows well what he is at heart. He therefore stood in his way to prevent his going, but he is determined to go. Yet his ass was more discerning than he: "the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the folly of the prophet", (@2 Peter 2:16).
A.F.M. There are three steps in that journey: The ass, seeing the angel, turned aside out of the way into the field; then Balaam's foot is crushed against the wall in a hollow of the vineyard; then the ass lay down under him. Was that a restrictive means that God used to withstand him?
J.T. It makes plain how undiscerning he was, how little sensitiveness he had. The ass was wiser than he. That is what chapter 22 brings out; that after all, he is not really disguised. With this peculiar kind of opposition, Balaam was outwardly in favour but secretly desirous of changing the position. In chapter 31 he is thoroughly exposed; not only himself, but his teaching; so he falls by the sword.
W.B-w. He would not only curse them, but would corrupt them: "Lo, these, through the counsel of Balaam, caused the children of Israel to commit sin against Jehovah in the matter of Peor". He had in mind to corrupt them, had he not?
J.T. That is what the Lord Jesus says to Pergamos. The doctrine of Balaam implied this corrupting teaching that the people could do the thing and have a good conscience in doing it, showing that Christians may form associations with ungodly people on social grounds and do the worst kind of things with a good conscience.
J.S. Would he be a type of clericalism as it is seen today as thoroughly entrenched in the religious world, but assuming to be in the service of God?
J.T. I think so. Balaam had a great reputation. Balak brought him from "the mountains of the east", showing what a far-reaching reputation he
{293}
had. He is a type of some great religious power with a corresponding reputation. It is not difficult to determine what this is today; there is great pretence in it to be representative of God, with great antiquity behind it, with ramifications without any parallel, so that the princes of this world seek its counsel. The leaders of this system will not come out and say that they are against Christianity, but they are *corrupting* it. That is the point to see.
A.P. Balaam views the people of God, and prophesies from *four* positions.
J.T. Balak and Balaam began with great outward show of perfection -- seven altars, seven bullocks, and seven rams, but then God was intervening. That is what we need to see; this system has come down to our day, but God has taken charge of the whole matter. We should have no Christianity today were it not that God intervened, as we see in the addresses to the assemblies. The Lord says, "I know". He speaks of "Antipas, my faithful witness", (@Revelation 2:13) being slain, as at the time of Balaam's teaching. God takes charge in every case. He does not allow Balaam to do anything except what He permitted him to do; He would not allow him to say a word before Balak except what He put in his mouth. This is very encouraging for us to see, that if God had not taken the matter in hand at the time of Balaam's teaching, which had become prevalent in Christendom, there would be no Christianity; it would be utterly corrupt. God has the matter in hand today; His eye and mind are everywhere.
C.A.M. The word "avenge" is characteristic in @Numbers 31. Do you think it would imply that the damage done has been taken account of by God in this way?
J.T. Yes. That will come in its time upon Christendom. God is waiting His time, so that several chapters intervene from the manifestation of
{294}
the corruption until Balaam is exposed and slain; the *war* singles him out.
W.B-w. It says, "Harass the Midianites", (chapter 25:16). What does that mean?
J.T. It was to weaken them, for the moment, as we have today God weakening the apostasy until the time comes when the avenging takes place. The way in which God takes the matter in hand is affecting; in each of Balaam's prophecies, there is increase, something fresh. First, Israel was to dwell alone. God compels him to say that. Israel is not to be reckoned among the nations. The Vatican has made great efforts to be recognised among the nations, showing great zest for political power; but Israel was to dwell alone, not to be reckoned among the nations yet, "Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel?" (chapter 23:10). There will be a large number, notwithstanding the separation.
C.A.M. The more extreme things become, the more wonderful is the result which God brings out. The further Balaam went, the results were more spiritual and glorious.
J.T. Quite so. He is compelled to say these great things concerning God's people. The second blessing speaks of the power that is in Israel -- the power of God in the very people that the enemy would curse. Then the order and beauty of Israel is seen in their goodly tents, like valleys spread forth, like gardens by the riverside, like aloe trees which Jehovah hath planted, like cedars beside the waters. Finally, the prophet sees a Star coming out of Jacob and a Sceptre arising out of Israel. So we are carried along to the millennial day. It is really the assembly that is in mind in all this, but linked up with the great end at the close of the chapter where Amalek "the first of the nations" is appointed to destruction.
{295}
That is the light we have in the presence of all this hidden opposition to the Israel of God.
A.F.M. It would appear that Balaam reversed his first parable in respect to Israel. God said they "shall dwell alone". Balaam said to Balak, Invite them to your sacrifices -- mix them.
J.T. The corrupting teaching is to mix, to set aside this great principle of separation on the part of the people for God. Balaam's teaching was to make room for alliance with the world, which is the very opposite to the fellowship into which we are brought.
J.S. The present teaching of religious amalgamation is on that line.
J.T. Yes; they do not like you to dwell alone. That is what is hated. Sanballat and Geshem said to Nehemiah, "Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono" (@Nehemiah 6:2), but Nehemiah says, "they thought to do me mischief". Modern apostates are likened to him; Jude likens them to Cain, Balaam, and Core. Those are the great sinners that are brought forward as types of apostasy in Christendom.
W.B-w. Tell us what part Phinehas has in the war of our chapter.
J.T. Well, he is the spiritual leader in this war, and is the first to have part in it. Hitherto it was a matter between God and the devil. In chapters 22 - 24 God is fighting for us, resulting in a complete victory. But now when the teaching of Balaam comes into evidence, the saints are brought into it, having in Phinehas a priestly leader. It is quite obvious that when teaching is promulgated God meets it mediately. He will take up someone to meet it. In our own time, J.N.D. and others took the sword and attacked the evil openly, and gave a lead, too. Phinehas led in this war which began in chapter 22, but now openly in chapter 25; it is one of the most important wars to be considered.
{296}
A.N.W. Have you not previously placed Rome with Jezebel in Thyatira rather than with Balaam in Pergamos?
J.T. Well, Pergamos is a stepping stone to Thyatira. "I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan is", (@Revelation 2:13). Satan's throne, the very centre of satanic operations, and "Antipas, my faithful witness ... who was slain among you, where Satan dwells". "Among you" meaning that the assembly, the public body, was there; popery had begun.
C.A.M. If I understand you, you said this war started between God and Satan, and the people are brought into it as the result of teaching.
J.T. That is right. As soon as you have the teaching you have something tangible. Before that the opposition was hidden, but known to God and frustrated by Him. But the effect of the teaching soon became manifest, and it was met through Phinehas, who took the javelin at once, used it, and the plague which had begun was stayed from Israel. As you get the teaching you can deal with it.
C.A.M. It gives great importance to the character of the moment if one can detect the evil, and meet it in this way.
W.B-w. Chapters 22 - 24 would be like "the mystery of iniquity"; what is secretly going on.
J.T. Quite so; it is already working; (@2 Thessalonians 2:7).
A.B.P. It would seem that Phinehas apprehended the root evil in chapter 25:15. "And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was tribal head of a father's house in Midian". Zur is numbered among the five slain kings of Midian in chapter 31.
J.T. That gives a clue. It was a social matter. I believe the Anglican system is the best illustration of it, because it is patterned on the world's system
{297}
from the most humble curate up to the archbishop. It is a great parallel with the world's social relations right up, and that is, I think, what is in mind in Midian, with its number of kings, great amount of jewellery, and outward show.
C.A.M. The Anglican system in that way makes much more of the social status than the other religious systems.
J.T. Yes, much more. Rome goes further in claiming sovereignty for its head, but the correspondence between the political system and social scale in England and the religious scale is remarkable. Even the seat of the archbishop is a *throne*.
F.H.L. In the days of Gideon the Midianites destroyed the produce for seven years. Does that not show us what these enemies can do?
J.T. Quite so. That was a later event. This great war aimed at Midian's overthrow. It was a peculiar war, the last in the wilderness, and the word "war" appears fourteen times in the chapter, showing that the idea is greatly stressed.
A.P. Would you say that many Christians stop when they come to this point of spiritual history?
J.T. I think they do. Unless Midian is overthrown the saints will never go into Canaan. When once it is overthrown we are ready to enter Canaan. For most Christians the social world is a most difficult obstacle to overcome.
A.F.M. Would you say the exercise the saints passed through in the early part of the last century involved the overthrow of Midian?
J.T. I think so. It is a great war, the end of which is the overthrow of the religious systems in the hearts of the saints and the recovery of the things of the assembly. The spoil mentioned here is enormous.
A.F.M. What would that be?
J.T. I think it is first the terms relating to the
{298}
assembly and the service of God; they have been used in the profession, but properly they belong only to those who have the Spirit. The full significance of this involves that their true value is restored through warfare. The metals are first mentioned: Gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, in verses 21, 22. "Everything that passeth through the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean", (verse 23).
A.F.M. Would these metals refer to the terms that you spoke of, but needing to go through the fire because unclean?
J.T. Yes, the names of holy things are found in the creeds and ecclesiastical formulas, in some cases quite related to evil things. Well, this war was to detach all these things, purify them, and put them into their proper settings; in result they came into "the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the children of Israel".
J.S. One would hold all these things in relation to the death of Christ.
J.T. Exactly.
A.F.M. Why was there the purifying by fire and then this passing through the *water* of separation?
J.T. The water is definitely the death of Christ. "Everything that passeth through the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean; only it shall be purified with the water of separation". Notice it is "the water of separation", not the fire of separation. The fire is a drastic thought, but the water of separation has a special spiritual status, see chapter 19; and then it goes on to say, "and everything that cannot pass through the fire ye shall make go through the water. And ye shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean". The water of separation has a spiritual setting. It is what came out of the side of Christ.
J.S. Would this teaching run parallel with the
{299}
teaching in John's gospel where you have the religious man and the opposition, and then much made of the water?
J.T. Quite so, a great deal is made of the water. It is to detach the saints and the things of God from the world. All these metals represent what is of God, but all have been in wrong hands; they are now brought back and caused to go through the symbol of the death of Christ, so that they might be in their proper setting in the house of God.
W.B-w. At Jericho the gold and silver were preserved also. It works out on the same principle there.
J.T. Just so, what is of God. I believe the gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead have each a spiritual meaning, and have to be detached from what is evil, and set up in their own places by the Spirit of God.
J.S. It seems there is a double cleansing, so to speak. That is, the things of God have to be detached from the captivity and again set in relation to true Christianity.
J.T. I think the last verse of our chapter is a clue to the present position. "Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial". The house of God is thus replenished; these things belong to Christianity proper. They never should have been elsewhere. It was unfaithfulness on the part of those responsible that allowed them to get into other hands.
W.B-w. There was a statute about it, too. "And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war that had gone to the battle, This is the statute of the law of which Jehovah hath commanded Moses". It is important to have a statute.
J.T. It is, indeed. It is a fixed matter, but this process has to be gone through. I believe that is what has been going on all these years and in all
{300}
our meetings; the detaching of these holy things of God from human settings and placing them where the Holy Spirit is.
J.E.H. Those marvellous holy utterances from the lips of Balaam were in the wrong setting as on *his* lips; the Lord has seen to it that they are treasured by the saints today.
J.T. Some of the most precious things in the treasury of God are these utterances of Balaam. They are strikingly illustrative of what we are saying. They are put now in their right setting; the Holy Spirit has given them a place in the record of Scripture. They are thus in the treasury of God.
J.H.E. When the children of Israel were leaving Egypt, they asked the Egyptians for utensils of silver and gold; these, not having been cleansed, were put to a wrong use in making the calf; but later on these metals, including copper, were given and dedicated to the tabernacle.
J.T. That is a similar thing. They put them to the wrong use, but ultimately they came into the tabernacle. They asked from the Egyptians. There are things among men that belong to God, and He has a right to them. It is a question of God's rights.
A.R. Is there anything in the fact that "The men of war had taken spoil each one for himself"? Evidently each man that goes into the conflict acquires something himself.
J.T. Yes, and the spirit of sacrifice is seen in giving them up. I think the parenthesis, verse 53, is to show the captains were unselfish like Noah in @Genesis 8:20; they gave up what they took in spoil.
F.H.L. The spoil is handed to Moses and to Eleazar the priest.
J.T. It was now in right hands; and was set in the tent of meeting as a memorial before Jehovah. Eleazar is the official priest, typical of Christ as over the house of God. We have also Phinehas
{301}
here. It says in verse 6: "Moses sent ... Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, and the holy instruments, even the alarm trumpets in his hand". Moses is the authority, of course, but Phinehas is the characterising man, making it a *priestly* war.
C.A.M. Is the fact that it is a priestly war the reason why there were no casualties?
J.T. I think so. I believe where we are governed by priestly instincts and intelligence, there are no casualties. The brethren are preserved.
J.S. Much spoil but no casualties.
J.T. Quite so; enormous spoil.
N.McC. I would like to ask as to verse 7. It says, "they slew all the males". Would there be encouragement for us, that in the Lord we can attack that which is *strong*?
J.T. If we do not overcome them the human systems will go on. The males here represent the intelligence and the strength of the opposition. God said to Moses, "Go unto Pharaoh ... take thy stand ... in front of him", (@Exodus 7:15). That is a corresponding thought. If you look at the literature of those who fought for the truth in the last hundred years, you will be impressed with this very thing; they attacked and overthrew the enemy in his stronghold.
J.T.Jr. Would you say that all the tribes being brought into the war through Phinehas would show that it is universal in character?
J.T. Quite so. I believe that was one great feature of the beginning of the revival; it was not a local or sectional movement, it referred to the whole assembly. All the saints of God are challenged by it. Jehovah said to Moses: "Avenge the children of Israel upon the Midianites; afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto thy peoples. And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm from amongst you men for
{302}
military service, that they go against Midian to execute Jehovah's vengeance upon Midian. Of every tribe a thousand, of all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. And there were levied out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand by tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. And Moses sent them to the war". You will notice that the appeal is to *arm* men -- not simply choose them as at Rephidim. The point is, they are to be armed, and they are to be from every tribe. It is not Moses choosing the army; he appeals to the people to do that -- to arm a thousand of each tribe; then next is Phinehas, but he is not said to be the general, as Joshua was at Rephidim; they are going *with* him. In all these conflicts there must be the priest, and he having full place; and then "they warred against Midian, as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and slew all the males. And they slew the kings of Midian, besides the others slain, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; and Balaam". They aimed at the leaders. It is the leaders and the males -- the intelligent powerful side. That is what God has done for us. The whole ecclesiastical system is exposed, and if it is exposed, it is overcome morally.
J.S. The material that Satan was using is overthrown.
J.T. Yes; the women that corrupted are also slain, but those that did not corrupt, that is, what is pure, is preserved; it is brought through and used, that is the principle.
A.P. Is it not interesting to see where it is "*brought to*"? "They brought to Moses and Eleazar, the priest, and to the assembly of the children of Israel".
J.T. That is another point: "And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took for a spoil all their cattle
{303}
and all their flocks and all their goods; and all their cities in their settlements and all their goodly dwelling-places they burned with fire. And they took all the booty, and all the prey, of man and of cattle; and they brought to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the children of Israel, the captives and the prey and the booty, to the camp in the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan of Jericho". That is the position. All is brought through to Moses and Eleazar in the camp, the last encampment in the wilderness. This is the finishing thing if we are to go over. That is what God has been doing all these years, to overthrow *in our hearts* all this great showy system in the world, in order to lead us into the light of Ephesians, having in view the coming of the Lord.
C.A.M. Would you say it throws wonderful light on the last hundred years? As I understand it, previous wars in the history of the assembly might have other characters, but this last one is a priestly war.
J.T. That is what is going on today. How great a thing to have part, in a priestly way, in what God is doing!
A.N.W. When you cite Anglicanism, you do so as a sample of what is also going on in this country, do you not?
J.T. The correspondence in England between the religious and the political is very remarkable, as we have said. And then it may be followed into the Dominions and also to this country.
A.F.M. Phinehas would strike at the root of these corrupt associations with the javelin. In @Numbers 10, in relation to the holy instruments, it says, "And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from
{304}
your enemies". It was entirely a spiritual war with spiritual results.
J.T. Quite so; sounding out the testimony on these holy instruments is most effective.
A.R. Is that asserting the rights of God on earth?
J.T. Yes; in what is ministered. Our salvation really lies in that sense in hearkening to the testimony that is sounded out. The ministry is the saving element.
A.B.P. Would you say that in John's gospel the "systems" are seen in a five-headed way? The woman of Samaria had five husbands, and in @John 5 there are five porches. Would it correspond to Midian with its five kings?
J.T. Yes, their ineffectiveness in meeting human need is exposed.
A.R. Is there any significance in the fact that the assembly gets such a large portion of live stock, especially sheep? There were six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep. The total is enormous. They are counted and divided between those who conducted the war and the assembly, Jehovah obtaining a certain portion; also the Levites. What is *living* including "human persons" is counted; also the *gold*.
A.P.T. With what epistles in the New Testament does this type correspond?
J.T. The epistles to the Romans and Corinthians.
A.N.W. Would the antitype of the end of Numbers be seen in @Romans 8:39, nothing "shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord"?
J.T. Yes. God for us is seen in that Balak's effort to curse Israel is frustrated and turned into blessing. Then the apostle goes on to show that nothing "shall be able to separate us from the love of God". In the apostle's instructions to the Corinthians
{305}
concerning evil associations as in chapter 10, the teaching of Balaam is in view. Fellowship is the great thing to protect us from such associations. As Paul proceeds, he opens up the truth of fellowship and so makes way for the Lord's supper. Then the assembly as an organism is spoken of and the gifts in view of public ministry. All that is included in the war we are contemplating; because clericalism being set aside, room is made for all the saints and the gifts to function.
A.N.W. Say one word again as to the slaying of Balaam "with the sword". The kings were slain, but Balaam was slain with the sword.
J.T. I think it is to show that the *word of God* was used. You have to bring that in to deal with evil doctrine -- "the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword", (@Hebrews 4:12).
J.S. Is that the word of God as in public ministry?
J.T. I think it comes out in @1 Corinthians 14:25. It is the prophetic ministry, which causes a man to fall down and own that "God is indeed amongst you". It sets aside all mere assumption of power on official ground, since it is the word of God.
C.A.M. I was struck with that because when God avenges, He does it very thoroughly. The weapons He uses and the results obtained are perfectly in accord with His government.
W.B-w. When the war is over and the officers are returning, Moses was wroth with them because they saved certain corrupting elements. The enemy would get in again through them.
J.T. Quite so. I suppose that might point to Bethesda principles.
W.B-w. In victory we have to be alert to see that there are no corrupting elements remaining among the brethren.
A.N.W. Verse 21 would show how this is presented.
{306}
Eleazar moves by himself: "And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war that had gone to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses ... everything that passeth through the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire ... and everything that cannot pass through the fire ye shall make go through the water". It is Eleazar, the priest, by himself acknowledging Jehovah's commandments to Moses.
J.T. That is very good. It is the priestly side. In conflict you feel the need of that at every turn.
R.D.G. In connection with the spoil being for God in this war, I was wondering whether if later, in connection with the war with Midian, this thing does not come out, that Gideon fails in that he takes the booty, makes an ephod of it, and puts it in his city instead of holding it for God.
J.T. Yes, you see great failure there, which is very humbling, and it is well to bring it in now because it is the opposite of what we have in this chapter -- the spoil enriching the tabernacle.
A.P. Referring to the priestly side here, I notice in the days of Ezra that in going up to Jerusalem the silver, gold, and the vessels were put in the hands of the twelve chief priests; (@Ezra 8:24 - 30).
J.T. Quite so. They were counted and weighed. That is all very interesting; the priestly side especially, for you have to consider that the conflict is largely with the great hierarchical system; an embellished system, to say nothing about priestcraft. The true priesthood is needed to overthrow all that. That is what the Holy Spirit undertook to do in the great recovery, and to rescue all the beautiful adornments that belong to the assembly only, for those that have the Holy Spirit. The spoil is very largely that, these metals and the other things that went through the water, can now be used aright. All *living* creatures of the spoil are not said to be cleansed;
{307}
abstractly those born of God are pure. Think of that vast number of sheep! God has the saints in His mind in the living creatures, I believe. He knows them all. Although the cattle of the spoil are not said to have been cleansed, those of Israel who went to the war and became defiled had to be cleansed, also their captives.
A.R. The sheep might represent persons recovered out of it all.
J.T. You have persons mentioned, too, but women only, those that are uncorrupted; thirty-two thousand -- they are usable; all others are slain. The Lord speaks of those in Thyatira who "have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan", (@Revelation 2:24). There were those that were morally clear of the teaching of Jezebel, and hence owned by the Lord.
W.B. You mean every man or woman who corrupts himself or herself is slain?
J.T. Yes, today they are morally judged; it is *moral* judgment, soon to be actually executed.
A.R. With regard to the cleansing in verse 19, it says that after they were cleansed, they had to stay seven days outside of the camp. Is there something suggestive in that?
J.T. It is a spiritual matter. Seven denotes in this sense that you are fully restored to, or set up in, the spiritual realm.
A.P.T. Do you have this positive side in @1 Corinthians 14:37: "if any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual"? It seems to be a question of coming into what the apostle had in his mind throughout the whole epistle. Earlier he says, "If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy", (chapter 3:17). Would chapter 14 be like the gold here that would come to light, it is brought to the tent of meeting?
J.T. Yes. "If any one thinks himself to be a
{308}
prophet or spiritual". The test is that what the apostle wrote is the *Lord's commandment*; in the recognition of this the spiritual are brought to light. You can see this at Corinth, saints such as Stephanas; how they would rally to that epistle! The test being that what he wrote was the commandment of the Lord, and it is the test today.
A.P. The first epistle in that way is like a washing.
A.N.W. Is it not a striking term, "human persons", in verse 40?
J.T. That is to stress *humanity*, I suppose.
J.T.Jr. In connection with "human persons" in our chapter, the apostle speaks about fighting "with beasts in Ephesus". That element is gone here; these persons spoken of are *human*.
J.T. Quite so; men were like beasts really, but as cleansed they have ceased to be that, and are men according to God.
{309}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (5)
@Joshua 3:1 - 17; @Joshua 5:13 - 15; @Joshua 6:1 - 5
J.T. We considered the war with the Midianites in @Numbers 31, when last together, and noted that all the people were representatively engaged in it.
It is not thought necessary to read from Deuteronomy, as the wars referred to there have already been considered in our previous readings.
Entering now into the book of Joshua we have first what is peculiarly sacred and spiritual, that is, the death and resurrection of Christ with reference to death as an enemy. It is formally called an enemy -- "the last enemy", (@1 Corinthians 15:26). The people, in this instance, have no direct part in the conflict, it is the *ark* that is prominent; it is Christ as going before the people, entering into death and rising again, so that death is abolished for *faith*; publicly it exists, for the waters returned to their former place after the ark had gone over; so it is therefore understood to be a matter of faith. But it is faith in *the power of God* shown in Christ's resurrection.
F.L. What is the thought of Jericho being the first point of approach in this connection?
J.T. The overthrow of the world is in view, as the immediate result of the victory over death.
F.L. Your thought is that firstly everything goes on in secret, and is in the hands of God; the people, as yet, are not brought into it instrumentally, but everything depends upon the ark.
J.T. So that our minds are directed to Christ as entering into death, necessarily alone. It was stressed that the people were to remain two thousand cubits behind.
J.E.H. How would this compare with the Red Sea?
{310}
J.T. Well, it has often been pointed out that the Red Sea is Christ's death *for* us, not our death with Him. The needs of our consciences are in view, that whilst still in this world we should, through faith, know that we are justified; hence the *wilderness* is the result; the world becomes a wilderness to us. We accept *death* with Christ in Romans, and in the light of *His* resurrection, "walk in newness of life", (chapter 6:4). Our resurrection is still future, not present as in Colossians.
A.N.W. Did you wish to emphasise faith especially in connection with the Jordan?
J.T. Yes, I was going to remark that the wilderness position is a result of the Red Sea, and it is said that the Israelites crossed it by faith. It is faith that is stressed there as corresponding with Romans. Faith is also seen at the Jordan, as in @Colossians 2. Faith lays hold of the power of God seen in Christ's resurrection, otherwise the return of the waters to their former position would have ended the matter; there would have been no more crossing. The outward reign of death holds men in fear as before, save as the death and resurrection of Christ is laid hold of by faith and in the power of the Spirit. Faith understands that death is abolished; Scripture says, He has "annulled death". Christ has annulled it. That will not be seen publicly until the millennium, but now it is understood by those of us who have faith and the Spirit -- the Spirit must have a place in this or we shall not enter into Canaan. The ark in Jordan is light, which faith holds to, but the Spirit is the power of our entrance. The death and resurrection of Christ being a fact, what proceeds until the coming of the Lord is *in the saints*, contingent on the Spirit.
F.L. Physical death is not annulled, but to faith death is annulled, as realised by the Holy Spirit, so
{311}
that we find saints passing away saying, There is no water here.
J.T. That is right, and on the same principle death does not come into our assembly meetings; we have access into the realm of life.
A.P. Does the word "faith" in @Colossians 2:12 bear on that? You were referring to it: "buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God".
J.T. That passage alludes to @Joshua 3.
A.N.W. Do you connect baptism with the Jordan?
J.T. Yes, in @Colossians 2:12, already quoted, we have: "buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God, who raised him from among the dead". That is, baptism in its full spiritual bearing enters into the Jordan. It begins in @Romans 6:4, where we are *not* said to be raised with Christ. It is said, "We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life", In Colossians, baptism runs on to our resurrection with Christ. It is not actual, of course, but through faith in the *working of God*, and the Spirit is the present realisation of it pending our actual resurrection when the Lord comes.
A.N.W. But would you not make the Red Sea and Jordan coalesce for that purpose?
J.T. They do, indeed; but Romans gives you the long period that is required to bring us to the appreciation of it, so that we lay hold of it and go in for it.
G.A. Does it culminate in the thought that Christ our forerunner has entered in?
J.T. Yes, only there it is not the land. The entrance there is to the presence of God -- more into
{312}
the sanctuary. The sanctuary is generally the objective in Hebrews, so that we are to draw near. Entrance into the land is, "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, the place that thou, Jehovah, hast made thy dwelling, the Sanctuary, Lord, that thy hands have prepared", (@Exodus 15:17). He brought them out that He might bring them in.
J.E.H. Would that be the reason that there is no reference in @Hebrews 11 to the wilderness? It says, "By faith they passed through the Red sea as through dry land", and in the next verse it says, "By faith the walls of Jericho fell", (verses 29,30).
J.T. That shows the link is with the power for the overthrow of the world. At the Red Sea you escape the power of the world, but the next step is to turn round and *overthrow* the world. Israel were not called upon to overthrow Egypt; God overthrew Pharaoh and his *host*, not the nation properly; whereas the overthrow of Jericho implies the overcoming of the world by the *saints*.
F.L. If I understand you, the meaning of the Red Sea is developed in the first half of Romans, but Jordan typifies the truth in Colossians, which regards me not only as buried with Christ in baptism, but also as raised with Him through faith of the working of God.
J.T. Colossians is that, also that we are "quickened together with him", which is a present thing, involving the work of God *in* us. There is nothing like that in the Red Sea, nor is the ark seen there.
C.A.M. The ark is the prominent feature here, would you not say?
J.T. It is most impressive, and yet is intelligible in view of the antitype. We are to keep our eye on the ark, and keep at a respectful distance from it, which means that we can have no part in this conflict.
{313}
It is Christ alone entering into death to make a way through it for us.
A.P.T. Does the Ethiopian's conversion link with Romans, and Paul's conversion more with Colossians? The eunuch went on his way rejoicing, walking in "newness of life". But of Paul it says, "And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that he is the Son of God", (@Acts 9:20). He had seen the ark. The preaching of the Son of God meant in principle the overthrow of the world.
J.T. That is good. The Lord Jesus appeared to Paul as risen and glorified. He appeared to him from heaven. Paul saw the Lord and he preached Him as the Son of God, which involves entrance into Canaan.
A.P. Does it not imply that the wilderness journey was over as far as Paul was concerned for the moment?
J.T. Yes, the Lord might have taken him up to heaven, not as the thief, through death, but as having seen Him in heavenly glory as Man. He saw Christ as none of the other saints saw Him -- he saw Him in His heavenly relations.
F.L. What is the significance of the two thousand cubits now?
J.T. Reverence is implied, also that we can have no part in this conflict; that whilst it enters into the subject of "The wars of the Lord", the people were not with Him in it, nor could they be. They had no part at all in this conflict. *He* has annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light. Life and incorruptibility would suggest the land, really.
A.F.M. Would our part be to keep our visibility clear with regard to these two thousand cubits?
J.T. Yes, especially in the assembly, because what we should have in mind is the *teaching* of all this. Its present application implies our being in
{314}
assembly. In no position is it more essential to have clear visibility than as coming together in assembly.
F.L. This distance is considerable, but every eye in the camp was to see the ark.
J.T. It is not only that there is a certain distance to imply reverence, but as the ark was not literally a large object the distance required good eyesight.
A.P. Do you think that Paul, in emphasising the greatness of Christ in @Colossians 1 is calling attention to the ark, in view of the actual journey over the Jordan?
J.T. I think that is right. @Colossians 1 helps as to the distance between us and Christ; the chapter greatly stresses His Person. It says, "for in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell" (@Colossians 1:19), without saying anything about His body; but in chapter 2 it is "bodily", showing that He is brought nearer to us. We can see Him; still there is definite distance between Him and us. @Colossians 2 shows our entering the land in correspondence with Christ: circumcised in His circumcision, buried, raised (through faith of God's power), and quickened with Him.
J.H.E. I was thinking of what you said about good eyesight; Paul's prayer in @Ephesians 1 would correspond: "being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know ... the surpassing greatness of his power", etc.
J.T. Yes. The first prayer is that the eyes of our heart might be enlightened; the second, chapter 3, is that we might be strengthened by the Father's Spirit in the inner man. Both are needed as we are entering into Canaan -- we need good eyesight and also strength.
F.L. In Laodicea eye-salve was needed. It is greatly needed in the times in which we are.
A.N.W. Would the "officers" be like the
{315}
apostle's doctrine in regard to this movement; (chapter 3:2)?
J.T. I think so. Joshua, of course, exercises authority, but his authority is more in keeping with Colossians, that sort of authority. In the officers you have authority, as in 1 Corinthians, which is essential to the position. The ark was borne by the priests, and when their feet touched the edge of the water, the power of God was manifest. Attention is called to the Lord Jesus in His holy steps into death. He went into it Himself. Mary anointing His *feet*, is honoured as understanding that He was going into death Himself; the completion of His walk is in view, what He was here as walking entered into His competency to deal with death.
C.A.M. Do you attach the priestly element to the Lord Himself?
J.T. Yes; it is just that which is represented; the holiness that entered into His movements, as, for instance, at Gethsemane. I think what you get in the gospels, after the Lord's supper, is particularly indicated here. He moved out to meet Satan, who had the power of death.
C.A.M. You were alluding to Mary as being intelligent regarding the movement of the ark of the covenant. May I ask whether there were those intelligent at the time of her anointing His feet, or whether it needed the period of forty days after He arose in which to bring them to the fuller understanding?
J.T. The forty days were needed to accustom the disciples to the new state that the Lord had inaugurated in His resurrection, but Mary, I think, is honoured in that it is mentioned that she anointed His feet beforehand, for His burial. She could not have told you that she understood it, but the Spirit of God, I think, honours her in mentioning this, and so the disciples, whether near or far, in those wonderful
{316}
moments after the Supper was instituted, when He went out to the mount of Olives and Gethsemane, would all take notice of and recall that these were the steps that immediately led into death. The mention of the priests feet does not imply that *we* have any active part in what is typified here. I do not think anything may be made of the movements of the priests; it is more the *element* that was typified in them. The ark, as a figure, could not move itself, hence the priests were essential to the movements. We should understand these movements; the apostles and all that were near the Lord after He was taken and delivered over to death would afterwards understand and recall those movements. The deepest spiritual instruction is found in them.
F.L. Is there something analogous here to what we get in Numbers, where the ark went before the people to search out a resting-place for them?
J.T. @Numbers 10 is the beginning of what culminates here, just as the Lord at a certain point in His blessed pathway began to move upward to Jerusalem; (@Mark 10:32). They were amazed, it says, and were afraid as they followed. They began to understand that "the way" He was on led to His death. Thomas says, "Let *us* also go, that we may die with him", (@John 11:16). The ark had already begun to move; indeed, it was so from the mount of Transfiguration. Every step from that point, I think, was like the movement of the ark into the Jordan.
A.P. It says in @Matthew 16:21, "From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go away to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised". Does that fit in here?
J.T. Yes; and then as He goes up to the mountain, and comes down again. He repeats that He is
{317}
going to die, to suffer at the hands of men; (@Matthew 17:9 - 12).
J.H.E. In @John 18 we read that Jesus and His disciples went beyond the torrent Cedron to the garden, and then later Judas comes. Jesus says to the band, "if therefore ye seek me, let these go away", (verse 8). He was going to enter into death *alone*.
J.T. Exactly. All was closing in as He entered the garden. He was entering into the actual territory of Satan's power in death. It was all condensed there, and that is what is before us here. Moses and Elijah on the mount, spoke to Him of His decease. He came down to go to Jerusalem and die.
F.L. In connection with your reference to Mary, the Lord attributed intelligence to her; she anointed Him against His burial; she is not found at the sepulchre, as if she would not look for Him *there*.
J.T. I think we are entitled to see it in that way. She had "passed over" anticipatively. He was known at Bethany as the resurrection and the life. The principle of passing over is what we lay hold of as we see Him go into death. Mary anointed His feet for burial. His feet were carrying Him into death. That, in her mind, would not be the end. He who raised Lazarus would come out of death Himself. Mary was a characteristic believer.
A.B.P. Had she gone through the experience of lodging by Jordan in @John 11? It says here in verse 1, "They came to the Jordan and lodged there".
J.T. I think so. It seems as if she had come to Jordan in her spirit, but also regarded Christ as about to enter it.
F.L. She would have the sense that death could not hold Him. That was impossible!
A.F.M. Is there a parallel between the priests feet touching the brim of the Jordan and the Lord delivering up His spirit in John -- He was superior to everything that was transpiring?
{318}
J.T. I think that is right. This whole book should be read specially in connection with John's gospel. If the Son of God goes into death, that is the end of death. Its abolition is already anticipated. John has that in mind all through His gospel. "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up", (chapter 2:19).
J.E.H. The title that is given to the ark is exceedingly significant. You would thus expect results -- "Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth".
J.T. What could stand in its way? Divine title to the territory enters into that. It is very exhilarating in John to see from the outset the Person who was there. The abolition of death is in prospect; and in Mary's act there was accumulative testimony to it; I believe her act of anointing the Lord's feet points to it, however imperfect her understanding might be.
C.A.M. You were calling attention recently to @John 11, as a military victory. The details in that chapter, one after another, are very wonderful.
J.T. The deliberation with which the Lord moved, and Thomas himself understanding that the movement had death in prospect -- "Let *us* also go that we may die with him" -- imply that. Thomas's remark is mentioned to his credit.
A.N.W. He was almost using Colossian language. I was thinking of the word "with", which is characteristic of Colossians.
F.L. There are here three figures of leadership and power that are quite remarkable. Would you tell us how they compare? There are Joshua, the captain of Jehovah's hosts, and the ark.
J.T. Joshua is the leader. He represents that side. We are plainly in a highly spiritual realm
{319}
here, and have to learn to see how one thought merges in another. So that Joshua was ostensibly the captain of Jehovah's hosts. He was a reliable man in military affairs. The first mention of Joshua is that he was allowed to choose his own army and to lead it, and he led it to victory; (@Exodus 17). We have to keep that in mind. He is seen here as representing that side, and it is said in chapter 4 that Jehovah magnified him; meaning that he represented the element of spiritual leadership seen in Christ; the principle is that he becomes greater and greater in our eyes as typical of Christ. But in chapter 5 Joshua is just one of ourselves, for after all, he is only a man; the Man with the drawn sword is Christ. Joshua as leader drops out of view for the moment. We have to compare that figure and the ark in chapter 3, the power is in the ark; the people are not in the conflict. The ark stays in the bed of the Jordan, where the great pressure was, until all the people passed over. I believe, in principle, that goes on all the time, in the passing over by the saints through faith, the waters of death are out of the way. We pass over through faith by the Spirit. But then in chapter 5 it is the Captain of Jehovah's *hosts*. But others are to have part in this, namely, all the saints. The overthrow of the world is in view, and we are all brought into that, which is chapter 6. So that we have to see how Joshua merges in Christ as spiritual leader. He has an historic place; so has the ark: but the Captain of Jehovah's hosts has no historic place; this is the first mention of Him. The old corn of the land has no historic place either; it is first mentioned here in chapter 5. So that the ark is expressive of *power*, involving the deity of Christ; Joshua is *leadership* spiritually, merging in the Captain of Jehovah's hosts, who is Christ. The Captain of Jehovah's hosts has more to do with the heavenly side of warfare.
{320}
F.L. "Who is he, this king of glory? Jehovah of hosts, he is the king of glory".
J.T. Quite so; "mighty in battle".
C.A.M. In apprehending Joshua's leadership we see that it merges in the greatness of Christ, like that expression in @Colossians 3, Christ is everything and in all.
J.T. Joshua is a man like ourselves; so are Moses and Aaron. That is God in Christ coming down to us in one like ourselves, so that we should understand. But then Joshua is magnified, and Moses is magnified; which means that we are gradually coming into the light of who Christ is.
A.C. Speaking of Joshua and the highly spiritual plane here, is there special instruction in the command, evidently from him, as to the distance, two thousand cubits, between the ark and the people: "Ye shall not come near it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore"?
J.T. What you find in Joshua and others is that while they have instructions from God, they show their spiritual intelligence in their manner of conveying them to the people: they epitomise or enlarge on what they hear. This principle is intended to mark all ministry. It is not delivered merely verbatim; it is presented in a calculated way by those who minister, compare @Exodus 12:21 - 28; @John 16:12; @1 Corinthians 3:1.
G.MacP. There is a remarkable expression in chapter 3:10: "Hereby shall ye know that the living God is in your midst". Would this be realised in the assembly, do you think -- the living God in the midst?
J.T. Quite so. The presence of God is realised as we are together according to the order presented in our chapter.
{321}
W.B-w. You spoke of *our* passing over as seen in this type. Does that work out in the assembly?
J.T. Yes; the forces of death are held back. That is, faith understands, and as we take this ground the Spirit sustains us as free of death. The number of actual deaths does not diminish, but for faith death is annulled. Martha linked the resurrection with "the last day"; but the Lord says, "I am the resurrection and the life; he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live; and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die", (@John 11:25,26). "Though he have died" refers to the departed saints, according to Thessalonians; but he "that lives and believes on me shall never die" refers to Colossians. That is the ground we take. Death is to depart to be with Christ, awaiting the resurrection, which is but a matter of time. The resurrection of the saints is bound up with Christ's -- "the first fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming", (@1 Corinthians 15:23).
C.A.M. So that during the entire faith period, the Jordan is held back for faith.
J.T. Yes. We can thus meet and enjoy eternal life together, because death is abolished, and we know it. Our Saviour Jesus Christ has abolished death and brought life and incorruptibility to light. It is for faith, the Spirit being the power; if the Spirit were not here it could only be an abstract thought with us, but the Spirit being here with us, "the living God is in your midst" as has just been remarked. Death is not on our spirits.
A.F.M. We have meetings for the Lord's supper, for prayer, for ministry, and for the reading of the Scriptures. Do we enter into eternal life in each of these meetings, or would you confine it to the meeting for the Lord's supper?
J.T. To the meeting for the Lord's supper and, in a modified way, to the others. I believe when
{322}
we come together "in assembly", we are where this teaching should come especially into view because we are looking toward the land.
J.T.Jr. Is it a change of position when it says, "remove from your place",? Does that involve a change of position with us?
J.T. Quite so. Lodging implies carefulness on the part of those in this position. As regards the inquiry about meetings for prayer, for reading the Scriptures, for ministry, and other meetings such as this, there is a peculiar kind of atmosphere in such gatherings that you do not get anywhere else. Being together "in assembly" is special, but the general thought is that we are in a realm of eternal life as amongst the saints where the Spirit is free.
W.B-w. Would you apply Joshua's rising early in the morning and the removing from Shittim as fitting in with coming together in assembly?
J.T. I think so. They came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. That is a very careful movement. Jehovah in the prophets, alludes to this journey to prove to Israel His righteousness -- what Balaam answered Balak "from Shittim unto Gilgal", (Micah 6:5). They are beginning that journey now, and what God is, and what His righteousness is, enter into it. The movement is a careful one; the prescribed distance between them and the ark is to be maintained as they enter the Jordan. The people did not come to a particular place on land, but to a *river*. It says: "and when ... they were come to the Jordan". They come right up to death. Their eye was now to be on Christ; the ark, which figuratively is the power of God and the glory of God. It is a mysterious object, and is a question of the deity of Christ in *such* circumstances.
J.S. The intensity of the conflict would be seen
{323}
as the priests feet touch the water; death is rolled back.
J.T. Yes. See the power -- as soon as their feet dipped in the edge of the water it rose up in a heap. It is the "exceeding greatness" (@Ephesians 1:19) of God's power in dealing with death.
A.C. Do you not think it would be a great incentive to the people that Joshua should speak with such assurance of the dispossession of these seven nations? No power, however formidable, could stand against the people of God.
J.T. That is what we ought to see here. We are in the presence of the greatest power against us, "the last enemy" (@1 Corinthians 15:26); but it is overcome by God's superior power.
A.B.P. What is the difference between this and Elijah's smiting the waters of Jordan with his mantle?
J.T. Elijah is more Christ Himself dealing with Jordan; Elisha is typical of the saints passing over, using the mantle that fell from Elijah; that is, it is in the power of Christ, I think, as the apostle says, "Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me", (2 Corinthians 12:9). "Elijah took his mantle, and *wrapped it together*, and smote the waters", (@2 Kings 2:8) It is not said that Elisha did this: "he took the mantle of Elijah ... and smote the waters", (@2 Kings 2:14) The former is direct divine power in exercise; the latter is this power as used by the saints.
F.L. As a practical thing, I have been greatly impressed with what has been brought out in this passing over Jordan in assembly aspect. But is it not a fact that each one of us as we are left here, is brought face to face in a practical way with this matter of passing over; that is, the power of death is known as annulled for us as we leave this scene to be with the Lord?
J.T. @John 12 would help us as to that. We can
{324}
understand that the company at Bethany, Judas excepted, would have a sense of the victory over death. I might ask Lazarus what his experiences had been; but I would say to him, The Lord loves me, too, you know! And Lazarus would own that what Christ did for him, He will do for all of us who may die. It is a question of the love and power of Christ; what will He not do for us? So that entering into death on my part now is an incident; it is a solemn occasion, of course, but still, it is an incident. "He shall never see death", the Lord says of everyone who keeps His word.
A.N.W. You referred just now to "in assembly" in @1 Corinthians 11. Is that on the wilderness side for the moment, rather than on the Gilgal side?
J.T. It is. It is a change of position upon removing from Shittim, which was the last encampment properly in the wilderness. They removed from that and were now on the march into the land -- from Shittim to Gilgal. We have to understand that journey. They moved and came to the Jordan; that is, they came into the presence of death -- and what is going to happen? It overflowed all its banks. You can understand what exercises the people would have as in this position, but then what triumph! For as the feet of the priests touched the waters, they disappeared, we may say, they rose up in a heap by the city Adam, far up the river, "and those that flowed down towards the sea of the plain, the salt sea, were completely cut off". It is the abolition of death. I think we can understand how that applies to our coming together in assembly.
J.S. At the Red Sea the water was in sight, but in Jordan it disappeared.
J.T. Yes. We begin with the wilderness, but we move from that position and go to Jordan. There is a lodging-place, which I think suggests making ourselves ready, preparatory for the passing over.
{325}
A.F.M. Would that not also apply with regard to the individual passing over? We see Christ in the bed of the river, by faith, and have an impression of Himself as having wrought all this great victory for us, and so go over dry-shod.
J.T. Yes. The position in which He is seen here is most touching, and endears Him to us. It is in keeping with earlier experience, because the spiritual rock that followed them was the Christ, (@1 Corinthians 10), a type of the Lord Jesus humbly serving the people, corresponding with the thought of the Hebrew servant of @Exodus 21. And the first movement of the ark is similar. It went before to seek out a resting place for the people. All that is to bring the love of Christ before us. Now He would go before to die for us so that the eye is on the same ark, as going down into death, and it remains in the Jordan until all the people pass over. It is meant to bring the love of Christ before us in regard to this matter, so that we might go into Canaan to possess it.
J.H.E. In this faith period, we come together in assembly, and we see a whole loaf and a full cup, but then there is also the thought of His body unreservedly given and His blood shed.
J.T. A dead Christ is before us in these symbols, which are also a memorial of Himself as absent. These are partaken of in the wilderness, but the change of ground, I think, is in the movement from Shittim to the Jordan, and the lodging place, with a view to entering into the land.
A.P.T. In @John 11:44 it says, "And the dead came forth, bound feet and hands with grave-clothes, and his face was bound round with a handkerchief. Jesus says to them, Loose him and let him go". Where do you apply that?
J.T. That is a service we may render to a brother. That was not done for Christ. The *statement* of the handkerchief that was on His head is noted in @John 20,
{326}
but that alludes to His *dignity*, I believe. I think we have to own that, great as the resurrection of Lazarus was, it is not resurrection properly. Lazarus died again; but Christ does not die again. It is only in Christ risen that you see the abolition of death. It is in Him risen that we understand the land of Canaan, and that death is no more. The resurrection of the saints will correspond with His, marked by incorruptibility, glory, power, and spirituality, for "it is raised a spiritual body", (@1 Corinthians 15:42 - 44).
F.L. Is there not a remarkable blending here of three things, which I suppose speak of Christ the passover, the manna, and the old corn of the land?
J.T. Yes; these are to be apprehended together at this point. There is nothing stilted about a Christian normally. Normally all the elements of support and growth are found with him. The "old corn" is added here, it belongs to the land. It is Christ as *indigenous* to heaven.
W.B-w. The waters "that flowed down towards the sea of the plain". What is the thought of the power of death in that sense?
J.T. I suppose the sea of the plain would be an allusion to judgment in its final character -- death in its final setting as the permanent judgment of God upon the wicked.
W.B-w. It is called the last enemy to be destroyed.
J.T. Quite; death and hades were cast into the fire; the lake, I think, would be suggestive of that -- the permanency of judgment. That is the end of it. "Death shall not exist any more", (@Revelation 21:4). That will be when it is cast into the lake of fire.
R.W.S. @Matthew 27:52,53 speaks of many bodies of the saints arising, going out of the tombs, after Christ's arising, and entering into the holy city and appearing
{327}
unto many. Would that connect with what you have been saying?
J.T. It is an *illustration* of the people passing over, but after His resurrection; that is, after He had dealt with death. Faith understands that the thing is dealt with so that all the people should pass over. "And many bodies of the saints fallen asleep" -- (notice the word "bodies", making it very concrete) -- "arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many". What became of them we are not told. It is to emphasise the great principle that the passing over was going on. @Matthew 27:50 - 54 presents the great *public* testimony to the *power* present when Christ died, enhanced by the confession of the centurion.
A.P. Does the faith side enter into what Elisha did in @2 Kings 6, when the sons of the prophets came and spoke of making a place to dwell in, and the iron fell into the water, and what Elisha did there?
J.T. Yes; there could be no building without that. Building is in resurrection.
A.P. Jordan was shown to have been overcome by what Elisha was able to do there?
J.T. Yes; the iron *swam*. The suggestion is that there is the energy of life in those that are raised, so that "quickened together with Christ" in Colossians is to put us, as to our state, in correspondence with the full position. Quickening implies that you have energy.
J.T.Jr. The word in @Joshua 3:3 is: "Go after it". There is energy there; is that the thought? And then at Jericho the people "shouted with a great shout".
J.T. Quite so; the shouting suggests energy and victory.
T.E.H. The prophet cut down a stick and cast it in where the axe had fallen. What is the thought in that?
{328}
J.T. I suppose that would be an allusion to Christ. A stick would float in Jordan; it would not be engulfed in the water. By casting in the stick, he "made the iron to swim". The allusion is doubtless to Christ going in to death, and *we* come up out of it *with* Him. The iron *fell* into Jordan -- the stick was *cast* into Jordan.
W.B-w. In that case there was water in the Jordan, but here the ark stood firm on dry ground.
J.T. That is the reason why I understand the instruction here should be connected with the assembly. It is where death is annulled for the moment; where we are to be consciously free, and not affected by it. It is a very great thing to be in the assembly in this knowledge, in the power of the Holy Spirit. We are free to be with God and to enjoy the heavenly position: "raised up together" -- that is, with one another. The twelve stones were taken up from the bed of the Jordan and carried over. Our origin is in death, according to this passage. The beginning of our history is figuratively in the Jordan; so we are in the assembly as having no past sinful history at all. We come up out of death with Christ and are elevated together to heavenly places.
W.B-w. The ark of the covenant of Jehovah on dry ground in the midst of Jordan implies that there was no water to be seen anywhere.
J.T. Yes; its presence there is the reason that the water is held back. Divine power held it in a heap very far by the city Adam, and the waters that flowed down towards the salt sea were completely cut off. Its presence in that position is the secret of the waters being entirely out of view.
J.E.H. @Psalm 114:5, referring to this great event, says, "what ailed thee ... thou Jordan, that thou turnedst back?"
C.J.E. Will you say something about verse 5 --
{329}
"And Joshua said to the people, Hallow yourselves"? Is there any application in that to ourselves, such as preparation for our meetings?
J.T. Just so. The question of our state enters into all this, and that is the point in "hallow yourselves". We have here events of great spiritual import, and it particularly enters into the saints position in assembly; we are to be impressed with the holiness and carefulness required in our movements. We have to be careful, as in this position above all others, that is, when we come together in assembly, and I believe that is why the apostle says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say", (@1 Corinthians 10:15). The assembly is characteristically composed of intelligent persons.
{330}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (6)
@Joshua 6:12 - 21; @Joshua 8:10 - 23,26
J.T. There are four wars of the Lord recorded in the book of Joshua in which the *people* have part. Firstly, Jericho, then Ai, Gibeon, and Merom. The last named involved the overthrow of the city of Hazer, which is said to have been the head of all the kingdoms in Canaan. In these great battles, thirty-one kings were overthrown, so that this section gives us much as to the subject with which we are engaged. There is a verse in @Judges 3 that should be borne in mind in connection with our reading: "these are the nations that Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, all that had not known all *the wars of Canaan*",(verse 1). The wars of Canaan have, perhaps, the greatest place in our subject.
A.F.M. Would they include the wars of the Lord or go beyond them?
J.T. The wars of the Lord would include *them*, only in the book of Joshua the Lord is seen as the Captain of Jehovah's hosts.
A.P. Did the overthrow of these thirty-one kings involve the securing of Jerusalem?
J.T. Well, the book of Joshua shows that Jerusalem had been taken, but it was not fully acquired until David's time. Its king is slain in chapter 10. David took the head of Goliath to Jerusalem and afterwards occupied the city.
A.N.W. @Ephesians 6:12 says, "Our struggle is ... against principalities, against authorities". Is that why you emphasise the smiting of the thirty-one kings of chapter 12?
J.T. I think they may allude to spiritual powers of wickedness in the heavenlies.
W.B-w. Did the overthrow of the thirty-one
{331}
kings bring about a division of the land from Shiloh?
J.T. Yes the conquest first, and then later the division of the land.
F.L. I suppose that in this particular spot in Canaan was concentrated the most fearful wickedness and cruelty of man.
J.T. Yes; "the iniquity of the Amorites" is spoken of early in Scripture, and God allowed it to mature in Canaan. As said of men in @Romans 1:24, "Wherefore God gave them up"; three times this is said in that chapter.
The seven nations of Canaan were allowed of God to develop the grossest wickedness, so that His righteousness would be seen in this conquest as the scripture says, "that thou shouldest be justified in thy words, and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment", (@Romans 3:4). This book establishes the righteousness of God in all that He does. He waited patiently until the iniquity of the Amorites was full, and a like development is progressing now in the history of Christendom, in which God's patience is manifest. Yet He is not overlooking the wickedness that is developing, nor will it receive less severe measures. The book of Revelation shows how God will deal with it; as in Jericho, its end will be complete destruction. Joshua swore, saying, "Cursed be the man before Jehovah who shall rise up and build this city Jericho", (@Joshua 6:26). Jericho represents the world; it was carefully fortified because of the children of Israel. The world is made to know something of the power of God's people, but at the same time the grace of God is present to save, as instanced in Rahab, who herself had part in the wickedness of Jericho, but who in acknowledgment of this, owned God and His people by faith, so that she and all her house were saved.
A.F.M. Does that substantiate that "where sin
{332}
abounded grace has overabounded", (@Romans 5:20), as witnessed in the saving of Rahab and her house?
J.T. Yes, and then it was the outcome of God's own work with her. Her faith was not a mere mental assent to the truth, which is so prevalent today. It was progressive and secret. We are told she had flax spread out on the roof. Her faith is the first *personal* faith mentioned after the passage through the Red Sea.
A.F.M. Do you refer to the principle of righteousness in the way of self-judgment, when you speak of the flax?
J.T. I think that is what is meant. The Spirit of God would not record that she had flax spread out on the roof, save for spiritual reasons. It would refer to the element of purity, however crudely understood. Then she had the knowledge of the power of God in the passage of the Red Sea, and the power of the people; the power of God amongst them, as seen in the overthrow of Sihon and Og. So that what is to be kept in view for our profit is that in the overthrow of the world there is no blank left, no void. There is always something to replace it. Israel replaced what Jericho represented, and besides, we have Rahab and her kindred without any statement as to how many there were. Rahab represents the work of God among the inhabitants of the land, God thus securing His title even there.
C.A.M. So that in the mighty conquest of Canaan, corresponding to the epistle to the Ephesians, the riches of God's grace are displayed.
J.T. That is right. The panoply of God begins with *truth* -- "having girt about your loins with truth", (@Ephesians 6:14). We have no part in the world, hence our affections are not flowing loosely; but girt about with truth; then, "having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and shod your feet with the preparation of the glad tidings of peace", showing that in the
{333}
conflict, even with enemies in the heavenlies, we do not relinquish the testimony, nor our fitness for it in our armour, especially in regard to our affections.
F.L. Is it analogous to the introduction of the testimony into Europe in @Acts 16? Paul and Silas in ministering the truth, encountered the opposition of the world, but they were victorious in what was effected through the gospel of peace in regard to the jailor and his household.
J.T. You can see how the entrance into Philippi is marked by these elements.
C.A.M. You were alluding to Rahab: are we right in thinking that the "cord" was of the same material as the flax?
J.T. There is no better raw material for strong cord than flax rightly prepared. You will remember that there are three words used. The word "cord" is mentioned first, without any colour attached to it, which would imply *strength*. @Joshua 2:15 reads, "And she let them down by a cord through the window". And then the word "thread"; verse 18 reads, "thou shalt bind in the window this line of scarlet thread"; it is said to be scarlet; the point is not now strength, but *colour*. Then finally the "scarlet *line*", which was bound in the window, (verse 21). Of course, one thing is spoken of, but there are three ideas. Then Rahab sends the spies forth *another way*; the principle of Christianity is another way than that of the world. All that enters into this great conflict at Jericho.
F.L. Would the scarlet represent lordship?
J.T. It may be royalty. The colour in itself is arresting; it catches the eye, and that was necessary in view of the Israelites passing round the city later; they would see this scarlet line. It also has its own voice as to what is seen in us, so that we are not judged with the world.
A.N.W. It is remarkable that Rahab should have
{334}
been justified by works in sending the spies out another way.
J.T. That is the idea. She was justified by works in receiving the messengers and in sending them out another way; "another way" was in keeping with the scarlet line, which was the ground of her salvation.
A.R. The world is not yet overthrown publicly, but it is overthrown in our hearts and in our houses, is it not?
J.T. That is the thought. The type here refers to what happened in apostolic times; it is the overthrowing of the world in principle in the *heart* of the Christian; and in his house.
F.L. "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out", (@John 12:31). Would that have a bearing on this?
J.T. Yes. "*Now* is the judgment" of it.
W.B-w. Do you look at Rahab in any way as an overcomer?
J.T. She certainly was an overcomer. She represents the work of God amongst men in the world, the establishment of the truth of redemption and deliverance from the world. The Lord said of Paul, "taking thee out from among the people, and the nations, to whom *I* send thee". That is deliverance from the world and then turning around to overthrow it in a moral way. Paul brought the world down by testimony, but this could only be effective by the work of God in men. Rahab represents this work. She would not have had these things viewed spiritually, aside from the work of God.
A.P. Do you think she had on any part of the armour spoken of in Ephesians, like the loins girt about?
J.T. She certainly corresponds in that she was obedient and had what was needed for the particular service required. It is not only that she is saved,
{335}
but she *served* in the testimony. She sent the spies out another way.
A.P. Was there not a change from "Rahab the harlot" to what was spiritual in her?
J.T. Quite so. The presence of the flax suggests that she was an overcomer -- of what she had been. Not only was she forgiven, but there was a change of *state* in her.
C.A.M. She represents the grace side, as, for instance, in the epistle to the Ephesians.
J.T. Yes. God was operating in grace in the very place where the judgment was to take effect. Rahab was delivered concurrently with the overthrow.
F.L. In reading about the host of Israel going round the city of Jericho, from what you have stated, this one woman and the two spies occupied a very important place, as an element preparatory to the work involving all the host of Israel.
J.T. The spies were under reproach in going into such a house; but then, see the result. Whatever men might think, the element of holiness was in that house, and an element of divine power was there. Note, too, their conversation; it was about what God did for His people at the Red Sea and what Israel did in overthrowing Sihon and Og. It would be a blessed season, because of the import of what was said; and then the quality of what Rahab had -- the cord, the thread, and the line, and her readiness to comply with the mind of God as expressed in the spies; sending them out another way. They did not ask her; evidently it was her own act. David, as of Rahab's lineage, also knew how to use linen, i.e., flax. It conveys a great deal of instruction, and helps us as to the order in chapter 6. In that chapter she is saved because of the scarlet line, but what she *was* is seen in chapter 2; you can understand how this enters into the order of chapter 6.
{336}
J.S. In chapter 6, we have the enemy on the defensive -- Jericho shut up and barred.
J.T. You can understand this with such a testimony in it as Rahab would give. We cannot but suppose that she had communicated her mind to other persons as well as to the spies. Whether she had done so or not, the testimony was *there*, if only in one person, to God's power. They barred themselves up against Israel because they feared them. The testimony of this power had come out beforehand, not only when Israel crossed the Jordan, for it was in this woman's heart. She could speak of it intelligently; and so the city is barred up. But how is the victory to be obtained? "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts", (@Zechariah 4:6). Humanly, they did not strike a blow to bring down the walls. First of all, it is the *testimony*, the blowing of the priests trumpets, and the carrying of the ark. There is a show of power, because the military men go first, but it is the combination of the marching round the city, the blowing of the trumpets, the carrying of the ark, and the shout of the people that brings down the walls. The testimony that God had in His mind is in full display. It is to show that the excellency of the power is of God and not from us.
J.S. Do you see that demonstrated in the apostles -- the power of their testimony to overthrow?
J.T. That was the principle. Paul says, "For the arms of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful according to God to the overthrow of strongholds; overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God", (@2 Corinthians 10:4,5). It is an allusion to this very thing.
A.F.M. The trumpets are called blast-horns. They were not a mechanical but a natural product; the sounding of these and the people's shouting brought the city wall down flat.
J.T. Quite so. The horns would allude to the
{337}
creature from whom they came, probably a sacrificial thought.
J.H.E. Would you say Paul was a wonderful example of this, going about from city to city taking them by storm? And he could say to the Galatians, "far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world", (@Galatians 6:14).
J.T. Quite so. That would be the secret of his power, as he says, "that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us", (@2 Corinthians 4:7). That is, I think, what is to be learned in this great conflict in Canaan; God's power working in those who renounce the assumption of any power in themselves.
A.R. The ark was among them.
J.T. That is where the power really was. The epistle to the Corinthians speaks of Christ as God's power and God's wisdom. Paul's testimony was "not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power", (chapter 2:4). Israel's going round Jericho's walls was really in outward weakness, for after all, what was there for the natural eye in all this? The king of Jericho might have said to himself as inside, If this is all, we need have no anxiety. But it was to bring out this very fact -- that the excellency of the power was of God.
W.B-w. Did not the protracted period of six days compassing the city and then the seventh day compassing it seven times test the people as to the power they had?
J.T. I think so. That is what is needed -- to learn patience. The power of God is brought out in patience. Jacob says, "I wait for thy salvation", (@Genesis 49:18). He was *doing* it. Saul could *not* wait. Our patience is tested typically in all this marching round, but in due course the walls *came down*. The people had power to shout "with a great shout" at the end;
{338}
they were not weary. What we have to learn is to wait, and be in accord with God's intervention at the end.
W.B-w. It was when Joshua said "Shout!" No matter what intervened; that was the time for the people to do so.
A.P.T. In war-time, soldiers are often inclined to be impatient; they want to get to the objective, but have to be kept back. Would that not apply to us?
J.T. I think it comes out in a practical way when matters arise locally; at times the issue is not clear and the saints get impatient; they do this and that, failing to observe that God has His own principles and will pursue those principles; they that are with Him will wait and pursue them with Him. It is for us all to learn how to wait and see the issue of things, to see what will come out of that which does not seem clear to us. If the issue is not clear to me, is it clear to somebody else? Why not consult someone who has more experience or spirituality, and see if he has not a little more light than I have?
A.N.W. It would suggest early rising, both in connection with Joshua and the people. I mean, waiting does not mean that there is no rising early and alertness in connection with it.
J.T. That is a fine combination, rising early, but still waiting on God. It tests you in your spirit and patience. Even if they did rise early on one day, they did not get victory that day. They had to wait for another day and yet another day. Patience is one of the greatest lessons to learn -- in view of the issue. As @James 5:11 says, "Ye have heard of the endurance of Job, and seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is full of tender compassion". We need not fear if God has the matter in hand; He will carry it through. "Let patience have her perfect work", (@James 1:4).
C.N.P. The waiting period would be characteristic
{339}
of the day of grace. Rahab had opportunity to get her father's household into her house before the judgment came, and all were saved. So that the waiting period was working out grace in a city that was doomed for destruction.
T.E.H. The apostle Paul laboured with tears, teaching publicly and in every house, testifying repentance toward God and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, in conquering the great city of Ephesus.
J.T. Quite so. He says, in speaking about his warfare at Corinth, "the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds", (@2 Corinthians 12:12). Patience comes first. Let us see what God will do. Joshua says, "Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word proceed out of your mouth until the day I say to you, Shout; then shall ye shout", (@Joshua 6:10).
Ques. What is the significance of Jericho coming into view before the people actually went over Jordan?
J.T. We are going into occupied territory and the occupants have to be overthrown. I believe that is why Jericho is in view here. They "went over opposite to Jericho"; the conflict of the *people* actually began there. As risen with Christ, we are actually in the land, and attack the enemies occupying it.
A.N.W. Is not this crossing of the Jordan a mature move? The children are not exactly in view.
J.T. Yes; that is what is in mind now. Crossing the Jordan is a spiritual matter, for which spiritual stature is required.
E.B. Do you get the thought of measurement in going round the city?
J.T. Yes. The idea is that it is compassable; it is not beyond us.
A.R. I was going to ask about the overthrow of
{340}
Jericho. It is not a military man who takes the lead, but the priests blowing the trumpets.
J.T. Quite so; the military men go before, but the trumpets are blown by the priests; that is to say, the *testimony* is sounded out. It is a distinct sounding out of the testimony, and that is the divinely appointed way of overthrowing the world in men s souls.
F.L. The footnote in the New Translation, with reference to the trumpets says, "The reverberating blast of the horn". So that it was evidently very powerful.
A.F.M. The marching around the city was in three parts. There are the valiant men ahead, and then the priests with the blast horns, and the ark of the covenant, and then the rear guard -- a *complete* testimony rendered.
J.T. That is how the work of God is carried on. I think we may see this order, for instance, at Philippi. The casting out of the demon was military, then the priests praying and praising in the prison; then the earthquake and the gospel preaching brought down the world *in the jailor*. The priestly element dominates. The Lord Jesus, entering into death, is declared to be the "Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead", (@Romans 1:4). The Spirit of holiness is the priestly side. The rear guard is to assure that the results are not held loosely; they are taken care of because there is sure to be an attack in the rear.
J.T.Jr. The army must be well disciplined to be effective. It says here, "Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall a word proceed out of your mouth", (verse 10).
J.T. That is very important as to matters that come up amongst us, that, as what is done is manifestly according to God, there is no insubordination, no assumption to know better. When everything is
{341}
according to God, victory is sure. Going around six days and then seven times on the seventh day tests our patience, but it is worth while; we learn something every time in such exercises; which means that we are greater at the end.
C.N.P. Would you say there was also development of the purpose of God in the salvation of Rahab? She gets a place in the genealogy of our Lord.
J.T. Quite so. The allusion here is to the power of life witnessed in the *breath*, whether in the blowing of the trumpet or in the shout. These are the things that are noticeable. It is the *energy of life* in the testimony.
W.B-w. Would Peter and John, at the beginning, represent those that blew the trumpets?
J.T. I think so. You have a great general attack at Pentecost, and the great result in the converts; also the after attack of the enemy in putting the apostles into prison, and then they are let out and they go "to their own company" (@Acts 4:23); I believe the thought of the rear guard is there; that is, things are, as it were, finished off; the world is completely overthrown there.
A.P.T. The attack through Ananias and Sapphira, (@Acts 5), is something like what took place at Ai; covetousness came in. The enemy would come in in that way.
J.T. That is the next thing -- the possibility of failure. In @Joshua 7 we see the evidence of this in Achan's sin and Israel's consequent reduction to powerlessness -- a very sorrowful condition. The attack was similar in @Acts 5, but the enemy was met and foiled at the very beginning by discipline.
W.G.T. At Jericho they went up straight, but when they came to Ai their weakness became manifest.
J.T. Well, there was a lack of moral stamina, accompanied by great self-confidence, "And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-Aven,
{342}
on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the country. And the men went up and spied out Ai. And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither, for they are few", (chapter 7:2,3). Compare this with chapter 2, when the earlier spies came over to Jericho -- how different their attitude! There was no idea of self-confidence with them. They were entirely dependent.
A.P. Is it not noticeable that Joshua sent them from Jericho to Ai, as if the exultation of the first victory entered into this second immediately?
J.T. Quite so; they should have gone back to Gilgal and then sent the spies up from there.
A.C. How do you regard Joshua's position?
J.T. Evidently he was affected by the leaven of self-confidence which was among the people. Even the most spiritual are capable of this, coming under the influence of what is current.
A.N.W. This danger, I suppose, is *after* a victory.
J.T. Preservation from this is in going back to Gilgal, where the flesh is wholly disallowed in circumcision, which means the setting aside of the flesh entirely, making room for the Spirit.
In passing on from this defeat we come to some very fine thoughts in recovery. In chapter 8, we have Joshua going "that night into the midst of the valley", and then the continued extension of his hand with the javelin. He does not withdraw his hand until Ai is destroyed -- a remarkable testimony of power, pointing, I suppose, to the power of resurrection, the excellency of the power of God in a man.
C.A.M. The great thing that was gained by the overthrow of Ai was the judgment of self-confidence, and then power is seen in the stretching out of Joshua's hand with the javelin.
{343}
J.T. What is to be learned, I think, is the new features of warfare that come out in recovery. It is not at all the same procedure of warfare as at Jericho; there was no ark and no trumpets, but skill and strategy and the stretching out of the javelin as replacing self-confidence.
A.P. Do not Joshua's feelings specially enter into this battle; he rent his clothes; (chapter 7:6); and then later on he is found among the people; (chapter 8:9)?
J.T. Yes. "And Joshua lodged that night among the people" (verse 9); and "Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley" (verse 13); he was taking things to heart.
A.F.M. What does going into the valley mean?
J.T. I think it is figuratively going down into death. It is a new feature in warfare. A general ordinarily would occupy an exalted position, but here he goes down.
A.R.S. That would correspond with David going down to the valley Elah.
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. His generalship was allowed to shine in that way.
J.T. There is a great deal of care employed as to the placing of the forces. I believe the Lord gives a lead in that in the garden of Gethsemane in the disposition He made of those with Him, to show how we should make the most of what there is. He says, "Sit here while I shall pray", (@Mark 14:32). He is passing through the greatest conflict, but He makes disposition of His disciples. Then He says to the others, "abide here and watch", (verse 34). So there are three positions, the first sitting, the others standing, and the Lord at a distance by Himself. I have no doubt that Joshua answers to that here in the careful disposition of his forces, and then lodging himself in
{344}
the midst of them, and going down to the valley. He is not maintaining an official distance.
J.S. So going down to the valley would correspond with Gilgal?
J.T. I think it does; it is the humbling side. Why should a general submit to that save as the outcome of his own feelings?
A.F.M. Would Joshua's humble position enable him to hold the stretched-forth javelin so long?
J.T. I think so, "when I am weak, then am I strong" -- taking the place of death he realises the power of resurrection. I think Joshua was feeling the pressure of this battle. No doubt God allowed him to feel it. Ai was not to be under-rated, but as accepting this he comes into the power of God. The apostle says, "who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver" (@2 Corinthians 1:10), hence he comes out in power in the second letter to Corinth.
A.R. It says in chapter 7, "let about two or three thousand men go up"; but in the next chapter, it says, he "chose thirty thousand" -- Joshua had now come to see what was needed.
J.T. Yes; the end of verse 2 says, "Set an ambush against the city behind it"; then in verse 3, "And Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose thirty thousand valiant men, and sent them away by night. And he commanded them, saying, See, ye shall be in ambush against the city, behind the city". *All* the men of war are now in action.
W.B-w. In verse 12 he had set the men in ambush on the west side of the city. The points of the compass are noted now.
J.T. Quite so; the first are sent away by night. "And he commanded them, saying, See ye shall be in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, and be all of you ready". And then it says, "Now he had taken about five
{345}
thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city" (verse 12). Then in verse 11, "And all the people of war that were with him went up, and drew near, and came before the city; and they encamped on the north of Ai and the valley was between them and Ai". The valley is in view. Then in verse 13, "And when they had set the people, the whole camp on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley". That is his position.
A.P. Is not verse 10 important -- Joshua's place in the army? It is a matter of inspection and going "before the people".
J.T. Quite so; and the elders are brought into the matter.
A.N.W. I should like to call attention to the excellent action in verse 15. Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten before them in order to save the situation.
J.T. It is an attitude of weakness. They allowed themselves to be beaten. We do not like to take such an attitude, but it is necessary for victory sometimes.
A.P. Paul says, "*I* was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling ... but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power", (@1 Corinthians 2:3,4).
J.T. With Joshua there is dependence and an acknowledgment of weakness, which empowered him to stretch out the javelin in his hand toward Ai.
A.C. Do you regard Joshua at the end of this victory as greater than he was before, in that he built an altar in mount Ebal directly after it?
J.T. Yes. He ought to have done this as he came into the land, but now he has come to it. Returning to the thought of the javelin; the apostle says, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me (who is not weak towards you, but is powerful among you,
{346}
for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power; for indeed we are weak in him, but we shall live with him by God's power towards you)", (@2 Corinthians 13:3,4). I believe that is the idea of the javelin being held out until the victory is complete.
G.MacP. Joshua assumed that Ai would fall before the conflict really began.
J.T. To have assurance of the victory is a great comfort. If you are sure that God is with you, that you have no personal motive, but are simply acting for the Lord, you may be sure that victory will be granted.
F.L. The time of victory is the time of the greatest danger of being swept off the ground, so that we need to be on our guard.
J.T. That is indeed true, for the next chapter exemplifies another defeat, in Israel's deception by the Gibeonites. In result, however, God gave victory in connection with them also.
A.P. Did not this matter of Gibeon incite the Amorites to battle and destruction?
J.T. Yes, it was the greatest battle of all, in a sense, because heaven is brought into it. Stones from heaven fell on this combination of kings; the sun also stood still, Jehovah having "hearkened to the voice of a man".
W.B-w. Referring to the victory at Ai, would you say it represented recovery in the present day?
J.T. I think all the divisions (alas! we must so speak of them) extending back for many years -- each of them was most humbling and involved a great deal of loss -- but there are results from which we are profiting today, as there was gain from the failures at Ai and Gibeon. Great results accrued and have remained as wealth amongst the people of God.
W.B-w. Ai means "the heap". Bethel "the
{347}
house of God". Would that help in your thought of recovery from ruin?
J.T. Quite, if you have the house of God in mind. The new features of warfare, that arose after the sin of Achan was judged, are remarkable.
J.H.E. What result was achieved at Gibeon?
J.T. Well, the deception by Gibeon was a humbling matter, and yet these Gibeonites were incorporated amongst the people of God, even as Rahab, and they performed valued services in Israel. They typify those who serve today -- hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation of the Lord, a service very much like that which the Lord Himself performed in the wilderness. He was the "Rock that followed them". We should recall that God would not sanction the slaying of the Gibeonites later (@2 Samuel 21:1).
A.F.M. "They were hewers of wood and drawers of water for *all* the assembly" -- a great privilege!
F.L. They came out honourably in the time of David.
J.T. Joshua said they were to be "hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the house of my God". I think Mr. Darby said he was just a hewer of wood and a drawer of water when he made his translation of the Bible for the assembly!
A.P.T. This ambush is a new military tactic. We never had it in Jehovah's wars before. Is it connected with this recovery?
J.T. I was thinking of these different features in relation to Ai. There is nothing corresponding with Jericho in the tactics employed, and I think they all bear on humiliation, and Joshua is thoroughly equal to it. It is a great thing to *learn to be humble*, because it is really a weapon afterwards. As soon as I allow myself to be beaten, I am more powerful than I have been.
C.A.M. It is a very remarkable thing. It is just
{348}
the opposite to pretending to be something you are not.
F.L. So the Gibeonites deceived the princes and Joshua was humiliated, but the time came when it was said there was no day like it before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man.
J.T. Joshua stands out here as never before. These poetic lines of verse 12 have hardly an equal. What a word they contain! At the voice of a man, the sun stood still about a full day. There is in this a suggestion of a man in Christ. That is what I think is meant; Paul spoke of his humiliation in Damascus, and then tells of his experience as a man in Christ, having been taken to a most exalted position; (@2 Corinthians 12).
F.L. Paul says, "I know a man in Christ ... caught up to the third heaven".
W.B-w. Will you tell us what form of evil marked these Gibeonites?
J.T. It was deception, but there was something in them that indicates faith. They recognised the name of Jehovah, Israel's God, and His fame, and they called upon Joshua to help them, and it is in that connection you get this great display of divine power from heaven.
A.P. Joshua and the princes were involved in making a covenant with Gibeon, but it is said they did not inquire at the mouth of Jehovah. Was this not humiliating?
J.T. It often happens that we are at fault, but God overrules in such instances, and the result is blessing even for the Gibeonites.
J.T.Jr. In effect, heaven is at the command of the earth. Is that going on now?
J.T. That is the thought, it is the voice of a man; what a man can do. This is a wonderful day. There will never be such a day as this, Christ in
{349}
heaven ever living to make intercession for us, and God hearkening to the voice of a man.
A.F.M. It is like "a thousand years as one day"; the one day of our dispensation has been nearly *two* thousand years in length.
A.P. Do you think the prayers of the saints enter into it today?
J.T. That is in keeping with the Lord's position and intercession on high.
G.MacP. Would @Acts 16 show that heaven listened to the voice of two men -- Paul and Silas?
J.T. Quite so, and the prison was shaken. That is the idea. So that our Monday nights are universally used for prayer, and it is an immense comfort to know that heaven hears and answers.
{350}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (7)
@Judges 1:1 - 20; @Judges 4:1 - 9
J.T. Attention was called to a statement in this book, namely, the wars of Canaan. It says, "And these are the nations that Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, all that had not known all *the wars of Canaan*; only that the generations of the children of Israel might know war by learning it, at the least those who before had known nothing thereof", (@Judges 3:1,2). It is therefore important that we keep this passage in mind in considering the subject before us.
The wars of Canaan have a peculiar place, and those who did not experience them were at a certain disadvantage; hence the book of Judges has in view a great change of circumstances in relation to war. Correspondingly, unless we understand something of the wars of Canaan, we too are at a disadvantage, and if God allows subsequent wars, it is that we might *know* war by learning it. To this end certain Canaanitish families were left in the land for Israel's and our profit. The principal battles, as we saw last time, were Jericho, Ai, Gibeon, and Merom. The battle of Gibeon (chapter 10), is outstanding in the sense that heaven directly intervened, God hearkening to the voice of a man.
J.S. Speaking of the wars of Canaan, is this character of conflict brought about by Satan disputing our right to the heavenly inheritance?
J.T. That is right. As partakers of the heavenly calling we dispute his right to be in heaven; hence the Canaanites who were in the land of promise had to be overthrown. This anticipates the war in @Revelation 12, in which we learn that Satan and his angels are to be *literally* cast out. At the present
{351}
time it is the attitude the saints take and what is brought about in us as a consequence, by the power of God. We apprehend our place in the heavenlies -- are seated there anticipatively -- and are not darkened by satanic influence.
F.L. What is the distinction between the wars of the Lord and the wars of Canaan? Is the latter a consequence of the former?
J.T. I think the wars of the Lord are properly wilderness wars. The term is found in @Numbers 21, the book of Numbers referring to the wilderness. Of course we regard the wars of Canaan, too, as the wars of the Lord, only that the distinction, which may be made for our profit, is that the wars of the Lord, as in the wilderness, contemplate Romans and Corinthians, whereas the wars of Canaan contemplate Ephesians peculiarly. We find the title "Lord" in relation to Ephesus in @Acts 19. It has a great place there as corresponding with the captain of Jehovah's host in the book of Joshua.
J.H.E. So "our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities", etc. (@Ephesians 6:12).
J.T. That is the heavenly warfare, and is exactly what is alluded to in the wars of Canaan.
A.F.M. So in @Ephesians 6 we are exhorted to "be strong in the Lord". Would that be a similar thought to the captain of Jehovah's army?
J.T. Yes. It is the Lord militarily; whereas the Lord in Romans and Corinthians has more to do with ourselves, as subduing us, and establishing authority over us. In Ephesians it is the Lord as dealing with the powers of darkness in the heavenlies.
A.F.M. In @Ephesians 6 we are exhorted to stand, having accomplished all things. Does that imply that the territory had already been taken?
J.T. I think so. The allusion is to heavenly ground taken in a moral sense by apostolic power,
{352}
the apostles took the territory, and I think that @Joshua 10 alludes to a man in Christ. It is the place that man has in the conflict as corresponding with Paul's ministry.
A.N.W. What part of the Ephesian armour suggests aggressive warfare?
J.T. The sword, I think.
A.N.W. Is there any other part?
J.T. Well, the feet shod with the preparation of the glad tidings of peace, and prayer. The armour is defensive, but the sword is offensive, and the feet shod with the preparation of the glad tidings of peace contemplates a forward movement -- the acquirement of heavenly territory. It is not merely that I am forgiven, but that I might be acquired for heaven; I belong to the elect.
A.F.M. Why is it "the preparation of the glad tidings of peace"?
J.T. It is characteristic of Ephesians. Peace between God and men, and peace among men is the result.
F.L. The feet shod with the preparation of the glad tidings of peace is followed with the prayer that the apostle might be enabled to make known the mystery of the glad tidings. That would go beyond the proclamation of the forgiveness of sins.
J.T. The mystery would involve the heavenly side, in view of which he was labouring.
W.B-w. @2 Corinthians 12 brings forward "a man in Christ". Is that preparatory to taking the heavenly territory?
J.T. That is what I thought; "a man in Christ" involves Paul's ministry, indeed, the conquest of Canaan involves his ministry; it is the heavenly side of the truth, and therefore @Joshua 10 has a unique place. The attack at Gibeon was not directly against Israel, but against persons who were in covenant relation with them. Whatever the circumstances
{353}
the Gibeonites were now on the side of God's people.
C.A.M. Connecting @2 Corinthians 12 with @Joshua 10 is very interesting; Paul's day, in a sense, is lengthened out.
J.T. Yes. It is Paul's day that is lengthened. It is he that contemplates the world in reconciliation. The lengthening out of the day points to the lengthening out of the dispensation, the acceptable year of the Lord.
F.L. It is very beautiful, is it not, to see that such people as the Gibeonites are in covenant relation; they are entitled to the protection of the God of Israel?
J.T. And they were attacked accordingly by the combination of these five Canaanitish kings, which brought on the great battle of Gibeon, and disclosed the place *man* had. Joshua was not simply the military leader, but a man who had influence in heaven.
W.B-w. The Gibeonites would represent the Gentiles coming in under Paul's ministry.
J.T. Yes, corresponding somewhat with Ruth.
C.A.M. "Behold, he is praying" (@Acts 9:12), would be a wonderful start to Paul's day; God listening to the voice of a man.
J.T. Quite so. Showing the great power that man has in heaven.
J.T.Jr. Is there any link between those reigning in Corinth and the kings in Joshua?
J.T. It is remarkable the prominence that kings have in Joshua. Israel overthrew thirty-one kings. The apostle was aiming at the overthrow of the reigning element at Corinth.
A.F.M. Would Jericho set forth something significant inasmuch as Israel overthrew it at the beginning of Canaan warfare? What does Jericho specifically stand for?
{354}
J.T. It illustrates the world as entrenched in men, who discerning the great power that has come in by the gospel and the presence of the Spirit here, seek to resist it; this opposition brings into evidence the power of the testimony, in overthrowing the world in men's souls.
W.B-w. Is the antitype of this seen in @Acts 2 -- Peter's preaching was used to the conversion of three thousand in one day?
J.T. Yes, the world was overthrown in them; its authority was destroyed by their acceptance of Peter's word and by being baptised. They continued steadfastly, we are told, in the apostle's teaching. The teaching of the world is henceforth renounced. The teaching of the apostles represents the authority of God, and they persevered in the fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers; these things and the other things beautifully mentioned following, showed that the world was overthrown in them. That is the idea, I think, and the Lord added to that.
A.P. Jericho was accursed, which meant destruction. Does it connect with the thought of Anathema Maranatha in the New Testament?
J.T. Yes, it was morally ended. It is only a question of time; the five kings in chapter 10 were hanged on trees, and Israel's captains put their feet on their necks. The world in that way is anticipatively overthrown; in due time it will come to pass literally.
A.P. There are two divisions in chapter 10, one is when Joshua came up from Gilgal and then when he went back to Gilgal. That has to do with the general defeat; but the death of the five kings is treated separately. What would you say about that?
J.T. It makes clear that there was no thought of relinquishment in Joshua's mind until the victory was completed; hence the kings are dealt with as *representatives* of the Canaanitish element.
{355}
F.L. Would this matter of judgment be seen in what is overthrown in the souls of men by the power of the Holy Spirit? In @John 16:11 it says, "of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged".
J.T. I think that is what is meant. The Spirit would bring in a "demonstration" of that. "And having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment", (verse 8). That is, He brought in a demonstration in those converted, the thing was manifestly there. I think that is the idea in the book of Joshua, in type, the world is overthrown in certain ones, and that is sufficient to establish the principle.
A.N.W. When you speak of the power in Man in the heavens, have you the thought that Christ ascended on high and "led captivity captive"?
J.T. That is what I understand. @Psalm 68 would refer to that. It is brought in in Ephesians, "Thou hast received gifts in man" (verse 18); that is, the power given is greater than the power of Satan.
F.L. In other words, it can only be understood in connection with Man in the Person of Christ in exaltation.
J.T. Our being brought into warfare shows that we are no longer babes, but take part in the war as men.
W.B-w. Have you any thought about the five kings being hid in the cave? What would the cave represent in Paul's ministry?
J.T. It suggests what is very ignominious. They are imprisoned alive and then hanged, and then the captains put their feet on their necks. It shows the utter abhorrence of what they represent, and Joshua kept that in mind at the victory. We are apt to neglect at the time of victory the feelings suitable to that occasion, but Joshua fully executed the curse as a witness to the mind of heaven.
{356}
W.B-w. "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly", (@Romans 16:20).
A.N.W. The Lord says, "I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven", (@Luke 10:18). That would convey the mind and judgment of heaven.
J.T. The word "falling" would show how ignominious the fall would be.
F.L. @Acts 19 gives a magnificent display of spiritual power in overcoming the elements of demon worship and the like, which illustrates that of which we are speaking.
J.T. The seven sons of Sceva were treated most ignominiously; they represent the perfection of satanic power. @Acts 19 corresponds antitypically with the book of Joshua, especially chapter 10. Great power was manifested in Ephesus; even napkins taken from Paul's body caused diseases to depart and demons to go out.
F.L. It is stated in @Acts 19 that the image of Diana fell down from heaven, but in regard to the Lord He *came* down.
J.T. Yes, and the assembly in the Revelation is seen as coming down.
J.S. With reference to the scriptures in hand, what would Adoni-Bezek represent?
J.T. That leads us on to Judges. It is well to keep in mind what was remarked in relation to chapter 3, that the wars are educational in Judges, to remind us that we have to *learn* war, especially as coming in after apostolic times. We have to admit that we do not know much of the wars of Canaan. Adoni-Bezek was a man of great power, but he owns the judgment of God upon him, which is somewhat in keeping with Rahab's attitude. He is deprived of his power, but not put to death. This reminds us that discrimination is to be used in dealing with our enemies.
C.A.M. Referring to learning war by "those who
{357}
before had known nothing thereof" -- does that bring it down to the present day?
J.T. Yes. It is well to accept that we are not in apostolic times.
C.A.M. So that church history is not complete until all have learned something of war.
J.T. Yes; the Canaanitish element is allowed to continue to this end. *All* the wars of Canaan are found in the book of Joshua; we must become conversant with all of them.
C.A.M. You were saying that wars in Judges were not on the same dignified plane as the wars in Joshua; but I suppose the variety in this book would show how very educational they are.
J.T. In Judges you have no general or leader such as Joshua. The angel of the Lord leaves Gilgal and goes to Bochim, which shows that we are on lower ground, and God takes up one after another sovereignly. The book begins with the fact that Joshua is dead.
A.N.W. Much of chapter 1 is taken up with what they did *not* dispossess. Does that confirm what you were saying?
J.T. I think that is what we find, speaking generally. The house of Joseph took Bethel, but after Judah's success, it is what the people failed to do.
F.L. Is there any significance in Jerusalem being brought in and dealt with?
J.T. It is an important item in the position. What particularly stands out in chapter 1 as encouraging is that the people still recognised Jehovah. They were not yet choosing leaders of their own; so that the position generally is wholesome.
F.L. It is not contemplated that any believer would count himself out of these exercises. Every believer should have an interest in the wars of Canaan.
J.T. Yes, and the children of Israel are subject
{358}
so far; they ask Jehovah as to leadership and He gives Judah first place. The next thing seen is that Judah is *brotherly*; he asks his brother Simeon to go with him.
J.T.Jr. Is that illustrated in Peter -- first ... Peter -- he and John went up together to the temple? Is that the brotherly element?
J.T. Yes; what a beautiful combination these two made!
J.S. In @Luke 9, the twelve are sent out, corresponding with Joshua; in @Luke 10 the seventy are sent out. Would that agree more with our day?
J.T. Yes, it is an *additional* provision, involving, I suppose, a sense of responsibility, the Spirit supporting it. That goes on to the end.
A.P. Is it not interesting when you come to the sovereign side in 1 Corinthians, that the gift of *governments* comes in there rather than in the letter to the Ephesians?
J.T. Yes, that was needed at Corinth.
F.L. It is beautiful to see in Peter and John, in the early chapters of the Acts, the brotherly way in which they worked together.
J.T. And then to observe the mutual result after their great service and great suffering in chapter 4. It says, "they came to their own company"; that is, they sought the company of the saints and merged there, so it is not now Peter and John, but "the apostles". That is the brotherly spirit, so that however distinguished you may be, you are glad to return to your own company and merge with them, those whom God may be using; in that way you are preserved from ambition and a desire for prominence.
A.B.P. We also have the word of Ananias to Saul, "brother Saul", and later the linking of Barnabas and Saul, and still later the selecting of
{359}
Silas by Paul. Would these instances further illustrate the brotherly spirit?
J.T. Yes. You get it in the epistles also; those to the Corinthians particularly emphasise *the brother*.
C.A.M. To refer to the wars in Judges again for a moment, there is a decline in the history of that book, so that it becomes very individual at the end.
J.T. Yes, after the first chapter individuals come into prominence, inclusive of Deborah and Jael, women who acquire prominence in the war, but the Spirit of God, I think, brings forward at the outset certain circumstances, which existed later than what we get in chapter 3, in order to give us a good start. He brings certain things forward for our encouragement, which is always a great thing in warfare, because we are so apt to be discouraged. Paul says, "if there be any virtue and if any praise, think on these things", (@Philippians 4:8). That is an important matter in warfare, especially in these days, because the enemy's aim would be to dishearten those who lead in it, by the adverse happenings.
J.S. A right objective is needed, as seen in Judah, who said to Simeon, "Come up with me into my lot".
C.A.M. It was just opposite to the way Adoni-Bezek had conducted his war. He evidently deserved what he got.
J.T. Yes; although he was a man not to be despised, because he bows to the government of God. This I think should be linked with the moral power that would mark the brotherly combination of Judah and Simeon. "They brought him to Jerusalem", where heavenly influence would prevail.
J.S. He recognises that the government of God against himself is right.
J.T. Yes; he calls to mind what he had done with the seventy kings -- he was a ruthless sort of man -- and yet he justifies the government of God.
{360}
F.L. So that he dies, so to speak, in the circle of the saints, as under the government of God. He was as one brought back to the proper place in God's dealings.
J.T. Speaking in a spiritual sense, one can die easier in Jerusalem than elsewhere!
A.F.M. In this book of Judges some leading thought prevails. In which part of the book is this seen?
J.T. I think the highest level is chapter 1. This level is later reached by individuals perhaps, but you have a *collective* level in chapter 1 which is not reached afterwards; it is seen in the place Judah has; we have to remember that Genesis gives him the royal place. It involves the sovereignty of God and I believe that is what stands out in this chapter and gives an excellent start: we are on the ground of Judah -- "the sceptre will not depart from Judah ... until Shiloh come, and to him will be the obedience of the peoples".
F.L. Caleb and Achsah follow on in the spirit of that.
J.T. Yes. The spirit of Judah is seen in them; Othniel develops, I think, into the *characteristic* military leader of the book. He is one of the leaders upon whom the Spirit came, in fact, it says, the Spirit *was* upon him; (chapter 3:10). It is a feature to look for; victory can only be accomplished in the power of the Spirit; Achsah his wife had the right idea in asking for springs of water, which imply the Spirit. Caleb, her father, had a great appreciation of the inheritance. He was a man of "another spirit", and had wholly followed the Lord; being a family man, his daughter knows how to speak to him, and knows that he has resources. Her husband needed those great resources, for he had to meet the king of Mesopotamia, the land of "two rivers", involving
{361}
resources; Othniel's hand therefore prevailed against him.
W.B-w. Would Othniel represent the overcomer?
J.T. I think he does. His family setting, both in regard to his wife and father-in-law, helped him in this. The family of faith and its resources are represented in Caleb.
J.T.Jr. Othniel's wife urged him in the right, not in the wrong direction; she urged him to ask her father for the field.
J.T. That is a good word for all wives, for they should help their husbands in the spiritual direction; she asked for springs of water from her father.
A.B.P. There is no hope of reclaiming Christendom today, but we must hold tenaciously to the household, must we not?
J.T. Yes, and the distinction Joseph has in chapter 1 is in that connection -- the house of Joseph is mentioned twice and in securing Bethel, "Jehovah was with them" and "they let go the man and all his family" who aided them in the enterprise.
A.F.M. You spoke of the house of Joseph exhibiting "peculiar strategy" at Bethel.
J.T. Yes; they "sent to search out Bethel; now the name of the city before was Luz. And the guards saw a man come forth out of the city, and said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, how we may enter into the city, and we will show thee kindness", (verses 23,24). I think we ought to notice the man and his family, and how the house of Joseph secured the house of God through the man. The family idea seems to have a place in the chapter, as in Caleb and then in Joseph. Joshua, who was of the house of Joseph, had asserted the principle of the household of faith before his death; (@Joshua 24:15).
C.A.M. I suppose this would link with what
{362}
happened at Jericho: this man being saved and his house, Rahab having had the same experience.
J.T. She, however, "dwelt in the midst of Israel", but the man in Luz did not.
A.P. It is interesting that not only is the man saved, but his family. Will you say some more about that?
J.T. It is an important subject, we were noticing in @Exodus 12 that the general instructions in regard to the passover provides for the salvation of the firstborn, but when Moses presents the thing, he epitomises and also puts in words that do not appear in what Jehovah said to him; that is, he is the *minister* and brings the truth to the people so that they can understand; he gives a spiritual fulness to his communications, and further says, your *houses* are to be saved, not only your firstborn.
A.P. In view of going to Bethel, Jacob told his household to put away their strange gods and cleanse themselves.
W.B-w. The man "went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day", (verse 26).
J.T. Evidently he did not follow up his advantage, for he went back to the old name. He did not appreciate the house of God.
F.P. Referring to Caleb as giving character, we might call attention to what he said to Joshua, "And Moses swore on that day, saying, The land whereon thy feet have trodden shall assuredly be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever! for thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God. And now behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as he said, these forty-five years, since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses, when Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. I am still this day strong, as in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even
{363}
so is my strength now, for war, both to go out and to come in. And now give me this mountain" (@Joshua 14:9 - 12). It is beautiful to see how all this shines in Judges 1.
J.T. You have rich thoughts throughout the chapter, and if we cherish them, we shall maintain the high level that God intends, so as to be in keeping with the wars of Canaan.
A.F.M. While the man at Luz failed to live with Israel, the children of the Kenite "went and dwelt with the people".
J.T. Yes; evidently they dwelt with the children of Judah. Compare their later history (chapter 4); @l Samuel 15:6,7; @l Chronicles 2:55; @Jeremiah 35.
J.S. In verse 19 we see that Judah took possession of the hill country, but did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron. What would you make of that?
J.T. It was to their discredit. I suppose they were not fully equipped, although they could have been. Chariots of iron were overcome later in the army of Sisera. "Then Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron", (chapter 4:13). He was overthrown, so it was not creditable to Judah that they did not overthrow these enemies. Jehovah was with them, however, in taking possession of the hill country.
A.R. Would the rich thoughts of chapter 1 be further seen in the selection of Othniel in chapter 3? He took Kirjath-sepher.
J.T. Yes; he overcame the "city of the book". That is what is to be noted, too, in warfare, the avoidance of reading matter that deadens our souls. That is a great detriment in spiritual warfare. Othniel would avoid all that would defile and deaden his soul. I think he represents a man of resourcefulness because he had to meet the king of Mesopotamia, "Syria of the two rivers". In natural territory rivers
{364}
afford resourcefulness. It says he judged Israel and went out to war, and the Spirit was upon him, implying, I think, that he is the outstanding military leader of the book of Judges.
C.A.M. I suppose we have to appreciate the victories in the Acts in order to achieve victories today.
J.T. Yes, the reading of the Acts of the apostles fills your soul with great and rich thoughts, they stand us in good stead, in the isolated conflicts of our times; it is a great thing to have our souls nourished with the rich thoughts of apostolic times.
F.L. At Ephesus the books were burned, and a new and precious literature replaces them.
J.T. Yes; following on the record of the burning of the books it is said: "Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and prevailed", (@Acts 19:20).
J.H.E. How would you regard the Jebusites; (verse 21)?
J.T. They represent the enemy, I think, in the place (Jerusalem) of light and rule.
J.H.E. Is it not remarkable that Paul was a Benjamite, and the Philippian jailor calls for light?
J.T. The Jebusites would be in a position of darkness really, because if the world looks in the wrong direction for light, it gets darkness. We read of "the universal lords of this darkness", (@Ephesians 6:12). In Paul you have light. The Philippian jailor asked for lights. He had been influenced by the Jebusites before. Being a government man, he would be ruled by the principles of Rome, whereas now he wants light, and he gets it. That would be like the overthrow of the Jebusites in his soul.
C.A.M. The Jebusites really waited until David's day before they were dealt with.
J.T. Yes, quite so. Jerusalem was not properly taken until then, but, as remarked, it comes in here significantly.
{365}
A.B.P. The light the Philippian jailor received seems to connect with the house of God and the circumstances surrounding it. He was told that he would be saved -- "thou and thy house".
A.P. The Macedonians were looking in the right direction for light: "the man" in the vision asked Paul to come over and help them.
A.P.T. What you said encourages in connection with occupation with what would not lower the standard. I was thinking of Paul in the end of 2 Timothy; he is buoyant in overcoming! The enemy was against him, but he says, "the Lord stood with me, and gave me power", and further, "The Lord shall deliver me from every wicked work, and shall preserve me for his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for the ages of ages. Amen", (chapter 4:18). Would not that sustain us despite the enemy's attacks? As good soldiers, we should be occupied with what is positive.
J.T. Yes; victories in the military field should certainly have as great a place as defeats; what one finds in the constant battles of every day is, we are apt to think of the things that are against us, instead of thinking first of what is for us. I believe that is what Paul meant, to be occupied with what is good and in our favour.
F.L. Although there may be education, there is no encouragement in defeat.
R.D.G. Joshua and Caleb in searching the land were occupied with what was good.
J.T. Caleb stilled the people, and told them of the good -- a very fine service.
A.R. In regard to maintaining the high level, the apostle says, "And the things thou hast heard of me ... these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also", (@2 Timothy 2:2); then he says, "as a good soldier of Jesus Christ"
{366}
(verse 3); would that be the idea of a soldier maintaining the truth as he had heard it?
J.T. Quite so. 2 Timothy fits in with Judges; it is to make us good soldiers. "The things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses", reminds us of what we were saying about the wars of Canaan, the positive things of apostolic times. How great a thing it is to have our souls nourished in the *thoughts*, even if we cannot have fully the actual things conveyed!
F.L. 2 Timothy is really a counterpart of Judges. I was thinking of Othniel.
J.T. It is. The intent of that epistle is to make good soldiers of us. The first great and good soldier presented is Othniel. It says, "Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother", (chapter 3:9). The name of *saviour* is very remarkable as applied to one man in those days. Then "the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him". Usually the Spirit came upon a person in view of service, but, with Othniel, as with Joshua, the Spirit was there, that is, he follows on Joshua properly as being the same kind of man, "a man in whom is the Spirit" (@Numbers 27:18) was said of Joshua; of Othniel it is said "the Spirit ... was upon him", (@Judges 3:10). Then the next man after him is Ehud, who represents, I think, one skilled in *the word of God*.
F.L. He was armed with a sword?
J.T. Yes, of a cubit length; it was definite measure. He knows the kind of weapon he has and uses it accordingly; the full measure of what he had is used, so that it entered into the man and accomplished the result intended. The idea is to get the word into people so that it works effectively.
A.F.M. He *made* him a sword having two edges of a cubit length. He did not borrow it!
J.T. You can see how that would correspond
{367}
with these rich thoughts we have been speaking of in Ephesians, the sword of the Spirit is the word of God.
F.L. With a sword of eighteen inches you would have to get very close to the person to use it.
J.T. It was not a conflict at a distance.
A.N.W. He says, "I have a word from God unto thee", confirming the character of the sword he had.
A.R. The king that he overcame was "a very fat man". Would you say a word about that?
J.T. He would be a very fleshly-minded man, a man that lived after the flesh; and his soldiers were like him -- "all fat". They all fell -- ten thousand of them.
J.S. They took their ease.
J.T. Like Moab, who had not been "emptied from vessel to vessel". They were undisciplined people, very difficult to overcome, but Ehud was in the power of the word of God and employed careful strategy. He must have been a man of great balance and thoughtfulness.
Rem. Why does it say he was left-handed?
J.T. To show that he was an *irregular* sort of man; he is not typical of a "college man", a man "trained for the ministry"; but his very irregularity gave him an advantage.
C.A.M. God takes up the most unlikely for His work.
A.P. Is there not a certain kind of irregularity all through this book suggesting that we should be prepared to meet all opposition?
J.T. Quite so. Unlikely persons taken up.
A.F.M. Ehud was "bound as to his right hand". He was not a man from the seminary, or regularly educated.
F.L. The character of Eglon, who met his doom here, is seen in @Philippians 3:19: "whose end is destruction, whose God is the belly".
{368}
A.R. Through the overcoming of this element, "the land had rest eighty years".
J.T. "And Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years", (verse 30). It shows how great and far-reaching the victory was. Then the next man is Shamgar, who slew six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad -- another unlikely weapon of warfare.
F.L. It was very unique.
J.T. Quite so. You have to judge these weapons by their results as used; you may criticise a man's methods, but he does the work needed. The ox-goad, I suppose, would mean a man of *experience*, involving discipline; the ox knows the goad, it keeps him in his place. Power lies in keeping in the place that God assigns us.
A.P. You would have in mind the household and one's position in it, the ox-goad was used evidently on the farm. "The ox knoweth his owner".
J.T. I think the thought is that Shamgar himself was a disciplined man.
A.F.M. Saul of Tarsus was not a disciplined man. He kicked against goads.
A.B.P. But later he says, "I buffet my body", (@1 Corinthians 9:27).
J.T. I think that is implied here "lest after having preached to others I should be myself rejected". He had power as disallowing the flesh and retaining the place assigned to him by the Lord.
{369}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (8)
@Judges 4:1 - 9; @Judges 7:19 - 23; @Judges 11:32,33; @Judges 15:9 - 17
J.T. Attention was called at our last reading to the wars of Canaan. In those wars we deal with spiritual wickedness in the heavenlies. They are alluded to in the book of Judges, and it is said that certain had not known them. The general character of the wars of this book relates to Canaan, but in the case of Jephthah we are taken back to the wilderness side of the Jordan, pointing to retrogression in the history of the assembly. The great conflict in the fifteenth century was of this character. It did not go beyond the epistle to the Romans; but it reasserted generally the truth of the gospel. The book of Judges contemplates us nominally in the heavenly position, and therefore the wars recorded are the wars of Canaan.
W.B-w. So in chapter 4 Jabin is said to be king of Canaan.
J.T. Yes, a Canaanitish enemy; a revival of a great power that had been overthrown by Joshua, showing that the conquest of Joshua was not *maintained*, otherwise Hazor would not have recovered power. It was destroyed, we are told in @Joshua 11, when other cities were not; it was singled out and was burnt, and yet it is in full power here with nine hundred chariots of iron. So that it points to failure in holding the advantage that God gave under Joshua.
A.F.M. In @Ephesians 6:13 it says, "and, having accomplished all things, to stand". Here it was failure in standing.
J.T. I thought that; Hazor having been burnt, had Israel been faithful it would never have recovered itself. I suppose the allusion is to the history of the assembly, as seen in the Romish system in an
{370}
ecclesiastical way. It had been overthrown politically, but it has been set up ecclesiastically; that is doubtless what we have in this chapter.
C.B. Would that warn us, so as not to allow those things that had been destroyed?
J.T. Well, Hazor had been destroyed and was rebuilt. The king of Hazor, according to @Joshua 11, was the head of all those countries, corresponding with the position that imperial Rome had, but it was destroyed in the sense of its having been overthrown in the hearts of the saints at the beginning by apostolic testimony; later it became restored in an ecclesiastical way, assuming headship in Christendom.
C.A.M. Its revival in Christendom, would you say, serves an extended purpose in teaching war to those who had not known the wars of Canaan?
J.T. I suppose it has been the stronghold of the enemy's power ecclesiastically from its inception. Paul says, "For the mystery of lawlessness already works", (@2 Thessalonians 2:7).
C.A.M. You mean the Romish system.
J.T. Yes, it is the centre, you might say, of ecclesiastical opposition to the truth from its inception.
W.B-w. Was there political opposition at the beginning, and since then is the opposition more ecclesiastical?
J.T. Yes. The Lord Himself and the apostles suffered at Rome's hands, but nevertheless it could be said that the apostles had turned the world upside down. They did not do it *outwardly*, but it was done in the *hearts of the saints*. The principles of Rome were overthrown in the heart of whoever accepted the heavenly testimony of Paul, that our citizenship is in heaven. But Christianity is falsified, by having been brought down to an earthly position, and this has given Rome its recovered place.
{371}
A.P. Is there a similarity between the rebuilding of Jericho and the rebuilding of Hazor?
J.T. I think there is. Typically it has become the curse of Christendom ever since, and inasmuch as this system exists in this way, we have therefore to consider how it is to be met, and what are the conditions in the saints of God by which it is to be met. That, I think, should be before us in considering Deborah and Barak. What comes out in the song of triumph in chapter 5 is the great feeling with which the saints as a whole are viewed as to their faithfulness or unfaithfulness; and the lovers of God are mentioned there for the first time, which, I think, is very suggestive as coming down to our own times. Today the test is as to whether we love God. Those who do will shine as the sun in his power.
A.F.M. What is the key to the recovery of what has been lost here?
J.T. Well, there is the first solemn fact that the people were "sold". "Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan" meaning, I suppose, that He allowed Jabin to acquire an ownership of Israel, a thing which Rome has never failed to assert. The oppression was long, "he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel twenty years". This humbling situation was met by Deborah, whose state and position qualified her for such service. She is called a prophetess, literally, as the margin says, a woman prophetess. Jezebel later claimed to be a prophetess, but here we have the true idea of a prophetess; Deborah is the wife of a man whose name signifies light, but the Romish system suggests darkness. Babylon says, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow", (@Revelation 18:7). She anticipates no sorrow, but is independent and imperial in her attitude and is assertive of her rights. Deborah stands in contrast with this; she is the *wife* of
{372}
Lapidoth, and she dwelt under her own palm-tree. She had acquired moral power, for the people *came* to her for judgment.
J.S. It says that she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah.
J.T. Yes, that would mean, I suppose, that she was in victory over herself, and so ruled her own spirit.
A.R.S. She was also "a mother in Israel", (@Judges 5:7).
C.A.M. The word "sold" seems to be a remarkable characteristic of Rome, who traffics even in the souls of men.
J.T. The principle of selling is alluded to several times earlier in this book. God says, as it were, I gain nothing by the sale. It is to bring into evidence God's *governmental* ways; He allowed another to assert a right over His people.
A.P. Paul speaks of being "sold under sin".
J.T. Which shows that the thing has acquired a right; not that it is right morally, but it is viewed in that way; hence the need of redemption.
A.P. Is not selling oneself displacing the right of the owner?
J.T. That is the way it works. There are those who deny the Master that bought them; (@2 Peter 2:1).
C.B. Is the thought suggested here that a spiritual person like Deborah is able to help us?
J.T. Exactly. She represents true formation and is right in every relation; she also has her *own* palm-tree.
A.F.M. Would the result of what is seen in her be that she was able to say to Barak, "Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded?"
J.T. That is one of the features here; that as loving God, you keep His commandments. She is the first to assert the idea of commandment in the book, corresponding in that way with our own times; it was the only way to overthrow Hazor and Jabin --
{373}
the commandments of God being kept by those who love Him.
G.McP. Is there anything in the fact that she judged Israel at *that* time?
J.T. It shows what a great person she was morally, being able to judge Israel in *such* an oppression.
R.A.L. Why is she not mentioned in @Hebrews 11 with Barak?
J.T. I think, to maintain the order of God, Barak was really the leader. She says to Barak, "I will by all means go with thee ... upon the way which thou goest"; the way in her mind was *his* way, she accorded it to him as *man*: "the way which *thou* goest", as much as to say, the way is yours and you are going in it, but it will not be to your honour that I come into it.
C.A.M. As I understand, the feminine element is prominent because of the matter of commandment and because of the love side.
J.T. That is right. It is to bring out that side. The Lord says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me", (@John 14:21). Deborah says, "Hath not Jehovah ... commanded?" She is helping Barak in that way. She is calling attention to the commandment.
A.P. Does her word to Barak have any relation to prophetic ministry today? It met a difficult situation.
J.T. It *was* prophetic ministry. In Gideon's time we have an unnamed prophet, but the prophetic ministry was there, and that should encourage us as to our meetings for ministry -- that God gives us prophetic words that help us in our judgments of matters continually arising, because the great need amongst us is of right principles in our judgments and decisions, so as not to allow personal feeling or
{374}
consideration of persons before principles. Principles come first.
A.B.P. The implements that Jael used were a tent-pin and a workman's hammer. Is there something suggestive in that for today?
J.T. That brings up the whole question of implements of war in this book. Paul says, "For the arms of our warfare are not fleshly" (@2 Corinthians 10:4); it is very instructive to go through this book and to consider the weapons employed, because they are spiritual; they are not carnal, and so we have first of all, Ehud with a sword with two edges, of a cubit length, as we had earlier; then we have the ox-goad of Shamgar; then we have here a tent-pin and a workman's hammer; then we have in Gideon empty pitchers, torches, and trumpets; and then last, Samson's weapon, "a fresh jawbone of an ass". Each of these weapons would be worth considering as suggestive of a certain feature of the truth. The sword with two edges is very remarkable, and it was of a cubit length. It is the word of God working both ways and it measured a cubit's length -- made carefully for a definite purpose. And then the ox-goad, referring to experience in harness with another brother, or with brothers; then the tent-pin here and the hammer -- all very humble things -- a workman s hammer and a tent-pin do not suggest what is carefully prepared. It was just an everyday matter -- they were common things in the tent, the religious leaders of the time would disregard and ridicule them; but they are what the Lord shows He can use effectively. And then the fresh jawbone of the ass, which is most interesting; it is used while fresh, and when used cast away. That is the last of war implements that we get in this book.
A.B.P. When David attacked Goliath he refused to put on the armour of a fighter; he used what he had *proved*, namely, the sling and stone.
{375}
J.T. That is a further thought, perhaps more advanced than any of the former instances cited from Judges. David had reserves with him. He used only one stone, although he had five.
Ques. What is the spiritual significance of Deborah being used as a judge at that time?
J.T. It is to bring out the formative side, involving the maternal, for she was a mother in Israel; and yet the order of God in leadership is maintained. She is a great example of a sister who, however much advanced she may be spiritually, recognises the order of God. The order of God is leadership, and it is vested in men -- the brothers. That, I think, is what the Spirit honours in @Hebrews 11 when He mentions Barak and not Deborah; she makes room for that here, because she says, "it will not be to thine honour upon the way which thou goest"; she also says, "I will by all means go with thee", but she recognises that the matter is his.
A.B.P. It says of the virtuous woman in Proverbs that her *husband* was known in the gates.
A.N.W. I thought in this case she has right instinct, not calling her husband, but Barak. It is not a family matter, is it?
J.T. Quite so. Barak was a man of faith; in Hebrews, long years afterwards, the Spirit of God so regards him.
A.R. Would this incident suggest that both brothers and sisters are in the conflict? She did not sit at home and let others fight.
J.T. She was a woman of courage. Some sit at home and tell what should be done, but Deborah is ready to go forth to war and she gives Barak his rightful place.
J.S. And mention being made of the nine hundred chariots of iron that Jabin had would show how powerful the enemy was; yet she is strong in faith.
A.P. Would you say a word as to the relation
{376}
that sisters definitely have in the conflict of the assembly. Are they outside of it?
J.T. They are in it, of course. But Deborah gives the full lead to Barak; she says to him, "Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath given Sisera into *thy* hand! Is not Jehovah gone out before *thee*? And Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the army, with the edge of the sword before Barak", (verses 14,15). Note that it is, "Jehovah gone out before *thee*", not "before *us*". And so his position is fully maintained. "And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the army".
A.R.S. I suppose a godly sister can give a brother who is in the work very good advice sometimes, would you not think?
J.T. I *know* it to be so. What is to be discerned is that sisters have excellent instincts, better than men have; hence the importance of listening to their advice and of taking them into our confidence.
A.P. Does the idea of the truth of the body really emphasise this?
J.T. Yes. "For also in the power of one Spirit we have *all* been baptised into one body", (@1 Corinthians 12:13).
Rem. It is said of Deborah: "And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel", and I wondered if that position would put her beyond the range of the oppression.
J.T. Spiritually it would. Ramah alludes to moral dignity and elevation, and Bethel, of course, is the house of God, so that the spiritual environment is excellent. In such an environment we are immune from the oppression.
W.B-w. Is it the principle of subjection that helps in this?
J.T. I think so. Deborah was subject. As
{377}
already remarked, she is called a woman prophetess, according to the footnote, to show how thoroughly feminine she was. She was true to her order and honoured in that way.
C.A.M. I suppose Jael too was truly womanly. Her victory was gained inside her own territory.
J.T. Quite so. "In the tent". "Blessed above women in the tent", Deborah sings of her.
A.R.S. She does not go outside of her proper circle, she was unlike many women of today.
A.F.M. It is remarkable that Deborah alludes to the mentality of Sisera, saying that Jael "shattered and pierced through his temples".
J.T. The great system he foreshadows is marked by mentality. No other institution has been so ramified with ability drawn from the human race; everything is taxed to add to it.
R.W.S. Why are wars of such importance, as the wars of Canaan, fought with such small instruments as indicated?
J.T. I think it is God pouring contempt on man's instruments that are forged in universities and seminaries. If God pours contempt on them, He can do without them here. These instruments are very irregular, but show the best possible results. The great power of Hazor is brought down by such mean things outwardly.
A.P. Paul says, "But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise", (@1 Corinthians 1:27). From man's point of view, these things are like foolishness.
A.R.S. David slew Goliath with the sling and stone. Saul would have him take his armour and sword, but he puts them off, saying that he had not proved them.
J.T. Well, that comes in here in principle. David would perhaps be spiritually beyond what we get in this book because, like John the baptist, he had
{378}
opportunity to wear the very best armour and employ the best implements according to men, but he declined them. Priests and Levites were sent to John the baptist from Jerusalem. They came to him and were ready to clothe him in all the dignity of Jerusalem, but he wisely declined it and said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness" (@John 1:23); but he was one of the most powerful of men; the Lord says, "Verily I say to you, that there is not arisen among the born of women a greater than John the baptist", (@Matthew 11:11).
A.McN. Did the irregular things we have spoken of become effective because of the presence of feminine affection?
J.T. Well, the feminine feature is stressed. We are given the history of Deborah but not the history of Barak; the Spirit of God dwells on her qualities to show what was there, and that was the secret of the triumph.
A.P.T. Deborah knew of her predecessors, for she referred to Shamgar. Does she illustrate one who knows something about church history?
J.T. Yes. She says, "the travellers on highways went by crooked paths. The villages ceased in Israel", (chapter 5:6,7). That is, although there was some triumph, typically there was no real church formation or local gatherings. Therefore, we have to take notice of the expression, "a mother in Israel".
R.D.G. Is it in contrast that the mother of Sisera is referred to?
J.T. I think so. Deborah tells us what was going on in her mind; (chapter 5:28 - 30).
A.N.W. The feminine reference in connection with Sisera is striking, not only the mother, but we get the wise amongst her ladies.
J.T. The feminine side is very much in evidence, but we can see the contrast. There is the natural side with her; there are the "ladies" -- worldly
{379}
dignity. Dignity was not wanting with Jael, either. She had "the nobles bowl": "In the nobles bowl she brought forth cream" (verse 25); pointing, I think, to spiritual dignity; but she was able to descend to common things -- the tent-pin and the workman's hammer. The spiritual person is not above using anything that can be used for the promotion of God's interests in His people.
A.B.P. In @Acts 16, where the thought of the believer's household comes in, we read of the foundation of the prison being shaken. I was wondering if that might not link on here, as contrasting with the idea of the tent-pin. A tent is different from a building with a foundation; it would suggest the manner in which we should live here as pilgrims, touching things lightly.
J.T. Yes; the world's foundation gives way; but the tent-pin suggests what holds the saints together in spite of the wind of satanic opposition. Here there was at least one pin to spare. The tent would be properly held without it. The pins of the tabernacle were included in the charge of the Merarites.
W.B-w. Deborah knew those that rode upon white she-asses and that sat upon carpets; she had a range of vision, too.
J.T. The range of vision she had, as seen in chapter 5, is remarkable. Are you not often struck with the broad outlook when reading the epistles of Peter? He was brought up as a fisherman; yet how wide his outlook! The same with John in writing the book of Revelation, what a wide range of knowledge he had; we see how John in writing could employ the features of creation in the most learned way. It is the teaching of God, showing that He can take up such men to bring to nothing the things that are.
W.B-w. Deborah knew where the mother of
{380}
Sisera was, too -- looking out at the window. She knew what the enemy was thinking of and doing.
J.T. "The spiritual discerns all things", (@1 Corinthians 2:15).
A.P. Deborah was acquainted with what the governors of Israel did: "My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people", (verse 9).
J.T. As having experience, God used them to maintain His government. "Governor" is a term that is applied later with dignity to Zerubbabel. In the New Testament it is applied to Pilate particularly; it is passed over to the Gentiles, and the Lord respects it. "Governors" are needed now in the assembly, persons who can maintain things by moral weight and experience.
Now we may go on to Gideon. The principle of a divine test comes in here. God would say, You are talking about all the brothers being soldiers and the sisters being prophetesses, but now I want you to understand that whilst all are responsible, I reserve the right to test everyone, as to whether it is worth while to send him into the conflict; whether he would not be in the way of victory, or whether his being in the battle would not be an occasion of inflation or pride. That is another side and a very testing exercise. God says to Gideon, "bring them down to the water" (the testing is there), "and I will try them for thee there", (chapter. 7:4). God takes the matter in hand. Here we have thirty-two thousand persons ostensibly ready for war, but what will happen if they go? They will vaunt themselves, if they get the victory.
C.A.M. If God is going to select, what are my exercises?
J.T. Well, I think it is a very essential matter. Am I going to be under reproach, by turning my back upon the war and going back home? What
{381}
a humiliating spectacle that is for a brother or sister to be thus seen! How much of it there is! The test is often applied: It is a stormy night, or other hindering things like that present themselves, and we stay at home and have no shame about it. Apparently these twenty-two thousand men went home without any sense of shame, but the three hundred would look upon them with scorn from a military point of view. We often see it in our meetings, when we should have three or four times as many present for them; the test is applied, many fail, and there are only a few.
A.McN. Is the test here one of courage?
J.T. It is one of self-denial -- that instead of drinking in the ordinary manner, giving myself to it for natural satisfaction, I lap like a dog.
A.F.M. Why lap like a dog?
J.T. A dog does not always represent a feature that is of God, but in this case it does.
A.P. A dog laps water quickly, and goes on. Is rapidity indicated?
J.T. That is the figure. God would suggest to us what is spiritual in His warriors; they are not to selfishly drop down to satisfy their appetites in a natural way; they do not partake of food as natural men do. Our belly is not our god; we eat and drink to the glory of God -- not for mere natural satisfaction, but for what is needed to furnish us for His service.
G.McP. The Syrophenician woman spoke of the dogs that ate of the crumbs that fell from the master's table.
J.T. That shows that she was taking her true place as regulated by the light of God.
R.D.G. "A living dog is better than a dead lion".
A.P.T. There is no difficulty about the drinking. Do you mean that we may drink too much?
J.T. We may do it in a natural way, as men do
{382}
it. There were ten thousand of them there, and there were nine thousand seven hundred men that did the thing as natural men would do it. Paul says to the Corinthians, "are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?" (@1 Corinthians 3:3); they were acting like ordinary men.
A.N.W. I suppose often a very small thing finds us out. This was not a big thing, but it was a real test.
J.T. God was applying it Himself.
W.B-w. Is the point in this that God selects the warriors Himself?
J.T. Yes; so that they should come into the ranks rightly. *We* may say to a brother or a sister: However young you are, you are responsible to take part in the conflict; but that may not satisfy God's rights, for *He* might exclude them. The test which God brings shows what you are. It may be a bad night and there is a Bible-reading, you should be there, but you are not. Well, that is the test, and God is applying it. We do not think of that, when we stay at home reading a book, but God is thereby exposing us; and being so like men in our ways, He cannot use us.
A.B.P. I wondered if Urijah the Hittite would be an example as answering to the test. He would not go down to his house to eat and drink, but slept at the entrance of the king's house. He felt that the conditions were such, the war being on, that he could not avail himself of things that were his by right.
J.T. A very good example indeed. Note his spiritual speech; (@2 Samuel 11:11).
C.A.M. I suppose on account of the way the warfare went, it was a somewhat prolonged and strenuous affair, and showed how necessary it was to have the right warriors -- people that would endure.
J.T. Quite so. Well, the next thing is the *way*
{383}
they had to wage war, involving the implements used. The pitchers were empty, and capable of being broken. The word is strong: "and *broke in pieces* the pitchers", which would mean that I thoroughly own that my body is mortal. It is having the sentence of death in ourselves; this means that we are prepared to go to pieces as regards our physical condition we go the whole road in *mind*; hence we do not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.
A.F.M. What are the torches?
J.T. Lapidoth, the husband of Deborah, conveyed the thought. It would be well known. It is a luminary, I suppose, not so much one of brilliancy as of a certain amount of light. That is the second thing. And then the trumpet in the right hand -- for the hands are carefully brought into this. It is a question of individuals in the war. You are entirely subject to a leader. Gideon says, "as I do, so shall ye do". In this warfare leadership is stressed. The three hundred followed Gideon as he directed. Thus the victory was complete.
A.R.S. Would that correspond with Paul's word to follow him as he followed Christ?
J.T. That is right. Of course the leading here means death in a moral sense, to oneself. It is not standing up on a platform, teaching or preaching, but a question of death, of being broken to pieces. The attitude of my mind is that this leadership involves death.
C.A.M. To hold one's body in that way would mean that one discounts all one goes through later.
A.R. "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels", (@2 Corinthians 4: 7).
J.T. That is actually what is alluded to here. It was Paul's experience, so that the excellency of the power was of God. @2 Corinthians 4:7 - 12 shows what is meant here. The apostle is battered, but fragile as his body was, it was preserved day by day;
{384}
but the light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus, that had shone into his heart, shone forth.
A.R.S. What do you understand by the lights inside the pitchers?
J.T. They refer to "this treasure in earthen vessels". Paul says, "God has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".
A.R.S. The breaking of the pitcher lets out the light?
J.T. That is the idea. I have the sentence of death in myself: the worst that can happen to me is death -- hence the light shines.
A.F.M. These go together then -- the broken pitchers, the torches, and the trumpets?
J.T. Yes. One is devoted even to death for the sake of the testimony, being ready to go *that* length. Thus light shines from such a vessel, and there is testimony, too, in the form of sound. It is "The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon". It is not what one is personally, but God revealed in Christ; the excellency of the power is of God.
R.W.S. The hand and the mouth come in in verse 6 -- "And the number of them that lapped, with their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men"; and then the allusion to the trumpet in the right hand being blown would be suggestive.
J.T. Hence @Romans 12 teaches us as to the use of our bodies as instruments of righteousness to God; to be used in intelligence, too -- "your intelligent service". We are taught how to use our hands, and, indeed, all our members, for the overthrow of the enemy and for general service in the testimony.
A.F.M. There is one feature of warfare in this chapter we might mention, namely, the cake of barley bread tumbling into the camp of Midian. Would you mind saying something about that?
J.T. It is a great general thought. The explanation
{385}
given is, "This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, the man of Israel: God hath given into his hand Midian and all the host". It was a question of *food* -- that was the issue. The Midianites were destroying the food intended for God's people. There has been in the revival of the truth of the Lord's supper the thought of food. Scripture makes much of this.
R.D.G. Would it be to humble Gideon as well as to encourage him, to liken him to a barley cake?
J.T. Yes, the man says it tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent, and smote it that it fell. It was an irregular kind of warfare, but it was very effective. Gideon, having heard the dream, worshipped. He was spiritual and so discerned the mind of God. He now had his word or impression from God, and hence all his anxieties were silenced, victory was assured. We may always look for this, and when it comes the spirit of thanksgiving and worship arises in the soul.
A.R.S. Is it not remarkable that this man in the camp was able to discern what this barley loaf stood for?
J.T. God took all that into account; it was intended by Him for Gideon; it is like the man of Macedonia, and many other such signs that God gives, but we can only touch upon these great things.
Jephthah -- whom we may now consider -- was a very irregular man, one that you would scarcely expect to be used of God, for he was a freebooter. But he reminds us of what God may have in reserve for leadership, though concealed by extraordinary circumstances. Jephthah knew the history of Israel. How did he get this knowledge? We are not told, but he had a wonderful grasp of the history of this particular territory; it is not Canaan, but the wilderness side of Jordan.
C.A.M. There seems to have been such persons
{386}
on the other side of Jordan, for Jehu came from the same district. Such aggressive men are necessary sometimes.
J.T. Well, it is a question of the man that God selects. What strikes you is the readiness (so that all may understand what is being said, chapter 11 should be read from verse 12 to verse 27) with which Jephthah addresses the king of Ammon and outlines the history of this territory and establishes the right of Israel to it, putting to contempt the claim of the children of Ammon. They had no right to it at all; and the battle is half won when the position is clearly shown. If you plainly declare the thing as it is, you have moral right on your side, and that is a great deal.
A.F.M. Would you say that this position refers to Luther and his contemporaries?
J.T. I think so. It is wilderness warfare, as you might say.
Jephthah says to the king of Ammon that Israel *walked* through the wilderness: "But when they came up from Egypt, then Israel walked through the wilderness as far as the Red sea, and came to Kadesh. And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom would not hearken. And they also sent to the king of Moab; and he would not. And Israel abode in Kadesh. And they walked through the wilderness, and went round", (verses 16 - 18). Calling attention to the people of God walking in the wilderness is a spiritual touch; and they could turn aside if the brother did not want them to go his way, because Edom was yet a brother. Jephthah goes over the ground, showing what God's people are like, that they could give way if necessary; but they fought with the Amorite, not giving way to him, and thus acquired the territory which Ammon now claimed, although it belonged to Israel for three
{387}
hundred years. I think all this is wilderness instruction entering into our subject.
J.S. As the result of being in the school of God.
J.T. Yes. Well, you can see what moral power this gave Jephthah in the battle. To apply it today, if you can make the thing clear and the principles clear, the battle is half won. You have moral right on your side.
J.S. The enemy changes his attack as soon as the situation is clearly stated.
W.B-w. What do Moab and Ammon represent today?
J.T. They were descendants of Lot, and thus had a certain relation to Israel. They claim, like the professing systems around us, certain territory, but faith refuses this. It belongs only to those who have faith.
There is one other feature to be considered -- Samson, the last judge spoken of in this book. There is a special instance to notice in the chapter we read -- the freshness of the implement that was used and then was thrown away when the battle was over; meaning that in the next conflict something else will be needed. It teaches us to be fresh and vigorous in our service and conflict.
J.S. We are not to be marked by repetition merely.
J.T. And God came in for Samson after the conflict in Lehi, when he was thirsty; God clave the hollow rock and gave him water to drink.
A.P. What do you make of the fact that the men of Judah were ready to bind him?
J.T. They are ready to deliver up to the Philistines the leader whom God raised up for their deliverance, pointing to the way the Jews delivered Christ to the Romans.
A.R. The water provided, I suppose, refers to the Spirit of God.
J.T. I think the place springs have in the book
{388}
is a key -- we are to maintain freshness through drinking into the Spirit.
C.A.M. It is very interesting; there is decline outwardly all through this book, and yet this reference to water evidently implies the means of freshness right to the end.
J.T. Yes; another thing is that Samson never led an army, nor was there a pitched battle in that sense involving others under his regime; it is a record of his own exploits, pointing to the increasing prominence in the last days of individual combat. And then Samson killed more in his death than in his life.
A.P. Samson could not have been counting on Judah to support him.
J.T. He overcame in spite of Judah's readiness to deliver him up to his enemies. He dwelt in the rock Etam. What was he doing there? The Spirit of God does not tell us, but, linking the cliff with the jawbone, we may assume that he was masticating -- taking in the word of God; he was drinking in divine thoughts, spiritual thoughts. Spiritually such a victory as he gained here can be accounted for only in this way. He smote the Philistines "hip and thigh" (chapter 15:8). This is an expression that is used of him only, as far as I know. I suppose it implies that they were in full power. The Spirit of God says he did it.
C.A.M. It seems to be a little like Paul at the end of 2 Timothy, before departing. He was delivered out of the mouth of the lion; but this matter of the books -- the parchments -- was necessary.
A.B.P. Is the thought of freshness seen in Philip, who, "beginning from that scripture, announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him" (@Acts 8:35)?
J.T. Quite so; he was ready to announce Jesus without special preparation.
J.S. Why is it the jawbone of an *ass*?
J.T. I think it is to call attention to one ready
{389}
to serve. Balaam's ass said to him, "Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine to this day? was I ever wont to do so to thee? And he said, No", (@Numbers 22:30).
R.D.G. I suppose it is important to note that it was in the days of the Philistines that he judged Israel twenty years?
J.T. Yes, indeed. They are the leading foes in this book and in Samson's case particularly. I suppose they stand for human principles, those propounded by "big men", according to the world's estimate. You will notice that they *spread* themselves in Lehi; that expression conveys their character: that of making a display.
A.F.M. There are certain things that remain from this conflict: the "Hill of the jawbone", and "The callers spring". These things are marks of victory.
J.T. Landmarks in the spiritual history of God's people.
{390}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (9)
@1 Samuel: 17:31 - 54; @2 Samuel 5:1 - 10, 17 - 25
J.T. We closed our last reading with the consideration of Samson, who slew a thousand men with the fresh jawbone of an ass. Another great incident in his warfare is the fact that he slew at his death more than those whom he had slain in his life. It is thought we should now go on to David, so as to pursue the subject as far as it appears in the Scriptures.
A.N.W. Is there any link between Samson and David, in the fact that they both had much to do with the Philistine enemy?
J.T. There is. What is said of David is that he *subdued* the Philistines. This is not said of Samson; his conquests were not so regular and persistent as David's. In @2 Samuel 8 it is said that David took Methegammah, or the power of the capital, out of their hand. It is a very great matter for the people of God, that such a position of advantage is taken out of the enemy's hands. Isolated victories over the enemy, of course, helped to weaken their power, but their subjugation awaited David's military service.
A.P. Are there any particular conditions that necessitated the bringing forth of David on God's part?
J.T. Well, one thing to be noticed before we proceed is, that David is not to be regarded as consecutive to what preceded. In a certain sense he may be consecutive as applied to our experience, but he is, properly speaking, collateral with Moses and Aaron as a type. Moses and Aaron represent the ministry, that is, they represent Christ more in His official capacity as Apostle and High Priest;
{391}
whereas David is the king and in coming into kingship, what marks him is *personal attractiveness*. What is personal is stressed. He is Christ from that point of view. So that he represents the history of Christ from the outset of his ministry as Moses does, only that it is a collateral line leading to the same end and has to be thus understood; Solomon filling out the great thought of kingship has to be regarded as God's Son.
A.F.M. Even on the battlefield David's qualities of beauty and goodliness are presented by the Spirit.
J.T. Well, it is important to have in our minds the distinction mentioned, because the time arrives in the history of the believer when the personal attractiveness of Christ affects him. Earlier, what he needs is authority. Of course, the king has authority, but what precedes this is authority in Moses.
C.A.M. Would you say that on account of the official thing breaking down in the beginning of 1 Samuel this element in David was necessary?
J.T. Yes. It is through the failure of the priesthood, viewed officially, that the personal side becomes effective. In the twelve apostles we have that which is representative of Christ's authority, so that the apostles doctrine is stressed in the early Acts, but afterwards it is Paul who brings in Christ from the standpoint of His personal attractiveness as the Son.
W.B-w. Moses was more for the wilderness war, whereas David would be for war in the land; would that be the distinction?
J.T. That is right, but not only for the land but for the *city*. The city is stressed in David's history as we see in 2 Samuel, which you do not get in Joshua. In Joshua we get the land, but not the city properly; Joshua is thus the filling out of Moses.
A.P. Do I understand that you are speaking of
{392}
David as beginning over again, but on another line from Moses?
J.T. Yes, that is the thought.
J.H.E. Do you find that in @Luke 2:52 -- "Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men".?.
J.T. Yes, that is the personal side.
J.E.H. I wonder whether @Psalm 45:2 would fit in with what you are saying -- the attractiveness of the king: "Thou art fairer than the sons of men".
J.T. There you get an example of it.
C.A.M. The thought of connecting it with the apostle Paul seems to help greatly, and to account too, for the details that are given about Paul as to his personal features.
J.T. Personality in the Acts appears specially in Paul. He presents the Son as revealed in him. What he was personally is in evidence throughout, even with regard to his advanced years: "being such a one as Paul the aged". And so David at the end is presented to us, as having died in a good old age, full of days; reference also is made to his reign and his might and the times that passed over him. David had the building much in mind. His wars were subservient to the building, but even in the war, as has been remarked, at the outset his beauty is noticed on the very battlefield and as coming out of the first great conflict, it says that Jonathan loved him as his own soul. He is spoken of as a valiant man, and a man of war (even before he encountered the giant), skilled in speech and of good presence. Another thing that distinguished him was *prayer*. In several instances, particularly at Keilah, he approaches the battle by prayer. And in his battles with the Philistines mentioned in @2 Samuel 5 he prayed before each battle.
A.F.M. All his victories are attributed to Jehovah as answering his prayers, as in @Psalm 18. Jehovah
{393}
had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies.
J.T. Yes, and in that Psalm he tells us that Jehovah was his military instructor. Others might have learnt war by seeing God fight, but David says of God, "Who teacheth my hands to war" (verse 34) and in @Psalm 144:1 he says, "my fingers to fight"; so that he is outstanding as a military man.
A.P. In regard to Paul's attractiveness, do you think that his going up to Jerusalem to visit Peter was more personal than official?
J.T. Making the acquaintance of Peter was personal. You may be sure that Peter was attracted by that young brother! Undoubtedly they had a good time during those fifteen days on personal lines. It was not a question of going up to learn from the apostles generally, but from this particular one. "Other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother", (@Galatians 1:19).
A.N.W. Does this personal attractiveness come out too in the apostle in such elements as women and children, that were drawn to him? In @Acts 20 the affections of the elders of Ephesus are drawn out to Paul, and in chapter 21 all the disciples at Tyre with wives and children accompanied him to the ship. I wondered whether that illustrated what the *man* was, rather than what he stood for officially.
J.T. No doubt. @Acts 20 brings it out strikingly; the personal links he established between himself and those he served. All this is of immense importance as bearing on ourselves in warfare; that we are personally attractive, although having to wage war.
A.F.M. Would you say something about David being sent? That seems to be emphasised. He is under command to visit his brethren with provisions from his father.
J.T. That is another thing I thought we might note. He says to Eliab, "What have I now done? Was it not laid upon me?" He was not rushing
{394}
into the conflict. It was a question of a duty laid upon him. He implies he would not be there, save for a good reason. His father had sent him into the army, but he had left the sheep with a keeper. He did not leave them without care. Then his story to Saul as to his experiences in combat with the lion and bear would show that he was a man who would lay down his life for the flock. He fought, not for the sake of fighting, but for a good reason -- the lamb was taken. It is as if the saints were attacked and one fought for them. He knew that God fought with him: "Jehovah", he says, "who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine". It might seem a small matter to risk his life for the sake of a lamb, but he did, not only with the lion but with the bear, and the Lord delivered him.
J.E.H. Would that be like the weak one, "him ... for whom Christ has died"? (@Romans 14:15).
J.T. That is the idea. You do not give up small things; men of God look after small as well as the large things; the same enemy that attacks the lamb attacks the assembly.
F.H.L. Do you understand that the lion and the bear attacked at the same time?
J.T. There is only one lamb mentioned, but I think it is implied that both animals took a lamb, not necessarily at the same time. The enemy was destroyed and the lamb saved in both instances. The value of a lamb was brought home to David later by Nathan; (@2 Samuel 12). The lamb was taken from the poor man, the very thing that appealed to the heart of David -- a small thing, but an object of affection.
A.N.W. David could say to Saul: "Thy servant fed his father's sheep". He *fed* the sheep before he defended them.
W.B-w. David fed "Jacob his people, ...
{395}
according to the integrity of his heart", (@Psalm 78:71,72). His *heart* was in the feeding.
A.R. David does not go into the ranks as a military man, but as sent of his father. What is your thought about that?
J.T. He was simply carrying provisions; militarily he comes in irregularly. He is the kind of man God uses -- the man who comes forward according to the *ordinary* way is generally useless. Saul's armour represented that side -- the ordinary way; the general principle of faith is "another way", (@James 2:25).
A.R.S. Would you say he came with a provision of mercy and at the direction of his father, to see how his brothers fared?
J.T. Quite so. His military qualities were hidden. It is God's way to hide what He intends to do by us: here the greatest military man is hidden beneath the shepherd's attire. David kept the secret to himself until he could speak of it to the right man, that is, to Saul. For after all, Saul was the anointed and he has to go under his orders.
A.P.T. In a conflict, the unspiritual minimises what God is about to use, and makes much of what the enemy is using. Saul says, "Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth". I was wondering if it would help us in conflict, to make much of what God is using rather than to make much of what the enemy is using.
J.T. The natural mind in us, not only in the unconverted, but in Christians, is always marked by that feature. The Philistine power is always marked by display -- they "*spread themselves*" (@2 Samuel 5:22), that is, they spread out to make a show of great power.
C.A.M. That gives force to what you were saying about the other way: by using those unexpected methods, God puts the enemy at a great disadvantage.
{396}
J.H.E. Paul says, "when I am weak, then I am powerful", (2 Corinthians 12:10).
A.F.M. Goliath "looked about" as if to find David.
J.T. It was the attitude of disdain. He was a big man that could be seen by all. Then you have the great skill wherewith David chooses his weapons. That is another matter. He allows Saul to put on him his dress and armour, but he put them off, explaining why he did it. "I have never tried them", he says, (verse 39). And "he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag that he had, into the pocket; and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine". This is how he approaches the enemy. There is scarcely an incident in Scripture that has so much instruction for us as this, as to meeting the enemy; the disregarding of the ordinary way, and yet *having* the things needed, namely, the five smooth stones out of the brook, the shepherd's bag that *he had*, into the pocket of which he put the *chosen* stones; the stones were not of human manufacture; they were smooth, evidently made so by the action of the water. That they came from God's arsenal, was manifest. There were five in number, too.
C.A.M. It was an unexpected affair. David when sent by his father did not have any idea of accomplishing so great a result. It is certain he did not borrow ideas of warfare from anyone but God.
J.T. He did not, but when the work had to be done he was ready. There was nothing slipshod about it. The stones are in the pocket of his shepherd's bag, carefully chosen, just so many, and the sling is in his hand, as it should be.
F.H.L. He took the head from off the giant just as he had seized the lion by the beard. His experiences would stand him in good stead.
{397}
J.T. David had no sword, but it was available *when needed*. He did not borrow it; it was his as the spoil of victory. It is the symbol of his triumph. Goliath was not using it, for it was in its sheath. David cut off his head with it. Considering David's skill with the sling, the Philistine, with all his armour and implements, was outmatched, for David was like a man with a rifle. At a distance he could aim exactly and strike the point he intended to strike.
A.P.T. In verse 46 David says, "I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee". The victory was his before he went into the battle.
J.T. Yes. The question may come in here as to the difference between the overthrow of this giant and the rolling back of the Jordan. The Jordan is the overthrow of *death*. It is rolled back so that the people go over. Goliath is typical of Satan, who has the *power* of death. The first is that Christ has annulled death, and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel. But then He has also *through death* annulled him who had the might of death, and that is what is in mind here.
A.R. So it says, "David ... killed him completely". That is what you mean by saying that Satan's power is completely overthrown?
J.T. Yes, it is really in view of the heavenlies, dealing with the head -- the mental power -- principalities and power in the heavenlies. It is Satan as the head of the system of evil in opposition to God.
C.A.M. That is a striking reference in @Hebrews 2:15 because it says, "who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage". This man had Israel in terror, did he not?
J.T. Quite so; presenting himself morning and evening for *forty* days.
A.P. Do you think that the victory of David links with the thought that Christ led captivity captive?
J.T. That is an allusion to the head of the giant;
{398}
it is brought to Jerusalem, and is a feature of David's ministry.
A.Pf. What place has David's staff?
J.T. I think it refers to *experience*. A staff is what you use in walking and in moving about. It suggests what David was in practical, everyday life.
J.H.E. In that sense he corresponds with Moses. Moses learned through his staff.
J.T. Quite so. Moses staff came into use in God's service after He had instructed him through it. David's is in his hand in the conflict and the Philistine disdains it. It adds to David's equipment here as a warrior of God.
G.MacP. Would this answer to Gethsemane -- the suffering the Lord went through?
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. In connection with Jordan, is it more perhaps the matter of inherent power that was there, whereas here it confirms your suggestion as to the personal matter -- the personal features of David?
J.T. Yes, there is no thought of beauty in the ark, in that sense. It was outwardly a box, but it was symbolic of the power of God. Inherent power was expressed there for as the feet of the priests touched the water, the waters rolled back. But here you have a beautiful personality. It is even mentioned as the giant looked about and saw David.
A.F.M. Would you distinguish between the stone sinking into his forehead and the sword putting him completely to death? There seems to be a period between the two acts.
J.T. I think the first is the power of the word of God in David and its effect. It brought Goliath down and made the cutting off of his head righteous. David had a moral right to do that -- to cut off his head. The action of the word clarifies the whole position. The stone is the symbol of the power of the word of God.
{399}
A.F.M. Would there be a parallel between that and the Lord's answering all the questions that the Pharisees and the Sadducees raised in Matthew's gospel?
J.T. That is just the idea. In principle they are brought down in that they could not answer Him. He had the last word. All these questions were the devil's attacks on Christ through agencies. But the Lord brought them all down. It is the power of the word.
F.H.L. In @Matthew 27 even the chief priests and elders sought to destroy Jesus. It is a remarkable word, is it not?
J.T. Quite so; their point was to destroy Him. Their one thought, whether they did it foully or not, was to destroy Him. But their folly was discovered at the cross. The place of His crucifixion was called, Place of a skull. Nothing there. No intelligence. Hence the moral right to bring all that to an end judicially. That is what happened in the death of Christ. That order of man is brought to an end, and Satan is in that way annulled. In @Hebrews 2 it is not as if he was entirely destroyed; he is "annulled". That is, for faith his power is gone, as we maintain the judicial action of God in the death of Christ.
A.R. David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem. What about that?
J.T. It shows the trend of his ministry. In @Luke 19:38 the disciples in praising God said, "peace in heaven", whereas in @Luke 2:14 the angels said, "on earth peace". David represents the heavenly side. Later he takes Jerusalem, and the head taken there is the symbol of his triumph.
F.N.W. It is like "Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive", (@Ephesians 4:8).
N.P. These five stones were chosen from the brook, but one was enough.
{400}
J.T. In the wilderness, the Lord used one scripture to meet each attack of Satan.
R.D.G. As was said, Goliath did not even draw his sword. David took it out of its sheath.
J.T. It all shows, I think, the complete dominance of David in dealing with this man, who is a type of Satan. Just as you see the Lord completely dominant at Gethsemane and on the cross. He was dominant, whatever show the enemy made.
A.P.T. @Colossians 2:15 says, "he made a show of them publicly". Would that fit in here?
J.T. Well, it fits in at the cross. What was so foolish, so ridiculous in man's eyes, is in God's hand the great means of triumph over His enemies.
A.C. Is it not remarkable that this first account of war in David's history is so full of instruction? Why is this?
J.T. I think it is because it is such a wonderful type of Christ's death -- how He met Satan in His conflict with him. He says, "for the ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing", (@John 14:30). It represents the dominance of Christ there: crucified in weakness, but still He was supreme.
C.A.M. The reference to Colossians is helpful, for that epistle stresses the personal greatness of Christ.
J.T. That is what Colossians aims at; it is Christ personally and how God in His death, especially in the feature of it expressed in the cross, has dealt with all that was against us.
A.F.M. When Goliath speaks to David, he says, "Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the heavens and to the beasts of the field" (@1 Samuel 17:44); in David's reply to the Philistine he says, "I will give the carcases of the *camp of the Philistines* this day to the fowl of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth", (verse 46). His faith already sees the completeness of the victory.
J.T. In @Revelation 19 you have the same thought,
{401}
the immense amount of food available for the fowls of the heavens, through the warfare, the great final battle of the Lord Jesus.
I think we ought to notice that when David is rejected here, he obtains Goliath's sword. There is none like it, he says; (@1 Samuel 21:9). And in further warfare (chapter 23), he prays, and he uses the ephod (verse 9); that is, the priestly side develops in his conflicts -- one of the most important things for us, that as having to fight we may do it as priests, praying about the matter; and the same thing appears later on (chapter 30), when all was lost at Ziklag, he prays again (verse 8); he recovered all, it says, showing how victory is available for us as we pray.
W.B-w. What do you say about chapter 17 verse 53? -- "And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they pillaged their camps". How does that fit in?
J.T. I suppose it would mean that as the result of Christ's death and resurrection and the Spirit here, we may know how to invade their camp and deprive them of their resources. The book called the "Irrationalism of Infidelity" is a good example of this in our times. It is an important side of the position.
A.N.W. Is that why he puts the armour in his tent?
J.T. I think so. David is enriched by it. As we understand the way Satan carries on his warfare, we see we have a great advantage over him.
A.R. Referring to the ephod and Goliath's sword again, I suppose David never fought for personal gain.
J.T. That is right. The first great conflict after he is rejected by Saul is at Keilah, and it is entirely an unselfish matter. He fought to save its inhabitants.
G.MacP. David, in @1 Samuel 17:47, says, "for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hands". He does not say "my" hands.
{402}
A.P.T. David cut off Saul's skirt (chapter 24), and afterwards his heart smote him because of that. His men would have gone further, but he checked them. I wondered whether he forgot the sense of the ephod for the moment?
J.T. Yes. He should not have so dealt with Saul because he was Jehovah's anointed. That is a beautiful touch, I think, that ought to help us in dealing with our elder brethren, such as have had a place in the testimony. The grace shown by David achieved a moral victory that touched even the heart of Saul. He was capable of being touched. "Is this thy voice, my son David?" he said, and he "lifted up his voice and wept", (chapter 24:17). He acknowledges that David is more righteous than he. Another thing that comes out in chapter 25 is that he is now formally recognised as fighting "*the battles of Jehovah*". It is a great matter when the brethren come to see that you are not fighting for personal ends.
F.H.L. The armour in the tent is the first mention that he had a tent in the camp. Does that suggest that he was identified with them now as a warrior and is moving forward?
J.T. Yes; he has a status militarily. There is no record of his having brought a tent there. It is likely that Saul assigned him one.
W.G.T. Abigail had a knowledge of the "sling".
J.T. She had. How she represented the grace and intelligence of the assembly is very beautiful. We see how Christ is fighting the divine battles, and this should be reflected in every one of us if we are fighting, we must see that it is the battle of Jehovah; it is not a personal matter.
W.B-w. Do you regard chapter 25 as another battle?
J.T. Yes. It was a great conflict in a moral sense, for Nabal was in disdainful opposition to David. He was kept back by the influence and good
{403}
advice of Abigail. It is the function of the assembly typically that is in mind, in its grace and intelligence. Abigail was a woman of great intelligence, and fits in there as restraining this warlike effort of David. He was about to go too far, and she modified it. It is not that the Lord Jesus would ever go too far; it is only the principle that *we* might go too far in waging war; our wisdom is to let the assembly always have its place; that is the great prime need now.
A.N.W. She recognised the folly of Nabal.
J.T. Yes, and pointed it out, too, in alluding to the meaning of his name. It is not now Goliath, a great intellect, but a man of folly.
A.R. Is there something in the fact that in this chapter Samuel is said to have died?
J.T. Yes; it is the end of a chapter in Israel's history. In a sense, Abigail takes his place, and David shines out all the more. Let us accede to the assembly its place in everything, and we shall have the mind of God.
W.B-w. You mean that in @Matthew 18 we get the principles that govern the assembly?
J.T. Quite so; God has brought something into this world that is going through intact; it is invulnerable, like the ark of Noah, but how is it going through? -- only as we recognise the principles governing it.
A.P. So Abigail represents the assembly from the military side?
J.T. Yes; she recognised David as fighting the battles of the Lord.
W.G.T. Would Nabal represent a local disturbance?
J.T. Quite so; David approached him with the greatest respect for some victuals, but he disdained him. David's men state to Nabal that they protected his shepherds, and Nabal's young man confirms this, saying, David's men "were a wall to us both by night and day". That is the idea of a local assembly.
{404}
This same young man discerned that Nabal was acting in folly, and he put that information where it should be. He did not get together a coterie of them and tell them, but told Abigail; that is, in type, the assembly -- "tell it to the assembly". If we are to have the help of God, we must recognise the assembly.
W.B-w. Abigail was a woman of ample provision; she took loaves of bread, bottles of wine, five sheep ready dressed, and other things, too, as blessing for David, showing that she was in character like David.
A.P.T. Do you think they were going too far at Corinth in connection with the one that had erred?
J.T. They were too slow in the exercise of grace, as they had been in the exercise of judgment. They were at fault in both cases.
A.P.T. Do you consider that an assembly may fail in that sense?
J.T. I think so.
G.MacP. Abigail said, "And if a man is risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out from the hollow of the sling", (verse 29). Showing that every enemy would be dealt with by Jehovah.
A.R. Do you mean that as we recognise the assembly, we shall have the mind for God for the present and for the future? Abigail could speak to David as to what he was doing and would yet do.
J.T. That is right.
Rem. The issue here is left with Jehovah. Jehovah deals with Nabal. He does not suffer at the hand of David.
J.T. God came in, consequent upon the wise advice of Abigail. She already anticipated that God would deal with him. She says, "let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal", (verse 26).
{405}
W.W.M. David says to Abigail, "blessed be thy discernment". That is an important word.
J.T. It is a very important word, especially in these local difficulties.
A.P.T. "Tell it to the assembly". Do you understand that to be the local assembly?
J.T. Yes; as far as I see, Scripture never warrants administration in the assembly viewed universally. Administration in the assembly while it is down here is always worked out locally. In chapter 30 the use of the ephod may be looked at as very important, and that "David recovered all". He rises to the type of Christ as seen in Romans, recovering all; and then in 2 Samuel going on to Ephesians; that is to say, securing Zion and Jerusalem.
A.P. You would say that, although David *recovered* all, yet he secured even more, because in chapter 30:26 it says, "David came to Ziklag, and he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah".
J.T. Yes. In the first chapter of the second book the spirit of David is stressed. What a man he was in regard to Saul, and how he is actuated by prayer! It is a question of ascent now. @1 Samuel 30 is Romans, I think -- every outstanding question raised on account of sin is adjusted here; but in chapter 2 of the second book it is "Shall I go *up*?" and "Whither shall I go *up*?" A beautiful spirit is seen in chapter 1, and following this he goes up to Hebron under divine direction. Then as anointed at Hebron he is recognised as the one who led Israel out and brought them in; (chapter 5). That is a very important side of the military affairs, that you do not lead the people away, so that they never come back. You may do that, you know, in the war. If you have not the right spirit, you may lead people into the combat and they go wrong in it. But David
{406}
led them out and brought them back, and all this in the time of Saul's reign.
A.N.W. I think that is very important. I think we know what it is to see souls lost in the conflict.
J.T. Sometimes it is the battle ground badly chosen, as the wood of Ephraim. The forest killed more than the sword; (@2 Samuel 18).
C.A.M. A conflict and victory without casualties is a remarkable thing.
J.T. Quite so. It is skill in leadership, as we saw in @Numbers 31. There was not a man lost, we are told.
A.P.T. Is that not Corinthians pretty much as under Paul's leadership?
J.T. I think so; he was very careful. He says, "having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled". He did not want to lose one that loved Christ.
But to go on to Zion: David took the stronghold of Zion. I think what is in mind now is Ephesians, that this warfare leads us not only into heavenly ground but into Jerusalem.
A.R. It says in this chapter that David took Zion. *He* took it.
J.T. Joab's part is omitted in Samuel, to bring this out; that it is *David's* exploit. I think it is an allusion to Christ's conquest of our hearts, the ejection of the enemy from our hearts; and He builds *inward*. *Building* is immediately in view. He has material now that has a place in our hearts. He says, so to say, the watercourse must be reached. I believe the allusion is to what is of God in our hearts.
A.F.M. That would correspond with the second prayer of @Ephesians 3:17, "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your heart".
W.B-w. I was thinking, too, of Ephesians 4:8: "Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity
{407}
captive, and has given gifts to men". He is thus working in our hearts down here.
J.T. Yes; in @Psalm 68, from which @Ephesians 4 is quoted, the gifts are in view of building -- "for the *dwelling* there of Jah Elohim".
W.G.T. Verse 17 speaks of David going down to the stronghold.
J.T. That is in view of the Philistine attack. Going *down* is noticeable. It is like Joshua going into the valley at Ai. Zion implies elevation, but David goes down, and victory is the result.
{408}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (10)
@2 Samuel 8:1 - 14; @2 Samuel 18:1 - 8; @2 Samuel 23:8 - 17
J.T. At out last reading we considered the conflicts in the early part of David's history, leading up to the capture of mount Zion, the city of David. It was thought that we should reflect upon the further wars of David, but considering the extensive ground to be covered, we can only touch on a few scriptures. Chapter 8 gives a general account of the conquests of David; then in chapter 18 we have the war with Absalom, affording special instruction in our subject; and finally, we have the mighty men of David, who should come under our consideration because they are an outcome of his spirit and skill in these wars.
We noticed last time, that when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up to seek him, but we did not enlarge on that incident. Chapter 5:17 to the end, indicates the character of the Philistine opposition, that is, the anointing in those who serve draws out their opposition, and it says that they spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. It says this twice, (verses 18 and 22). That is, in attacking, what is remarked by the Spirit of God here, this class of enemies *spread* themselves, they make as much show of strength as possible. Here it is in the valley of Rephaim, which would allude to human power. And another thing that comes out, which is especially to be noted, is that David inquired of Jehovah in regard of these two attacks. It is to bring out his dependence, as we saw earlier in @1 Samuel 23. During the attack at Keilah he prayed for guidance. It seems as if that is one of the most important lessons to be learnt in our consideration of David's service -- his dependence upon God in conflict. And another
{409}
thing that we ought to keep in mind, is that his conflicts end in peace. Peace ought to be the result of all wars. And so the normal counterpart of David is *Solomon*, a man of peace.
F.L. Would you say that the mind cannot be guided merely by precedent? In chapter 5:23, 24 Jehovah gives directions to David that are totally different from the first. Would that indicate the need we have for dependence upon the Lord for the *next* move?
J.T. Yes; the second inquiry brings out the answer, "Thou shalt not go up; turn round behind them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees". There is a certain humility required in that, in answering to that instruction. Instead of facing the enemy you have to turn round behind and come up opposite the mulberry-trees. It would rob the military man of all self-confidence. And Jehovah says further, You are not to attack until "thou hearest a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, ... then thou shalt bestir thyself". That is, one has to learn to be still until he hears the military sound, the sound of *marching*.
F.L. Would the marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees indicate means that were inconspicuous and lowly?
J.T. That is what I thought. Without this invisible army -- invisible, but not unheard -- what can you do? The sound of marching -- it is an orderly military movement, showing that Jehovah is a Man of war. He is leading in this. The mulberry-trees here would probably imply inconspicuousness, a low sort of tree; they represent men who serve otherwise than by making a show like the Philistines.
A.P. Have you any thought as to David *hearing*, (verse 17)? Is there a point of importance in hearing properly in matters of war?
J.T. Quite so; and he went down to the stronghold.
{410}
In the *stronghold* a sense of assurance comes into your soul. It would be a matter of *faith*. "The name of the Lord is a strong tower" (@Proverbs 18:10) into which the righteous enter and are safe.
A.P. Paul must have heard properly from the house of Chloe at Corinth.
J.T. Yes -- not like Joshua, who thought the sound of mirth in the camp was the sound of war; (@Exodus 32).
A.R. David had to wait for Jehovah's guidance, but he "did so, as Jehovah had commanded him", (@2 Samuel 5:25). He waited for God to lead.
J.T. Quite so. These incidents coming in immediately after his anointing bring out David's character; his dependence upon, and waiting for God. Chapter 8 records a series of conflicts, each for our special instruction. For the first time since Samuel we have the *subjugation* of the Philistines, not isolated battles, successful though they were, as in the book of Judges. It is the subduing power of God in conflict. "David smote the Philistines, and subdued them; and David took the power of the capital out of the hand of the Philistines".
C.A.M. This eighth chapter would indicate protracted conflicts.
J.T. It gives what is more extended, both as to territory and time, than might appear at first sight. It is an epitome of David's reign, before Absalom's revolt. You have his cabinet, as we may call it, stated at the end of the chapter, showing that it was an ordered kingdom or empire, as the outcome of his great skill in war.
F.L. We get here elements differing, and we have to discern; the Philistines, the Amalekites, and the Edomites, as far as I can remember, are not mentioned prophetically for blessing in another day, but the Moabites and Ammonites were so provided for. Would the Philistines, Amalekites, and Edomites
{411}
in that way represent elements which are eternally irreconcilable to God?
J.T. Well, I think we have to distinguish between what may take place currently and what may be the final outcome. Now what takes place currently in this chapter under David is not altogether in keeping with the prophetic outlook; that is, his prowess brings all kinds of national elements into subjection; under David, extermination is not the order of the day. With Joshua it was extermination, but with David, *subjugation*; that is, the power of the kingdom in subduing all kinds of enemies. He subdued the worst kind, the Philistine, and took the power of control out of their hands, that is, "the power of the capital". It is in David's hands now. The enemies continue, but they are subject. Today it would be the power of the kingdom subduing in a moral sense. The worst kind of opposition is subjugated by the power that is expressed in David. To illustrate all this, we have first the Philistines, then the Moabites, then the Syrians, in verses 3 and 4; and then the Amalekites and the Edomites. As subdued, the nations bring *gifts* and they are dedicated. It is subjugation that *brings results for God*. This should be observed. It is a question, not of extermination, but of subjugation; so that the power of the kingdom for good is demonstrated.
J.E.H. Would it correspond with "angels and authorities and powers being subjected to" Christ (@1 Peter 3:22)?
J.T. It does; that is the ordering of God, but what we have here is actual subjugation. I think that the present thought of the kingdom is the subjugation of these elements in ourselves. That is, Romans and Corinthians answer largely to what we are dealing with now -- the subjugation of elements that would interfere with the working out of divine thoughts; you have not only subjugation, but persons bringing gifts, as you will observe in verse 7: "And
{412}
David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much bronze". And then we have: "And he brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze. Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he had dedicated of all the nations that he had subdued: of the Syrians, and of the Moabites, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of the Amalekites, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah". I think we should notice that our wars ought to have peace in mind, and also riches; all that is worked out as the saints become subjugated to the Lord.
A.P. We should have thought that the Lord would have exterminated Saul of Tarsus, but He subdued him and made him useful.
J.T. Quite so; He made him an occasion of great riches in the house of God.
F.L. It has often been remarked that the great crises in the assembly, which have led to much sorrow and division, have nearly always been followed by spiritual riches.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. The wars of David are resultful in that way and culminate in a long reign of peace.
A.N.W. "The work of righteousness shall be peace", (@Isaiah 32:17). I suppose that is the establishment of the rights of God resulting in peace in our souls.
J.T. I think so; so that we apply the thing to ourselves not as a mere historic thing, but as it works out as under the rule of Christ in the kingdom or in the house.
J.E.H. Is it not remarkable that David said, "I am for peace; but ... they are for war", showing
{413}
that the ultimate concern of his mind was to reach peace.
J.T. That is the thought. As to the elements subdued here, the Philistines had "the bridle of the people"; they kept the people in bondage, but David took that out of their hands. Then the Moabites refer to the pride of man, with which we are all more or less affected; and the Syrians have *hereditary* feelings of opposition to others -- and so the Edomites and the Amalekites, all these are just features of the flesh, that find, alas, their place with us, and they are regulated by the subjugating power of the Lord. Thus David had accumulated a wonderful amount of material for the house when the time came to build it.
A.MacN. Is what is preserved for God suggested in "one full line to keep alive"?
J.T. I think it shows that this is a discriminating war, and care is necessary that what is of God is measured, that nothing of God is damaged. I believe the measure is more exercise, "one full line" for life. It is a remarkable incident, but has its own spiritual meaning, I am sure.
A.N.W. Say a little more about the difference between subjugation kingdom-wise and subjugation house-wise.
J.T. I think subjugation by the king is necessarily more arbitrary, as we might say, but in the house the *family* feeling predominates and modifies. There is more entreaty and affection with the latter, but these battles are constantly going on, and the opposition is in every one of us more or less. I think that is what we should see, that it is a subjugating time marked by discrimination. So we have a great difference in this chapter from chapter 18, where the forest consumed more than the sword. That was a poor matter, the result of a badly-selected battle-field. Here everything is marked by discrimination.
{414}
T.E.H. Abraham had three hundred and eighteen trained servants in his own house.
J.T. Military training helps on the battle-field peculiarly. It gives presence of mind, so that you are not flustered in what you are doing; nor wild in your shooting, nor in the use of your sword, but are calm and collected. That is, I think, the effect of good military training; and David could say that Jehovah was his military Instructor. You can understand what a balanced soldier he was and how calmly he would take account of a battle as it proceeded, and not lose his presence of mind. In war you might destroy your friend unless you are carefully balanced.
J.S. So the Lord in speaking to Saul of Tarsus evidenced discrimination when He said, "why persecutest thou me?" (@Acts 9:4). He brought him down; He subdued him, but with great discrimination, so that he becomes a contributor and enriches the assembly.
F.L. I think there is great meaning in what you say. These opposing elements are to be discerned and judged in ourselves; that is where the enemy is found. It is most important.
J.T. Yes. In the conflict, we must be careful that we are not damaging anything that is of God.
A.P. Is not discrimination and balance seen in Elisha, in contrast with what was manifest in the young man, his servant who was with him? The servant was fearful, but Elisha calculated the whole position; (@2 Kings 6).
W.G.T. Would this making of the Moabites lie on the ground be a humiliating thing?
J.T. That is where one belongs, and should be. The judgment of God brings us there; and it is now a question of mercy. We are entirely in the King's hands, we have no power in ourselves. But there is a *full* line for life.
A.B.P. Peter says, "Humble yourselves ... under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
{415}
you in due time", (@1 Peter 5:6). The thought of measure comes in there, too -- "in due time".
F.L. There are two lines for death, but for life, it is a full line.
J.T. I think the two lines would be *adequate* testimony as to what man is in his rebellion. It is an adequate testimony, I think, carried down from the Old Testament, such as the law by which is the knowledge of sin, and the prophets, the testimony to God's patience, to bring out what man is in rebellion against God. I suppose we might take the two lines as a witness on God's behalf of the righteousness of His judgment; whereas the gospel is the full line for life.
A.Pf. The wars in Joshua were exterminating, why not subjugating?
J.T. I think it is good to bring that out. The wars of Canaan, as we have had, were wars of extermination because God had waited for hundreds of years for the iniquity of the Amorite to become full. It is a question of spiritual wickedness in the heavenlies; but David represents a heavenly position -- that of the rule of Christ in a moral sense. This is not the time for extermination, but of *grace*. Indeed, this whole section develops grace in a remarkable way on the part of David. It is a discriminative warfare; one that preserves whatever is of God among the nations. It is a question of the nations, and David is careful that nothing that is of God among them is destroyed. The next chapter brings out beautifully the character of David's kingdom -- "the kindness of God" is shown. He would show it to any of the house of Saul, his greatest enemy. Then chapter 10 presents the man that *despises grace*, that is, Hanun, the son of the king of Ammon, and he is dealt with ruthlessly. It is like "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish". (@Acts 13:41). But this chapter is a discriminative warfare to save all possible.
{416}
G.McP. When David recovered all, in @1 Samuel 30, he slew the Amalekites, but saved the young Egyptian alive.
J.T. Quite so; he could use him. That young man is a type of one in whom the work of God is effective.
J.H.E. Would this be like @1 Corinthians 15:28, "that God may be all in all"?
J.T. That is the great end in view. The complete subjugation of everyone by the Lord Jesus Himself. Subjugation could never apply to Him, for He never needed it. He took the *place* of subjection. He is the Leader in eternity, the Son Himself is subject; that will be the eternal state of things. I do not think that *subjugation* appears there at all, for there will be no evidence of anything that would need subjugation; the work of God, and that only, will be in evidence in eternity. Here we have elements that continually need to be *kept* subject; in @2 Samuel 8 you have the idea of *garrisons*. Garrisons are to maintain subjugation.
J.T.Jr. Is the idea of a garrison suggested in the local assembly?
J.T. I think so. It is the power of God in a locality. It is not a mobile idea, but a local one.
J.T.Jr. The exercise of power in the hands of the Philistines would mean that, in such a case, power is in the wrong hands.
J.T. Exactly; the principle of the chapter is that he took the capital out of their hands; and the garrisons, I suppose, would mean that in every locality the influence and authority of David are maintained. Methegammah would mean "the capital". It was the Philistines capital, and they exercised their influence from that point. Jerusalem is the great thought of the capital in God's mind.
F.L. Do I understand correctly that the two
{417}
great phases of subjugation are *grace* and *judgment*, and that this introduces Solomon's kingdom?
J.T. Yes. The kingdom is handed over, as it were, to the Prince of peace; it culminates in Solomon. During the millennial day He will not be subjugating. The millennium will be the result of Christ's service typified in David; it will not be a time of war; the sinner of one hundred years will be dealt with, but that will be the exception. The general thought will be peace, and it is the outcome of what is going on now, and what will happen immediately before the introduction of the millennium.
A.P.T. What is the composition of a garrison?
J.T. I should think they would be men trained under David, who would represent his authority in each locality, maintaining his power according to the spirit and skill of David.
T.E.H. Was Timothy, as seen in the epistles to the Corinthians, a good soldier, having the mind of Christ?
J.T. According to chapter 4 of the first epistle, he is sent by the apostle to Corinth. He says, "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ", (verse 17). That illustrates what has been remarked as to the composition of the garrisons, that it would be a question of David and his spirit in a locality, and I think that is the reason why Paul mentions Timothy in his second letter, because they had already proved him in their midst. He represented Paul's spirit and way amongst them.
F.L. He had "no one like-minded", (@Philippians 2:20).
J.T. The kind of thing that is always needed in a locality is someone to represent the Lord, not only His authority, but His Spirit and ways: "my ways", Paul says, "as they are in Christ", (@1 Corinthians 4:17).
J.T.Jr. You get great variety in this cabinet of
{418}
David. Is that suggestive of the variety of God's provision in the assembly?
J.T. Yes. "David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people. And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler; and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was scribe; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers", (chapter 8:15 - 18). I apprehend that a garrison spiritually would represent the intelligence and stability that is presented in these verses.
W.G.T. "David reigned over all Israel", (verse 15).
J.T. I think it is the Lord in His authority as recognised everywhere. "And thus I ordain in *all* the assemblies", (@1 Corinthians 7:17). "All that in *every place* call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours", (@1 Corinthians 1:2). These scriptures would suggest the same idea.
A.N.W. It seems that the Syrian and the Edomite features require the garrison. I wonder whether they might stand related to what you said before with regard to them.
J.T. Well, I think they adhere to their characteristics. The Syrian is a hereditary sort of enemy, arising from distant natural links. Jacob's wives came from there, Laban being a Syrian. You can understand how the Syrians would vie with Israel in view of the great prosperity that God had granted him, and therefore that element requires especially to be held in check. That is what I think is in mind. Edom is like that, only nearer. He is the *brother*, but as on the ground of nature would have a claim and would make demands. Bitter opposition is sure to arise from them as the blessing of God marks
{419}
those who walk by faith. Thus garrisons are needed there particularly.
A.P. Inveterate hatred marked Edom. It is spoken of in the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and others.
A.B.P. Would you say that the saints at Crete needed a garrison? They were always liars. There was a constant tendency with them that had to be rebuked sharply.
J.T. Quite so; a characteristic sort of thing.
F.L. With regard to the imperial idea of which you speak, the Euphrates is brought in here, the eastern boundary of the territory promised to Israel.
J.T. That is an important point. Not only Canaan, but from the great sea to the Euphrates was promised; Canaan is the heavenly territory, but the imperial territory includes much more. David's kingdom would not omit anything that is within the range of promise. It may be thought of little account because so far away, but a spiritual man will not let any promised thing go. God has secured everything that He has promised. "Whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us", (@2 Corinthians 1:20).
F.L. That would embrace the territory from which Abraham was called.
J.T. Quite so. I think we are often apt to think little of what is at a distance, but the securing of the territory to the utmost limits of the promise by Jehovah means that there was the utmost care with David to let nothing go; everything is of value, and hence secured.
F.L. We get something very different in character in chapter 17 in the war against Absalom.
J.T. That brings us to a very humbling bit of discipline. First of all, it is the outcome of David's own failure. It corresponds with divisions that have come in amongst the people of God. They are the
{420}
outcome of not only one or two leaders, but of the general condition of the saints, and the whole history from chapter 12 onwards is pathetic; it is a sorrowful history, which every student of Scripture should weigh in his own soul before God. What it presents is a weak and crippled David suffering on account of his own conduct under the government of God. In this chapter we have him as about to be victorious, but still things are very weak; he marshalled, however, those that were with him, he is military enough for that, but full of natural feelings to the extent even of allowing in principle an antichrist, because he was his son. "O Absalom, my son, my son!" he says. If any looked into the occurrence he would be impressed with the prominence David still gives to Absalom and to the relation of son. The history of Absalom is abhorrent to the idea of such a relationship.
A.MacN. He made a most serious breach amongst the subjects of David.
J.T. He did, and that is why David ought not to have allowed his natural affections to sway him. That is the lesson to be learned; not to allow natural relations and affections to sway us in the things of God. The most spiritual believer is capable of being affected in this way.
F.L. David said, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom".
A.B.P. Principles come before persons.
J.T. That is right; that is what one was saying, but David puts his own son before principles.
A.N.W. In connection with the family of Saul, David would show the kindness of God to Saul's house, but he could not show such kindness to Absalom.
J.T. No indeed. That is where the error lay; there was a certain appearance of judgment, but still David allowed him to come back, and reinstated
{421}
him to favour, in doing which he opened the door to antichrist, for that is what Absalom represents. That is, the spirit and character of antichrist which is finding a footing in Christendom today.
A.P. Would you say that as over against right principles, the thought of feelings comes in here? The people said, "Thou shalt not go forth" -- we might think the statement represented right feelings, but they were evidently wrong feelings.
J.T. Yes, they had great regard for David. It is only here, I think, that you get him formally valued by the people: "*thou* art worth ten thousand of us". It was a humble but right attitude, but although so highly regarded, he is not moving in spiritual energy at this time. This is a most humiliating scene. The battle-field was badly selected, being in the forest of Ephraim; this, I suppose, has some allusion to Absalom assuming he had the right of the first-born in Israel. Now the leading place belonged to Judah. The Spirit of God tells us that the forest devoured more people than the sword. The sword is the proper weapon for divine warfare.
F.L. David surrendered headship and leadership when he said, "I will do what is good in your sight". He let the people lead, and then we have the poor battle-field.
A.B.P. Is not this conflict executed on the principle of assumed leadership? David, the true leader, stays behind, and Absalom is definitely in the foreground as having usurped the place.
J.T. David makes room for that by opening the door for Absalom's return, who was a murderer. So that where there is true leadership, the thing is to hold to it, even at the expense of being criticised. David's position was that of marshal; he marshalled his forces, but he did not lead them. Of course Absalom was personally guilty, and is judged accordingly.
{422}
J.T.Jr. David's first breakdown came about because he did not go with his army, "when kings go forth", (chapter 11:1).
J.T. That is right. From that time he was leaving things too much to others. If God gives a man a place, he should not leave that place, but stand to it; so it says of Josiah, "the king stood in his place", (@2 Chronicles 34:31). That was the salvation of the position, holding the place assigned him by God.
T.E.H. When David hearkened to the suggestions of the woman of Tekoah, was it because he had given way to Joab's artifices as chief? Joab brought Absalom back with David's consent.
J.T. Well, he had the place of chief, but was losing ground with the king, and hence acts in the role of politician, which brings out the kind of man Joab was. He would gain favour with David by urging Absalom's return, as he knew the king desired this. All these incidents are to lay bare the weakness of the position from chapter 12 onwards; typically, the great weakness of Christendom today. The responsible element was weak, and that is what is now apparent; antichrist, political manoeuvres, and the like. Joab did not care for Absalom a bit, but he knew what David's mind was towards him, and ingratiated himself with the king. What the Spirit of God portrays to us is, that the whole position was weak, and this battle was the outcome, with losses that were unnecessarily great. The battles in chapter 8 were very different; they were discriminating; everything that was of God was preserved and no life unnecessarily lost.
W.G.T. Joab and Absalom were both bad elements; Joab was on the side of David, but nevertheless he was not a help to him.
J.T. Quite so. You may be on the right side outwardly, yet still be very wrong. That is what is exposed here.
{423}
F.L. Did not God use what was available when Joab slew Absalom with the three spears?
J.T. It was thoroughly done, but you see how ruthless he was. You often see that men who are spared in one conflict come into judgment in the next one. Joab was a hard man. He ought to have shown some sympathy with the king. He could easily have done less than he did, and yet Absalom would have been righteously dealt with, but he would not stop to speak to a reasoning man who had told him of Absalom's plight. The soldier reminded Joab of what the king had said. He had respect for the king, but Joab had not. The facts are mentioned so as to expose the character of Joab. The subject spirit in the man who spoke to him should have rebuked him.
A.N.W. Joab and his brothers were too hard for David. He said, when Abishai would have slain Shimei, "What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?"
J.T. God does not like severity in this sense. It may be right abstractly, the object of it may deserve it; God does not act speedily in such cases, but will make His mind known in time.
A.P. How do you regard the ten young men who were Joab's armour-bearers?
J.T. You never hear of David's armour-bearers, but Joab was marked in this way. Ordinarily a Levite goes on his own initiative. Of course, two are better than one, and we have the instance of "Paul and his company", which is very special. It was companionship, adding strength to the position, and was suitable in such a servant.
G.MacP. Is the point for us to learn to adhere to the king's commandment?
J.T. Yes; I think Joab was exposed. While it was well that Absalom was killed, if a murderer is lynched he deserves it, but the lynchers are *breaking*
{424}
*the law*. That must be borne in mind. In exercising discipline in the assembly, we must keep to the law governing it. God is concerned about the law, and that is where Joab failed. The man who saw Absalom hanging in the terebinth said, the king said "Take care ... of the young man Absalom ... and thou wouldest have set thyself against me" had I gone contrary to it. He was a man with a conscience.
A.P.T. Paul says to the Corinthians, "What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and in a spirit of meekness?" (@1 Corinthians 4:21). In his instructions in chapter 5 he shows that he did not want to get rid of the wicked man. He wanted to apply the principles we have been speaking of, not only to subjugate him, but to hold him for God.
J.T. That his spirit might be saved, but Joab never had any thought like that. The saving of a man's spirit did not mark his warfare.
A.R. In the reign of peace under Solomon, Joab could have no part.
J.T. That is what comes out. Everything is adjusted in the beginning of Kings; all these adverse elements meet their right judgment. They cannot enter into the reign of peace. So we must judge as before God as to principles, and thus qualify for the coming reign of peace.
A.Pf. Would you put the wars in chapter 18 in the same class as the war in chapter 8?
J.T. No, I would not. The wars of chapter 8 are for the subjugation of the nations; as the gospel today is for the obedience of faith among the nations, to take out of them a people for God; and so the great wars in the introduction of the millennium will be for the subjugation of the nations, so that all the saved nations shall enter into eternal life -- "the righteous into life eternal", (@Matthew 25:46). The idea is that what is of God will be preserved and blessed. He is taking out a people from them now; by and
{425}
by the *nations* will be saved. In @2 Samuel 18 it is war amongst ourselves. A rebellion amongst the people of God is in mind, a most humiliating thing and the state of Christendom in type. Antichristian principles have been allowed to enter.
A.R. Would you make a difference between David in chapter 8 and in chapter 18?
J.T. A great difference; in that his power according to the latter is greatly diminished, and natural feelings largely rule. Chapter 8 is more what marked the beginning of the history of the gospel. Chapter 18 portrays the present state of Christendom.
A.P. How do you apply the destroying of the people by the forest, to Christendom today?
J.T. It was the bad choice of the battle-ground; uncertain and conflicting motives and actions are illustrated in this. To make your way in such circumstances is extremely difficult. In Christendom today one is hedged in by motives, principles, and methods.
F.L. Would you get the idea in Christian men crusading, in the name of Christ, against crime, prohibition, and all that kind of thing? They are on the wrong battle-ground.
J.T. And many Christians are damaged.
G.V.D. Would the conflict being spread over the face of the country suggest that it was outside of divine principles?
J.T. That is right. It was not regulated by right principles, by proper generalship. The Lord is a Man of war, and never lets things get out of hand. Ordinarily David would not have acted in this way.
F.L. What about David's men?
J.T. Well, I thought they are the outcome of the skill and influence which David represents. They are distinctive in war and leadership. The principle is, I think, that we take on the character of David (i.e., Christ). David's mighty men were a motley
{426}
lot, as @1 Samuel 22 tells us, but he "became a captain over them", and they learned under his influence. They saw objectively in him true military skill and instinct, and withal a gracious spirit. Chronicles gives a list of the mighties, at the outset of his reign; as much as to say, Before we tell you about this great man, we will show you the effect of his influence upon his mighty men. Here we have them at the end of his reign, but they are in general the same persons; that is to say, you see in a man in his local meeting, or wherever he ministers or serves, what are the results of his service.
F.L. @Philippians 2 gives a suggestion for the training of these men. Paul speaks of Timotheus and Epaphroditus as having Christ's impress upon them.
J.T. Philippians above all epistles is intended to bring out the features of those who come under Christ; what men they were. Of course @Romans 16 gives us a striking list of persons, too, and so do Colossians and Ephesians; but Philippians is special. Take Epaphroditus: he is sick, and a sick man usually expects people to see him and be sympathetic with him. If he is not spiritual, he is likely to complain; whereas Epaphroditus says, I am not thinking of myself at all, but of the Philippians, for as hearing of my sickness, they will suffer on my account. And then Paul had no one like Timotheus, who cared with genuine feeling how the saints got on.
A.N.W. Referring to @Romans 16, from where did all those worthies get their features? Do you suppose they got them through Paul?
J.T. Well, he knew them all by name. Each had a distinguishing trait of Christ. It was a fine ability to be able to speak about so many and to say the right thing about each of them. What distinguished each was the Spirit of Christ, and they were all worthy of his salutations.
{427}
F.L. Priscilla and Aquila met Paul in Corinth. They would be typical of the others.
J.T. Exactly; they saw much of him there, and they staked their neck for him.
A.P. There is evidently order in the mention of these distinguished ones here.
J.T. I think so. The first is Joseb-Bassebeth, he was chief of the captains; he has great distinction. He fought against eight hundred slain by him. He did not beat the air. He knew how to use his weapon. He fought against eight hundred and did not miss a man -- "slain by him at one time". It is not that he slew eight hundred out of a larger number, but he slew *all* against whom he fought.
F.H.L. It does not mention who the eight hundred were. Taking character from David, Joseb-Bassebeth could meet any enemy.
J.T. That is right. He slew them all; he did not let a man slip. The great prowess of these men is stressed, and also how thorough they were. We do not know what these enemies were, but we may be sure they were real ones.
F.H.L. It speaks specifically of the Philistines afterwards.
A.P.T. Do you think there have been mighty men throughout the history of the assembly since the Lord ascended on high?
J.T. I think that is what is in mind. It may be assumed that they appeared at the outset only, but the Spirit of God balances things. He mentions these men at the beginning of David's reign in Chronicles, and mentions them here at the end; making reference, I think, to what Christ has effected throughout the whole history of the dispensation.
A.P. The plot of lentiles is not a big thing; it would come down to our times, would it not?
J.T. Yes, it was something defined. The people had fled, but Shammah stood in the midst of the
{428}
plot and delivered it. Lentiles would be food, and the plot was *full* of them. Next we have the beautiful tribute to the three chiefs at Bethlehem. The chapter says, "David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate!" In response to this, "the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate". I believe this may apply to the end. It is a question of the longings of Christ when that which He values is in the enemy's hands. He knows where it is: "The Lord knows those that are his",(@2 Timothy 2:19). He knows where they are. It is a question of breaking through to secure what He longs for.
F.L. This brings into evidence the power of responsive love; knowing what David wanted and going for it, regardless of consequences, because they loved him.
J.T. I think the revival of the truth of Christ as Head of the assembly, His body, opens the door for this sort of mightiness. It was collective; the three of the thirty chiefs act together. It was not with intent to destroy anybody; they simply *broke through* to get what David so earnestly desired.
A.N.W. I was thinking that one of the salient features of their devotedness was their unity of action. It is a great test for us.
A.P.T. Some of us were speaking recently about getting people in to hear the gospel. One wonders if the lack with us is, that we do not "break through". The Lord Jesus wants to get people out to hear; are we not cowardly in inviting people?
J.T. That is a challenge. The thing is to get what the Lord desires. We know what He wants. It is a matter of understanding here. It says, "David was then in the stronghold; and the Philistines garrison was then at Bethlehem. And David longed,
{429}
and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate". The position is clear and his longings are understood. "And the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate". No doubt there were other wells in the vicinity, but it was this one that David designated. These three drew the water, "took it, and brought it to David". What a mighty exploit that was! They reached the well and got back again! They broke through going and coming, but nothing is said of anybody being slain. The point is, getting what the Lord wants and bringing it to Him.
A.P. Would not this define a principle in present-day movements? It is not the setting of the world right religiously, but meeting Christ's desires. Is not that our position today?
J.T. Yes; we are not overthrowing human institutions; it is getting what Christ wants out of them. The seal is on the foundation, "The Lord knows those that are his"; and "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", (@2 Timothy 2:19). If you get them to withdraw from iniquity, you have broken through. And then David, being priest, has now something to offer. The conflict affords him this, so that the passage says, "however he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah. And he said, Be it far from me, Jehovah, that I should do this thing! is it not the blood of the men that went at the risk of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men". We may transfer David's act to the Lord as serving in the assembly; He has that whereof to offer. He takes up the fruits of our spiritual exploits and presents them to God.
A.R. It was a drink offering.
{430}
C.A.M. David appreciated the willingness of those men to give up their lives.
J.T. Yes; Paul speaks of being "poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration" of the faith of the Philippians. That was the attitude of these mighty men; there was thus something offered to God. You hardly get a passage in relation to David so beautiful as this; the longings of his heart and the wonderful answer to them in these three men, and then David as priest taking all that and presenting it to God. It is a fine tribute to come in at the end of the dispensation.
T.E.H. Is a similar idea seen in @Romans 15:16? Paul speaks there of "carrying on as a sacrificial service the message of glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit".
J.T. That enters into what is before us here. Many of us have never thought that the Lord is offering us up; that we are taken out of the nations to this end. I believe this feature is to mark the end of these our days -- offering up, however little, in a priestly way, the product of the work of God as the people of God.
{431}
THE WARS OF THE LORD (11)
@2 Chronicles 10:6 - 15; @2 Chronicles 13:4 - 12; @2 Chronicles 14:8 - 15; @Isaiah 37:14 - 25, 30 - 32
J.T. The ground to be covered is extensive and we would do well to pay particular attention in following the scriptures read, so as to see the connection throughout, leading up to conflict in relation to the *remnant*. The first scripture deals with a *division* amongst the people of God and conflict arising from that cause. Therefore the government of God enters into it peculiarly, causing humiliation that there should be such a condition of things at all. So that what is to be learned is the need, under those circumstances, of taking counsel. Solomon himself had advised in the Proverbs that they were to make war with good advice and his son fails in this at the outset. He had rightly asked advice from the old men at first, but then consulted with the young men that stood before him, and followed their counsel to subsequent disaster.
C.A.M. Are you looking at Rehoboam's unfavourable position as illustrating church history generally, or at the way it would work out at the present moment?
J.T. It marks the present time amongst those who have part in the great recovery. This sort of thing has, alas, marked the history, and we do well now to see how such a contingency, if it ever does arise, is to be met. A brother with light and ability may go forward without taking counsel, whereas war is to be entered upon "with good advice". War was pending at this time, and was only averted by God's direct intervention. Division took place, however, and conflict was there, but the principles involved had not fully come to light. They came to
{432}
light under Abijah, the next king, as we shall see. He was able to call attention to the principles, so we may see more clearly what Jeroboam and his supporters stood for, and what Rehoboam stood for. That was why I thought Abijah's features should be particularly before us, because his address (chapter 13) opens up in a very precise and intelligent way, the evil on one side and the good on the other; as showing in the latter that God was with the house of David.
A.N.W. Would you make it a little clearer as to what this group of old men would stand for in our day?
J.T. What is said is: "And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived". That they had stood before Solomon gave them a place of importance that no others had in regard to the matter in hand. They had stood before a man possessed of the greatest wisdom. You would regard one who has had to do with wisdom, seeing it exercised in Christ, as worthy of being consulted. Joseph taught Pharaoh's senators wisdom, and those who have had to do with the Lord in exercising the government of God acquire great experience in wisdom. "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth", the Lord said, (@Matthew 28:18). Solomon's name signifies "peace", and his reign was marked by peace, and therefore these old men, characteristically, would be sons of peace. Such are the men to rely upon for advice, now that the kingdom was transferred to Rehoboam.
J.H.E. Would this rising up of the people be like that which will happen at the end of the millennium?
J.T. This is God dealing governmentally with the house of David. Jeroboam's immediate movements were the outcome of Rehoboam's want of wisdom. There were deeper motives, of course, and God had
{433}
intended this change in His government; but the passage calls attention to the want of wisdom in the responsible man. What you allude to demonstrates the utter incorrigibility of man in the flesh, and that rebellion will be of a worse character than the rebellion of Jeroboam.
W.G.T. The people had an able spokesman in Jeroboam.
J.T. They had, but Rehoboam had the matter in his hands according to the facts presented; and what happened was to show what may be the outcome of want of wisdom in those who are responsible.
A.R. The old men knew Solomon and also the people; whereas the young men knew neither.
J.T. Quite so; they were wanting in experience. The passage says, "But he forsook the advice of the old men which they had given him, and consulted with the young men, who had grown up with him, that stood before him". They were brought up with *him*, and stood before *him*. What a lack of balance through pride! Rehoboam is not presented to us as a man of wisdom, whereas Solomon is. Solomon was a man that God loved from his birth; his name "Jedidiah" meant this. The name given him by David was "Solomon", meaning that he was a man of peace, and that is a great matter in having to do with warlike conditions -- for this, sons of peace are needed.
W.G.T. Rehoboam's government would result in bondage.
J.T. Quite so. The young men advised the rigour of Solomon's reign, and would *increase* it.
C.A.M. It would seem that Rehoboam was forcing a rebellious condition by disregarding what was of God in the past. Is that how you look at it?
J.T. Exactly. Solomon represents much. He was a counterpart of David and had *specially asked* God for "an understanding heart to judge thy
{434}
people, to discern between good and bad". Jehovah commends him for it, and gives it to him, but what a difference between him and Rehoboam! Those who stood before Solomon had an opportunity to observe the operation of the wisdom that God had given to him. We have no such facts credited to Rehoboam, and yet he accepted the advice of the young men who were brought up with him and stood before him. Anybody can see that the choice of *counsel* should have been that of the old men.
J.S. Rehoboam was really moving on party lines, choosing young men like himself.
F.L. The prophet seems to speak to "Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Go not up, nor fight with your brethren; return every man to his house, for this thing is from me", (chapter 11:3,4). God overruled to prevent further disaster.
A.F.M. Rehoboam had the advantage of his father's advice and wisdom in general and he himself was a man over forty, yet he failed disastrously.
J.T. I think he had the character of a novice. If one is a novice, knows it, and bows, acknowledging his weakness as Solomon himself had done at the outset, God honours him. When Solomon was a young man, he says, "I know not to go out and to come in", (@1 Kings 3:7). God honoured that and gave him wisdom. Rehoboam was a novice and did not admit it. He chose men of his own kind, and really, as you say, was a partisan in that sense.
J.S. He disregards the elders.
J.T. I think that is the lesson; and *such* elders! We see in the book of Judges how important it is to respect those who have been associated with men whom God uses to lead His people; "the elders that outlived Joshua" helped Israel to serve Jehovah. One great thought of God is to carry forward His
{435}
principles; there may be new ones, but the old ones are not discarded; divine principles never cease to have force.
J.S. So with Timothy, he was familiar with Paul's ways as they are in Christ.
J.T. Paul said to Timothy: "thou hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith", etc.; (@2 Timothy 3:10). He was a very good example for Timothy, and was to carry forward what he had seen in the apostle.
A.R.S. How do you account for Rehoboam being brought up by Solomon, and seeing all the glory of his father's kingdom, yet acting in this way?
J.T. I think he made *himself* the centre instead of following out the wisdom seen in his father's kingdom, and these young men who were brought up with him stood before him. What an exposure as to lack of wisdom and discretion all this was!
A.B.P. Is that not similar to @Luke 15:29 where the elder son says to the father, "that I might make merry with *my* friends"?
J.T. Just so. He had his own coterie of friends aside from his father. You see it in Job's sons, they made a feast in their elder brother's house; their father was not present; they could carry on well enough without him, but the wind came and destroyed the house.
W.G.T. At the end of the chapter he sends the man that was "over the levy". The people could hardly be expected to accept such a man under those circumstances.
J.T. Quite so. It was as much as to say, This man knows the power of the army. It is somewhat a Philistine thought. Abimelech came with the captain of his army to Abraham. The children of Israel stoned Hadoram. What was needed was a son of peace.
C.A.M. I suppose if we were to approach anything
{436}
threatening division we have to observe previous history.
J.T. That is exactly what comes into evidence first of all here -- Rehoboam's failure. Jeroboam is left for a *later* exposure. His failure was deeper; it is really rebellious, but it is not in evidence at first. We come to that under the next king -- Abijah. He exposes what is in Jeroboam, and makes plain that he shall not escape. That has marked all the sorrowful divisions; if we wait, time will show where the real evil is.
F.L. You were saying the great matter is principle. I was thinking of Jeroboam and those with him; they had certain right. Rehoboam was wrong, and in the great events that have caused sorrow in the church, divisions, etc., very often there has been a genuine cause of trouble, but God always supports that which is based on right principles. The history of the ten tribes, beginning with Jeroboam, was ever a declining one; although, numerically, they were by far the largest portion of the nation.
J.T. There was not a good king in the whole list. Of Abijah the son of Jeroboam, in @1 Kings 14, it is said that something good toward Jehovah was found in him; but he was removed governmentally, and Jeroboam's ignominious end is announced at the same time. God exposed the roots of the movement under him, and although right principles were with Rehoboam, he fails at first in not taking the advice of the old men.
R.D.G. In their answer the old men did not admit the charge against Solomon, that his rule was severe; whereas the young men do admit it.
J.T. The old men did not refer to it. All they say is, "If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever". Kindness applies at all
{437}
times. Hard words never accomplish much, but "good words" are always wise.
F.H.L. It had the blessing of both parties in view. Both the king and the people would be blessed, had the advice of the old men been taken.
J.T. It was advice of sons of peace. The old men understood something about peace; they had stood before the man of peace and their advice would be according to that.
T.H. The character of these men would be reflected in the comments of the queen of Sheba: "Happy are thy men! happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom!" (@1 Kings 10:8).
J.T. Yes; they would reflect something of Solomon, whose administration was marked by peace. Generally speaking, war should have peace in view.
A.B.P. You could almost say they were quoting one of Solomon's proverbs, "A soft answer turneth away fury", (chapter 15:1).
J.T. Quite so. The book of Proverbs should have been studied by Rehoboam; indeed, it is addressed to him; it is "my son" almost throughout. We are translated "into the kingdom of the Son of his love", (@Colossians 1:13), and stand before Him.
When you come to Abijah, you see how the truth works out. Chapter 13 says: "In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. And Abijah began the war with an army of men of war, four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty men of valour". Jeroboam had the numerical strength, and this leads Abijah to make very important
{438}
remarks as to the whole position. He is seen on the top of a mountain, which would mean moral elevation. Jotham (@Judges 9) making a speech of this kind, stood on mount Gerizim. Abijah says, "Hear me, Jeroboam, and all Israel! Ought ye not to know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever ... ?" He is touching important truth, because it runs through Scripture that the kingdom over Israel was given "to David for ever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord". That is the truth. And then Abijah goes on to say, "And now ye think to show yourselves strong against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David". I think that is a very fine statement; he has the truth of the "kingdom of Jehovah". Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah. There is such a thing as that today: to bring out *what really is involved* in the histories of the divisions that have occurred amongst the saints; the kingdom of God existing in the hands in which it was intended to be. Are there not such people in the world? That is the point to consider. And that is what Abijah is saying here, and so it goes on to say, "and ye are a great multitude, and ye have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods". What we see is that Jeroboam is *exposed*. He was an idolator. He had set up idolatry, and now the time has come to expose the whole matter and to show where God is, and with whom He is. This is a matter of immense importance in divine warfare.
J.T.Jr. Is that why the priests and Levites are emphasised here -- to show the real thought of the kingdom?
J.T. Yes; they represent the spiritual side of the position and maintain what is for God. How beautifully
{439}
the matter is stated by Abijah! He says, "Have ye not cast out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests as the peoples of the lands? ... Children of Israel, do not fight with Jehovah the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper". Abijah's speech throughout is most striking. It brings out where God is and His service; the priests, the sons of Aaron and the Levites are brought in. Thus the issue in the conflict is made clear, and also what a priestly heart this man had.
C.A.M. It well fits into Chronicles. It is not recorded elsewhere.
J.T. That is the thought in Chronicles, the spiritual line in the house of David.
A.P. Abijah not only meets the situation with what is negative, but with what is positive.
J.T. Jeroboam is exposed; that is what the Spirit of God brings out. So in all the divisions and conflicts for the truth -- in time all comes to light: what God has been and with whom He has been throughout.
F.L. Whether the headship of Christ, the order of the house of God, or other elements of the truth, all comes out.
C.A.M. If Jeroboam fights after this, there is no excuse for him. I suppose, if things are stated in a priestly way, there should be no fighting.
J.T. Quite so. Here Jeroboam is fighting against Jehovah. Abijah makes it very clear that it is not a partisan matter. The point is, the kingdom is Jehovah's; today, it is the kingdom of God.
J.T.Jr. The Levites are at their work. Is that not so today?
J.T. The point here is, that the service of God is not held theoretically, but is in progress, and each one is in his own place and active.
A.F.M. Is Abijah a true son of Solomon?
{440}
J.T. I think he is really more a son of David; he is a priest. David represents the priesthood as king. He danced before the ark with all his might. Solomon acted as priest, too, but not as David did.
W.G.T. It says of Rehoboam that he was young and faint-hearted. He did not have the courage of David.
A.P.T. The apostle says in 1 Corinthians that the kingdom of God is not in word but in power. I was wondering whether that was setting forth the thing in moral greatness, like Abijah before he went into conflict with Jeroboam.
J.T. The service of God went on, and that is a great matter.
J.S. Abijah sets forth the position clearly; "for *we* keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but *ye* have forsaken him".
J.T. Yes, and he says further, "And behold, we have God with us at our head", -- the very words of David. David said, "thou art exalted as head above all", (@1 Chronicles 29:11).
A.P. Would you say too, in view of the priests and the sons of Levi coming into prominence, that they were not on partisan lines?
J.T. The whole position is that; it is not partisan. It is a question of Jehovah's kingdom and Jehovah's service. As David said, "Carry back the ark of God into the city". He recognised the divine centre, although for the moment he was driven out; (@2 Samuel 15).
G.McP. We spoke of idolatry in Jeroboam's kingdom and it has entered into Christendom. The spirit of idolatry was coming in at Corinth; the apostle says, "there are gods many, and lords many, yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ", (@1 Corinthians 8:5,6).
W.G.T. Abijah in his address preserves the whole position of Israel as before God.
{441}
J.T. Quite so. But Jeroboam refused to listen; instead of taking it to heart, he "caused an ambush to come about behind them; and they were before Judah, and the ambush behind them. And Judah looked back, and behold, they had the battle in front and behind", (chapter 13:13,14). Jeroboam had *numbers*, and would rely on them, refusing the word of God. There are those who make much of numbers. The clearest truth may be set before them, but they pay no attention to it. They just go on and regard those that have it as enemies, and attack them before and behind. We have experienced something like that. "And Judah looked back, and behold, they had the battle in front and behind; and they cried to Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets", (verse 14). That is the way to meet those who trust in numbers and military skill: sound out the testimony. When Jericho was taken, the priests sounded the trumpets. The overthrow of opposition is in dependence on God and the clear sounding out of His testimony.
J.S. Human strategy is a poor thing in spiritual things.
J.T. I think that what is seen here is excellent, and serves as instruction for the present time. "And they cried to Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. And the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand", (verses 14 - 16). I think that is the lesson, to maintain the position as divinely ordered, and in prayer, sound out the testimony in a spiritual way; and God will come in for us.
A.P.T. Does this fit in with @Numbers 10?
J.T. Yes, as to the trumpets. You can see how intelligent they were here. The men of Judah
{442}
shouted, as at the capture of Jericho, and the trumpets sounded; they followed a spiritual example. In @Numbers 10 the priests were to blow the trumpets when the enemy attacked.
F.L. I was thinking of Daniel in captivity, (chapter 9); what an acknowledgment he makes of the state of Israel at that time.
J.T. He is addressed as "greatly beloved". When he began to pray, heaven began to move towards him.
A.R. Would this suggest that in all conflicts you look for the priestly element taking on the responsibility?
J.T. Yes. We get back to what God inaugurated, because, after all, that is the testimony; and the shout here, I think, is fully discerning that God was with Judah. There *must* be victory. Victory is anticipated in the shout.
F.L. It is a remarkable thing about Daniel that he was one against whom failure is not recorded, yet he is identified with what the people were. He had the spirit of Christ.
J.T. His part in chapter 2:17 - 23 and chapter 9 coincides with what is before us here. He and his companions waited on God, and God came in for them. Here Abijah calls attention to the divine institution and that *it was operative*.
A.P. Evidently all the men of Judah were brought into it as well as the elders. Would that fall in with the assembly meeting, the people of God *all* being brought into any judgment reached?
J.T. The men of Judah, I suppose, are characteristic. Judah is coming into his place. When the division took place, the whole position of Judah and the house of David was greatly beclouded; but as time went on, the truth came out that God was with Judah; he has a great place here.
F.H.L. Abijah refers to Jeroboam's army as "children of Israel".
{443}
J.T. He *appeals* to them, I think, in a touching way. We ought to be able to address our brethren, however antagonistic, in a similar way; for after all, they belong to God. Abijah is not partisan; he is not stressing Judah in that sense; it is the children of Israel.
A.N.W. "Hear me, Jeroboam, and all Israel!"
F.H.L. He says "we", but ends up with "children of Israel!"
J.T. "Do not fight with Jehovah the God of *your* fathers". He gives them full credit for being children of Israel, although they are opposed to him.
A.J.D. This address is like the apostle writing to the Corinthians, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" (@1 Corinthians 10:22).
A.R. Is the blowing of the trumpets to meet the rights of God among His people?
J.T. Yes, it is the assertion of His rights.
J.H.E. Would you not see that in Peter, in addressing them in Jerusalem? The result was that three thousand souls were added.
J.T. Yes. He addressed them as "men of Israel".
A.MacD. @1 Samuel 4 also speaks of Israel shouting with a great shout, but in that instance they were overcome by the Philistines. How should we view that?
J.T. They were trusting in the symbol instead of God; they carried the ark into the camp, as if the outward symbol would save them, but the moral state, which should go with it, was lacking with them. Symbols, unless accompanied by the state of soul in keeping with them, cannot be relied upon for the presence and help of God.
A.N.W. Here they cried to Jehovah and they blew the trumpets and shouted -- a remarkable combination, bringing God in.
{444}
A.F.M. And God delivered Jeroboam's host into their hand. "And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter; and there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men"; later the passage says, "And Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and Jehovah smote him, and he died", (verse 20). In addition to the victory, Jeroboam fell under God's stroke and died.
A.B.P. Would Abijah's confidence here be based upon the covenant of salt to which he refers?
J.T. Yes; it is incorruptible, and therefore is an abiding covenant.
J.S. The result of the victory here is that certain cities are captured with their dependent villages. What would you say about that?
J.T. Territory is acquired. "And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him: Bethel with its dependent villages, and Jeshanah with its dependent villages, and Ephron with its dependent villages", (verse 19). There is recovered territory, especially *Bethel*.
Perhaps we may now look at Asa for a moment. It is a question here not only of thousands but a *million* in the field against Judah. "And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, it maketh no difference to thee to help, whether there be much or no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for we rely on thee, and in thy name have we come against this multitude. Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee", (chapter 14:11). That is a most suitable prayer. He stresses "our God". God loves that. It is another feature. I believe every one of those conflicts bring out a new feature, and God loves to be made much of by His people.
J.S. And man made little of.
J.T. Yes; when we come together we speak of Christ and His walk here, which is beautiful and right, but God loves to be made much of *Himself*,
{445}
and that is what Asa does here. He says, "Jehovah our God".
A.N.W. Is it greater to say, "our God", than "our fathers God"?
J.T. I think so; it indicates a *present* knowledge and appreciation of God, as in Hebrews, "our God".
C.A.M. This book seems to run parallel with Luke's gospel, making much of prayers and priestly exercises.
J.T. The first book of Chronicles is much like Luke in that it links the testimony from *Adam* onwards; and then you get "the course of Abia" in the beginning of Luke, which is from 1 Chronicles -- it is a spiritual touch. Chronicles has a great place for David; in Luke Paul is in view.
J.S. In Luke the disciples are sent out as messengers of peace.
J.T. Quite so; and they are to look for sons of peace wherever they go.
A.P. What would you say about the removal of idolatry internally in Judah; (verses 2,3)?
J.T. "And Asa did what was good and right in the sight of Jehovah, his God; and he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places, and broke the columns, and cut down the Asherahs; and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to practise the law and the commandment. And he removed out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images; and the kingdom was quiet before him", (verses 2 - 5). That was all very important, and emphasises what we have been saying, that Jehovah, as Asa says, was "his God", and again, "help us, O Jehovah our God", and again "thou art our God".
F.L. There is a very touching link with what you are saying in the time of Jehoshaphat. It reads, "Our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might in presence of this great company which
{446}
cometh against us, neither know we what to do; but our eyes are upon thee! And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their sons", (@2 Chronicles 20:12,13).
J.T. Chapter 14 goes on to say, "Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah". A million men are destroyed, showing that numbers are nothing when God has His place. It rebukes the idea of mere numbers, although, of course, we rejoice in numbers of real saints, "those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", (@2 Timothy 2:19).
J.T.Jr. Is that the test of faith, that Ethiopia's host represents what man is naturally before God?
J.T. Quite so, a boasting of the numbers they can bring into the field.
J.T.Jr. The Ethiopians are completely overthrown.
A.B.P. It says, "they were crushed before Jehovah and before his army".
J.T. I think that is an important point to bring out. We had Jehovah's kingdom, and now we have His army; showing how completely He is identified with His people.
To go on further -- in the next chapter we have prophecy through Azariah coming in after the victory, encouraging us with regard to our meetings for "ministry". There ought to be room for the mind of God at all times coming in among us. God comes in at all times, if we are open for it, with a word in regard to any current difficulty. It says, "And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded. And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you while ye are with him; and if ye seek him he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him he will forsake you ... And they sacrificed to Jehovah in that day, of the spoil that they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep", (verses 1 - 11). I think that is a great point. These
{447}
ministry meetings are of great importance if we make right use of them. God will bring in something to help us as to all matters and to confirm us in what is right. The word of Azariah was confirmatory to Asa and it was calculated to continue the result of the victory, that the gain of it should be permanent.
J.S. And many were recovered.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. From beyond the borders of Judah many are recovered. Largely that is the thing to keep before us that our brethren should be recovered to the truth. "They fell away to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him", (verse 9).
Ques. Is this like 2 Timothy -- departing from iniquity and following righteousness?
J.T. Yes. That is the only way of recovery. "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". "And pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", (@2 Timothy 2:19,22).
The point suggested in chapter 14 is to make room for prophetic ministry. The prophet comes in after the victory to consolidate it, so that God might get His portion, which He did, as the chapter shows.
G.McP. It says they "returned to Jerusalem".
J.T. Yes, that is the centre. We must now go on to the last scripture to show how the *remnant* comes into conflict and victory. It is a great subject: Isaiah, of all the prophets, brings in the remnant. He it is whose son's name signified "a remnant shall return" and it comes out under this king: Hezekiah himself sends to Isaiah saying, "Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left" (@Isaiah 37:4), as much as to say that Isaiah will understand the meaning of that. His is the leading prophetic book, and it is very significant that it makes so much of the remnant. "A remnant shall return" is the
{448}
key. Every Christian should be in the returned remnant.
J.S. Isaiah makes so much of Christ personally by the Spirit.
C.A.M. In him prophetic and priestly services are combined. Prayer is prominent in the chapter read.
J.T. Yes. Hezekiah knew Isaiah and said to him, "lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left"; and the answer is magnificent: "And this shall be the sign unto thee: there shall be eaten this year such as groweth of itself; and in the second year that which springeth of the same; but in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward; for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that escape: the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall do this".
A.P. Historically, when does that take place?
J.T. It is a great general thought that in the remnant there is no result aside from this principle of taking root downward and bearing fruit upward.
The message from Isaiah begins at verse 21. Before that we have Hezekiah's action in going to the house of Jehovah as he received Sennacherib's letter: "And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah ... saying ... hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God". That was his prayer. Then it says in verse 21, "And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: ..". (verses 21 - 35). We see in all this the place that the remnant has, and how the fact that only a remnant existed does not interfere with the working out of the divine thought in Zion and Jerusalem.
{449}
The principles involved in them were unconquered. The daughter of Zion laughed to scorn the enemy, and the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head at him. The great principles of God set out in them cannot be overcome. However few may be attached to them they stand. The enemy himself had spoken about that. He says, I will give you two thousand horses if you can find riders for them. That is the point the enemy is making, the fewness of those that are identified with divine principles, but faith says to him that the whole power of God is behind Zion.
F.L. "Fear not, little flock, for it has been the good pleasure of your Father to give you the kingdom", (@Luke 12:32). That is the principle.
J.T. That is the idea. We are going on with eternal principles, and they are indestructible and unconquerable. Our safety lies in being attached to them and standing by them. Hezekiah says, Thou art "the Same". He uses the oft-repeated title conveying God's unchangeableness.
A.P.T. There is no change with God, so there should be no change in the characteristics of the remnant.
J.T. God is the Same, and the truth is the same, and the principles are the same, and our safety lies in embracing them and abiding by them.
E.S. Hezekiah gets his answer from the prophet.
J.T. God honours the prophet. He has those through whom He speaks. It is our wisdom to perceive and know them and pay attention to them. God could have spoken to Hezekiah, but he is stressing the idea of the prophet. Meetings for prophecy, I think, are a great matter in these last days. We are constantly needing the mind of God in matters that are frequently coming up.
A.P.T. It is not simply to hear two or three brothers speak.
J.T. It is a question of the word of God.
{450}
R.W.S. Verses 31 and 32 speak of taking root; what does that allude to?
J.T. "And this shall be the sign unto thee: there shall be eaten this year such as groweth of itself; and in the second year that which springeth of the same; but in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof". In the first year, there is nothing in the way of order or skill. It is nature itself, and the second year is that which springeth of the same, what comes up from the uncultivated crop of the first year. But in the third year you come to the divine thought. There you have skilful cultivation. It says, "sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof". That is, there is husbandry, as Paul alludes to it, "ye are God's husbandry", (@1 Corinthians 3:9). The saints coming under divine order and authority and principles are God's husbandry, and thus you have food properly produced. Spiritually, it is ministry intelligently presented with a view to a desired result. But the first two years are left open; it is what nature itself produces in spite of conditions and without agricultural skill.
J.S. The growth is first seen taking root downward, not what is displayed, but yet according to the order of God.
J.T. Yes, it is the order of God that enters into the third year; that is, the remnant has now come under the order of God. It is God's husbandry.
A.R. Bearing fruit upward suggests full development, I suppose. God immediately says that out of Jerusalem shall come forth a remnant, as if it is going forth from that centre now.
J.T. I think the allusion is to divine principles taking form in the energy of life. However few there are in the remnant, there is reality, and thus there are results for God.
W.G.T. Would the third year suggest finality;
{451}
that is, what God has produced at the end in the remnant?
J.T. Yes, it is completed exercise. The result intended is the third year. And what may be observed now is complete annihilation of the enemy, one hundred and eighty-five thousand are smitten at once. That is what God does, but He also brings out all these great and beautiful thoughts in Isaiah and Hezekiah and the saints.
C.A.M. These are far more important than doing away with Sennacherib's army.
J.T. God is working out His thoughts in His people. He allows difficulties to continue for some time without settlement, so that the saints may all be brought into the understanding of the principles that govern them. I believe the third year implies that.
J.H.E. Paul was three years in Arabia; but then he took root downward and bore fruit upward.
F.L. In the recovery of 2 Chronicles, do you see any analogy to the seven assemblies in Revelation?
J.T. I have no doubt there is. Certain features in the revivals in the reigns of Hezekiah and Josiah correspond with Philadelphia.
{452}
DIVINE MEASUREMENT
@Revelation 11:1,2; @Revelation 21:15 - 17
I was thinking of *measure*, but particularly in regard of substance. As you know, there is long measure, square measure, and cubic measure. These are not only in use among men, but they are also used by God, the last involving substance. Cubic measure must involve that in some sense. So I was encouraged to call attention to these scriptures in the book of Revelation which anticipate the full divine result. This is not determined by square or long measure, but by cubic measure.
Thus we are reminded that God looks for substance in His people. He will have it, as we see in the measurement in the passage last read. What He is determined to have in the future, He surely would have now. So you find that in the Proverbs wisdom enters into these things peculiarly, for all divine measurements are in wisdom; indeed you could not have the great physical system that we are in aside from wisdom and the measurements and the weights that wisdom alone could determine. And I may say that whatever can be measured and weighed is not infinite. It is finite. God in Christ came into what was measured outwardly, but ever remaining what He was personally, that the infinite, eternal, omnipotent God should find a way into the finite so as to be in it; and in it in regard of measurement and in regard of very small measurement, but measurement of a solid kind. The ark of the covenant was relatively very small, the measurements of which were governed by a *half*; it was two and one-half by one and one-half by one and one-half cubits. There was in it, therefore, the witness of something more, which love would ever recognise in the presence of the Son of
{453}
God here. As John says, "The Word became flesh" (He took that condition), "and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth", (@John 1:14). He came into that compass so as to be taken account of. Wisdom designed it.
The most remarkable measurement was that of the ark; (@Exodus 25). It was to remind faith beforehand that God was coming in. Moses was already notified in the peculiar appearance to him at mount Horeb in the thorn-bush. It was something that in man's account would be extremely insignificant, and yet God was in it. It was burning, but the bush was not consumed. God could come into the most insignificant circumstances with His people, and be there according to the exigencies of His own nature. And yet the bush remained unburnt -- most extraordinary thing! Such would appeal to faith and intelligence that God could be with us in the very smallest circumstances, but according to His own nature, and yet we remain, we are not consumed. Moses says, "I will now turn aside, and see this great sight", (@Exodus 3:3). What he regarded as great was that the fire was there and the bush was not consumed, an immense fact for faith, that however severe the discipline, and it was severe throughout the wilderness, the fire burnt but Israel remained. "Our God is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12:29) -- *our* God. It is well to remember that; not simply "God", but "*our* God". The God we know who has justified us, who in love has sent Christ for us, is a consuming fire.
So we are told to serve Him "with reverence and godly fear". That corresponds with what the ark signifies and the measurements of it. The testimony was to be put in it. God says, "And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee", (@Exodus 25:16). That is to say, all the mind and glory of God was in Christ. In Him all the fulness was pleased to dwell.
{454}
Wisdom (@Proverbs 8), after speaking as to what it would do, says that it loves those that love it and that riches and honour are with it. Before it says anything as to the creation in which it had such a part, it reminds us that it loves those that love it, and that wealth is with it, "durable wealth and righteousness", for it will have no other kind of wealth. Any wealth acquired aside from righteousness is spurious, the "mammon of unrighteousness", (@Luke 16:9). Wisdom's way of acquiring and investing with wealth is in righteousness.
And then it says, "I walk in the path of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasuries", (verses 20,21). That is what wisdom does; when it comes to dealing with men, righteousness is insisted on; what substance we have must be on those lines. In fact, Wisdom has actually taken up the path of righteousness; it says, "I walk in the path of righteousness". What company we have thus in the path! You say, "The company of the saints"? Yes, but we have the company of Wisdom in the path of righteousness. The wisdom that created all these great things, of which I have been speaking, has actually come down here in Christ to "lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasuries". No one will be poor who walks in those paths; not at the side, but in the *midst* of the paths of judgment. We must not be afraid of judgment; we cannot go through this world according to God without it; it ought to reside among the saints. But I am speaking of the fact that Wisdom is there; the Lord is in those paths to cause those that love Him to inherit substance and to fill their treasuries. Every believer ought to have a treasury. A treasury in this sense is not a place into which robbers can break and steal.
{455}
The believer, instructed in the kingdom of the heavens, is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old. Where are we to get the things new and old with which we shall contribute to the wealth of our brethren, save as we are in those paths? It is right to read the Scriptures, you cannot get on without it; you cannot get on without prayer; you cannot get on without meditation; you cannot get on without the meetings. As soon as we begin to lag in regard of these things we become poor. It is sure as possible that spiritual poverty stalks in our circumstances as soon as we begin to lag in reading and prayer, and in the assembling of ourselves together. These things are essential, but, dear brethren, what is insisted on is this, that we acquire the substance that wisdom imparts as we are in the path of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment.
Well, all this enters into the book of Revelation because what is measured in chapter 21 is being built up now, acquired; it is the work of wisdom. The formation and building up of the heavenly city is the great masterpiece of wisdom, greater than anything done previously. It is to be measured by and by, and will be a perfect cube.
I wanted to go back a little so that we may see how practical this thing is. You get the principle of measurement in Romans in the most simple manner. You get it in Corinthians and Ephesians, and throughout Scripture, but you get it in @Romans 12 in a simple, practical way, and that is, What do I think about myself? What is my estimate of myself? I begin with myself in this matter. God having forgiven me, saved me, and given me the Spirit, I have now to take account of myself as a unit before Him. Paul says, "What shall I do, Lord?" (@Acts 22:10.) He became conscious of his personal responsibility to the Lord. Hence he says, "For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man
{456}
that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith", (@Romans 12: 3). That is, it is not my acquirement to start with, it is the divine measure, what God has seen fit to give me.
He is the God of measure, and He is distributing, and there is infinite variety in His realm. He has saved me and now He is distributing in measure to me, and it is my obligation to determine it. It is not a question of the amount of reading I have done, needful as reading is, but the measure of *faith* God has given me. What power have I to look at unseen things? That marks Christianity, the power to look at unseen things, to see God who is invisible. I begin to reckon on that principle of faith, not of sight. I am taken up for another world altogether, and faith is the link with that world. How much am I able to enter into it? The apostle said later, "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen", (@2 Corinthians 4:18). Thus by the Spirit I bring in here something from that world in the way of testimony. I do not go by current customs at all. As I look into that world, I see in it things that were before this world. "Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt", (@Numbers 13:22). That means that the resurrection sphere is not governed by the principle of this world. I have to look into that world, and that makes me a stranger in this world. It is not an advanced idea, it is an initial idea; I have to determine my measure, and if I do, it is very likely I shall seem very small. It is a deflating thing, not an inflating thing. Reading and the acquirement of knowledge, although necessary, is apt to be inflating, but if I measure my faith, then I begin to feel very small, and that is wholesome. It makes me dependent on God.
Then you find in the epistle to the Corinthians
{457}
another thing. It is a sort of beacon-light as a warning to us, especially to young men who aspire to serve. The Lord is looking for young men, and young women too, but if you desire to serve, in regard to this matter of measurement see that the *standard* is right. You want to serve and you should serve, and the Lord will help you in it. I have never known this to fail where one has laid himself out to serve. But the principle of measurement is what I would call your attention to. What is my standard of measurement? The Corinthians were "measuring themselves by themselves". That is the principle of this world. I am a little taller than another brother, I can speak better, I know more. That is not the idea at all, that is not the standard. "These, measuring themselves by themselves ... are not intelligent", (@2 Corinthians 10:12). It is folly to do that. The standard *is Christ*; God has His standard here for everything, whether walk, conversation, ministry, service -- Christ is His standard. Hence I do not think of the brother beside me, I think of Christ. I look at Christ's service in the gospel and I look at my service. I find I am dwarfed, but that is wholesome, and although perhaps depressing, the Lord takes one by the hand. Moses said, "Send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send", (@Exodus 4:13). He said, as it were, "I cannot speak". What a come-down for one who had been mighty in *words* in Egypt! But God would not let him go. You may be depressed, and it is wholesome in a way, if you measure yourself with Christ. But then God says, "Aaron can speak". He furnishes him with a mouth-piece.
But He further says, "I will be with thy mouth". If God is with my mouth, I shall get words. Moses proved the truth of God's promise and of what he had seen in the bush. He refers to it later, "the good will". You often hear that expression in business circles. If I have "the good will" of God in my
{458}
little business, I shall prosper, spiritually, I mean. What a good will that is! The good will of God, of Him that dwelt in the bush. I shall never fail, never be bankrupt, if I have that good will! It is the good will of Him that could come down in the smallest circumstances. Moses proved it. Moses had plenty of matter in his heart; he was not questioning that. Wonderful light had come to him about God in the bush; God revealed His name to him, "I am that I am". His heart was, no doubt, full of that precious light. God says, I will stand by your mouth, too. You can rely on God. You see how Moses prospered from that small beginning in the backside of the desert with a flock of sheep, as a shepherd tending them. God says, "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet". What an honour! And what a mighty prophet he was! As I take my proper measure, not measuring myself with others, God is with me. Christ is the standard for me. I would not be out of communion with God for anything, and certainly not in regard of His standard.
Now, coming on to the first scripture read (@Revelation 11), we have this principle of measurement introduced into circumstances such as ours. Chapter 21 is future. The prophet is directed to take a reed like a staff, which would direct the mind to a certain experience. The angel says, "Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it". Applying this to the saints, we are viewed collectively, for we are not the temple of God otherwise; and speaking of this, one does deplore the disposition of brethren to absent themselves from the meetings.
One has often thought of Lazarus. Scripture never refers to anything he *said*, but it makes a great deal of *him*. It is not a question of speaking. He is like John, the writer of the gospel, one whom Jesus loved,
{459}
and yet it does not say that he ever said anything. It is not a question of speaking, not that speaking has not its place, but it was the kind of man he was, "he whom thou lovest", (@John 11:3). It says that the Lord Jesus "six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was", (@John 12:1). He was of that place. Let us suppose he was absent -- I can hardly think of him in that way, but suppose he were absent. You can see what the situation would be in Bethany that day. The Lord came with him before Him. I should not like to be absent on such an occasion! Of course, I am not in New York tonight! I am here in the fulfilment of a certain responsibility, I hope, but it is said of Lazarus that he was *of* the place. He is of the place and he gives character to it, and so the Lord came to it in relation to *him*.
"Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was". And Lazarus was there. You must have the company for the temple. "Ye are the temple of God" (@1 Corinthians 3:16), (the saints at Corinth), meaning all the saints. I must not be absent when that is in function. It is a wonderful thought, the church is the temple of God, and so is a local meeting, at least in principle. I do not want to be away when the measuring takes place!
The next thing is the altar, that is, the principle of *giving*, the principle of sacrifice. The brethren may not know what I sacrifice. The measuring is by the Lord, and one is impressed with the poverty of our giving. We may think lightly of it, but God does not. It says, "Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury". He watched the thing.
And then there are the worshippers. I want to be there when the measuring of these is going on. Is it not most precious that there is such a thing as that in every little gathering in the world? -- God at the present time taking account accurately of the
{460}
temple, what there is going on in the way of light in the meetings, and of our sacrifices, and of the worshippers. How God delights in a little bit of worship! The Lord says, "The Father seeks such as his worshippers"; it is the persons He seeks, persons who worship. "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth", (@John 4:23,24) "The court without", the profession around, is left out; not that God does not know what is going on, but He takes no account of it, being valueless. He says, "Measure it not". Hence the importance of what is measured now by God: God taking account of us accurately for His own satisfaction. "And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels", (@Matthew 3:17). That is the principle of it.
In @Revelation 21 it is a measuring reed of *gold*. That is the kind of measuring now, the reed itself must be wholly of God. It is not now a staff, or simply the principle of measurement, but the material of the reed. It is according to the nature of God. That is what He uses. It says, "He that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city". There was a definite purpose in his mind to measure the city. And then it says, "And the gates thereof, and the wall thereof". These are the things in the mind of God. The city is in the mind of God; it comes down with every evidence of His approval, nothing wanting in it, the residence of the glory. The prophet sees it coming down from heaven and it shines like jasper. It is "a city which hath foundations", that faith had ever looked for; now it is here. And God Himself would have it measured, the city, and the gates, and the wall. Then it says, "And the city lies four-square, and its length is as much as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed -- twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and height of it are equal". It is a vast thing, no
{461}
small conception; not now the ark of the covenant, so small, with half measurements. It has complete measurements, twelve thousand furlongs -- an immense thing. And the length and breadth and height are equal. It is solid.
I just mention that because we ought to have the idea of substance ever before us. The Lord would furnish us with it. In every religion that has been built up in this world there has not been substance in this sense, for the founders were not what they said. In Christianity it is what is seen, and heard, and handled, and contemplated. Everything is worked out from that. We are going on with a Person who is the expression of His (God's) substance and with persons who are formed after that Person. We are going on with substance. We have the Persons and the blessings, the Lord Himself and the Spirit. You see what we are going on with. God, as it were, says, "I am going on with this". This is what is coming out, a cube of twelve thousand stadia. You can look up the equivalent of a furlong and you will see how large the city is. It is the divinely given symbol of the great concrete result that God is working up to.
One might speak of it in regard of twelve, that love enters into every part of it. It is composed of the saints, as formed in love, so that we are entirely under the hand of the Lord for His manipulation in service. It is a glorious thought that I am to be entirely in the hands of the Lord in relation to millions of others for His service. We must get the spiritual thought that the number twelve, which enters into all the measurements, refers to love. How can I be under the hand of the Lord in relation to myriads of others unless I am in subjection to Him and formed in the divine nature? I am not a rival of any of them. I am there to serve in relation to others, and at the present time that is what tests me. When Saul says,
{462}
"What wilt thou have me to do?"the Lord said, "Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do", (@Acts 9:6). He had to go to the brethren. He had to learn to serve from and *in relation to them*. The idea of the *cube* and *twelve* entering into it is that it is substantial spiritually, formed in love, so that every unit in it is under the Lord's hand for service. He will send us hither and thither in His service.
Well, that is the thing -- the length of it and the breadth and the height are equal. What a glorious prospect! Think of all the units in this wonderful thing formed after Christ, and all for His will as He was here for the Father's will! Never for one instant was He here but for the pleasure of His Father. And that is the city. The number "twelve" enters into it in every way. May God help us in regard of substance and measurement. I believe it will work out in our increased and enhanced usefulness in the testimony.
{463}
THE LORD JESUS IN THE TEMPLE
@Luke 2:27 - 32; 46 - 49; @Luke 19:45 - 48
These scriptures speak of the Lord Jesus in the temple, in three different settings. It is not the inside or most holy place that is in mind here, but the general position, the general temple buildings into which the Lord had access. He did not have access into the holiest or even into the holy place, not being a priest after the law, although it would appear that His betrayer had access inside, for he cast down the thirty pieces of silver there. That would indicate the irregularity of the government of the house of God, for when it was a question of the betrayal of Christ the limitations attaching to the house were very secondary. The result is that, when the issue is Christ, the religious privileges and order become secondary.
But the Lord had access to the temple in an outward way, and these three scriptures furnish us with what characteristically marks His presence in the temple according to this evangelist. There are other mentions of His presence in the temple, but these three furnish that which governs the whole matter in this gospel. What should be observed first of all is the advance from chapter 2. The conditions become more adverse to Him. If we carry that down to our own days, it is imperative that there should be priestly conditions in what has the place of the temple of God. This is especially imperative where Christ is seen in a small way as in chapter 2:27. In chapter 2:46 He is seen in an increased measure. Priestly conditions were not there, but He is there Himself in priestly power even as a Boy. That is, priestly conditions are required in the place if Christ can be there at all, even in a small way. Then there are conditions where He has greater strength and
{464}
scope. (I am speaking now of Christ in testimony, not His personal position down here.) There are conditions where His testimony has power and scope to take care of itself, so to speak, and of the rights of God too.
The second scripture in chapter 2 shows that priestly conditions were wanting where they should have been peculiarly, for in truth they did exist in Mary His mother, but they had lapsed, which is often the case with us. There is no opposition seen, but a great want of priestly care and consideration for Christ. Then in the third scripture we have actual opposition in the temple. But He is now seen in fulness of strength as a Man, having scope and power in Himself to deal with conditions in the temple; and He *does* deal with them.
Now I come to these points in the order in which I read the scriptures, first in regard of priestly conditions where things are small in the testimony. I use the word *testimony* because Christ is seen in this way in all these scriptures. It is a question of testimony in every instance. How essential are priestly conditions when the testimony is in a small way, meaning perhaps that it has just begun or had a small effect! How incongruous it would have been to heaven and all who are spiritual if the Lord Jesus had come in as a Babe into the temple without finding priestly hands there! How wanting the whole scene would have been! How utterly out of keeping with what had been divinely intended, that, coming in as a Babe, as He did, He should find coldness and opposition! God would speak to us, now, I believe, as to this point, for where things are small, where the work of God has just begun, or has not had a very great effect, aside from priestly conditions the work must cease; it must, as it were, die out. I am not speaking of Christ personally; I am speaking of Him in a way that is figurative of conditions that may be found, and are being found, at the present time.
{465}
Here in Luke's gospel there was a real movement. No one can read this chapter and the preceding one without being impressed with them, and yet it is a movement in outward smallness. In chapter 1 we have the inner side, the shrine, as we may call it, and a priest there. Gabriel came there -- a remarkable fact -- to announce something, something small, but what was sought after, for Zacharias had evidently prayed for John -- a male child. But he failed in faith. The position was disappointing to heaven, for the angel represented heaven. There had been prayer, and Zacharias was a righteous man, his wife a righteous woman, blameless, of a certain order in the priesthood, serving too at the hour of prayer, offering incense; and yet the scene was peculiarly disappointing to heaven. Gabriel was a full representative of heaven, and he came to enhance the position, and instead of that he finds the whole position disappointing. The priest was in his place, outwardly doing what he should do, but inwardly unbelieving. A very searching matter! And then the judicial dealings of God make the matter outwardly worse; for the priest became dumb. This that I am saying now is not something beside the mark, it is a question of answering to the mind of heaven, of remembering our prayers, and expecting God to act. If we pray for something for the promotion of the testimony, God may have to say that disciplinary matters must intervene; judicial matters must intervene before they can be reached. I am not to be simply an onlooker, or one that has forgotten the things that have been required from heaven, but to go through the thing in discipline. We are to wait with patience, as it says. Zacharias failed in that, and the whole position was disappointing. It would be the last thing that those who love God would desire, that the position in which they are responsible personally should be found wanting.
{466}
But it is not so in chapter 2. We find there that the parents of Jesus -- Mary and Joseph -- are acting their part; they bring the Babe in according to the divine principle governing the position. The true priest begins really in that way; he says, "I myself with the mind serve God's law", (@Romans 7:25). There is no question of what that specific law may be. The point is whether it is God's, whether it is something from God that governs what I am to do. The true priest begins that way, and Mary and Joseph began that way; they were observing what God required as to their part in the matter. They brought the Babe in, and in the temple was found a true priest. Heaven is not disappointed now. How disappointing it would have been had the conditions been what they became later! But it was divinely ordered that there should be no disappointment; the matter was too serious, too important. It was a question of the Son of God, but still in a small way as to what is seen outwardly, analogous to what is current in regard of the testimony, but nevertheless essentially interesting to heaven. Priestly conditions were imperative there; so Simeon was the man. The Babe was there and Simeon was there; he was in Jerusalem but he was in the temple at the right time. As the Child is brought in he knows what to do. It is often the case in these analogous circumstances that a small work of God is just small in our minds, and regarded as of but little account and unworthy of the great exercise that is really imperative so that it might go forward. Simeon was of that mind. It was revealed to him. The position was of God, as in every such case, and God acts in these cases; but Simeon was truly a priest and in his place as needed. This brings up the practical thought that the testimony often suffers through brethren moving about, travelling aimlessly maybe. We cannot afford to expose the testimony. Sacrifice may be needed; heaven loves
{467}
that. Heaven is watching the testimony with the greatest intentness, and is disappointed when it finds us slack and uninterested. "With whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?" (@1 Samuel 17:28) one said in a haughty spirit to his brother. David said he left them with the keeper; they must be protected. The testimony must be protected, and protected by suitable hands.
Now Simeon was on the spot. He was characteristically a man in Jerusalem; but then he might be in Jerusalem and not in the temple. He might be a priest truly and not in the temple when he was needed. The point is to be where I am needed. Anna, too, came in at that hour; she did not miss it. Simeon took the Child in his arms. We have often commented on this beautiful scene -- really there is no scene more beautiful: a true priest of God prepared for the occasion and now in it, on the spot, with priestly garments, priestly feelings! Not only did he know how to handle the Babe, but he knew how to receive God's thoughts about the Babe. That is the next thing. The best thoughts any priest can have about Christ are not the full thoughts of God. But one wants to be equal to receive the thoughts of God for the particular time. So varied are the glories of Christ, so attractive, so excellent, that, in every incident in which God intervenes and says something, it is different! The variety is so great, the glories so extensive and varied! So it is not only that I am at the meeting, but I am where I am needed to be, and able to receive divine impressions about Christ, and able to speak of them too, able to communicate. How great a thing it is, dear brethren, to be ready to receive the divine thoughts about the holy Person, and then to communicate them.
So the Spirit of God tells us about this pattern man -- Simeon. In regard of the testimony in a small way, particularly in initial stages or where the testimony
{468}
has not had much success, there is great need for the priest to be there day and night, like Anna, night and day in the temple. She would not miss anything. She spoke of *Him*; she spoke about Christ. We are not told what she said, but we are told what Simeon said. He had the communication and knew how to convey the communication. What meetings we should have on these lines, as able to take in divine thoughts, and to convey divine thoughts about Christ! The Babe is brought in according to divine order, according to the law of God, and He is handed over to the priest. The priest is taking Him on; a man in communication with heaven, a man conversant with the reception of divine thoughts, for "it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ", and now he has Him in his arms. How beautiful is the scene! We only transfer it to any brother or sister, especially a brother in assembly taking on the divine thoughts presented in Christ in smallness, however small, and then taking divine thoughts into his mind, immediately transmitted into his mind from heaven. Think of the freshness, think of the glory that shine under those circumstances!
So he says, "Mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people". What great thoughts were transmitted to his mind! The Babe is not yet active; He is, as it were, passive, but He is the Lord's Christ, and the priest's soul is flooded with light about Him -- "a light for revelation of the Gentiles". We in the Western parts live in the view of heaven tonight. Is it too much to say that what I am speaking of from @Luke 2 applies to this meeting? What is heaven looking at here? The Gentiles, in ourselves, are brought into the view of heaven. Think of being on that ground before God! Christ has done it. "A light for revelation of the Gentiles". It is the
{469}
unveiling, the taking away of the veil so that God looks upon us, not only in complacency in a potential way, but in an active sense. Christ has brought us in before the heavenly gaze. "A light for revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel".
That is the feature I would present in these verses. What heaven is looking for in every assembly meeting is the bringing in of what is so pleasing, what Christ has effected. As it is said, "One God, the Father, of whom all things, and we *for* him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we *by* him", (@1 Corinthians 8:6). That is the position. We are *for* the Father here, particularly as in assembly; we are *for* the Father, but instrumentally *by* the Son. The one Lord has brought us in. All this enters into what we have in those verses, and I commend them in this way as most needful, so that we may, as in assembly, be there in a priestly sense, ready to receive heaven's thoughts about Christ, the Father's thoughts. There would be nothing stale, nothing marked by platitude. All is fresh and new, bringing fresh impressions of the many glories of Christ.
Now in verse 46 the conditions are not so good. There is another view; the Lord, as it were, has to take care of Himself. I am speaking now analogously of current conditions. It is humbling that there should be such retrogression in believers, particularly such a distinguished person as Mary, for she is seen in chapter 2 as a priest. And now she and her husband are together. They had been up to Jerusalem, and "the boy Jesus", as He is called, went up with them, and they left for home talking to their fellow-travellers, but nothing about Jesus. He is not introduced at all; or, if He is introduced, they are speaking of Him theoretically, not consciously. They thought He was in the company, but He was not, and so they went back with a certain amount of parental resentment. Think of being resentful of
{470}
Christ! They thought He was in the company, and now they went back sorrowing. It was in mutual parental love; the parents are looking for their son and sorrowing, as they say, but with a measure of resentment. Their state is unpriestly. We often find it reflected in our locality, and the Lord has to look after Himself. I am speaking now of the testimony, and it has to look after itself. At twelve years of age, He is able to do it, and so is the testimony at this age. But the Spirit of God holds up here a picture of what happens, the state of theory, for if they spoke of Him at all on the way home it was theoretically. They thought He was in the company, but He was not. There was no priestly feeling expressed at all -- parental feeling, in a way, but merely natural. They ultimately find the Lord in the temple, and there is nothing against Him there, thank God! The doctors are there as in a normal condition of things, but with no particular attention to Him -- to Christ. The meeting goes on, the usual things are done as the meeting proceeds, and we go home, but there is nothing at all, as far as the priests are concerned (or those who should be priests), nothing new or fresh. But then the Lord shines. He is sitting where He should be at that age, and this is, of course, a pattern for all boys and girls. He is sitting where He should be, sitting among the teachers. They are not viewed here as reprobates. There is no antagonism to Christ; but whatever comes that is worth having is from this holy Boy. Nothing at all is recorded of what the doctors said. We have a record of what Mary said to Him, and distressing it is! "Thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing". We are not let off, dear brethren. You might say she was doing her best. But she was *not* doing her best; she was really a priest, but had lapsed, and that is the difficulty very often. She was just giving vent to her natural parental feelings at the moment. Her priestly
{471}
state is submerged; though it is there, thank God! So there is hope for every true priest, that although priestly state may be covered over it will come to light. The Lord says, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?" So the position here is that He is able to take care of Himself, for which we may thank God, for, applying it to any condition in a locality, the ground is held.
We had communications in the early part of the chapter, but now the Lord is speaking about His Father, and as we are together that is one of the finest thoughts -- to hear Him speak either *to* or *about* His Father. In @John 14, 15 and 16, the Lord Jesus speaks *about* His Father, speaks much *about* Him; in chapter 17 He speaks *to* Him. Here He is speaking *about* Him, "Did ye not know that I must be about my Father's business?" What light, dear brethren, shines! Did anyone ever speak in the temple like that before? Never! It is entirely new and fresh. The priests are lacking, not opposed, but the priesthood is not in evidence, and it should not be so. Instead of Mary and Joseph advancing in priesthood, they are retrograding. If the priesthood retrogrades and dies out, what will become of the testimony in the place? We may carry on in our regular routine, but there is no freshness, no word about the Father, no reception of immediate communications about the Son, about the Father, no word from the Son about the Father. Dear brethren, we cannot afford to lose these things.
Now in the last chapter Christ is acting in a judicial way in the temple. The temple, we may say, is becoming worse and worse. We begin with a priestly condition and go on to an unpriestly condition, and now we arrive at a hostile condition, and the Lord has to have recourse to judicial action. This is a solemn matter. Chapter 19:40 brings out His glory, His greatness as entering Jerusalem. He said, "If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out". God is never
{472}
short of what He needs in that sense; there would be always what is new. God acts in power and brings about what He needs in a sovereign way, but I am speaking now of the continuance of what is needed, and increase in that continuance.
The Lord enters the temple and finds a commercial state of things in the temple of God, persons selling doves, sheep and the like in the temple. He cast them out. We see the increasing power in the testimony as the conditions become worse, for the testimony must go through, and we want to be in it. He cast out the actual merchants, the persons, the buyers and sellers, not here the commodities as in John's gospel. There it was a scourge of small cords; He cast out the things being sold and bought, and rebuked the persons selling and buying, but here He casts out the sellers and buyers. It is so serious that we have a commercial state of things where Simeon once held Jesus in his arms in a true priestly way, receiving communications from heaven about Him, where he conveyed those communications. There are now buyers and sellers of doves and sheep, a Canaanitish condition. The Lord has helped us in recent years, calling our attention to the incongruity of the merchant spirit amongst us. There may be a trading of the word of God for instance, making merchandise of the holy things of God. The Lord will not tolerate it, and if He calls attention to it He follows it up. He quotes from @Isaiah 56:7, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations". Instead of being a house of prayer where God makes His people rejoice, now it is used for merchandise, and the Lord is dealing with it. Luke does not mention the scourge of small cords, for he usually presents the gracious side; but, still, the offenders are cast out, and then the Lord teaches them. He creates conditions for teaching. He was not teaching in the temple in chapter 2, but hearing and asking questions. But
{473}
now it is the full thought; He has dealt with the evil and He proceeds to instruct.
So, dear brethren, under these circumstances what is needed is teaching what *this* is and what *that* is, according to God. The word is, "They shall be all taught of God". (@John 6:45). That is real teaching, for who teaches like Him? He uses instruments, but the teaching is of God, and it is to prevent the recurrence of these things. Now that the Lord has brought things on to a right basis for us, let us proceed. The true means on His side is teaching. "My people are destroyed", it said elsewhere, "for lack of knowledge". (@Hosea 4:6). The Lord proceeds to teach in the temple, and presently says, "There shall not be left stone upon stone", (@Luke 21:6). But while the position stands the teaching goes on, and it will go on, and we want to be in it. Let us learn all we can, and impart what we have learned according to our measure. "Freely ye have received, freely give", says the Lord, (@Matthew 10:8).
