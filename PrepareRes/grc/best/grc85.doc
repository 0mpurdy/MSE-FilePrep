{#Anchor of The Soul}
{92}
ANCHOR OF THE SOUL
*Very brief notes taken at random during the Reading on Lord's Day afternoon, 17th February, 1963, with Mr. G. R. Cowell*.
@Hebrews 6: 17 - 20; @Hebrews 10: 19 - 23; @Hebrews 13: 10 - 16
In chapter 6 the expression "anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil". In chapter 13 the altar gives the thought of stability. These two things are stabilizing and give us assurance of our place within the veil and outside the camp where the divine altar is in which things are presented. We go forth to Him without the camp where the Christian altar is.
God comes out with a view to man going in. The Lord is our forerunner and He secures our place within the veil. We go in according to God within the veil and then go outside the camp. This is the
{93}
divine order of giving us a place within the veil first; because God puts what is positive before us to help us to move out of what is of man. Knowing our place within the veil gives strength to go forth to the Lord outside the camp. On the one hand Christ, within the veil, in the presence of God, appearing there for us. As forerunner he marks out a place for us. On the other hand, outside the camp we are identified with Him wherever He is.
Lay hold of hope which is before us. In @Genesis 12 there *is* the promise; and also in @Genesis 22. These two unchangeable things. It is impossible for God to fail in His oath. We belong to the most intimate family within the veil; everyone who is redeemed who has the Spirit belongs to the first-born family. Hebrews is a 'perpendicular' epistle -- Corinthians a 'horizontal' one. Hebrews was written to set Timothy free. What is unchangeable brings stability as an anchor for our souls. If there is no anchor we are blown about and are restless. In coming to the Lord Jesus we get rest -- "Ye shall find rest to your souls", @Matthew 11: 29. We have all fled for refuge. In the race our eyes are on the goal; Looking unto Jesus -- all our hope and trust is in Him. Faith is the substantiation of things that are hoped for. Let us draw near Him in full assurance of faith. Confession of faith can be as cold as ice but confession of hope is always burning and living -- "I will come again". Hope in Jesus our forerunner. 'In hope we lift our wishful longing eyes', as we sometimes sing.
The God of peace has no room for agitation, only adoration. The anchor of our souls keeps us stable so that we are not moved by winds of doctrine. We should abhor all that is man-made. The camp is man-
{94}
made. Hebrews talks of things that are not made by man.
The confession of faith is not enough -- we want living hope in our souls. They went forth to meet the bridegroom with flaming torches. It would be good to have more flaming torches. Paul and Silas in the prison were full of hope. Jesus is our hope. Our place is with Him where He is -- "Where I am there ye also may be", @John 14: 3. "I go to prepare you a place". Our place *is* prepared; there are restful conditions where God is. "Abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit", @Romans 15: 13. Boldness is not self-confidence. It is not presumption to be bold. A man-made altar in a cathedral is no use. We have a Christian altar.
All our needs are met at the Throne of Grace. But let us not forget the needs of others. Do something for someone -- for a sick person -- communicating of my substance, not only praising. Never overlook the practical side of Christianity.
