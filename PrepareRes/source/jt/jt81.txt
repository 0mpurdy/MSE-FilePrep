REVIVAL (1)
@2 Chronicles 29: 1 - 36
J.T. What is in mind is revival. We have a prayer in @Psalm 85 that the saints might be revived, and in the prophet Habakkuk we have a further prayer that the work of the Lord should be revived. These prayers are applicable today. We always have a tendency to droop, to become cold; so that I thought the Lord would help us to consider the outstanding instances of revival in the Old Testament, and perhaps we may be led to go into the New. So that the thought is to consider Hezekiah first in two readings. The next chapter (30) introduces the passover which he kept. His revival is compared with the time of Solomon, "And there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had not been the like in Jerusalem" (verse 26). Then Josiah's passover -- the revival under Josiah -- is compared with the days of Samuel in chapter 35: 18: "And there was no passover like to that holden in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel hold such a passover as Josiah held ...". That goes back further.
The third allusion is in Nehemiah: the feast of tabernacles in his days goes back to Joshua. These comparisons will help us, and it will be observed that the feast of tabernacles is in remnant times. Nehemiah's time goes back further by comparison even than these two in 2 Chronicles. The further back we go in comparison the nearer we get to the original thought of God, and the greater evidence there is of true revival, not only in feelings and affections but in principles and truth.
{2}
I mention those three because of the comparisons made with them. There are other revivals we may look at with the Lord's help but this one under Hezekiah is particularly important. It begins with a man of mature years, twenty-five years, when he opened the doors of the house of God, "He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them" (verse 3). Then we shall see as we run down the chapter the development of the truth under his influence and direction, so that the Spirit of God tells us in the last verse of our chapter, "And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people; for the thing was done suddenly". It was a real revival by the grace of God, and though there was not much time to effect everything, yet it was reached.
C.H.H. Do you place these revivals consecutively, the one following the other in our own soul's history?
J.T. They should be. The opening of the doors of the house of Jehovah is the first thing, and then the dealing with the evil that had existed, which we get in the succeeding verses. These revivals are very important as applicable at the present time. They are intended to stir us up.
S.P. Is revival connected with some particular phase of the truth?
J.T. I think that is right. Some particular phase is stressed in each revival. We can see the house is the prominent thing here.
J.W. It says, "And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah". Would that be the moral basis for the movement seen in this chapter?
J.T. Quite so, "And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done". There is a standard mentioned, that is the principle, there is always a standard in mind. We may thank God for any outstanding servants we can allude to who have gone, but of course the great standard is
{3}
Christ. There is nothing less in the mind of God at anytime than Christ.
A.H.P. These revivals are not based upon the need of men, the low level of man's need, but on what is according to God, starting at the higher point.
J.T. Revivals in the history of christendom are not to be classed under the headings of these the Scriptures allude to; such usually refer to great activity in evangelical work. But what you observe here is that the principles governing the work, the right standard, is to be in mind from the start. It says in verse 25, "And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet". They have the higher standard in mind; that is a matter to be kept before us. The word 'revival' is common; many activities might be alluded to under that name but they do not fit here at all. Revival today according to God must involve the assembly, and Christ as Head of it.
Ques. Is there not importance in the fact that it gives his mother's name, Abijah? The previous chapter closes with, "And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead", and this chapter begins with the mother's side.
J.T. You get that frequently in the histories of these kings. In order to have a right product you must not only have a right father but a right mother. That principle is set out in Genesis, the principle of a right father and a right mother, so as to have a wholly right seed. We have what is partial, and even mongrel, like Ishmael, but a wholly right seed is in mind in the things of God, so that Genesis not only provides the patriarchs but the sisterhood too; it supplies suitable wives and mothers. I suppose that is the suggestion in the mother's name being mentioned here, so that it says in verse 2, "And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done".
{4}
J.W.D. You get the allusion to David in connection with Philadelphia. I was wondering whether the thought of Hezekiah's reigning referred to the dispensation of God and sovereignty in regard to the period of revival.
J.T. That opens up an instructive line of thought. It is remarkable how David is introduced in connection with the gospels. Matthew had in mind the assembly, and introduces David at once -- "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham". Paul brings him in in connection with the gospel in Romans, and Timothy is reminded of it in @2 Timothy 2: 8: "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David", a very striking matter in remnant times. Then in the address to Philadelphia, which of course alludes to the remnant times in our dispensation, it is "He that has the key of David"; and when He finally addresses Himself to the churches in the close of Revelation, the Lord says, "*I* am the root and offspring of David", @Revelation 22: 16.
So that I think in Hezekiah's connection with David here we see that David is the standard thought. We have the suggestion of what is best spiritually; David represents what is best, most refined spiritually. In a revival God would have that before Him, not merely what may accrue to men but what will accrue to God. David is the leader in the service of God in the Old Testament, the sweet psalmist of Israel.
C.H.H. What is the distinction between Joshua's line and David's?
J.T. Joshua goes back further; it is earlier. But there is nothing really higher in quality than what we get in David. The comparison here in our section is with Solomon, as already remarked, it is "since the time of Solomon the son of David". Joshua's spiritual power is not, I think, in relation to the kingdom.
{5}
Moses represents that side -- spiritual power in the kingdom in the way of authority and rule. Joshua is Christ known inwardly, that is, the power by which we enter on our inheritance, our heavenly position.
S.McC. Is it helpful to see the lead that Hezekiah gives in clothing what is levitical with the peculiar dignity he does, as in verse 11: "My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him, and to be his ministers and incense-burners"?
J.T. Yes, that passage indicates that he is exercising his proper function as king. The first book of Samuel shows that the priesthood was henceforth to be subservient to the king and Hezekiah exercises that prerogative. He speaks in a fatherly way to the Levites. It would be the Spirit of Christ in authority amongst us in revival, in whatever way that may be shown. To stir up the Levites, he calls them "My sons"; it is a fatherly thought. As a king he is a young man, but he, as a king, represents the authority of Christ. He exercises his functions in that way, to stir up the Levites, that is the point; to get the Levites moving spiritually he gives them their highest place. "For Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him, and to be his ministers and incense-burners". It is well in stirring up people to remind them of their dignity, there is an incentive in that to move in true dignity. He had already called them to attention in verse 4: "And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them into the open place eastward". They are to be lectured; it was, so to speak, the Spirit of God calling on the brethren for in a certain aspect there has been lethargy. "He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them into the open place eastward; and he said to them, Hear me, ye Levites: hallow yourselves now, and hallow the house
{6}
of Jehovah the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the sanctuary". And then he acknowledges the guilt that had preceded, and in verse 11 he calls them his sons and addresses them in their dignity; he shows what their proper function is, positive service God-ward, "ministers and incense-burners". Verses 3 to 11 contain an appeal to us at the present time. It seems to me that each of us should take it to heart as to himself, his house and his local position, as to where he has been and as to where he is in regard to all this, and whether there is not a voice to us in this scripture. They are addressed by the king as sons, and their dignity is fully owned. The thing is to exercise what we are called into, what we are as called into the service of God.
F.R.A. Would the thought of eastward suggest the coming in of the Lord? He opened the doors and then they gathered in the open place eastward. Conditions have to be suitable to His coming in.
J.T. I think so, there is always a hopeful outlook. We are likely to be doleful and say there is no hope, but the eastward direction is hopeful; it suggests hopefulness. There is plenty of scope, he "gathered them into the open place", and gave them the suggestion of liberty and room.
J.B. Would Peter in chapter 3 of the second epistle have revival in his mind in saying, "I stir up, in the way of putting you in remembrance, your pure mind, to be mindful of the words spoken before by the holy prophets", and he goes on in connection with the day of the Lord and their waiting?
J.T. I think stirring up their pure minds could take that character, 'Stirring up' is a good thought, but the thing is not to stir up what is impure. It is pure minds. I think it would have the bearing of a revival.
{7}
J.R.H. You were speaking of David setting forth the standard. It says that Hezekiah "opened the doors of the house of Jehovah". Would that have reference to the key of David? Would that come in there?
J.T. Yes, it is a question of the right to do it. The Lord has a right. The word to Philadelphia in @Revelation 3: 7 is, "And to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write: These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open". I think it involves the right of Christ. Christendom had come under foreign authority and influence; if we go back to the Reformation. Rome had the key of everything except the Eastern church, and that had become dead. The Lord did much in the Reformation, but there was not much opening in it for what was positive. The key of David refers to the right to open up things in the way of what is positive. The allusion would be to what has happened in that spiritual initiative has been taken out of the hand of Rome, and all that goes with it has lost its place -- not in an official way but in a spiritual way. There has been complete release from that influence. The Lord has come in and opened up things to us; there is an entrance into those things and it continues now as much as ever. The Lord continues things as He opens up the doors to us, that is what is in mind. Hezekiah did that, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and repaired them; he exercised the right that belonged to him. It is a question of the Lord's authority, a right to open and no one shall shut, "Behold, I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut". It is a very encouraging thought, so that it looks as though the Lord will keep the doors open for us.
A.H.P. When local difficulties arise the suggestion is sometimes made to close up the meeting. I was
{8}
wondering whether this scripture, in conjunction with the one suggested in Revelation, might afford to us the procedure by which the door should be kept open for the Lord and His service.
J.T. Yes; it is the holy and true One that opens. We know how much has been opened up externally by imitation, leading nowhere except toward the world; but there is only One who opens up these things, and He opens with the key of David. It refers to what is most exalted and refined spiritually, the service of God and all that goes with it.
C.H.H. The previous king introduced foreign elements into the worship of Jehovah, but in this chapter they judge that and definitely name it as being evil.
J.T. Quite so. He not only introduced idolatrous elements, but we are told in verse 19 of "the vessels that king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression". That is, he would cast away what is of God as profane. There is much of that. But these vessels are now restored, and that is the sort of thing going on today.
J.W.D. Would 2 Timothy be rather the rallying of what is priestly and levitical in the brethren, and the opening of the doors be more the Corinthian epistles?
J.T. The rallying of the priestly elements would be 2 Timothy and the introduction of David there is striking. That epistle opens up everything to us; it is the avenue of all that is of God. It is, I believe, a sort of charter given to us that we may fall back upon. Any one person has that mandate; he does not need to wait for anyone else; any true believer in Christ is not required to wait for anyone else, for he can release himself in separating from vessels to dishonour, and then "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". I believe the door is open in that way.
{9}
All that we have in 1 and 2 Corinthians and all that we have noted is available to us. So Hezekiah here renders a wonderful service in opening the doors and repairing them that there may be access to the things of God. But there may be access and yet much repair needed; even now there are a lot of things held that need correction, and access to the things of God is hindered because of these conditions.
E.G.McA. Is individual exercise expressed in Hezekiah in verse 10? Particularly in verse 5 he gathers the priests and Levites to face the situation found in the temple, so that the individual exercise moves out to take in the whole company in revival.
J.T. That is the way the passage stands. The first thought is in bringing the Levites to the open place. It is authoritative; it is the king that is doing it; he has the right to do it according to 1 Samuel. Now that he has delivered his message to them in the open place as to the uncleanness of the conditions, he comes back to the thought of positive service, and it is there he tells us what is in his heart. You want to get what God has put into some brother's heart who has a care, some brother who has the lead. Some brother has a secret understanding with God, but in carrying that out he may have trouble. Hezekiah told them what was in his heart; it was "to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us" (verse 10). And then he calls the Levites out, "My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to do service unto him, and to be his ministers and incense-burners". That is a beautiful appeal to us, recognising the dignity of the Levites, calling them sons, touching our affections. See what you are called into! It seems to me that this is a great appeal to us. You can see the course he takes here, the course that is needed now -- cleansing, and repairing what is out of the way, and
{10}
then the positive side, the Levites fully owned in their dignity. What a wonderful thing is opened up to us, "ministers and incense-burners" to Jehovah!
S.P. Even though Hezekiah gives the lead, the germ is there to respond to the lead. And then in verse 15 the movement is from them: "And they gathered their brethren, and hallowed themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah".
J.T. Yes, that is good. One man cannot make a revival, though he may lead in it. More than one man is needed. You can see that Hezekiah had an understanding with God in his heart. But then in the next section it says, "Then the Levites rose up". (verse 12), and then their names are given, which is important. It is well to read all these names, because if the Spirit of God has taken pains to write down a man's name it is well to read it. These names have been read in our hearing and there is a goodly number of them. It says in verses 15 - 17, "And they gathered their brethren, and hallowed themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah. And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and carried forth all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah, into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it to carry it forth into the brook Kidron. And they began on the first of the first month to hallow, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah; and they hallowed the house of Jehovah eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end". It seems to me that is very fine. The matter is finished. There are external things, but then there are the inner things that have to be dealt with, that is, things that are professedly nearer to God, that
{11}
might be concealed; because with many of us as gifted men or even in the place of spiritual men there are things that cannot be seen; but priestly intelligence understands and they come to the inner part to deal with all that, and it is carried outside; and then it is brought to what suggests the death of the Lord Jesus, the judgment of God, in the brook Kidron.
H.B. What would you say as to the Levites hallowing themselves first before hallowing the house of Jehovah?
J.T. You can see that one has to be hallowed himself before he can help the saints. That is what I believe is the force of the Lord saying that He is the holy and the true. "Holiness becometh thy house", @Psalm 93: 5. If any one seeks to help others he must be holy himself.
J.W.D. I suppose this goes far beyond what is merely local: the house of Jehovah governs everywhere. One in priestly service can move in any local assembly really.
J.T. There is only one house. The word 'house' in this sense is never plural, it is always singular. There are many assemblies and subdivisions, many local assemblies, but only one house.
J.W.D. It is in mind here to make a covenant which would involve the saints everywhere.
J.T. So that Paul says, "And thus I ordain in all the assemblies", @1 Corinthians 7: 17. There are not different methods or customs, we are all governed by the same principles and methods.
Ques. Are there two activities in action here, one the taking out the evil and the other the bringing back of the clean vessels?
J.T. That is important, undoing what Ahaz had done. "And all the vessels that king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression have we prepared
{12}
and hallowed, and behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah". It seems to me that this is an important matter, certain ones had been cast away by a previous administration, an evil one, indeed an idolatrous one, but these vessels are now secured. We cannot afford to lose them. The priests are mentioned first in verse 4; and then in verse 16 in the cleansing of the house in the first service depicted, it says, "And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and carried forth all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah, into the court of the house of Jehovah". It seems to me that they are governed rightly as regards everything. They are the ones who have the full thought, they go into the inner part of the house. The inner part today would apply to brethren who are recognised as leaders, who might conceal things better than others, but priestly intelligence can detect them. These evils may pass unnoticed, but the priestly element, it seems to me, deals with that point, so that what is inner, what is more obscure, is discovered and dealt with. "And the Levites took it to carry it forth into the brook Kidron", they understand their work. The priest, of course, comes first; it is the priests and Levites. In Deuteronomy and Joshua there is not much distinction between the priests and Levites, but the priests come first, the Levites are subservient to the priests. It works out here that the priestly discernment deals with this inner uncleanness; they carry it out to the court. It is where it can be seen by anybody. The Levites then come in and they deal with it, which would mean, I suppose, that the Levites, perhaps by a word of ministry, a rebuke, or an exhortation, would put the thing where it belonged. This thing can only be dealt with by the application of the death of Christ; the death of Christ would be alluded to in the brook.
{13}
Ques. Is Paul an instance of one who is not going to be deterred by the prominence of the brother in question? Paul withstood Peter to the face. He is priestly, the matter is brought to an issue.
J.T. That helps. The structure of 1 and 2 Corinthians would indicate that Paul discerned that the real difficulty at Corinth was with the leaders. He immediately says in chapter 1, "There are strifes among you. But I speak of this, that each of you says, *I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ", meaning that there were local leaders. He does not name them, he leaves that and goes on to other things; but in the second epistle he goes back to it with power and he says, "Having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled", @2 Corinthians 10: 6. He wanted to get the mass of the brethren right, but he would deal with those leaders. I believe that is the priestly side here; the priest went into the inner part and brought the thing out. Nobody probably suspected that evil had gone so far in, but the priest did and brought it out into the open place.
J.W.D. Would these inner things be defective doctrine?
J.T. They might be, or bad principles probably. We have had to deal with such; in fact they have constantly to be dealt with, things that have been carried down for years by persons who can conceal them. They will not bring them out. Ordinarily they are concealed, but the priestly element discerns them and puts the finger upon them.
E.G.McA. Would you say that the priests coming into the inner part of the temple would indicate the consciousness that something is wrong before God, and the movement would come from the affections
{14}
God-ward; and then it works down to the Levites and into the ministry?
J.T. I think that is right. There is a great deal that passes because men have had a standing, the anointing has been there; they have had a place and they are not suspected, and they are clever enough to conceal the things. But priestly discernment puts its finger upon the evil and it is exposed. The Lord has done much of that for us.
J.R.H. How would you explain what is set out in verse 34. "Only the priests were too few ... for the Levites were more upright in heart to hallow themselves than the priests"?
J.T. "The priests were too few, and they could not flay all the burnt-offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had hallowed themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to hallow themselves than the priests". That would not set aside the order of the truth, that the priest comes first; even although he may not be hallowed as a Levite, yet he has more inwardly than the Levite has, because it is the same person, you know. I may be hallowed in regard of my service, and be able to give out a good deal to the brethren, but I may be neglecting the priestly side. But even so, as a priest I know more than I do as a Levite. The priesthood refers to what is more spiritual.
G.A.T. Say a word as to why very often evil is allowed to remain amongst us for a long time. What is the secret of that?
J.T. I have particular instances in mind. It is because of a person of established reputation; he is inside and people think he could not be wrong. And as far as you know, perhaps, he has not said anything to you that is wrong. He would be wise enough not to say it to you, but it is there, and he has said it and
{15}
done it and others know. The idea is that the priest discerns it. I believe the continuance of things that are wrong for a long time is largely because they are sheltered by such persons, persons of reputation. The Lord sees to it in time that the thing is exposed, being brought out into the open place as it says in verse 16: "Carried forth ... into the court". I believe that means the things are public; they are no longer secret. It is a very remarkable thing that it is in the inner part, nearer to God, where the evil is; and it is the reputation of the persons who hold it that gives it this place.
G.A.T. Would you say there are times when rather than bring in trouble by bringing the question up, we are weak; and instead of going inside and going to the bottom of the question we would rather leave it?
J.T. I am sure that is right. There is much that goes on amongst brethren with us that is not open. For instance, I know a place where the box was nailed to the outside of the door; it was said to have been there for fifty years. That is an open thing, everybody could see it, but it was allowed just because someone of importance had recognised it. There are many things like that, allowed to continue because we are just careless about them. They have suited a previous generation and they will suit ours, I believe what is here is inside, not what is open; when it is in the court it is open.
Rem. In @1 Samuel 21, Doeg the Edomite was in there; Saul allowed him in.
J.T. David said he saw him there; he knew he was there and would do harm. David discerned him but others did not.
S.McC. Do you think the reason why we are deceived so much in regard of such persons is because we take things too casually? Whatever is said or
{16}
ministered, it may be in conversation, is all taken casually; we recognise the brother and whatever place he may have ostensibly.
J.T. I am sure that is right; persons have carried along a sort of reputation amongst us and the rank and file of the brethren do not discern anything out of the way. Saints are suffering from it everywhere. The evil is there. They may not be intelligent about it but the priestly element discerns this sort of thing, and brings it out so that everyone can see it.
J.B. Nehemiah is concerned before God about those who had come in in relation to the priesthood.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would you confine this to doctrine only?
J.T. Doctrine or wrong principles.
Ques. I was thinking one might have a prominent place and the priestly element might discern from his walk that he is not in accordance with his ministry.
J.T. Yes; people can maintain a certain saintly attitude. This sanctified monkish idea is very old; it has entered into the whole clerical system. Christendom has wholly imbibed it and is permeated by it. Persons put on a sanctified appearance that carries weight with the rank and file and the evil is not discerned. That comes into our own position too. A man might have a reputation for being a saintly man for years and years and that goes a long way with people; but underneath there is what is damaging to the saints. The priests bring that out so that all can see it, and the Levites begin to operate; they carry everything out to the brook Kidron which is the death of Christ. Everything must be dealt with on that principle.
E.P. Does the principle of the Levite bring in the thought that the saints should get the full value of it? The second epistle to the Corinthians goes further than the first epistle.
{17}
J.T. The general condition of the brethren was being affected. The apostle in the second letter in a remarkable way carries the brethren with him in what he is saying. He finally is able to speak out plainly about their leaders; had he done that in his first epistle, he might have stumbled a lot of people. He brought the people round to the truth, then he dealt with the leaders.
J.W.D. In @2 Corinthians 11 he says, "Such are false apostles, deceitful workers". This kind of evil undermined what was apostolic, yet was covered by what seemed to be almost apostolic.
J.T. "And it is not wonderful, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light" (verse 14); things are covered by an exterior.
J.W.D. "Whose end shall be according to their works" (verse 15).
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. This kind of leader sometimes influences the assembly in a wrong way to get the assembly to carry out his will and not the mind of God.
J.T. That is right, but it is an important thing that the assembly stands in its own place. We are apt to make it a vest pocket matter, and use it for all kinds of purposes. It has a great place of dignity down here and no man should sway it or use it for his own ends.
A.H.P. Do you think it is wise to be alert to the priestly sensibilities of the brethren rather than to what is merely ministerial? Priestly sensibilities would discern something that might be passed by in ministry.
J.T. That is right; and we are all apt to be governed by personal feelings in the things of God -- the most baneful thing I know of, personal preference; whereas the priesthood is independent of all that, set up in spiritual power; that is the principle
{18}
of it, I believe that is the sense in which it should be seen here. They go into the inner matter, they deal with it, and bring it out into the court and there it is.
Rem. So verse 20 seems to help in that way, that the princes are brought in after the priests do their work. Attention is called to the rulers as if the responsible element can never do anything right until this other matter is dealt with.
J.T. Quite right. Take for instance in the so-called Glanton affair, it took a good while before the priests discerned the thing. The Levites were not clear about it; some of the best-known brethren went against the truth in those days. But it was finally discerned and brought out; the principle was brought out and there it is. And then the Levites -- what a remarkable amount of ministry we have had brought out ever since on that point! The Levites dealt with it, the Lord has gifted them to apply the death of Christ to all these things. The principle brought out then is now established.
To go on in the chapter, verse 20 refers to the king and the princes; that is more spiritual, what you may call the great spiritual lead that God would always give in these circumstances. "And Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah. And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them upon the altar of Jehovah". Now notice that, the number *seven* there; and then in verse 31 it says, "Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart, burnt-offerings".
{19}
That is, the people were brought into it, "And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs, all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah. And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep". Now the brethren will notice that it is the great general result amongst the saints, the embodiment of it; but the king and the princes, which refers to spiritual lead given in the movement, render what is due to God; they know what is due to God. Before you get the great congregation in the thing you get a spiritual lead, brethren who know what is suitable to God. In verses 21 and 22, it says, "And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them upon the altar of Jehovah. And they slaughtered the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar; and they slaughtered the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar, and they slaughtered the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar". This is all the burnt-offering. Then in verses 23 and 24 is the sin-offering: "And they brought near the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them. And the priests slaughtered them, and they made purification for sin with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel; because for all Israel, said the king, is the burnt-offering and the sin-offering". Now that is important to understand in a revival, that God will give a spiritual lead; that is what I think is meant by the king and the princes. It means persons of spiritual understanding and wealth and they apply measure and weight. It is not a question of how much I can give, but of what is suitable. A leader always understands what is suitable, and he confines himself to what is suitable to God. The idea of measure is very important in this chapter, governed by the number seven.
{20}
E.G.McA. What would the four different kinds of animals represent?
J.T. First you have the seven bullocks, then seven rams, and then seven lambs; these all refer to the burnt-offering. A bullock is something large; there is no question about this offering alluding to a person who has got spiritual wealth, he is thinking of what is for God. Rams allude to what is mature, and to the progenitive idea; we get the thought I suppose in the ram caught by the horns in a thicket. It is the progenitive idea as well as the mature idea; it is the great thought of God that there is to be a continuation of this. Lambs allude to what is intrinsic and precious. All this is coming out in spiritual leadership; you will find that a man who knows God, whom God is using, loves to speak of the intrinsic preciousness of Christ. He knows also that it is going to continue, it is not going to die out; I believe the ram brings that out, and the lamb is the intrinsic preciousness of Christ. The seven goats refer to Christ's sin-bearing, that is the idea in the goat: "Who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree", @1 Peter 2: 24. You have a wonderful thought of Christ here in these four kinds of creatures. And then the service begins in verse 25: "And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah through his prophets. And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. And Hezekiah commanded to offer up the burnt-offering on the altar. And at the moment the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel. And all the congregation worshipped". A wonderful scene this!
{21}
Ques. The headship of Christ, you would say, is seen throughout the chapter in Hezekiah?
J.T. I think so, that runs through it, I think we ought to notice now that the Lord is helping us in prophetic ministry; it comes in here in a striking manner. David would represent the highest spiritual thought in the service of God; but the two prophets mentioned, Gad and Nathan, are remarkable, I believe calling attention to the service that is rendered by prophetic ministry today in relation to the service of God.
C.H.H. Would that be seen in Ezra's day? The building prospered under the ministry of the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah.
J.T. That is an excellent illustration of this. I think the chapter is striking in this matter of prophecy. The Lord is blessing the brethren in all parts of the world as to this thought. These remarkable prophets, Gad and Nathan, were peculiarly associated with David, and they are brought in here. Why did Hezekiah bring them in here? It is I think to remind us that this revival touches the highest point in the service of God. So the king says, Now offer the burnt-offering; and as the burnt-offering began the song began. God is getting His portion, not only from the odour of the offering, but from the sweet music of the singers.
J.W.D. So it says in the last clause of verse 25, "For the commandment was of Jehovah through his prophets"; and then in verse 27, "Hezekiah commanded to offer up the burnt-offering on the altar".
J.T. The prophets first, then the king is exercising his own function. I suppose it would be the authority of Christ today by the Spirit. Royalty reigns, his authority enters into all these matters; but the dignified matter of the prophets ought to be noted, how the authority of God comes in through the prophetic ministry as it comes in through Christ as Lord.
{22}
Ques. Is that linked on with @1 Corinthians 14? Would the prophetic word have a bearing on conditions locally, bringing in worship?
J.T. That is what happens immediately if a man comes under the influence of prophetic ministry; the secrets of his heart are made manifest and he falls down. The matter is so clear that all the brethren are brought into it. An unbeliever coming into this is judged of all and he falls down and worships God and he reports that God is among you of a truth.
Ques. So these prophetic meetings would be available to bring in the mind of the Lord in relation to any matter that comes up in a locality? It may not be reached in a care meeting, but possibly in a meeting for prophetic ministry.
J.T. You often find that. The prophetic ministry in the power of the Spirit carries your conscience, that that is the mind of God on this matter.
C.H.H. Would a prophetic meeting be helped by singing more hymns, combining more hymns with the prophetic word?
J.T. If they are in power. In some places the brethren sing at the care meeting. I have no difficulty about that if the thing is in power; it promotes good feelings. Hezekiah is concerned about the song. In verse 27, "Hezekiah commanded to offer up the burnt-offering on the altar. And at the moment the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel". He is controlling the thing authoritatively, it is offered up on the altar where it should be. "And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded, all the time until the burnt-offering was finished. And when they had ended offering the burnt-offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped. And king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to sing
{23}
praise to Jehovah with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped". We have another name here, Asaph; he is particularly a singer and a psalm writer as David is, "And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped".
J.B. Often on Lord's day morning we have very little singing. I wonder if this would help us in connection with singing on the Lord's day morning?
J.T. Well now, that is what one has been impressed with recently, that the song of the Lord is very restricted; it has become very restricted. We have a hymn at the beginning of our meeting and then perhaps there is nothing further to the Lord Jesus in the way of singing. There may be a hymn after the breaking of bread, and then one or two perhaps to the Father. But I think what you say is suggestive, there ought to be more, not simply the use of hymns literally but in spiritual power, and not only the words but the tunes as well, because tunes have a great deal to do with the usefulness of the hymns. I believe the Lord personally has been left out too much in the service of song. We are inclined to go immediately to the Father after the breaking of bread whereas we should go on to the mutual and reciprocal exchange of affection between Christ and the assembly; there are hymns suitable for that which ought to be used.
S.P. In verse 26 the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets; "And at the moment the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel".
J.T. That would show that the priests came in in their place; they came first there. The Levites stood with the instruments of David and the priests with the trumpets. They stood, they are not using them yet,
{24}
they are ready for the service as soon as Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering on the altar.
S.P. I was wondering what is suggested in the blending of the trumpets and the instruments of David.
J.T. I think the point is to bring out the service of the priests. The trumpet of course is more distinctive, and not so musical. The instruments of David would be peculiarly musical, but the trumpets are more spiritual authority in the priests. So in the service of God as we have it, you feel that a young brother would be wise to wait for a lead rather than to give a lead. Not indeed that they may not give a lead spiritually, because very often a young brother gives a touch that carries the whole position; but I think there ought to be constant concern as to the priestly side. The priestly side refers to spiritual formation, so that they are all in line for the service. The Levites stood and the priests stood and as soon as the burnt-offering began the trumpets began. The priestly side comes first.
E.P. Would the trumpet keep it up to pitch? The instruments of David would be more the stringed instruments.
J.T. I think they refer to the higher tone of the service, the higher feelings of the brethren. Suppose you were at Troas; you sit among the brethren and if Paul were there you would feel, I think I will wait for Paul. Paul got up and he discoursed for a long time. Why did he do that? If a young brother got up and did that the brethren would say, It is quite out of order. But Paul's word is the thing needed at the moment. I believe that is what the service of the priest means; there is no doubt about it, the trumpet is easily heard.
J.W.D. Do you not think all the brethren at Troas would not only like to hear the trumpet in regard to the breaking of bread, but to hear such a servant as Paul giving thanks to the Father?
{25}
J.T. I should be very sorry if I were in a meeting with Paul and he did not get an opportunity to speak to God, I should like to give him an opportunity to speak to God.
C.H.H. Is the trumpet associated with the rapture, the ascent spiritually?
J.T. The trump of God, quite so.
J.R.H. At the end of verse 29 evidently a very high note is reached in worship. But in verse 30 "king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer". And after that "they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped". Would you not say the worship there reached a higher note? Would that give room for a word as giving a stimulus to a still higher move?
J.T. It looks that way. It is remarkable the distinction made there between the end of verse 29 where "The king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped", and verse 30 where "king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer". It is entirely an authoritative spiritual matter. They commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David, not only with the instruments of David, but with the words of David and Asaph. The whole of the first book of Psalms you might say is David's, and two-thirds of the third book is Asaph's. So we are now concerned about words; not the music, but the actual hymns that are given out; not only the instruments of David, but the words have to be noted here, "The words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped". The Levites here "bowed their heads and worshipped", it is a most exalted side of the position. At the end of verse 29 "The king and all that were present with
{26}
him ... worshipped", that is the whole meeting, you might say; but verse 30 is a higher side of the position; the Levites under the direction of the king are using certain words. It is not only the tune, but what kind of words do you use? What kind of hymns do you choose? What are the actual things said? Do you use the best? David and Asaph represent the best of the book of Psalms in that sense.
E.G.McA. Would verse 27 indicate the spiritual condition of a meeting? In verse 28, "And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded, all the time until the burnt-offering was finished". As a result of this we have these heights of worship and praise to God.
J.T. I think so. We are moving up. Verse 30 goes beyond because it says, "They sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped", as if what is going on deepens the feelings God-ward.
T.W. In relation to revival in any locality, do you not think you would look for these elements in it, king, princes, priests and Levites, prophets and people?
J.T. That is where things are worked out. We have spoken of the assembly in the universal aspect of the house, but the actual working out of administrative service is in localities.
C.T. Why is the word 'gladness' added in that verse?
J.T. Gladness is a great matter. We shall see more of it as we go on because we get it in the last verse: "And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people". It is one of the finest elements, there is real stimulation in it. Gladness and joy amongst us -- there is real testimony in that! Persons are affected in a joyful way.
{27}
REVIVAL (2)
@2 Chronicles 30: 1 - 27
J.T. We read chapter 29 this morning in order to bring out the idea of revival as instanced in the reign of Hezekiah. It was pointed out that he began at the mature age of twenty-five, and immediately, we are told, he "opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them". I thought that the opening of the doors corresponded to Philadelphia where the Lord Jesus speaks of Himself as "the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens", @Revelation 3: 7. He has moved in our times in the way of revival in the past century and opened the doors of the house of God to us. It says, "he who opens and no one shall shut". It would mean the entrance into the divine thought, the whole scope of the Lord's mind opened up. Then the cleansing of the house engaged us, how Hezekiah brought the priests and Levites into the open place eastward and spoke to them authoritatively as to their service and the need of cleansing, confessing the guilt of those that preceded him. Then he spoke to them as his sons in a fatherly way, in their dignity as ministers of Jehovah. Then we had the actual account of the cleansing, and the provision made by the king and his princes for the service of God to be resumed; four creatures, seven of each, for the burnt-offering and the sin-offering, so that the service of God was resumed. The burnt-offering began and the song of the Lord began and proceeded. We ended with the joy: "Hezekiah rejoiced", it says in the last verse, "and all the people, that God had prepared the people; for the thing was done suddenly". It was a divine movement, it was not any effort on man's part to work up a revival. It was God's work and His people were ready, He prepared them indeed.
{28}
Hence we have in chapter 29: 10 the great fundamental position of revival, things are being done according to order, the saints are being stirred up to give so that there is wealth and joy; in fact it is brought out that "God had prepared the people", a very great matter.
Now what we have to look at next in the revival is the ordered feasts, what characterises the dispensation in the way of stated feasts, beginning with the passover. If there be a revival, God would have things in some sense in keeping with the whole dispensation. There is that which distinguishes our dispensation from the past one and from the future one. I suggested reading chapter 30 to show that we have now arrived at the features which characterise the whole dispensation in the sense of appointed feasts.
A.B. It says at the close of chapter 29, "And the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order"; not exactly the house but the service.
J.T. Very good, preparing for what we are saying. I think God is concerned now with the features of the dispensation. Each dispensation has its own features, and ours has its features. This chapter would provide for that.
J.W.D. What is meant by the expression, "all Israel and Judah" (verse 1)?
J.T. It is a universal thought. There is only one assembly; the revival is not a partisan matter. It took place of course in a very small way in certain countries, but it spread out to all Israel, to the whole assembly. God has nothing less than that in His mind. It would show us that no movement of God is partisan, but the whole assembly must be in mind. The assembly gives character to the dispensation; we must have the whole thought.
S.McC. That would be in mind in the thought of rallying to Jerusalem. It says in the end of verse 3,
{29}
"Neither had the people been gathered together to Jerusalem".
J.T. In the end of verse 5 it says, "because they had not held it for a long time as it was written". They may have held it but it was not held "as it was written". The idea of Jerusalem would be taken up from @Exodus 20: 24: "In all places where I shall make my name to be remembered, I will come unto thee, and bless thee". That was where the holy convocations were to be held three times in the year. There were seven of them, but three of them were selected according to @Deuteronomy 16 as representing the spiritual side of the feasts that were all to be held as appointed. So the position is maintained, the dispensation is maintained in the recognition of these feasts.
G.A.T. Would you say cleansing must take place before this chapter could come in, as we had this morning? Evil must be judged and put away.
J.T. That is the teaching of chapter 29, and is encouraging to look at. There are healthy conditions in the way of wealth, spiritual wealth, so that God is served in chapter 29. Now He would have recourse to His special appointments in the way of public convocations, what is in keeping with the dispensation, and on that account I think the Spirit of God has greatly stressed the Lord's supper for us. It has a greater place now perhaps than it had in the revival.
J.B. Why are Ephraim and Manasseh not mentioned in Israel? It says that he "wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh". Why is that?
J.T. Ephraim and Manasseh were representing the tribe of Joseph. Joseph had the birthright, given to him on account of Reuben's failure (@1 Chronicles 5: 1); that is, they came into a leading place in the dispensation of old, and there was evidently rivalry between them and Judah. Ephraim and Manasseh
{30}
stand for one thought, that is leadership. But God had recourse to Judah, and Judah got the first place, that is through David. I think the allusion is to any rival elements; they are to be met and if possible to be won over in a righteous way. I think that is why these two are mentioned specially. The general thought is that "Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh"; they were specially singled out for the letters, as if God would say to any rival element. You are wanted, if you can come on God's terms.
J.W.D. In @Luke 22 following the inauguration of the Supper there was also strife amongst them as to who should be the greatest. Is that a similar thought?
J.T. That is good. It shows the readiness of the flesh to show itself in rivalry, "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good", @Romans 12: 21. That is what comes out here.
J.R.H. Would you say Hezekiah had a great spiritual unity in view in which Ephraim was not to envy Judah?
J.T. It is anticipative of that, the final restoration of Israel. Ezekiel brings that out. They are to be brought together as one to Christ, one stick, "Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not trouble Ephraim", @Isaiah 11: 13. Hezekiah would show he is in keeping with that; he would have them on divine terms. So it says that "they established a decree to make proclamation throughout Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; because they had not held it for a long time as it was written. And the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, return to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
{31}
Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. And be not like your fathers and like your brethren, who transgressed against Jehovah the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see. Now, harden not your necks, as your fathers; yield yourselves to Jehovah, and come to his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever; and serve Jehovah your God, that the fierceness of his anger may turn away from you. For if ye return to Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion with those that have carried them captive, so that they shall come again unto this land; for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return to him" (verses  5 - 9), a very remarkable appeal from Hezekiah in the grace and in the Spirit of Christ, overcoming rivalry in these words conveyed. There is no compromising the truth. We love our brethren and we want them on divine terms and only on divine terms. There is every encouragement to return; the Lord is ready to help.
J.W. Is this a city matter? The posts passed through from city to city in conveyance of the message. What bearing has that on what you say?
J.T. I suppose cities are representative of local responsibility. A city is not like a nation, a city is local. It may be metropolitan but it has local responsibility I think. What do you think yourself?
J.W. I thought so. The message would come to the local position.
J.T. The Lord said, "Ye shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come" (@Matthew 10: 23), meaning that the cities as visited would represent the whole country. He sent the seventy out "two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come", @Luke 10: 1.
{32}
Rem. The Lord would adjust all the saints. Each Lord's day morning is a fresh occasion for adjustment in the locality.
J.T. That is a right feeling with which to sit down at the Lord's supper, to remember our brethren, those who are not present. But we can go on because of those who are present. "all Israel that were present", @2 Chronicles 31: 1. But you miss those who are absent, as the Lord Himself said, "But the nine, where are they?". But you never want them on the ground of compromise, of accommodation, always on divine terms.
Rem. At Corinth matters had to be judged. They were saying, "*I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ", @1 Corinthians 1: 12. Until that had been dealt with the Supper could not be properly taken as he describes in chapter 11.
J.T. That is a fact, the divisions were there, they came together in divisions and they carried the divisions into the meeting. It brings out the discipline of God. Moreover Paul said, "it is not to eat the Lord's supper". Hence we are clear about that side, no party can have the Lord's supper; it is a universal thought and belongs to the whole assembly seen in any locality. But "there exist divisions among you", he says. "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper".
C.H.H. I was wondering if this would correspond in any way to Paul's final invitation to Israel in the Acts, inviting the whole nation into what was to characterise christianity, to come into the new dispensation. They rejected it, but some received it. When he was in his own hired house he sent for them and gave them a final word.
J.T. "The Jews went away, having great reasoning among themselves", @Acts 28: 29. He had quoted @Isaiah 6: 9, 10 to them. It is a judicial pronouncement.
{33}
People may go on in their position to a point in which the matter is fixed and there is no hope for them. So that they went away, "Paul having spoken one word" to them from Isaiah. This is a judicial pronouncement as to Israel being shut out from their privileges now because of their hardness. So he says, "Lo, we turn to the nations", (@Acts 13: 46); and "This salvation of God has been sent to the nations; *they* also will hear it", @Acts 28: 28. That is the position now, a fixed state of things. Since Paul said that, the Jews as such have been left under the governmental dealings with limitations of God. It is a very solemn matter. It fits in here with Hezekiah; it implies that if Ephraim and Manasseh are to have part in the passover it must be on the divine terms.
S.P. Would these letters in going out to all these cities throughout the land carry the moral influence of Jerusalem as connected with this revival?
J.T. God had not yet rejected Jerusalem, He was still owning it. It was the place where He had placed His name according to @Exodus 20: 24. So that the door was open: "He that has the key of David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open", @Revelation 3: 7. This is an open door to them still. And so in Laodicea, "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me", @Revelation 3: 20. He is knocking at the door of Ephraim and Manasseh. Who will open to him? Some of them do, that is a comfort.
E.G.McA. Is the reference to gathering to Jerusalem the principle that overcomes any independent local features? We are together on the Lord's day morning in the light of the whole assembly, shutting out any local independence.
J.T. That is important here because Jerusalem is the appointed place. It goes back to @Exodus 20: 24,
{34}
where the service of God is formally set up: "Where I shall make my name to be remembered"; and there is a description there of the altar of earth and the altar of stone. God is insisting on what He will have now. Any local party might say, We will have the Lord's supper, and of course they could in the outward form; but according to what is just remarked we can say definitely that it is not the Lord's supper. It is on party lines. Jerusalem meets the divine thought as to where it stands, anything else is spurious.
J.W.D. Do you think Jerusalem stands for Paul's ministry?
J.T. I think so. David went to Jerusalem "against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land", and took the city. It had a great place in the mind of God. In Melchizedek we have the thought of Jerusalem; we have it in Joshua, in Judges, and we have it in 1 Samuel. David took the head of the giant there. It is the divine position in the mind of God that He never gives up, and spiritual understanding lays hold of it so that anything else is spurious. Samaria was a rival to Jerusalem. The woman said to the Lord, "Ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship". The Lord said, We say right, that is the divine mind. But then that went just so far, and we understand now what it means when He says, "The hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father", @John 4: 21. That is, the geographical thought is not reckoned any more, but the spiritual thought is, and Jerusalem is Jerusalem still. It represents the place where God causes His name to be remembered. Divine 'cause' is not what any man undertakes to do; as in the end of chapter 29, it is the people that "God had prepared". God must be the great cause of all these matters: "where I shall make my name to be remembered, I will come unto thee, and
{35}
bless thee". I might say, I am going to start a meeting. That does not count at all, that is spurious.
E.G.McA. "And they rose up and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem; and they took away all the incense-altars, and cast them into the torrent Kidron". Is that the effect of it?
J.T. "The torrent Kidron" is, I think, the moral side of the matter, how all these evils are dealt with. It is not simply Christ, but the death of Christ, everything must conform to that. So that our fellowship is *the* fellowship, the true fellowship, it is the fellowship of God's Son, the fellowship of His death, and the fellowship of the Spirit.
Ques. "We, being many, are one loaf", @1 Corinthians 10: 17. Is that the universal thought?
J.T. Yes, 'we' not 'ye'; it is the universal thought.
J.W.D. "This is my body, which is for you", @1 Corinthians 11: 24. Is "you" the local thought?
J.T. It is more the gentiles there. In the way it is put in Corinthians it is for the gentiles, for such as they, I think. It is not 'given' there, but "for you"; it is our portion as well as that of those that were at Jerusalem with the twelve.
Ques. Are you suggesting that the Lord's supper is not optional with me?
J.T. Oh no, divine things are never optional. All divine requirements are imperative.
G.A.T. In verse 10 there is one class of people who "mocked them", and in verse 11 another class who humbled themselves. Would they be the class who can partake of the Supper rightly?
J.T. In verse 11 they open their doors, "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him", @Revelation 3: 20. In verse 10 the couriers "passed from city to city through the country of
{36}
Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them". That was the general attitude. But then verse 11 says, "Nevertheless certain of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem". That is a comfort and I think should stimulate us to keep on, to put the truth before our brethren who are turned aside. Some "humbled themselves"; even if it is only one it is worth while.
J.W. In view of being brought into "the unity of the faith", @Ephesians 4: 13. God gave them "one heart" (verse 12).
J.T. Quite so, that is very good. "The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of Jehovah. And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to hold the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation". So that we need not be discouraged.
E.G.McA. What bearing has this feast of unleavened bread in this chapter on the inside clearance of what is evil in the house of God in the previous chapter? Is this more the external side of the truth?
J.T. I think it is the external position, as in 1 Corinthians. Galatians and Ephesians are more the inside position. I think God is concerned about having the dispensation restored in its orderliness; that is to characterise the dispensation publicly.
Rem. We need some more help on that matter as to whether the Supper is optional or whether it should be regular with those breaking bread.
J.T. It is not optional; and those who think it is and sometimes refrain from taking it, those who are nominally in fellowship, may think that they are immune from judgment because they are not doing anything wrong in a positive way. But chapter 9 of
{37}
Numbers would show that one who fails to keep the passover -- one who can do it and does not -- shall, after allowing him full grace to come in the second month instead of the first month, be cut off; cut off not because of what he *is* doing but because of what he is *not* doing.
G.A.T. Is it your thought that if I wilfully stay away from the Supper, maybe for a few Lord's days and then go back again, I should be dealt with on that account?
J.T. Well, of course it is a question of what is underneath an attitude like that. No chapters suggest more grace than the chapters we are reading. @Numbers 9 is a drastic description as to delinquents, those who are delinquent in regard to what marks the dispensation. The passover was the outstanding convocation, the first one; anyone who was delinquent there was cut off most drastically. He is simply cut off. But if it was a case of one Lord's day or two or three, that would need to be inquired into. Each case has to be dealt with separately as it comes up, according to the facts governing it. The Lord looks to the local brethren for discernment in connection with such; it would be a question of judging the attitude.
Ques. Is local administration carried on on the basis of precedent?
J.T. Precedent has something to do with it. The word 'precedent' has a great place in legal administration in the world. What one judge allows is for another to act upon and what one court holds is held by another to act upon. But when we come to divine things the only precedent we can go by is what we have recorded in Scripture. The book of the Acts is peculiarly a book of precedents rather than injunctions, not what we are enjoined to do, but what was done. It is what was done by the apostles and early brethren. It is for us to discern and compare
{38}
what may exist now with what is written; the whole position reverts to priestly discernment. Is this the precedent we can go by? Therefore precedent can only apply up to a point; what goes with it is the discernment of the priests locally and their judgment. "Why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?" @Luke 12: 57. Whatever others think, do ye what is right, that is a charge put on the local company. Therefore we have to consider the facts as well as the precedent and the injunctions governing it. I think it is important in assembly administration as to what we are governed by. It may be that London has done this or that, but that will not do in itself. We first have to determine the facts of the case. The types show that these facts have to be weighed in a priestly way; priests are to do things; that is the spiritual element. There must always be a spiritual lead in a local meeting; we are not to be communistic. A local lead is always contemplated. We are told in @Acts 14 that Paul and Barnabas went away "having chosen them elders in each assembly", meaning, We are going back to Antioch and we shall not be here to help the brethren, but we will elect these elders, persons who are qualified to rule, that is to give a spiritual lead in the locality. So that in Derbe or Lystra if anything came up amongst them they would not necessarily have to write to Paul about it, although he would be glad to answer their questions. The first epistle to the Corinthians was an answer to inquiry largely. He is ready to answer their questions, but then the idea is that *they* are able to deal with matters. The Lord would be with them. These elders are definitely selected by the apostles to keep things going according to God. Therefore when a matter comes up it is for them to determine the facts and weigh them and then apply the principle, the divine instruction given covering this particular matter. And I think it is of
{39}
vast importance that we should know how to deal with matters in each local company.
C.H.H. That necessitates spirituality more than gift.
J.T. Well, it does; eldership is no question of gift, it is divine choice. God puts a man forward because by his qualifications he is manifestly suited for the service.
Rem. In @John 8 the case brought before the Lord indicates that the priestly element was lacking in connection with the woman. They were not able to settle the case themselves.
J.T. Quite so.
S.McC. If there are unsettled issues in our localities it would be a great exercise to those who are supposed to give a lead in the matter.
J.T. The Lord would encourage us in our localities to settle matters. For instance, if it was a question of ordinary practical righteousness, set the least esteemed in the assembly to handle that. Remember we are to judge angels; we are to judge the world. Why cannot we learn to judge now? The Lord would put that upon us; we ought to be able to look after matters. Not that the apostle would not answer their inquiries, but still the assemblies were set up with elders. I believe the Lord would help us to determine the facts and then to apply divine principles.
C.H.H. Something too difficult might occur amongst the tribes for the local judge to determine. In that case they were to send for the judge who would be "in those days".
J.T. That is good. There are not only elders, they being local, but there are persons who are gifted and available universally. There is the gift of government, for instance, and persons with the word of wisdom ought to be used, if available, whether local or otherwise.
{40}
J.W.D. The elders are more connected with discipline, not with matters connected with the public framework of the truth.
J.T. Quite so; so they chose elders in each assembly. Titus was to "establish elders in each city", @Titus 1: 5. The elder in a city was to have jurisdiction in his own city. In @Acts 14 they chose elders, as if to say, We want local companies able to stand on their own feet and look after matters. God said "I ... taught Ephraim to walk" (@Hosea 11: 3); and we want local meetings to walk. Not that they cannot write and ask questions, they can; but the responsibility attaches to local persons.
C.H.H. Do you make a distinction between the elders in Titus and the elders in each assembly?
J.T. In @Acts 14 it is just elders in each *assembly*, but in Titus we have a further thought of ordaining elders in every *city*. So that if there is a subdivision in the city all the elders in the city would have rule there; the elder in the city has rule in the city.
Ques. Is not the thought of an elder that he takes care of matters so as not to burden the assembly with too many unnecessary details?
J.T. Quite so. Confidence enables us to settle a great many things without going to the assembly at all. The assembly is the last resource; that is what @Matthew 18 would teach us. Still, we must not be settling things in the care meeting, or have leading brothers settling matters among themselves; we must always have the assembly before us.
Ques. Peter tells the elders to "Shepherd the flock of God", @1 Peter 5: 2.
J.T. They were to be examples to the flock. Our brother here wants to know more about why the Lord said in His message to Paul, "This is my body, which is for you". The word 'given' is not there in @1 Corinthians 11, it is just "for you". I think the Lord would convey to the gentiles at that time that
{41}
He was thinking of them as well as of the Jewish christians.
J.W. Would it be the truth of Paul's ministry finding expression in that way, in the "you", Paul being the apostle of the gentiles?
J.T. I think the Lord had that in mind. Paul says, "For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you", @1 Corinthians 11: 23. The Lord would have in mind that the gentiles had an equal place in His affections with the Jewish christians, because the primary introduction of the Lord's supper was in connection with the Jewish remnant.
C.H.H. Why does the passover set forth here in chapter 30 exceed anything which Moses ever wrote? Would it be something similar to @1 Corinthians 5 extending to the Lord's supper? Here they had peace-offerings, heave-offerings and burnt-offerings.
J.T. I think Deuteronomy would furnish some instruction for this, there were other offerings besides the passover lamb itself. It seems that there is increase in the passover, and the Lord partook of it at the last passover supper with all that entered into it. It would include all that entered into it in the way of spiritual addition, because we have things added later that are not mentioned in Exodus. As to the Lord's supper, we know that features are added to it in the Lord's message to Paul that we do not get at the beginning. For instance, he would decry the Lord's supper being held house-wise; not that a brother's house could not be the meeting room, but he would decry the thought of a christian adding the Lord's supper to one of his own meals, which I think was a custom at the beginning, according to @1 Corinthians 11. Paul dissociates the Lord's supper from their houses; he says, "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking?" (verse 22). It is remarkable how he connects the assembly with the Lord's body in a peculiar way.
{42}
Ques. Would you help us a little more about the houses?
J.T. They were partaking of the Lord's supper in relation to ordinary meals, and they were putting those who had no houses to shame and despising the assembly of God, "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking?", he says. Ordinary household matters should not come into the assembly at all. He dissociates the assembly from all household influences; the Lord's supper belongs properly to the assembly and cannot be taken in any private way.
C.H.H. The additional thought is in @1 Corinthians 10, "We, being many, are one loaf, one body". That is not given in the gospels.
S.McC. Supposing there was a brother living in a certain locality isolated from the brethren; would it be right to visit him and take the Supper with him?
J.T. That would need to be inquired into; it is a question of the history of the place. Supposing the assembly had been there and had dwindled down, and perhaps there were only one or two: you would have to consider whether the Lord would still recognise them; and if there are any there, why is there not the Lord's supper? I am only saying these matters need careful consideration. You cannot lay down what should happen, it is a question of the conditions there.
C.H.H. "Come and let us return unto Jehovah, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before his face", @Hosea 6: 1, 2. Might revival be on this line?
J.T. Quite so, "Return to Jehovah", that is the word here. They wrote letters that they should come to Jerusalem, as we read it already, "Harden not your necks, as your fathers; yield yourselves to Jehovah, and come to his sanctuary, which he has
{43}
sanctified for ever; and serve Jehovah your God, that the fierceness of his anger may turn away from you. For if ye return to Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion with those that have carried them captive, so that they shall come again unto this land". According to the state of our souls God will act in a remarkable way with the very "powers that be" to help us. The point is, "if ye return"; there is needed a state of soul to come back to God, to His sanctuary, a most touching appeal to any one who has turned his back on the truth.
E.P. Would it fit in with the thought of @Psalm 122: 5: "For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David"?
J.T. Just so.
A.H.P. I was wondering whether what is being said would tend to help us as to the dignity of the local assembly, and then as to the local assembly recognising the dignity of the assembly in its universal setting.
J.T. What we are at here is the importance of returning, and the ministry of the Lord would help us in our attitude toward persons who are turned away. I think Hezekiah's letters here are very beautiful and helpful and they are touching. We want you all back, he is saying, Jerusalem is Jerusalem still; God has not changed His mind about it, that is where He has recorded His name, where Israel's males came up three times in a year. The first convocation is the passover. Here it is! Why should you not have part in this? Why should you be exempt? He encourages them all, saying, "If ye return to Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion with those that have carried them captive, so that they shall come again unto this land; for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return to him". It is a most appealing word,
{44}
and if we regard it God will act in our circumstances. If I move in this way toward God others will be helped; they will take account of what I am doing and it will help others to do the same thing.
G.A.T. What you say is very encouraging, as to what we find when we return. I have to go to my brethren in this day and what should I expect there?
J.T. The thing is that the saints reflect what is in the mind of God. The assembly is intended to reflect the grace of heaven, so a returning one finds the grace of heaven amongst the saints. I think that is what the Lord meant in @John 20: 23, "whose soever sins ye remit"; grace is in the assembly.
E.P. In his second epistle Paul is concerned that that spirit should be amongst the saints at Corinth. I was thinking of the personal appeal of Paul, "I ... entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ", @2 Corinthians 10: 1.
J.T. Quite so.
S.P. Would you suggest that in Ezra there was a movement in the hearts of the people in captivity before there was a movement in the heart of Cyrus sovereignly?
J.T. Exactly. God moves with us and then with the rulers; the issue is in the state of the people. If the state is right with us God will move. I have thought a great deal of that in connection with our brethren on the Continent now. The question arises -- Is the state of the people right? If the people are right God works with the rulers.
H.B. Would you say those who have been turned aside may be reached with this message?
J.T. Yes. The post here is rather an official courier, it would not be just any messenger at all. You may be sure Hezekiah selected the right people, spiritual men, to go with this message. I believe it would refer today to the ministry that is current amongst us. The work of those who have the truth
{45}
is largely amongst our brethren who have turned aside, to get them back. The Lord is ready to receive them: "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in", @Revelation 3: 20. There are not only knocks; many have the knocks, that is, bereavements, sickness, financial troubles and what not; those are the knocks but the voice is not heard in them. Then, "if any one hear my voice" -- it is not the knock, it is the voice of Christ that appeals to me -- "and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me". That "he with me" would mean that He would bring me into the assembly.
C.H.H. Would it be similar to a tree cut down, yet its roots are in the ground? The ministry is capable of restoring one if the roots are in the ground.
J.T. That is worth considering. The actual word is, "There is hope for a tree, if it be cut down it will sprout again", @Job 14: 7. There are other references which bear on it, as in @Ecclesiastes 11: 3, "in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be". That is, it would finally be found there. But Job says there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that is, some hand has acted on it. A fall does not mean that any hand has acted on it, it falls because of decay or rottenness. Wherever it falls its position is fixed, "there it shall be". But if a divine hand is operating on it, there is hope of it even if it lies there. It is worth looking at @Job 14: 7 - 9: "it will sprout again, and its tender branch will not cease; though its root grow old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground, yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a young plant". It is a very remarkable thing, I think; it is the difference between a person who falls through moral decay, so that there is nothing to support it -- it goes and there it is -- and one who is cut down. There is hope for that
{46}
one; God is cutting down a live tree; there is something there that God is dealing with. It is in the ground. It says, "Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground", yet there is something in it. Why did any hand cut it down if not for a purpose? If you apply it to God, there is hope for it; if you see God is dealing with a man governmentally, judicially, there is hope for him. He has the sense of scent, he desires the word of God and springs up and brings forth "boughs like a young plant". That I think is worth while going over; it is very remarkable how God deals with His people.
Ques. Does not verse 18 confirm that? "For a multitude of the people, many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, and they ate the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them saying, Jehovah, who is good, forgive every one that has directed his heart to seek God". It would bring out whether there are any roots there, any work of God. It is the dispensational right of God to pardon according to the work of God in them.
J.T. There are new names here. When the recovery takes place it spreads out wide, not only Ephraim and Manasseh but others as well, Issachar and Zebulun. They had not cleansed themselves, and they ate the passover otherwise than it was written. They are exposed in what they are doing, but then there is priestly grace available when people are on these lines. They are coming back with wrong thoughts, but they are coming back. They are partaking of the thing, not rightly, but still there is a priestly touch here. Hezekiah prays for them and he says to God, "Forgive every one that has directed his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, although not according to the purification of the sanctuary. And Jehovah hearkened to
{47}
Hezekiah, and healed the people". That is a beautiful reference to the Lord's priestly intercession for us. The point is, are you going at all? Is your heart with the brethren? Have you got it in your heart to be with your brethren in a right way?
E.G.McA. Would Hezekiah see there what you referred to in regard to the tree cut down? It budded and put forth boughs. Would they return in that way?
J.T. I think it represents the scent of water. Hezekiah's message would be water, the word of God, and there is sensitiveness as to it. "Jehovah, who is good", very beautiful; of course Hezekiah's beseeching should be with us, the spirit of intercession for our brethren so that Jehovah might help them.
E.G.McA. In any one turning his face toward the brethren again you would expect to see some evidence of divine work as in this passage in Job.
J.T. Talk to him and see what he says; then you get at the root. If he says, 'I liked that word last night', he has the scent of water. He sees God in it, in the word of God; he has the scent of water, and you say there is certainly hope of that man.
Rem. In @Acts 2: 37 they say, "What shall we do, brethren?". The scent of water had its effect.
J.T. Exactly, at Peter's address they repented. It was the word of God to them.
J.R.H. Would the scent of water be in Paul's mind when he said, "What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and in a spirit of meekness?" @1 Corinthians 4: 21.
J.T. He was counting on it and he counted on it rightly because Titus came back with great joy in his heart. One has often thought of the meeting between Paul and Titus. What joy it afforded Paul and what joy it afforded Titus because the Corinthians were affected by the word of God!
{48}
G.A.T. You would say the scent of water is like enjoying the ministry?
J.T. You can tell by the way people speak of the ministry; not simply that they enjoy it, but how it affects them.
E.G.McA. I got help from your reference to the scent of water. There is something in them that will respond. We are not to cast them off, saying, They never were any good; but you would find in speaking to them that there is still something of God.
J.T. Like the trunk of a tree, we must never give them up, because one day something may happen and they will respond.
J.W. Would there be a connection with Eutychus falling from the window in @Acts 20 and Paul coming down?
J.T. That is more than the word of God; Paul's embrace is a great thing. "His life is in him", he says. He knew the thing was there, his life was in him.
S.P. You say, You must never give them up. Would you amplify that?
J.T. I mean such as Job describes; but if it is a tree that has fallen as Ecclesiastes says, "toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be", @Ecclesiastes 11: 3. But if it be cut down -- if you think of a brother who has sinned seriously, but God is dealing with him, and when you talk to him about the Lord Jesus, about the word of God, there is response in him and he is not argumentative -- that man has got the sense of scent. The word 'scent' is important. There are five senses. The writer in the Hebrews refers to those who have their senses exercised. As soon as a man exercises his sense of scent you must keep on with him; presently he becomes like a young plant, not the trunk of a tree any more. Maybe he was a brother who had some distinction; he has forfeited
{49}
it now, he has got to begin over again, like a young plant.
E.P. Do you think Job himself is the tree he is speaking of? Elihu had words for God and then God heals him at the close.
J.T. Quite so. I think Job said a great deal that he did not understand, but the book is a valuable account of what he said. What he said was right, only in the wrong position; he spoke "words ... without knowledge" (@Job 35: 16); he did not know what he was talking about. The things are right; as a matter of fact he is using the figure of the tree in this chapter, not knowing that he is describing a man whom God is disciplining, and that he himself was that man.
G.W. Nebuchadnezzar was a tree cut down. His understanding returned to him and he "blessed the Most High", @Daniel 4: 34.
J.T. The stump was there.
J.B. You get in @Hosea 14: 8, "Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? ... I am like a green fir-tree -- From me is thy fruit found".
J.T. Quite so, very good.
C.H.H. Would the prophecy of Hosea as quoted correspond with Hezekiah? It is so coloured with the knowledge of God.
J.T. I think Hezekiah represents the Spirit of Christ vested in benign authority. Throughout these two chapters he speaks with remarkable authority, but he is very gracious; for instance, he has the right to speak to the priests and Levites but the second time he calls them "my sons", a gracious way of dealing with souls. So I think he reflects beautifully the Spirit of Christ in all this revival. How successful he is as we move on in these chapters! Success marks every verse. It is encouraging for us to go on. God has been working and is working and let us go on in that light.
{50}
G.A.T. If a brother returns to us who has been away, how should we receive him? Should we shake hands with him?
J.T. It is a question of each case being dealt with according to its own facts. You are not holding anything against him. Things have to be dealt with but you are not enlarging on his guilt, "Whose soever sins ye remit" (@John 20: 23), as if the Lord were saying, I leave the matter with you. It is for the local brethren to decide as to this man; the Lord has confidence in the brethren. Matthew would say, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven" (chapter 18: 18). Matthew is severe and we are entitled to use severity if the case requires it. The local brethren are the ones who should know. You may be sure that Hezekiah was the principal person with whom God wrought; you may be sure God had taken him in hand well before he brought him into this public position to represent His mind. If He is going to work He will prepare men, discipline them beforehand. Take a man like Elijah, we have not a single word about his previous history, but he has had a previous history. He said to Ahab, "There shall not be dew nor rain these years, except by my word", @1 Kings 17: 1. He had been with God.
Ques. So Paul says, "Not a novice"; is that the thought?
J.T. God chooses his man for the work, you may be sure of that. But we must go on if we are to finish our chapter. It says in verse 21, "And the children of Israel, that were present at Jerusalem, held the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness". You may be sure if the thing is right and rightly entered upon, God is with us; He loves to be with us and make it a success. It goes on to say, "And the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, with the instruments of praise
{51}
to Jehovah. And Hezekiah spoke consolingly to all the Levites that had understanding in the good knowledge of Jehovah". This calls attention to the brethren who are serving, who have understanding of the mind of God. "And they ate the feast-offerings the seven days, sacrificing peace-offerings, and extolling Jehovah the God of their fathers". You can see how successful all this is, how Hezekiah is exercising the Spirit of Christ in it. He spoke consolingly to persons who had a good knowledge of God. Then they were "sacrificing peace-offerings", which is a new thought here referring to a general state of felicity, a happy state of things amongst the brethren. They are not occupied with this, and saying, How well we are getting on! They are making much of God, "extolling Jehovah the God of their fathers". The answer to all this is that "the whole congregation took counsel to observe other seven days; and they observed the seven days with gladness. For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation as heave-offering: a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests hallowed themselves. And the whole congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. And there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had not been the like in Jerusalem". I think what is to be observed in these closing verses is the great increase. Having entered upon a course of revival brethren are brought into it and continue in it. There is increase, there is great increase so that they are able to carry on seven days more. It shows the sustained wealth of the people. And then we have the thought that there had not been anything
{52}
like this since the time of Solomon, a tribute to what was there, double seven days, alluding to the ability to carry on for fourteen days.
Rem. It is spontaneous.
J.T. Quite so.
J.H. What is the thought in the priests merging with the Levites as in the last verse?
J.T. "And the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people"; we already alluded to that this morning. In Deuteronomy and Joshua there is hardly any distinction made between priests and Levites; those who are serving are in a state of priesthood. It alludes to the great spiritual wealth that accrued here in this revival. You can hardly distinguish between the priests and the Levites, they are the same in truth; in antitype they are the same person only they are becoming more spiritual, "And their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, to the heavens". What a wonderful result that the whole thing goes up to heaven! How much accrues to God out of all this! I think the Lord is helping the brethren into what develops for God, the highest conception.
Ques. "The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to do service unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah", @Deuteronomy 21: 5. Is that the thought?
J.T. They have reached the full thought; that is a good point. These two chapters show that this revival leads us up to what is for God.
J.R.H. The climax is in full accord with Solomon's greatest day, in connection with God's holy habitation in heaven. Does this final verse show that?
J.T. I think so; a double time, to observe other seven days. That is, there is enough spiritual power to proceed with other seven days. That same thing had happened in Solomon's dedication of the house, that is what is alluded to here. Not that this exceeded
{53}
Solomon's day, but rather that there had been nothing like it since Solomon: "There had not been the like in Jerusalem".
G.A.T. Who do the princes stand for, and the strangers in Israel?
J.T. I think the princes would allude to those of spiritual wealth who could do things for others. Strangers would be those who came by invitation from the other tribes; they too had part in this joy.
C.H.H. Would verse 23 indicate that Hezekiah and the princes taking the spiritual lead had secured the whole congregation?
J.T. It is a remarkable thing, "the whole congregation"; we are ready to go home from meetings like this after two or three days. It is right enough in a way but the point is, Am I equal to a prolonged spiritual occasion, or are fleshly instincts predominant with me so that I can only stand two or three days? The point here is the state, and that all comes about through a process. These are good times and we want to go on with them, they "took counsel to observe other seven days".
{54}
REVIVAL (3)
@2 Chronicles 34: 14 - 33; @2 Chronicles 35: 1 - 19
J.T. We can see, I believe, in this inquiry that each revival in Israel has an especial feature. So in Hezekiah's revival we see the wealth developed, and then how they had recourse to what should mark the dispensation publicly. It is obvious that in a revival attention has to be paid to moral conditions first; and as we saw in the reading yesterday morning, the process brings out the latent wealth that is there, increasing as the feast goes on and as the season of blessing goes on. In chapter 30 there was the passover which suggests what marks the dispensation, what marked that dispensation; the Lord's supper correspondingly marks ours, and the public service of God, the order that attends it. Thus I think the brethren will have seen that this line of truth is most important for us, verified in our own times in the revival that God has graciously granted in our dispensation, into which we have come and which we are now enjoying. Our responsibility is to maintain it. There was nothing, we are told, like that which Hezekiah inaugurated in the way of revival since the days of Solomon. It lasted fourteen days, it is a double feast marked by joy.
Now Josiah's passover has its own features. It is still the passover but it excels Hezekiah's in that it is held on the fourteenth day of the first month instead of the fourteenth day of the second month, meaning that there was more readiness on this occasion of Josiah's than on Hezekiah's. The outstanding feature here, I think, is the discovery of the book of the law, which is another great feature that God is reviving -- the authority of Scripture as over against the lawlessness which is marking current professed ministry around us. And another thing that may be mentioned in a preliminary way is the
{55}
youthfulness of this monarch. We are told he was eight years old when he began to reign. This is a feature we do well to observe because God is verifying it I believe, indeed I know, in the work in the young amongst us. Since the borrowed principle of Sunday Schools has been exposed and set aside there has been more divine work in very young people. The work leads into the assembly faster than it used to from those schools, for the young get right terms and right feelings amongst the brethren, where they should be and where they should learn. So I think the Spirit of God would remind us in Josiah's service how the young, very young persons, may come into the service. We have his age given first when he began to reign, and then what happened in the eighth year of his reign, in the twelfth year of his reign, and the eighteenth year of his reign, the last bringing him up to the age of twenty-six in which his greatest service was rendered.
A.B. The cleansing and purging seem to enter into this. Would you say something about that?
J.T. Hezekiah's exercise was to open the doors of the house of God and to repair them and then to cleanse the temple. But here Josiah is concerned first of all in the twelfth year of his reign, that is when he was twenty years of age, "to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherahs, and the graven images, and the molten images. And they broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the sun-pillars that were on high above them he cut down; and the Asherahs and the graven images and the molten images he broke in pieces, and made dust of them and strewed it upon the graves of those that had sacrificed to them; and he burned the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem. And so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, in their ruins round about; and
{56}
he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherahs and the graven images into powder, and cut down all the sun-pillars throughout the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem". This is a remarkable range of service, the greatest service rendered by a young servant. But we have to take him not only as a person but as a principle of youthful energy in whomsoever it may be seen acting authoritatively for the general purgation of the saints. There is a ministry which deals with the house of God and the service of God and a ministry that deals with the general state of the saints. The latter requires courage and moral authority, and I think that is seen here. The royal power that this king exercises is symbolical or typical of the authority of Christ exercised now in the power of the Spirit, which will always accompany spiritual ministry.
C.H.H. He seems to be acting on instincts rather than on writing at first.
J.T. That is very good, showing that the work of God is true to itself even before the Scriptures are understood, so that he is ready for the Scriptures when they are brought to him. He is not like a man that goes into things himself and disregards Scripture; he may be ignorant of Scripture but his instincts are right and when the Scriptures are brought to him he is most submissive to them. When the book is found he is affected by it. He accepts responsibility in the eighth year of his reign: "While he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem". That is a word for the present time so that we should not despise youth; on the other hand they should see to it that they are not to be despised. If they are marked by a spirit like this they will not be despised.
J.W.D. What would you say about brothers in a care meeting having difficulty in affording young boys
{57}
and girls the right to break bread because they fear that afterwards they might not be able to stand?
J.T. That is the reason, I think, that the Spirit of God stresses these stages in Josiah's life, showing how they *may* stand. The work of God will stand even in young people, so that the point is to see that it *is* the work of God. It will be normal -- you do not expect grey-haired experience from a boy of twelve, or a girl of twelve; but if the work of God is there it will be true to itself. How exposed they are in the schools! And I believe they should be particularly remembered in that way in our prayers. The Lord is able to make them stand.
E.P. Is there any particular significance in the last verse of the preceding chapter, "And the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead"? I was thinking of the spiritual instincts of the saints coming forward in regard to these things. What do you think?
J.T. It would seem that the general thought of the people was right. The general consensus of opinion is not always right; it is sometimes very wrong, and hence the need of leaders to give a right lead in these acts. It would appear here that the people of the land were right; they had the mind of God. They did not say, Josiah is too young to be upon the throne; and God honoured their action.
S.P. "Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign", chapter 33: 21. They put him down.
J.T. He was not a good choice. He was much older than Josiah when he began to reign, and now the condition of the people of the land had changed. It shows that all these things have to be read in the scripture contextually. What is the context? The context of the scripture here would indicate that the people of the land were right in making this young boy king. There must have been something potential there that was indicated in subsequent history.
{58}
A.B. Would you say too that the work began in him when he was eight years old? "Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign".
J.T. There was something there undoubtedly and the Spirit of God gives scope in the young. We give him eight years to see what that will bring out, for time has its own results. There is no deterioration in him at all, but the contrary; he has the idea of purging the whole country, a big thought, going even beyond Judah and Jerusalem.
Ques. "He began to seek after the God of David his father"; that is a good trait, is it not?
J.T. You are referring to verse 2: it says, "He did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand nor to the left. And in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherahs, and the graven images, and the molten images". I think the Spirit of God is calling attention to the sections or periods of his life; so that the young may come in at the age of eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve, be subject to the truth and to their parents, come to the meetings and enjoy them; and then it is for the brethren to watch and see whether time has a deteriorating influence or the contrary. If it is steady improvement, well that is the work of God.
J.B. @Proverbs 8: 17 says, "I love those that love me; and they that seek me early shall find me". Would this be in keeping with chapter 34: 3?
J.T. "They that seek me early", that is what you mean.
S.P. Does the spiritual movement of Josiah connect up with 2 Timothy? The apostle speaks of Timothy's grandmother -- first of himself, then of
{59}
his grandmother and then of his mother. Would that agree with this?
J.T. It is Timothy that the apostle enjoins, "Let no one despise thy youth" (@1 Timothy 4: 12), as much as to say, This is a youth worth caring for. "Give heed to thyself", he says, and "youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace", @2 Timothy 2: 22. It is a responsibility put on the young to see to themselves, because their youth will be despised unless they show that the work of God is paramount in them.
J.W.D. What would you look for in a young person seeking his place at the Lord's supper? You know there is considerable difficulty about this question.
J.T. In a general way it is a question of instinct that I should look for, whether the instincts there are the mark of the work of God. You get with Jacob, for instance, as unborn, that he is a supplanter. He had no intelligence from education at all, but the instinct was there that he supplanted somebody else, the man after the flesh. That is one thing that may appear in the very earliest stage of life. We get with John the baptist, the babe as yet unborn, that he rejoiced as the voice of the Lord's mother fell upon the ears of his mother, one of the most striking things. All that is to bring out the instincts of the work of God in the very earliest stages of human life. Then when children are being trained at their father's table and in his house, and come to the meetings, it is for parents to watch for these instincts; and the Scriptures enjoin that the truth is to be kept before them in a whole or full way, as illustrated in the idea of the omer of manna. The child is sitting down at his father's breakfast table and it is a large family, perhaps one may be fifteen years of age and others right down to three. The child of three has the same
{60}
amount of manna as the father and mother have and the other children. If he is an inquiring child he would say, 'Why do I get as much as you?' 'My child, that is God's thought for you. You are going to be a man like me. God has no other thought for you at all'. The idea in humanity is not minors or young children but men; hence the first mention of a babe is that he is a man. Eve says, "I have acquired a man with Jehovah", @Genesis 4: 1. So the Lord says, "A man has been born into the world", @John 16: 21. God has no other thought than to make men, not make children but make men. I think if we follow its instincts we shall see developed how God is working in the child.
J.B. Hannah's great exercise in connection with Samuel was seen in the instincts that came out in him later. Her desire was for a man child, and bringing a coat every year would suggest there was development on these lines.
J.T. She had no other thought than that he should be a man and take up things for God. I think the periods or stages here in Josiah's life are very instructive and ought to appeal to every young child in this room. He is in fellowship, you might say, at eight years of age; he is on the throne. At the age of sixteen we are told, "In the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem"; and in verse 8, "And in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the chronicler, to repair the house of Jehovah his God". What a man he was to send these men! What moral power he had to do this, to repair the house of Jehovah his God; not the doors only but the whole house!
{61}
E.P. Do you think in seeking after the God of David his father, he had taken on what had preceded? It was "David his father".
J.T. I think so. David, as we had yesterday, is the standard for all the following kings; and this young king, while he was yet young, "began to seek after the God of David his father".
Ques. Would the twelfth year of his reign refer to the reaching of the military age, twenty years old? It would be in keeping with the book of Numbers.
J.T. It is the military age, but he really attained the military age before in the manly qualities that marked him.
C.H.H. Would the evidence of the work of God in a young person be demonstrated by progress instinctively, in that Josiah did not follow in the steps of his own natural father or grandfather? He passes them over and goes back to David.
J.T. I think that is good. These stages in his life are a guide to us to watch our children. A year ago perhaps my child professed to love the Lord and may have wished to break bread with us. What is he now? Has he made any progress in the time? Because time has its own effect.
E.G.McA. Would you say that in the eighth year of his reign, when "he began to seek after the God of David his father", the light of his position had come home to him? And then we get what follows from there so that in the eighteenth year of his reign he breaks loose from everything that would contradict that position, because these things he breaks down have a religious aspect, have they not?
J.T. Quite so. You are struck with his courage and the wide sphere of operations he takes on, not only in Jerusalem and Judah, but in the other tribes territories.
G.A.T. The secret of all his progress was in the second verse: "He did what was right in the sight
{62}
of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand nor to the left". Would that be the line of walking in the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so; verse 2 is the whole life of the man. It is a sort of introductory word: This is the man we are going to speak of. His whole life is marked in this way; I would like to get the stages of it. Verse 3 begins the stages. We note the effect of time in a brother's life, whether a year makes any difference in him. If it does not there is not much to look for in him.
J.B. "The earth bears fruit of itself, first the blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear", @Mark 4: 28.
J.T. It is the question of seed-time and harvest; the year is divided in that way. It is to bring out what time can do. You must put the seed into the ground, and it must be nurtured; there must be proper attention paid to it.
Ques. I baptise my children, but what have I got in view?
J.T. Quite so. You have the mind of God in view for them.
Ques. Should I not be looking for them to come into fellowship, and the earlier the better?
J.W.D. What are you going to do if the brethren are not happy? They say, Well, in bygone ministry certain prominent brethren decried the idea of young children coming into fellowship.
J.T. One is struck in these great revivals by the great stress laid on the Levites. They refer to brothers of vigour, they are not to serve after they are fifty. They begin at thirty, they are mature; it is twenty with David, but primarily from thirty to fifty years. I believe it is in the ministry that these unhappy brothers should be met. You say they are
{63}
not happy; well, sometimes we do not need to be happy to assert what is right. I think the way the Levites are stressed in these revivals is to call attention to the ministry amongst us, that we are to be in vigour in intelligence, indeed, but in vigour in dealing with all these irregularities. We have carried down considerable tradition and that tradition has to be hewed to pieces if it is not right, not according to God. I believe the prophetic ministry is to meet all that. These meetings for ministry bring in the mind of God, bring it in in power; there it is, that is the truth of this matter or that. Here it is in regard of young people.
J.W.D. You mean in this scripture?
J.T. In this very scripture.
W.L. In regard of young people coming in, where would the responsibility lie? In the persons themselves?
J.T. I think so. There ought to be individual responsibility; every young person is responsible.
W.L. There has been a good deal said in regard to the responsibility of the parents. I was wondering about @1 Corinthians 11: 29 in regard of responsibility, as to the discernment of the body of Christ.
J.T. There ought to be a sense of responsibility in the persons themselves. The parents do not bring them into fellowship; they cease as to any authority with a child as to his place in fellowship. He puts in his claim to the assembly, and it is a matter for the brethren then; they look for a sense of responsibility in the young person and we ought to look for it, because he should stand on his own feet if he is in fellowship; he is a board of the tabernacle, potentially at least; that is, he stands with other boards on the ground of redemption. The parents are responsible to God as to what they have in mind for him. In the Jewish economy the Jewish child had the same
{64}
amount of manna as the father. We have to determine what that means. I say to my child, You are in the mind of God the same as I am; you are intended by God to be in the tabernacle as I am.
S.P. Moses was nourished in the house of his father three months. That nourishment carried him right through the forty years.
J.T. That is a good illustration, for that nourishment carried him right through for the first forty years. We must bear in mind in speaking of Moses the kind of parents he had, they were both of the house of Levi, Levites. So he would be like Timothy; he was nourished in the house of his father.
A.H.P. In speaking of the instinctive evidences of the work of God, it is not merely the age by itself, but some feature of the work of God, however small, in the person which is the thing to go by.
J.T. Quite so.
C.H.H. The man in @John 9 was forced to stand on his feet by his parents.
J.T. They did not help him; "He is of age", that would apply when a young person is seeking fellowship. It is a question of his individuality. He has to reach the thought of "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law" (@Romans 7: 25); that really is the beginning of things.
Rem. You would say it is the positive side of what you have been saying in regard to the young, as Paul speaking about Timothy to the Philippians, "For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on" (chapter 2: 20). "But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings" (verse 22). There is the positive side of what we see in the young.
J.T. Serving with Paul has that feature, quite so. That is one point in our subject this afternoon.
{65}
Then the next thing is the authority of Scripture, how that came in in this particular revival and how it discloses that whilst we may have revival as in Josiah's time, yet it may not go on to the end. That is another very solemn consideration. The introduction of the prophetic word to him from Huldah is, "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah. Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my fury shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched. But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard: Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy garments and weep before me, I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah. Behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought the king word again". Now one calls attention to this as a prophetic word because peculiar stress is being laid on the thought of prophecy just now. It reminds the king that although he is leading in this great revival it may not go on to the end. That is one of the solemn things; whilst we may be enjoying good times we have to inquire -- How long is this going to last? And am I depending on someone else for it or am I going to make it last? That is the effect of a word like this.
{66}
S.McC. Jeremiah's ministry would show while they turned outwardly, many of them, in heart were not really in it.
J.T. That would show the rapidity that marked the departure after Josiah's death. It is very solemn, showing that one man may be used of God to influence the revival of the truth in this way and yet it may not last. That is one of the most solemn things we can think of. The question is, Am I going to make it last or am I depending upon someone else?
C.H.H. How would you apply that in the present day? Do you think we should not look for it lasting?
J.T. I am only saying the prophetic word should be attended to whatever it says. The revival that had come in, that was current, was not going to last, and surely that was a word for everybody. If I had been there with the light I have now, I would say, That is a serious matter, we must turn to God about it; because we know that He changed His mind about Nineveh, and the Spirit of God teaches us that He is ready to change His mind if we are willing to repent.
E.G.McA. The word of God may come to me as I read the Scriptures, but going to the prophetess Huldah indicates that I cannot read the Scriptures independently of ministry as it comes out through the Levites.
J.T. Quite so; that is what gift is for. "Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men", @Ephesians 4: 8. "And *he* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry" (verses  11, 12). Hence we find in Ezra and Nehemiah that the Levites give the sense of the Scriptures; that is what meetings of this kind and our weekly readings are for, that the Scriptures might be opened up to us.
{67}
C.H.H. What is the moral bearing of the keeping of the wardrobe and the second quarter of the town? Would that suggest the moral features of a prophet?
J.T. The idea of the wardrobe (whether it was she who kept it or her husband, she is connected with it) is quite extensive in Scripture. We know there are different robes, and the one who keeps it would know what the different robes are. She could tell you what the best one was like: "Bring forth the best robe", the father said that to his bondmen. They are supposed to know the best robe, the one to bring for this particular occasion. There are other robes in the wardrobe. It is very significant that it comes in here. And she lived in the second quarter of the city; that would mean she was not an aristocrat; she was an ordinary person. She did not live on Fifth Avenue or in the West End.
E.G.McA. Would having to do with the wardrobe indicate that I am clothed now according to the prophetic word?
J.T. That is the thought. The prophet, or here it is the prophetess, would indicate the kind of robe to be worn. Josiah rent his garments you see; that would mean that what he had was not suitable.
C.H.H. Was not Paul able to clothe the Corinthian saints in the very best robe? In spite of their state he clothed them with the thoughts of God, he maintained their dignity.
J.T. That is very good. The first eight verses of the epistle is clothing them with the very best; that is, it helps to remind the saints of what they are in the mind of God. What a garment belongs to them! The ones we have on are not suitable; that is the idea of rending the garments. So Elisha parted his garments in two and took up the mantle of Elijah.
T.U. Why is it a woman who prophesied? What is the bearing of it in connection with the thought that is before us?
{68}
J.T. The bearing is that the sisters here should take it to heart. Have they ever spoken a prophetic word to the brethren? Why should a sister not speak a prophetic word if she is with God? There are other things that would keep her from giving an address, but Philip had four daughters who prophesied. They did the work.
E.G.McA. Do you think by Josiah rending his garments that he was ready for the prophetic word of the moment from Huldah?
J.T. I think so. He was ready to listen to the prophetic word, "And the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. And the king went up into the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah". He wanted everybody to hear what he had heard. He is not afraid of reading the book of the law, the prophetic message does not deter him from having it read. That is what I think is very fine, he is ready for the full force of the Scriptures.
E.G.McA. The sword of the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. These men went to her (verse 22). That is an important feature, the brothers do not ignore the sisters.
J.T. The king told them to go to her, "And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the law, that he rent his garments. And the king commanded Hilkijah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying, Go inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book which is found: for great is the wrath of
{69}
Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this book. And Hilkijah and they that the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokehath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter of the town; and they spoke with her to that effect".
S.McC. Is it not all the more remarkable when we think that Jeremiah was present at the time and his ministry going out, but yet they go to Huldah? Perhaps there is a tendency with us to despise the more obscure side of the prophetic element amongst us.
J.T. She is linked up with the wardrobe and she dwells in the second part of the city. She is not a person that is of national repute. But these men knew where to go to get the word of God, they knew who to inquire of.
E.G.McA. The Scripture says, "The priest's lips should keep knowledge". Why would he go to Huldah? What is the significance of that?
J.T. She is called a prophetess. The king knows her apparently. Do you not think we ought to know the persons who are likely to have the mind of God?
E.G.McA. Would it be the exercise of priestly instinct?
J.T. Exactly. Priesthood is one thing; prophecy is another.
C.H.H. Would Sarah's word be prophetic? The Lord tells Abraham to listen to Sarah.
J.T. Just so. Why should not the sisters be able to help as to the mind of God? We have abundant evidence that the Lord uses them, as in this instance. Why not now? I know of nothing to be coveted by any one of us more than to be able to convey the mind of God to the brethren in a crisis.
{70}
C.H.H. Deborah was greatly used in a crisis.
Rem. Deborah dwelt under her own palm tree, and all Israel came to her. She had her own judgment about matters.
J.T. I would say she was victorious over herself. The palm means victory over herself. Now the effect of the prophetic word is, "And the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem". It is the king who is doing it. "And the king went up into the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah". The next thing is that he got all the people there. The king is in his place, and the prophet. If we are to act according to the mind of God each one is to be in his place, whatever place God has assigned to him in the testimony. Let me be there, let me be where I should be. The king was in his place here and so we have great results, "And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that are written in this book. And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. And Josiah removed all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and made to serve all that were found in Israel -- to serve Jehovah their God, all his days they did not depart from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers". I think that is a remarkable tribute to a man who is true. He had gone on all these years and now he is in his place and we see the moral power he has got with
{71}
the whole community. All the days of his life they served Jehovah. It is a question of what moral power I have got in serving the Lord amongst His people.
S.McC. Is not verse 32 important? We might say, Well, I am sure that is right, and perhaps not do it; but it says here, "He caused all that were present ... to stand to it".
J.T. That would show what kingly power is. All power, of course, is in the hand of Christ in heaven and on earth, but He uses a man here. It is Christ's power, it is royal power, but it is exercised in certain ones. It is a question of what each one is, standing in his own place and serving faithfully.
T.U. Is the thought that if one is to be a man of weight he must answer to the prophetic word?
J.T. That is the thing if we have a prophetic meeting, to listen for the mind of God coming to us. The next thing is that there is something for *me*: I say, I got a word there tonight. It is those who hear the word of God and do it, those are the brethren.
S.P. To go back to what is effected in Josiah, the place he gave the sin-offering in verse 21: "For great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah". Do you think in any way there is a lack amongst us on this line? He did not detach himself from the "us"; he included himself in it. It led to his power.
J.T. Quite so, the prophetic word takes account of that. You notice the first message of the prophetess is to the man that sent them; Josiah is addressed as a man. He, as a man, is linked up with all men, they are going to suffer. But there is a second message, in verse 26: "But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard". This is another idea,
{72}
he is now respected as the king of Judah. "Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, ... I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah. Behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers ...". I think we ought to notice that, the difference between the two parts of the prophetic message. The first is a great general thought, that Josiah is just a man; in the second part he is king of Judah; his own personal qualities are touched upon. God differentiates between the man and the king because as king he stands in relation to the whole position.
S.P. Would that help us in our local administrations? Sometimes we detach ourselves in a matter of discipline and we lose the value of it and lose power in a matter of administration.
J.T. The man that accepts responsibility accepts the responsibility for the whole position. That is a good point.
E.P. Would the Lord's special words to the overcomer fit in with this word to the king of Judah? There is the more general message to the assembly and then there is the word to the overcomer.
J.T. Exactly. There is a difference between the angel and the overcomer; the angel represents all.
J.R.H. This word of the prophetess Huldah was spoken to five men appointed by the king. Is it in order for a sister to speak to a few brothers what she believes to be the mind of God?
J.T. By all means; I have experienced that on more than one occasion, a sister conveying the mind of God. The Lord will give His mind to sisters if they ask for it. If sisters accept the general responsibility of the position and are before God about it they will get His mind. Why not? He will honour sisters as well as brothers. There are other principles
{73}
that keep them from public speaking; nevertheless God uses sisters who cover their heads and recognise the authority above them. It is in subjection that they are used.
A.B. I was thinking that the Lord sent the woman in @John 20 to the brethren.
J.T. She went and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that He had said these things to her. She does not teach them; she conveys the word.
Ques. It is quite helpful in administrative matters to identify ourselves with the brethren by the word 'we' instead of saying 'they', I notice in difficulties we are prone to say, They did this and they did that. Do you think it would be more helpful to identify ourselves with the matter even if it is wrong?
J.T. It is our matter. Every sister should look at it in that light, and brothers too.
G.A.T. Daniel said, "We have sinned", @Daniel 9: 5.
J.T. Quite so.
J.V. Would you say a word in regard to the book of the covenant? Evidently it had a great effect upon them.
J.T. It is general, of course; it was the book of the law and the book of the covenant. Hilkijah says, "I have found the book of the law" (verse 15). That is one title of it, it is a question of the will of God, the assertion of His will. The book of the covenant is an expression of what He is to us in His love; it is well worth thinking of, and looking at it from that point of view. The covenant is God entering into an engagement, and that engagement is the outcome of what He is in Himself.
J.R.H. The book of the covenant was made in the land of Moab and was put inside the ark. I thought that the reading of this book in the ears of the people, both great and small, was the fulfilling of the injunction at the end of Deuteronomy, when all the people were to be gathered together, men,
{74}
women and children, that even the children who did not know Jehovah might learn and fear.
J.T. I am thankful for what you said about Deuteronomy. There was an additional book given, an additional covenant, but the book of the law is the primary book of God, asserting His rights as at Sinai. And the book of the covenant is what He is, not only His will but His affections towards us, a very touching thing. Chapter 35 begins, "And Josiah held a passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem", a fine pronouncement about this king in verse 1. This word 'and' is additional; it links on with chapter 34. We are notified here that it is a superior passover to Hezekiah's because the additional month of grace which was allowed in the book of Numbers is not sought here; it is not needed. Hezekiah's passover was in the second month but Josiah's was in the first month, the primary thought of God, showing that there was a condition here to be noted. So that we are told in the last verse we read, "And there was no passover like to that holden in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel hold such a passover as Josiah held, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover holden". That is when he was twenty-six years of age. I think that is a very fine tribute. Then in connection with the passover, the ordering and authority of the king were used to establish headship and the working of love in the courses. It says in verses 2 and 3, "And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah. And he said to the Levites, that taught all Israel, and who were holy to Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built; ye have not to carry it upon your shoulders". We do well to take notice of
{75}
these facts because here Josiah is at his best spiritually; he is ordering the priests to be in their courses and he is honouring the Levites, telling them that they are holy and that they taught all Israel, that they are to put the holy ark where it should be. In the whole chapter as we shall see, everything is where it should be, and every person. It would give the best results for each person and thing to be where it should be according to divine prescription. So we have the priests in their courses and then we have the Levites looking after the ark, putting it where it should be. Then we have in verse 10, "And the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king's commandment". Then we are told in verse 15, "And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place". This is very remarkable instruction as to revival, it is calling upon every brother, sister and child to be in his place. God has an assigned place for each of us, and we are to be there. You are on call.
C.H.H. Would the fact that it was the eighteenth year of his reign, corresponding to the same year that he sought word from the prophetess, prove that the prophetic word was used to put everybody in his place?
J.T. I think that helps. God is constantly calling attention to the value of the prophetic word. What results it obtains amongst us! It is within the range of every one of us, both brothers and sisters, to get a word from God. How it is said is another matter, but it is possible to get a word from God.
S.McC. Would the suggestion of the "holy ark" link with the presentation of Christ to Philadelphia, "the holy, the true"?
J.T. I think that is good; so that it is a question of the Levites, "Ye have not to carry it upon your shoulders", as Josiah said. David had said it before;
{76}
it is not an onerous service. Put it where it should be, and that is the place that Solomon built for it. There is no doubt about the place; it is the house built by the son, and that is where it belongs. The point is that Christ has His proper place, where He should be.
J.B. What is suggested in verse 4, "According to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son"?
J.T. That has to be linked up with what we had yesterday, the instruments of David and the words of David. Now we have the writing of David and the writing of Solomon. The writing is something put on record, it is there for everybody to read. It is not simply the commandment of Jehovah but the writing of these men; it is a question of exalted spiritual instruction left on record.
E.G.McA. How does the last part of verse 15 work in now. "They had not to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them"?
J.T. Right down to the doorkeepers you mean?
E.G.McA. The Levites saw to it that they did not have to leave their place. How does that levitical service work now?
J.T. The thing is to see that you do not let a person into fellowship who is not suitable. It is so ordained that the Levites look after the doorkeepers, that we should not let any extraneous matter in that should not be in, or let any out that might be in. The idea of doorkeeping here is very striking; it says the singers were in their place and the doorkeepers at every gate and "they had not to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them". I suppose it would be that the ministry helps. Your business is to look after the doors, do not let anyone in who should not be in. What do you think of that yourself?
{77}
E.G.McA. I think that is very fine.
J.B. Would the singers and the doorkeepers suggest that what is inside and what is outside is in keeping and in order?
J.T. I think that is good. If you look at chapter 23 of the first book there is some word about that. "And four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith", meaning that the doorkeepers and the singers were the same in number; in other words it would be the same persons, because if you have not good doorkeepers you will not have good singing or worship to God.
Ques. Would chapter 8 of the Acts indicate the proper order in connection with letting anyone into fellowship? Does that give us guidance as to who should take their place amongst us? I refer to Peter and John and Simon Magus, in that setting the doorkeepers are men with spiritual discernment.
J.T. Peter and John were sent down by the other apostles; it was an apostolic matter. Philip was an evangelist, it says; it shows the correlation between the different services. "some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists"; it is the relation between the evangelists and the apostles in @Acts 8. The evangelist's work is carried on; Philip was very successful, but he allowed Simon Magus into fellowship. Peter discerned that, showing that the different services must work in with one another.
J.W.D. Do you not think the conditions of doorkeeping would be much more stringent in Josiah's time than in Hezekiah's?
J.T. I think so. Josiah's passover is outstanding. What is stressed in Hezekiah's time is not the passover -- the comparison is not with the passover in Solomon's time -- but with the fourteen days of joyous service, fourteen days of feast. It is a double feast, that is what is outstanding there. In Hezekiah's
{78}
day there had been nothing like that since Solomon's time. But what is stressed here is the passover: there was no passover like this since Samuel, it was like an Exodus passover.
S.McC. In going back it alludes to Samuel the prophet. Why that?
J.T. Well, I suppose there might have been one in his time like it, though we are not told there was. The comparison here goes further back, it covers more ground than Hezekiah's; but it is a question here of the passover, whereas in Hezekiah's time it is a question of the duration of the feast fourteen days. That is exactly what Solomon had, fourteen days; there was not anything like it again until Hezekiah; but it would appear that Solomon did not have a passover like Josiah, nor did David have a passover like Josiah, a very striking thing. There was not one like it since Samuel's time.
Ques. Is it getting down to first principles, or getting back to the roots of the matter?
J.T. I should think he went back to Exodus. The book was there in his hand, he would refer to it and look over it.
C.H.H. Would the fact that the doorkeepers are insisted upon here be because according to chapter 34 evil abounded without measure; man multiplied evil before the Lord? Evil had got in to such an extent that there was great necessity for doorkeepers.
J.T. It is strikingly so today; evil is all around in such an insidious way, coming in through the schools: our little ones are where the worst kind of evil is. Evil is most insidious at the present time, so that the doorkeeping is very important and correlated with the singing. If the doorkeeping is not good neither is the singing.
T.U. Is there the blending of the book of Moses with the words of David in relation to the detail of the passover?
{79}
J.T. You must go to Moses for the passover, but there is more attaching to this service; there are other sacrifices as well. They did not have the ark in Exodus when they celebrated the passover. It is a richer state of things in that there has been great addition; that is another thing we should observe, that David said to Solomon, "Thou shalt add to it". I believe that extended back to the passover in Egypt; there was to be continual addition in a spiritual way.
E.G.McA. We have referred to the great evil in the days of Amon, Josiah's father. Is it true that in the passover the prophetic word has more weight than it had in the revival in Hezekiah's day, that the prophetic word has more weight and place as the evil abounds?
J.T. It would seem so. There is no discrepancy here but Hezekiah has to ask the Lord to pardon because things are not in order.
A.B. Would that be seen in that it is the idea of cleansing with Hezekiah; but the thought with Josiah is purging, a more stringent idea, and perhaps connected with the thought of the passover?
J.T. Yes, and more extensive too, because all the territory of Judah and Israel was affected by the purging. Josiah went out among all the brethren, as it were.
Ques. Do you connect the word 'doorkeeping' with a letter of commendation? That is, doorkeepers should convey the right information in a letter of commendation.
J.T. Yes; that is so.
C.Y. The doorkeepers were at every gate, including each local assembly.
J.T. That is the idea, doorkeepers in every gate.
C.H.H. Would there be any connection with the angels at the gates of the heavenly city?
{80}
J.T. That brings it in. These are the terms laid down in the last chapter of the Bible, that if one washes his robes he may enter: "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city". No doorkeeper will challenge you if you wash your robes; you have a right to enter in at the gates. He is glad to see you and passes you through.
{81}
REVIVAL (4)
@Nehemiah 12: 27 - 43; @Ezra 6: 16 - 22
J.T. It will be obvious to all that these scriptures are closely allied. It is a question whether we should begin with the house or the wall. It occurs to me we should begin with the dedication of the wall of the city as signifying typically fellowship, coming down to the level of all of us. It is a subject that has a great place with us, profitably. The house is, of course, a more spiritual thought, more inward, which I think we ought to look at secondly. But Nehemiah gives great prominence to the wall, first the building of it which would mean the recovery in our times, the recognition of fellowship. Fellowship is treated of in the two letters to Corinth: the fellowship of God's Son in chapter 1, the fellowship of Christ's death in chapter 10, and the fellowship of the Spirit in the end of the second epistle -- of God's Son, of His death and of His Spirit, in the epistles to the Corinthians. John however in his two epistles treats of fellowship with one another, "with the Father" and "with his Son". If we are helped to go over the ground a little, oft traversed indeed profitably, then we may see the force of the dedication of the wall with these processions and the two choirs of singers, one moving in one direction and the other in another so that they meet. When we come to the house of God, both choirs stood in the house of God (verse 40). It would give us an inlet to the house in Ezra.
Ques. Would there be any connection between what you are saying and the fact that Nehemiah is governor, representing the authoritative side in connection with the wall, and Ezra representing the priestly side in connection with the house?
J.T. That is good, indicating the distinction to be kept in mind in our inquiry, that whilst he is acting
{82}
under a gentile monarch, he is still acting under divine government. And the fellowship still stands in connection with the authority of Christ, so that it says in @1 Corinthians 10, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?". That stands in relation to the truth of the fellowship.
S.McC. What do these choirs suggest to you?
J.T. A jubilant spirit amongst the brethren -- that we are in the fellowship, not in a somewhat disconsolate way, but happily and freely following it and commending it to others, I think that is the idea.
E.P. Would it be right to say Ezra deals more with their position and Nehemiah with their state?
J.T. Perhaps you would enlarge on that.
E.P. I was thinking of the great movement up from Babylon under Ezra; they are moved up from Babylon to the true position, whereas Nehemiah deals more with their condition as in that position.
J.T. I think that is instructive because Ezra's movement is linked with the movements under Zerubbabel and Jeshua, though Ezra came in much later, contemporary with Nehemiah. The movement under Zerubbabel and Jeshua is a movement under the direct government of God; the proclamation was by Cyrus according to Ezra that they should return and build. Cyrus is a prophetic monarch: he had been spoken of in Isaiah before he was born, showing that God had had this matter that is indicated in Ezra long in mind, and the movement corresponded with his pre-revealed thoughts. Ezra is positional. The proclamation runs in @Ezra 1: 1 - 4, "And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in writing, saying, Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth
{83}
has Jehovah the God of the heavens given to me, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah the God of Israel -- he is God -- which is at Jerusalem. And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the voluntary offering for the house of God which is at Jerusalem". That is a remarkable proclamation and carries direct divine authority, for Cyrus recognises that God had given him the nations. And now he is very precise as to what the position is -- it is at Jerusalem: "He has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem"; so that it carries with it, you might say, the authority that David and Solomon had in their building.
S.McC. Is it not significant in connection with that, that in @Nehemiah 12 Ezra goes before them and Nehemiah after them?
J.T. I think that is orderly. Ezra would be the more spiritual. Nehemiah is the authoritative side, representative really of the gentile authority. Ezra had come up under gentile authority but he is recognised as a priest. In order to make clear the distinction between the two books, there is no proclamation in Nehemiah in the sense in which we have it in Ezra; Nehemiah is the outcome of one man being concerned about the people of God. It was God that was concerned about the building of the house and raised up Cyrus to do it, according to Ezra; but in Nehemiah it is the outcome of his own exercise. We are told that; the book opens with the words of Nehemiah, meaning that he is a man moved of himself. The meaning of his name, as given in the note, is 'Comfort of Jehovah' -- a word that should appeal to every brother and sister as to
{84}
whether one is a comfort to God and to the saints in his service. Then we are told that "Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. And they said to me, Those who remain, that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned with fire", @Nehemiah 1: 2, 3. These verses show that Nehemiah's building is the outcome of one man's exercise, but the present revival that God has graciously granted is of Himself, more in keeping with Ezra. God had raised up Cyrus of Himself, spoken of long before he was born, showing that it was a matter of God's mind, fixed on His calendar, that there should be a recovery of Israel after the captivity; a very foundational thought, for after all everything proceeds from God. But Nehemiah is the side of individual concern about these matters. As to ourselves, it is a question for each of us whether this revival is to continue, and whether we have right feelings about the weakness that exists at the present time -- some meetings dying out or discontinuing, others arising -- whether we have right feelings. So the two books put together in that way describe our position; God has wrought and He looks for individual concern about matters. Are they to be continued? Can I improve on present conditions? Can I make things better? That is Nehemiah.
E.P. Would it be right to say that this individual concern awakens mutual concern throughout the book?
J.T. I think that is the way the matter is. We have observed indeed in our readings since we have been here, that God works in relation to any right movement. One man moves with God and God works in relation to that man; I think there is
{85}
abundant evidence of that. God works with one man and others are affected to move with him. It is a question of leadership in Nehemiah, one man feeling things rightly, so that the book begins with his words.
G.H. Would Ezra be more John's side and Nehemiah more Paul's, the idea of authority?
J.T. John's gospel speaks of God, beginning with "the Word", everything emanates from that. What you say is right; Ezra presents God moving from the divine side. God moving in Cyrus, a gentile monarch, so that he might build the house of God at Jerusalem and for the release of God's people. It is all from the divine side; God had spoken about it before; He had spoken about it by both Isaiah and Jeremiah. Nehemiah represents to us what one man can do who feels things amongst the people of God and would have them bettered; Nehemiah represents that side. As such a man as that works, God moves with him and he acquires moral power among his brethren.
S.P. Would you say it is right for us to inquire as to the different localities, inquire feelingly, not with a sense of being curious but as carrying the interests of the assembly? Should we inquire how things are moving, how the brethren are getting on? It should encourage circulation amongst the brethren.
J.T. I am sure it would. Any information of common interest that a brother obtains he should pass on because it is of value, pass it on to the brethren in his locality at the beginning of the meeting for prayer so that the saints hear, "And the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem", @Acts 11: 22. Tidings came of the work of God far away, and the ears of the assembly heard. The ears of the assembly are characteristic and they hear what God is doing, as we were reminded the other evening, "Let us return now and visit the brethren ... and see how
{86}
they are getting on", @Acts 15: 36. Why should I not find out and make it known? Nehemiah made inquiry, "I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped ...".
Rem. In connection with what you are saying, this word 'revive' is used by the enemy in this book, chapter 4: 2; it is used by the enemy to hinder the work of God. Our brother was saying the positive side should be circulated amongst us, but the enemy would seem to know what is going on and try to hinder it.
J.T. Yes, he has ears too, and would use them to hinder. He knows what God is doing; that is very striking.
G.A.T. If we have local exercises, troubles we call them, you would say it is fitting that we should let it be known so that we have the prayers of our brethren outside?
J.T. Even in regard to a meeting for care where there should be liberty for the circulation of all matters relative to the service of God; as it says in one of the hymns suitable for that meeting, 'Every interest precious to Thee finding in our hearts a place' (`305:2). These interests belong to God, and the needs of the testimony should be our concern. So in the meeting for care they come up and this information ought to be circulated. Sisters will do well to inquire; many of them do not. Their husbands will do well to tell their wives and families what they should know relative to these matters; they are common property. Everyone should know so that the prayers may continue.
S.McC. In some localities it has been implied that the brethren would be happier to consider the matter before them if visiting brothers were not present. Do you think that sentiment is right?
J.T. It is very wrong. It denies the general fellowship. Visiting brethren normally ought to be
{87}
a help. There is only one fellowship; exclusion of brethren in that way is merely natural sentiment.
S.McC. What would you do if you were in a meeting where the brothers said they were not free to go on with the matter until the visiting brother went out?
J.T. It is distressing. It shows how far natural sentiment enters into our affairs.
C.H.H. In this fellowship indicated in the wall and the choirs going round it, would all these different gates represent the different features of the fellowship which they had to take account of?
J.T. The points touched on have a spiritual significance; the different gates touched on, even the persons, all have significance. We might notice one or two of them in verse 36 of chapter 12. "And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azareel ...". These names and the places mentioned by name carry spiritual suggestions that ought to be in our minds in relation to the fellowship. We shall perhaps speak a little later on that, but our present subject is the dedication of the wall. In verse 27, "And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to hold the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, lutes and harps". That is the great general thought. One has been impressed in these meetings with the great prominence in revivals given to priests and Levites. They represent the operative work of God, operative instrumentally; if God is to carry on His work He has got His own instruments. No one enters into a matter involving operation without suitable instruments, and these instruments are prepared beforehand; they must be. I think that is what enters into the stress laid on priests and Levites in all these revivals; without these instrumentalities the operation cannot proceed. This operation here is
{88}
a dedication, a peculiar service. It is an operation really but we must have a *modus operandi*, that is, a means whereby such an operation can go through. It is not for everybody to lead, it is for these persons mentioned by name here; but it says "they sought the Levites out of all their places", to get them into line, to get them into position. Each should be in position in this great matter.
E.G.McA. Would you say that is like the apostle bringing it to the attention of the Corinthians in the first chapter, that "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" before he brings in the collective side of his teaching? It was in order that the priests and Levites might be stirred up to build the wall.
J.T. I think so; "so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ" (verse 7). The allusion would be to what was there. You must have workmanship, not just anybody. Corinth must have proper workmanship, not just anybody. Corinth had skilled men, but not the right kind. Men are made skilful in the seminaries and the universities, but they are not the right kind; they do not come under the heading of priests and Levites. Here they are God's divinely skilled men and the thought is, Let each be in his place. A Levite ought to be at Jerusalem -- it says to bring them to Jerusalem; that is their place in relation to the work of God.
Ques. Do we get that thought with Barnabas? "And he went away to Tarsus to seek out Saul", @Acts 11: 25. We are not told that anyone asked him to do it, but he saw the necessity to seek out a man that would be ready to help the saints at Antioch.
J.T. He was the man for the moment, he was the man for the work; exactly. It is very striking in the Acts to note the allusions to levitical skill and instinct. I believe every brother and sister ought to
{89}
take it to heart. Am I available for this matter? Am I skilled? Because skill is required.
S.P. Why do things come upon us suddenly? It says in @2 Chronicles 29: 36 that "God had prepared the people; for the thing was done suddenly". In our localities something might come suddenly. If we are not prepared we might get into difficulty.
J.T. Quite so; we may have to make special prayer about it as Hezekiah did. We are not to postpone the work if it is a movement of God. Things must be done.
J.W.D. Would you say a little more about bringing the Levites to Jerusalem? What had you in mind about Jerusalem?
J.T. It is a great position, the centre of everything in this matter, the centre of divine operations; so that the Levites were sought "out of all their places to bring them to Jerusalem". We were speaking yesterday about the Levites being in their places under Josiah; they were in their places officially. It seems that here they were in the places they had sought out for themselves in the country. There was hesitation to go to Jerusalem. It says in chapter 11, verses 1 and 2, "And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem; and the rest of the people cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine parts in the cities. And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem". It seems there was a hesitancy to dwell in Jerusalem; it requires spiritual instinct. And so it goes on to say in verses 3 and 4, "And these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem; but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities. Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants. And in Jerusalem dwelt some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin". It seems as if they were choosing their own
{90}
places. The priests and Levites belonged to Jerusalem properly, where the house of God was.
Ques. In seeking out the Levites, do you not think a locality ought to have in its mind that there are brethren in other places that can help them? That requires that they must support the Levites.
J.T. The Levites stand related to the tabernacle according to Numbers; they stand round the tabernacle under the supervision of the priests. So they have a universal bearing; they are universal in their service and ought to be availed of too.
Ques. Is it not instructive to see the movements of this great servant? He went out and surveyed the scene by night. He went through the valley-gate, "even toward the jackal-fountain, and to the dung-gate; and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were in ruins, and its gates were consumed with fire. And I went on to the fountain-gate, and to the king's pool; ... and turned back, and entered by the valley-gate and returned", @Nehemiah 2: 13 - 15. Would that not suggest the attitude of mind that can be used for revival, a lowly spirit, and returning back in the same lowly spirit?
J.T. The valley-gate would allude to the death of Christ. Joshua lodged in the valley in taking Ai. Really the line is going down as Christ went down and Nehemiah came back to that point. You can see how the Spirit of God could use a man like that. A man like that acquires moral weight amongst us, and the Spirit of God will use him to assert authority amongst us.
E.P. So that the dedication of the wall would be the saints arriving at what he had arrived at before.
J.T. He had the thought of building the wall. And now it is built, so we are entitled to introduce all his exercises into this dedication service. How he rejoiced in the fact of its being finished! He tells us how long it took to build. The great thought of
{91}
fellowship is established. Now what do we think about it? Are we satisfied with it or are we complaining about the narrowness of it, complaining that the brethren do not want radios or smoking, practices that are defiling? If we are, we are not joining in this dedication; we have no part in these choirs; we shall be out of it. The thing is now settled and established and we are rejoicing in the fact. There is now some security in the fellowship.
E.G.McA. Speaking of that, is that why the movement of the first choir was toward the dung gate? Is it there that all these things go out?
J.T. You are referring to chapter 12: 31: "And I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall and appointed two great choirs and processions, on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate". Very good; that is where all these things belong, at the dung-gate. It applies to mixed marriages too; all over the world there are certain outstanding things that one could mention, such as radios, smoking and mixed marriages. It is a constant battle, all these things have to be cast into this place of filth. We have already had the brook Kidron, typical of the death of Christ; that is how they are set aside judicially. The Spirit of God requires that they should be set aside and the standard is the death of Christ.
Rem. In the next chapter conditions seem to come up again that would interfere with this joy. Nehemiah sees them bringing in things to sell on the sabbath, and he finds mixed marriages. He says "I protested". You know brethren do not like you to protest, but if we see things wrong we should speak to one another and say, I protest.
J.T. Very good. And now let us see the order of these choirs: "And I ... appointed two great choirs and processions, on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate. And after them went
{92}
Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah ...", (verses  31, 32). Now I think that the position ought to be clearly understood, that these choirs are not only choirs, but processions. We do not want to be out of these things; we want to be in them, having part in the choir and in the procession, meaning that I am witness of this thing. I might not be taking much active part but I am in the procession; I am thoroughly in this matter of fellowship and I am glad to be in it.
S.P. It is not optional.
J.T. Nehemiah is commanding it.
J.H-t. It is on the wall too, and over the gates, I was wondering if it would help us to see that the wall and the gates for the choirs and processions to move on must be established?
J.T. There is liberty of movement; it is a happy occasion. Everyone, even if he is not actively engaged in the choir, is in the procession. The choirs and the processions are distinct thoughts; we may not be all singing, but the idea of the procession is very interesting; I am in line with that.
S.McC. Is the choir the idea of giving a lead to the procession?
J.T. I think so. The song here is jubilance, you know, we are happy in the thing; a great time of joy.
E.G.McA. Would you say that in the procession there is also the thought of my public identification with this movement? I might be in my spirit in line with the thing, but am I ready to take my place in the procession, which would bring in reproach in connection with this matter?
J.T. You can understand there would be reproach. These enemies that are spoken of earlier in the book said, "If a fox went up, it would break down their stone wall" (chapter 4: 3). That was when they were building. They would jeer at them in this procession, but there is moral power in it, I think the Lord
{93}
would speak to us as to whether we are all satisfied about this matter of fellowship or whether we want the walls lowered and broken through.
C.H.H. Would you say that in coming to the dung-gate singing, we should be happy that all these things should be put out? We have authority established to do away with these things, such as smoking, radios and all that kind of thing. If people persist in them we are not obliged to go on with them.
J.T. That is evil and we are not obliged to go on with evil. God is with us in refusing it. We may be weak but surely He will triumph over these enemies. This compromising is so dangerous! Some say, Let it go; and there it is! The enemy is undisturbed in what he is doing.
Rem. The priests and the Levites purified themselves; that is, we cannot take things up with others until we have first cleared our own houses. If brothers who have to take up these matters are not clear themselves, they are not able to do anything for others.
J.W. Would "Sanballat, and Tobijah, and Geshem the Arabian" be elements that would hold us in compromise? They say, "Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono". But Nehemiah says, "I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down" (chapter 6: 1 - 3).
J.T. Very good. We have a sense of the greatness of the work, we know what enters into it. I think that is very fine, "I am doing a great work". Not simply that the work is great, but I am doing it, I am working at it. Now we cannot take up in detail these names that are mentioned here after verse 31, but I think the Spirit of God loves to bring forward names of those who are in this procession, people who are outstanding as supporting this matter of fellowship. They are happily in it, they are joining in the choir and they are in the procession. And then
{94}
we find, as already remarked, that they had the musical instruments of David the man of God. It is a very remarkable thing that David is called a man of God in this connection, not in view of any great military operations, but in this connection of the musical instruments of David, the man of God. They have got these, so it is no mean choir.
J.R.H. In connection with these names verse 35 says, "Certain of the priests sons". Why are they spoken of as priests sons instead of priests?
J.T. I do not know, except to bring in the thought of sonship. Earlier we have the word 'children', that is in verse 28: "The children of the singers were assembled". Evidently two original words are used, one purely a family word, 'children'; the other, 'sons', distinguished members of the family alluding to priesthood. Aaron's sons is a thought that runs through Scripture; that is, we are related to Christ in sonship. Then we have Ezra brought into that section in verse 36 in connection with the instruments of David the man of God: "And Ezra the scribe before them".
Ques. In regard to the two companies, it would be necessary for the choir to have a leader, and the procession having joined in with the choir would follow together co-operatively. Would that not mean that I walk with my brethren and that we find that we have the same objective?
J.T. I think that is good. The choir is certainly one thought and the procession another, but they are beautifully linked together. There is, I think, orderliness in the singing; singing is the leading thought. There is orderliness too in the procession, we have part in it in an orderly way.
G.A.T. Would this have any connection with the children of Israel marching around Jericho? They did not sing there, but shouted.
{95}
J.T. There is a certain likeness, but there is more to it here. The procession around Jericho was very formal and very solemn; they were to be silent, not talkative. Talkativeness amongst us is harmful, "In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression; but he that restraineth his lips doeth wisely", @Proverbs 10: 19. So that at Jericho Joshua enjoins silence in the movement, but the time will come to shout; we are to be ready for that. But here it is jubilance. The point here is that the saints are happy in the position into which they are brought, involving fellowship, involving the denial of things I like naturally. I am happy to sacrifice these things, I have better things in the fellowship of God's Son.
E.G.McA. In the choir there is the thought of training; and I was wondering if the singing of the choir would indicate that our minds are governed by the Scriptures, so that we move in line with the truth not only as it is in the Scriptures but as it is brought out by the Levites. Hence the procession follows and there is no question in the mind of the people as to what we stand for.
J.T. I think so. Anyone seeing these people, this remarkable performance in Jerusalem, would say, Whatever we may think about it, they are happy people. They are not disconsolate. At some of our meetings in England, these large meetings, the caterers expect that the brethren will buy their wares, cigarettes, drinks, newspapers and what not. And when the time comes between the meetings and the brethren move out, the people look at them and they are not buying those things at all. None of them are smoking; they remark on that. They do not buy newspapers; Cannot you read?, they say sarcastically. But then they have to admit that the brethren are not doleful looking, they are quite happy; that is the idea, we are contented in the things we have got. We have not what they rely upon for their joy,
{96}
and we do not use these things at all. We have our own joys.
S.McC. Would the fountain-gate suggest something of that inward resourcefulness connected with the Spirit?
J.T. I think so. There is the fountain, but the word 'gate' is also used, I suppose it would be the point where water is secured. The word 'gate' to us means what is administrative, that there are administrative occasions. If it is the dung-gate, it would mean that certain things are sent there as judged to be filth; it is the administrative pronouncement as to evil things. But the fountain-gate is another thought; there the brethren are happy and free -- we have ministry and things that help us and refresh us.
W.McK. Paul says, "I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ", @Philippians 3: 8.
J.T. We can see gain relative to the dung-gate, but here we have the fountain-gate after "David the man of God" is mentioned, so that we are now touching exalted spiritual things. "And at the fountain-gate, and over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward" (verse 37). It is moral ascent after you touch the fountain-gate; we are going up now and it is the stairs of the city of David, an appointed method, the appointed way of going up. We are not climbing up, it is orderly elevation. And it is "at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate", even that length, the water-gate -- where water is administered.
C.H.H. Would that be seen in @Psalm 87, "Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion" (verse 2)? Then "As well the
{97}
singers as the dancers shall say, All my springs are in thee" (verse 7).
J.T. Quite so, the singers and the dancers say that, "All my springs are in thee". That does not mean that my springs are in God, but my springs are in Zion; that is an ordered state of things that God has established. That is what is in mind here.
Ques. In one company Ezra leads and in the other company Nehemiah goes after, supporting them. Is there any thought in that?
J.T. That is the next thing to look at, verse 38: "And the second choir went in the opposite direction upon the wall, and I after them, and the half of the people, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall". We can all see the moral ascent reached in this first movement in relation to Ezra; it is to the water-gate even above the house of David. The second movement is in verse 38, the second choir went in the opposite direction "and I after them", Nehemiah says. It is a question of authority behind; it is there. The choir is moving of itself, "and the half of the people, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall; and from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the gate of the old wall, and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate; and they stood still in the prison-gate". Now there is not time to go into all these gates or points but they are worth keeping in our minds. "And they stood still in the prison-gate", as much as to say, Do not forget that! But every gate here has a meaning, I believe. First of all, "from beyond the tower of the furnaces", which I think would allude to discipline and pressure, the severity of the fire we are put through to refine us; and then "to the broad wall". Persons thus refined have a good deal of latitude because we are brought to a broad place; we are not tied up under Jewish restrictions.
{98}
You can trust persons who have gone through the fire; that is the idea of the broad wall. There is latitude for us in what we are doing.
C.H.H. Would that indicate that you are enlarged under pressure?
J.T. Quite so, "In pressure thou hast enlarged me", @Psalm 4: 1. You have room and you could be trusted to use it. Some of us have to be watched, but there are others who can be trusted. And then, "from above the gate of Ephraim", which I suppose is the sort of gate which recognises leadership; Ephraim was the leading tribe at one time. Then, "above the gate of the old wall"; that is, we do not forget old principles or the old wall, what it was like or where the old gate was.
J.H. Do you get the idea of the choir standing still in the prison-gate in the second epistle to the Corinthians? "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions, and God of all encouragement; who encourages us in all our tribulation".
J.T. Quite so. The prison-gate is to be noted -- stand still there. We are not of much account unless we are in prison. The Lord says, "I was in prison", @Matthew 25: 36. He is the Leader in everything. The saints are the people who know characteristically what imprisonment means.
C.H.H. The Lord can adjust us in prison.
J.T. He can use it because He knew what it meant. He used it on Simon. These gates should all be looked into. The tower of Hananeel has a peculiar meaning, a tower always denoting strength or distinction.
S.McC. If you just allude to them all -- what of the fish-gate?
J.T. We have got to the gate of Ephraim and then we come to the fish-gate; I suppose it would suggest something brought from a distance to Jerusalem.
{99}
But fish, I believe, typify among other things the sovereignty of God. He finds His people sovereignly as in the waters. *You* cannot find them, of course, though fish can be found. The general thought is that they are in an element that denotes the sovereignty of God. An immense place, the waters! God alone knows the depths of the waters. The Lord said to Simon, Cast in a hook and you will find one fish; it is a question of sovereignty. I suppose the fish-gate would allude to all that; also what marks fish characteristically is that they do not go with the current of things around.
S.McC. These gates are very interesting; this second movement is connected with a line of gates. That is not such an exalted level as the first movement.
J.T. They end on the same level, I think the high level is in verse 37, but this choir brings in other thoughts that are conducive to this high level. Do not let us forget them. We have two towers, "the tower of Hananeel and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate", which we need not say much about; and then "they stood still in the prison-gate". And then "both choirs stood in the house of God", that is the point to reach here. The other ascent is more spiritual, "above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward"; but "both choirs stood in the house of God, and I and the half of the rulers with me; and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets" (verse 41). And then we have the singers in verse 42 and their names given. "And the singers sang aloud; and Jizrahiah was their overseer". We now have an overseer in the singing in this choir, "And that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and also the women and the children rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off".
{100}
So that we can see the point in all this, the testimony of satisfaction amongst the brethren. We are satisfied with the position whatever others may think about it; brethren are satisfied with the position whatever reproach is attached to it. We find it is so at a time like this; we find real joy in looking into the things of God.
J.B. The queen of Sheba in 1 Kings referred to Solomon's men and servants: "Happy are thy men! happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom!". And then she goes on to bless Jehovah.
J.T. These are remnant times. It speaks of "the joy of Jerusalem". Jerusalem as a place is not a delightful place; after all people did not want to live there, they would rather live in the country. But now its joy is heard afar off, "the joy of Jerusalem".
J.W.D. I believe that God is making the joy of the saints a testimony. These people are happy in the position they are in.
E.L. In @Lamentations 4: 12 it says, "The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should enter into the gates of Jerusalem", I wonder if we often under-estimate the power of the enemy in bringing in adverse things in relation to administration.
J.T. Do I understand that you are alluding to the gates?
E.L. You were suggesting that the gates allude to administration. I wondered if the enemy would attack administration in our localities.
J.T. The enemy would set aside the principle of administration, and hence spoil all this. These gates alluding to administration are to be much before us; the administrative side begins with individuals and works out through our care meetings to authoritative
{101}
assembly pronouncements. I believe that is how God is supporting us, so that the truth stands. What I think is particularly noticeable here is the joy of Jerusalem and it was heard afar off.
S.McC. "And also the women and the children rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off". The women and children are brought into it. We might say there is not much for the children in the fellowship; we are negating certain things that would appeal to them. But they are in this matter.
J.T. Very good.
Ques. Would you say the position has to be arrived at? "How should we sing a song of Jehovah's upon a foreign soil?" @Psalm 137: 4. The enemy wanted them to sing but they could not do it.
J.T. They could not do it there, they could do it in Jerusalem.
C.H.H. In the end of the Songs of degrees they reached the house of God: "Bless Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, who by night stand in the house of Jehovah. Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless Jehovah". Would that correspond to this place, to these different gates? The end that is reached is the house of God.
J.T. The 'songs of degrees' means 'songs of ascent', moral elevation, every step going upward. But now in Ezra at the dedication of the house I think we come to the direct link, because here they stood in the house of God. @Ezra 6: 16 says, "And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy", that is, this one, the one they had just built under great hardship. God helped them and it is "this house"; that is to say, what we have to do with answers to the original house; we dedicate that, not the original house but this one.
{102}
Ques. Referring to the earlier remark in connection with the positional side of the government of God, it is favourable towards this revival as seen in Ezra, Ezra having to do with the positional side and Nehemiah having to do with the state of the people. Is it so today, that God in His government is favourable to the revival, both as seen in Cyrus and now?
J.T. Quite so, it is the dispensation that is seen in Ezra. The position is clear, and now what marks the dispensation is that it is the dispensation of God that is in faith. The original word 'dispensation' involves the house of God; it is the economy house-wise and the house is essential to it. The walls are the protection of it. You cannot have the dispensation of God without the presence of God house-wise, and that is what is in mind here. "This house" is such as we have, and in "this house" God is pleased to be with His people on His own terms. Now the point is to dedicate that, to show that we are thoroughly and fully committed to that. So that it says they "kept the dedication of this house of God with joy; and they presented at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. And they set the priests in their classes, and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem: as it is written in the book of Moses". So that we can see how the dispensation is here characteristically, the people are committing themselves to it with joy. This house and the offerings are in relation to the twelve tribes, it is a universal thought. The house is always a universal thought.
S.McC. It is a remarkable thing that the offerings double as they proceed -- one hundred, two hundred, four hundred. The thing is intensified as it goes on.
{103}
J.T. Very good.
S.P. In Nehemiah it says, "they offered great sacrifices"; here it gives the number. Why is that?
J.T. It is measurement I think; God is the God of measure. And however much we have got He always keeps to His own thoughts. So we do not bring in everything we have in any assembly service; you would bring in what is suitable because He is the God of measure.
J.S.T. I was thinking of John in Revelation, he is given a reed to measure the altar and the house and those who worship. Would that be in keeping?
J.T. I think so. The idea of measure is most important in the things of God, beginning, as you might say, with Exodus. Exodus is the great central thought of the house, the dwelling place of God. Everything there is according to measure. We now arrive at what belongs to God. The inner side is mentioned earlier, but administration would have more to do with the announcements; the gates would be important at that point. Passing on we come to the offerings, that is what is entirely for the heart of God; that belongs to the inner position. The gates and the walls have to do with what is external, so we rightly have our announcements at first and then we proceed to the inner thought in the assembly service. In order to make clear that the dispensation is in mind, the next paragraph beginning with verse 19 says, "And the children of the captivity held the passover upon the fourteenth of the first month". They are in keeping with the thought of Josiah, but the house of God comes first here and its dedication. The next thing is the formal ordinance that characterises the dispensation; that is for us the Lord's supper, but here it is the passover.
J.R.H. The position here is very fine: "For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves as
{104}
one man". That is something in advance of what we were reading of Hezekiah yesterday.
J.T. Quite so. You allude to verses 20 and 21. "For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves as one man, they were all pure; and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. And the children of Israel that were come back out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah the God of Israel, did eat" -- these are the people that eat -- "and they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for Jehovah had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel".
S.McC. It is interesting how catholic they were in their thoughts; they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity. That would be helpful today; in our outlook we have in mind the whole position.
J.T. That is, the whole of those who have come out; the children of the captivity would mean we have all been in the captivity. We have learned from it and we take character from it; we are really a remnant restored from the general defection, the general captivity. It is a characteristic word, "the children of the captivity"; we have all had our part in the captivity. We are not there now, we have come back and we have purified ourselves; that is what is meant, these are the ones who ate the passover.
E.P. Does this thought of dedication mean that the position is made clear? I was thinking of the passage in @John 10: 22, "Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem, and it was winter. And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch
{105}
of Solomon". I was thinking that the dedication of the walls and the house would mean that the position was made clear and established.
J.T. And that we have committed ourselves thoroughly to it. We read of persons who have dedicated themselves to the ministry: that is, we have tried the thing out, we have experience with it. We have thoroughly committed ourselves to it. I believe that is what is meant by "this house"; it was not the original house, but such as it is we are committed to it and satisfied so far with it and we are rejoicing. The word 'dedication' would mean we have thoroughly committed ourselves to it.
Ques. Would this exceed @2 Timothy 2?
J.T. I think the idea of @2 Timothy 2 is the gateway into 1 Timothy. We have not lost 1 Timothy, but 2 Timothy is the way into it. We do not speak officially, but we do reach the house, such as it is. It is the house nevertheless. God is there and we have committed ourselves to it in the dedication. We are happily in it.
Rem. The word 'purified' here is the very word used in @2 Timothy 2.
J.T. We are purified from certain things and that makes room for the house. It means we cannot return to cathedrals or anything officially called a church in this world; we have come to the house, what is according to God, and we are going to stay there. We have thoroughly committed ourselves to it.
E.P. So there is peculiar significance attached to "this house"; Jesus walking in Solomon's porch in the feast of dedication would make the position clear in the presence of all the pretension that was there.
J.T. John gives us the official thing among the Jews only to show that something better was coming in that was the real thing.
J.H-t. The dedication is kept with joy, which agrees with what you were saying about being
{106}
thoroughly committed to it. It has been said many times when something is established among the brethren -- Well, I will bow to it. That is not the right attitude.
J.T. That is a miserable thing. It is better to bow to it than to be opposed to it, but I should be able to see with the brethren.
G.A.T. If anyone expresses a desire to break bread, what you look for is what is in verse 21, "And the children of Israel that were come back out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah the God of Israel, did eat".
J.T. Quite so; he is cleansing himself from all the filthiness he had been associated with.
S.McC. Verse 22 is most encouraging, that we are now in the position in buoyancy as you have been suggesting: "For Jehovah had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel". How encouraging that is!
J.T. There is another thought there, the brethren are doing it. For it says, "Jehovah had made them joyful"; that is, He comes in, it is His doing, "For Jehovah had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel". God has been operating but that comes in last. We have been doing it, but God shows that He is in the thing too. You can see the position in both these choirs, first in the dedication of the fellowship, and now in the dedication of the house. You can see how the brethren have committed themselves to the two thoughts and God says, I am thoroughly with you in it. You could not have reached this point without Me.
{107}
REVIVAL (5)
@Nehemiah 8: 1 - 18; @Malachi 3: 16 - 18
J.T. I have in mind that we might finish with the feast of tabernacles, and link it up a little with the verses read in Malachi. In order that we might have the position clearly in view, attention should be called to the year -- the spiritual year, and the seventh month. The chapter really begins, "When the seventh month came", the month of great spiritual events, the feast of trumpets and the day of atonement, the feast of ingathering, or the feast of tabernacles. And what may not have been observed by some of us is the stress laid on the people in the first section of the chapter, the general movement amongst the people to hear the word of God; not a movement arising from leadership, though the leaders come into it and help the people. The word in verse 1 is, "And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in their cities, all the people gathered together as one man to the open place that was before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel". It seems that particular notice should be taken of this because God would give us to understand that the position, the truth, is not to be carried and maintained only by leading brothers or sisters, but that all are brought into it in the sense that they want to know more about the law of Moses.
C.H.H. Would it indicate that one who held the truth should be subject to a call from his brethren?
J.T. That is the way it stands here. You mean Ezra was ready, "And they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses"; is that what you mean?
{108}
C.H.H. Yes, that servants should hold themselves in readiness where the state is suitable and where they are invited.
J.T. The question arises at this point as to these meetings that are now annual, you may say, these general meetings, as to what underlies them. Is it a movement of the people in the place? Or is it to have a big affair, the matter of serving the saints being secondary? Or is it that we would know more about the will of God? The point the people make is, "They spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel". Is that the underlying thought?
S.P. Does that show a willingness on the part of the people to come under the law and commandments as being morally suitable to this gathering together?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. It seems to be a movement among the people, a united one; "All the people gathered together as one man". They have recourse to a man available whom God can use, so that "They spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel". Then we are told, "Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation, both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month". He is amenable to call, ready, but he moved according to the proposal of the people; a remarkable thing, I believe.
S.McC. In the first verse you read it says, "they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses", and then in the second verse it says, "And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation". Is there any significance in that?
J.T. I think the word 'scribe' is a characteristic word connected with his name. It is used in chapter 7 of his own book (verse 6). His priestly status is
{109}
unquestionable, shown to be unquestionable in that chapter, and he also was "a ready scribe in the law of Moses". It would seem as if the first thought in asking him to take on this service is "the scribe", that "he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses"; not simply a man that can write well, but a man that can write in the law of Moses, conversant with things relative to the mind of God, ready in that. Evidently the people knew his qualifications.
J.R.H. I suppose the meaning of his name, 'help', would have that in view; the people were seeking help from Ezra. It was not like the prophetic word direct from God; it was more the prompting of the people.
J.T. Seemingly it was a question of exposition, which is not exactly prophetic; an exegetical service to open up, to bring things out that are already there; not a special message from God, but what was already existent in the written page. He is qualified for that, that is the point; it is a question of exposition rather. The Lord Jesus as risen exemplifies this ministry, "he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself", @Luke 24: 27. It was no question of a prophetic word but bringing the Scriptures to bear upon them.
Rem. It says in @Ezra 7: 12, "To Ezra the priest, an accomplished scribe of the law of the God of the heavens".
J.T. Yes, "the law of the God of the heavens".
S.McC. This exegetical service that you alluded to would have a large place in a meeting like this.
J.T. A very large place. God seems to use these meetings to open up what is in the Scriptures. A prophetic word is of course immediately from God supported by Scripture, but exegetical service is to bring out the thing that is already there, what God has embedded in the Scriptures, the immensity of the resources in the Scriptures.
{110}
Ques. Referring back to the fact that this was held in the seventh month, had you in mind that the saints should come to this matter spiritually in a locality, according to @Leviticus 23? The first day was to be a day of rest, and we were going to consider the matter from that point onward.
J.T. I thought it would be well to call attention to the periods of the year. It is not the lunar year that is in mind but what is called the ecclesiastical, spiritual and agricultural year. The year is a matter of crops from the divine point of view, "seed time and harvest", and this month is the harvest month. The idea is therefore to reach the great end in mind in the year, culminating at its end. The year is to be productive. I thought it would be very appropriate that we should finish our readings at the feast of tabernacles, in the end of the spiritual year.
S.McC. Is it like the crown in that sense? "Thou crownest the year with thy goodness", @Psalm 65: 11.
J.T. It would be that exactly. The seventh month is not the twelfth month, though they had twelve months in their year; the seventh month is the end of the agricultural year, and the agricultural year is the year that tells, because the point in the original divisions after the flood was seed-time and harvest. Other things are subservient to this, "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease", @Genesis 8: 22. Hence the question that arises, What is the harvest in all our exercises? What is the result in the whole matter? If there is no harvest there is nothing gained; there may be a sowing without a harvest. The idea of a harvest is what God brings in. You put your seed into the ground; God causes it to grow; God gives the result.
J.W.D. Do you think these meetings should be on an annual basis, or on the basis of spiritual prosperity in a locality?
{111}
J.T. Annual matters on the basis of the twelve-month year are apt to become crystallised and lose freshness. They just come, and we have to go through with them. I think the thought in this chapter is that they should be the outcome of the state or desire of the people. What are we looking for? What are we aiming at? Here they were aiming at the book of the law of Moses and the best available man to give them an understanding of it. It is a matter of the people. We have other scriptures that stress leadership, but here it is the people's matter. These annual meetings are apt to give undue importance to the localities in which they are held, and so lose their force; and the localities themselves are apt to gain the least of all from them, because they are occupied with the service and the like. This chapter is to correct that, we are thinking of "the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel".
E.P. Do you think the open place and the water-gate suggest the recognised need of adjustment? What is your thought as to the water-gate?
J.T. I was connecting it with the good judgment of the people. How rightly governed they are in principles! "All the people gathered together as one man to the open place that was before the water-gate". We are dealing now with local matters in an open, transparent way; we are ready for the will of God; we have nothing else in mind. We are open about it and there is plenty of room; the open place means there is plenty of scope for anyone to come, and then the pulpit of wood is to make the matter thoroughly successful. I mean to say, if we are having a meeting like this the consideration of the brethren is that in all the externals there should be nothing to hinder; the meeting-place, the arrangements and time of meetings, everything should be thought out from our side so that the thing should
{112}
be a success. This open place suggests there is plenty of room, and the water-gate would suggest that it is a time now for the administration of things that are suggested in water, refreshment, because the promise of old was "Assemble the people, and I will give them water", @Numbers 21: 16. It does not name any man who is to do it, but "I will give them water". Jehovah promised to do it and the people have that in mind.
E.G.McA. Would you say the people here in this chapter were in the good of what we had this morning, this wonderful procession that reached even to the water-gate eastward? They were in the good of this and so they called this man to expound the law.
J.T. I think that is good.
Ques. Our brother made reference in prayer to the last great day of the feast, and would there be anything in that in relation to this meeting now and the subject in hand?
J.T. Well, we are having a great day; we would expect the last one to be that. You would expect an accumulation of wealth in our meeting.
Ques. I was thinking, they say to the Lord, "Remove hence and go into Judaea". He says, "Go ye up", but He goes up later. The question in my mind is what is in our minds in an occasion like this, whether a set occasion is in our minds. The Lord brings in the water idea, does He not, when He says, "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water". Does that enter into an occasion like this?
J.T. You are alluding to @John 7. The feast was running its course and the Lord evidently implied that they were thirsting and there was really no water, so that the water-gate all centred in Him, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink", @John 7: 37. That was the idea. Those who assembled
{113}
at Jerusalem at that time did not have the right thought. His brethren said, "Manifest thyself to the world", but the Lord says, "My time is not yet come"; I am going to have a great display but not yet. But then He went up privately, which is the whole present position; it is a question of the dispensation, to be unknown as regards men. The Lord went up in the last day of the feast when they did not have anything to satisfy their thirst. The water-gate, the administration of the refreshment of God, was not there, but it was in Him. He went up privately, that is the position in John. He cried and said, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink" (verse 37). There are several cries recorded, and this is one of the Lord's cries because it was urgent that there should be water administered.
S.McC. The open place was not there either. He went up "not openly".
J.T. He went up privately and that is the position today; our position is obscure but the real thing is there, that is the point.
S.McC. There may be the thought of inviting Ezra, and yet having reserves perhaps. The open place would stand over against that so that there might be full room for Ezra and his exposition of the law.
J.T. I think that is the thought. All these external matters are important and I believe they are applicable now at the end of this series of meetings, that we might be reminded what underlies these meetings in the localities in which they are held. Are they according to God? Are we seeking the will of God? The book of the law of God which He commanded Israel -- that is what is to be in our minds, and then all the externals should conduce to that; everything should be made conducive to that. We should not leave anything to the Lord which we can do ourselves. People often say as to certain externals, We
{114}
will leave it to the Lord. It is a very great mistake; we should do it ourselves. The Lord would say, Do it yourselves, you can do it. All the externals that enter into our meeting rooms in a general way should be attended to by us, "And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation ... . And he read in it before the open place that was before the water-gate from the morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and those that could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. And Ezra the scribe stood upon a high stage of wood, which they had made for the purpose", @Nehemiah 8: 2 - 4. Notice that they are not handicapping him in any way; they made this stage for the purpose and he uses what they made; that is, there is every possible convenience to make the matter a success, to make it what it should be.
J.R.H. So that we ought to be free from everything in the way of formality in meetings such as these. Is it your thought that we should be together in the accumulation of previous exercises?
J.T. I think the month, as I said, is harvest month, that is the last month of the agricultural year. Obviously they would have that in mind, their minds would be full of this at the end of the year. And as to what has been remarked about externals, things are attended to; there is nothing to interfere so far as external preparations are concerned, all is conducive to the success of the service, even the pulpit of wood. It was prepared for the occasion, it was not an ordinary one that you would get in an ordinary church; it was one suitable for the purpose. There is no ecclesiastical pretension attached to it; it is an improvised thing, and Ezra would say, I will use that.
H.B. In connection with Peter, Cornelius says, "Now therefore *we* are all present before God to
{115}
hear all things that are commanded thee of God", @Acts 10: 33.
J.T. Very good; they were all there. Cornelius and his friends were all there. It was his thought; he sent for Peter, just as they asked Ezra here, and Peter was available.
S.McC. What does this pulpit of wood suggest to you, mere externals or some moral thought?
J.T. I do not think it is much more than externals. "And Ezra the scribe stood upon a high stage of wood, which they had made for the purpose"; just a thing simply and thoughtfully made for the purpose and he used it, I suppose the idea was that his voice should be heard. This microphone is God's creature, no matter how it is put together; it is not the devil's creature; just as a high pulpit of wood or a pair of glasses is God's creature; you use it simply because it augments the service.
S.P. Would you say a little more with regard to these meetings becoming crystallised? The pulpit of wood is not something to be put away and taken out next time; it was made for this occasion.
J.T. It is not a fixed thing at all. I think the less crystallised we are in these things the better. Let everything be fresh and ready for the particular occasion in mind.
Ques. What about these thirteen men beside him?
J.T. You may have in your mind that these are the brothers who sit on the platform. I think there is something in that. There are brethren that are more outstanding in supporting the truth. Why should the Spirit of God go over these hard names, difficult to pronounce, so that they should be read before us in the western world thousands of years afterwards? Why should it be? Well, it is God keeping fresh before us that He is taking account of these names. The idea of 'name' is clearly renown, and any little bit of spiritual renown that any one
{116}
has God honours. He will honour it even to the mention of the name at a particular time.
J.R.H. Would not the pulpit of wood be the exalted place gift is given in the affections of the saints?
J.T. I think it might be, but it is more that they would like to hear him; as much as to say, We are asking Ezra to give this exposition, we want to hear what he says. It is much more like that.
Rem. The open place suggests that the brother would be given liberty and scope as he came before the brethren. And then the water-gate suggests the spiritual aspect, the refreshment.
J.T. That is good. The water-gate is the idea of the administration of spiritual refreshment, because you must never omit the idea of administration on these occasions, for after all it is a divine administration. We always like to say to the Lord, It is Your matter, but He might say, It is *your* matter. The great governing thought is that it is the Lord's matter and it is a question of what He administers; for the Father has given all things into His hand and He is ready to administer to us if we give Him opportunity. The incident at Jerusalem in @John 7 is one of the most striking. It was the time of the feast of tabernacles, yet there is no provision made for the water-gate; but it is there in the Man who went up privately: "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink. He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", @John 7: 37 - 39. That is, He had not yet gone up into heaven, the place of administering, but even so He is already speaking of it.
{117}
J.B. Would the thirteen men named here with Ezra be in line with him, to support him in connection with this movement?
J.T. They would. We have these brothers beside him and it says, "And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up" (verse 5). Notice the constant recurrence of "the people" in this section; it is what they are doing. They went to hear Ezra, they have made this pulpit of wood for him and he is on it and they are all listeners, a very fine position. You may be sure God is going to give results and blessing this time.
E.G.McA. Feasts might become crystallised because of being annual. That is an exercising thought. This scripture would indicate that every external as well as internal condition of the people would make it easy for Ezra to minister. You have thirteen on the platform and thirteen down amongst the people who are ready to minister.
J.T. "And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen! with lifting up of their hands; and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground". Then we have these others named, and the Levites "caused the people to understand the law; and the people stood in their place"; so these men that are mentioned are all helpers. Whether they are armour-bearers or supporters of Ezra or whether they are doing the work among the brethren they are helpers.
E.G.McA. The suggestion is that contributions should be helpful, so that the people generally should understand the law.
J.T. Those down among the people like yourself are to make yourselves heard.
T.U. In reference to the numerous mentions of the people, it says their ears were attentive.
{118}
J.T. The whole series of facts mentioned shows that the state was there and that it was a movement of God in the people, a most important matter. It is not a question of certain leaders bringing them together, but of their own movement; and the word to everyone here today is, What is my motive in all this?
Ques. I was going to remark that Ezra begins in speaking to God at the outset. Would you help us in regard to which One of the divine Persons we should address in opening a gathering such as this?
J.T. Of course in the Old Testament there was only one Person known; the three Persons in the Trinity were not as yet disclosed, but They are now; and therefore it is a question as to which should be addressed in relation to any given circumstance and that is a question of priestly intelligence. In a meeting such as this, as we begin, it is, I think, in order and seemly to address God. "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him", @1 Corinthians 8: 6. That is the great general position of christianity; it is one God, the Father, the great general position. But then John tells us, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3: 35); that of course brings us round to the Person who has the administration in His hand. We have to think of Him because it is a time for administration; whether it be the water-gate or whatever gate it is, it is the time for administration. Every gate refers to Christ and His administrative authority. It is therefore a question of spiritual intelligence as to whether we should address God or the Lord, because they are both God, whether we are addressing One or the Other. In addressing the Lord we are addressing Him in His mediatorial position. Both are right, it is only a question of spiritual intelligence; the Lord may be addressed or the Father may be addressed, God as Father. If it be a matter
{119}
of immediate administration I should refer to the Lord Jesus in prayer. It says here, "And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen!". So that they begin with worship. Whatever form that might take it seems suitable that all should be directed God-ward, because the great general position is, "One God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him"; and secondly, "one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him". The word 'by' there is administrative, that is, things come in through Him.
C.H.H. Would this indicate the high level on which this revival is? The two previous revivals that we have looked at do not begin with worship but with cleansing and opening doors; but here it begins with worship.
J.T. I think it is very appropriate. Ezra gives the lead now and the people say, "Amen"; they begin the thing but now he is leading. They put him in the place and he is leading in relation to God first; he is carrying them with him. A very important thing in the ministry is to carry the saints with you. Here they say, "Amen, Amen!", meaning that they are thoroughly with him in what he is doing.
Rem. Would it help for all the people to be standing up? We do much sitting down.
J.T. That is another thing, the standing up is good. There is a great deal of it now. The Lord seems to stress it, that we should stand up under certain circumstances, but still we do not want to be attitudinarians. Ours is a dispensation marked by liberty, where sonship reigns. It says of David that he "sat before Jehovah" (@1 Chronicles 17: 16), which is very unusual; it points to our dispensation, going beyond the old dispensation.
J.R.H. Would you say that the one who leads should promote the spirit of worship in the people who hear the word?
{120}
J.T. I think that is a good suggestion for us. They stood up and assented by the words, "Amen, Amen!". We cannot always take examples in the Old Testament literally, but I think it is good for brethren to say, "Amen"; it shows that we are listening and are moving in the current of the Spirit.
Ques. You mean the sisters too when you say the brethren, do you not?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would the standing represent a priestly sensitiveness among the people to receive the mind of God, as Ezra read from the book?
J.T. I think so, it marks a priest's attitude. You are at attention, ready for priest's service. And then it goes on to say, "And they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground"; that is another attitude. External attitude is stressed here. The lifting up of hands is supplicatory; bowing their heads is submission and reverence. There are remarkable spiritual attitudes here which ought to be noted, because we are apt in assembly to be irreverent.
E.G.McA. The additional word 'holy' in 1 Timothy would have some effect upon the bowing and worshipping, would it?
J.T. "Lifting up pious [or holy] hands, without wrath or reasoning", @1 Timothy 2: 8. I think that attitude is supplicatory. If I have anything on my hands contrary to God I cannot hold them up. They must be clean hands.
Rem. The man in @John 9 was led on to this gradually so that he came to the point where he worshipped, showing that the Lord did not introduce the subject until the man was ready for it, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?". He evidently was ready for the reference to the Son of God.
J.T. Quite so; then he worshipped. I think these are all very important matters in regard of what we
{121}
call our general meetings, to take away from them all mere officialism and crystallisation and tradition, any thought of adding to ourselves in the way of distinction because we have this great affair. Let it be a question of the will of God, learning the will of God, "the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel". Then it goes on in verse 8, "And they read in the law of God distinctly out of the book, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading". This is a word for those who are ministering; all are taken into account here. "They read in the law of God distinctly ... and gave the sense, and caused them to understand"; that is, we must exercise patience with the brethren. If they do not understand we should seek to make them understand, to get them to understand, because after all hearing is not everything, understanding must be present. Philip says to the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" @Acts 8: 30. If I have not understanding the Lord will give it. The brethren who are able to give understanding to any ought to be ready to do it with patience.
H.B. Shepherd and teacher seems to be one gift in Scripture, as though teaching has to be done in the spirit of the shepherd.
J.T. I think that is right; shepherd and teacher is one gift really.
C.H.H. Would what follows in verse 7 take place after such a meeting as this? Would this occur in principle after the general meetings such as today?
J.T. As has been remarked, it is those who stood among the brethren who caused them to understand. Your thought would be that in the intervals that we should be able to instruct one another, and then to carry the instruction through to our localities. The Lord has helped the brethren generally in attending the large meetings that are being held now, and in
{122}
carrying back a synopsis of them and going over them with the brethren on a particular night in their several localities. Not that you want to enlarge on it unduly, but it is good to spread the thing abroad; whatever is there let the brethren get the good of it.
C.H.H. I think the reading occurring from morning until midday may be to suggest what might be the outcome of it, that there was time left to assimilate all that came out in the ministry. These thirteen were able to take it back to their localities.
J.W. Would the verse which says "Send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared", bear on what you have said?
J.T. That is the next thing. Verse 9 is more the prophetic sort of thing coming authoritatively, as you might say, "And Nehemiah, that is, the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that explained to the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God, mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. And he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared; for the day is holy to our Lord; and be not grieved, for the joy of Jehovah is your strength. And the Levites quieted all the people, saying, Be still! for the day is holy; neither be grieved. And all the people went their way, to eat and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing. For they had understood the words that were declared to them". I think it is a very fine passage as bringing out the idea of joy. Christianity involves joyfulness; it involves sobriety, of course, and mourning, but there is a time for everything; a time like this is not a time for mourning or confessing, but rather for joyfulness. What God affords to us on these occasions shows that they are worth while attending; God gives us compensation in the sense of joy in these occasions.
{123}
One has been struck with the prominence given to rejoicing and gladness in all these scriptures we have read. The Tirshatha, the scribe and the Levites are spiritual enough and authoritative enough to remind the people of this, so that the matter should not be spoiled by what does not properly fit into it. It might fit in elsewhere, but not here. The people need to be stimulated at this time; we all do. So that we return to our localities in the sense of stimulation, resolving to go in more definitely for the things of God. It is worth while to do so. If we have these happy times at these occasions why can we not have them locally? And we can.
S.McC. It is called here "the joy of Jehovah". Would that be an exalted aspect of this rejoicing?
J.T. It was not a matter of their own. Jehovah really was giving the stimulation. I think we all feel in these meetings a divine touch that gives us stimulation and causes joy. The Lord says, "Peace be to you" in @John 20, and "The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord". Let it be established, this thought of joy. "Rejoice in the Lord always, again I will say, Rejoice", @Philippians 4: 4.
Ques. This "mourn not, nor weep" -- is there a tendency to droop even with the great ministry we are having? The great tendency is for the saints to droop, so that Ezra and Nehemiah seem to work together to forestall anything like that here.
J.T. The point was to stimulate the people. It was worth while, it was the people's matter. They are set for the things of God, and God is honouring them. He wants them to have the best; I think that is the point. God would love to bring us into the atmosphere of heaven and He brings the atmosphere of heaven where we can really enjoy the thing.
S.R.McC. "Send portions". Are we to take of that spirit?
{124}
J.T. Carry the thing to our localities; there is nothing prepared for them, they are not here -- spread it abroad.
J.W. In the administration of matters in localities, is there not a tendency in matters of discipline perhaps that the mourning and weeping would overcome us? But would all this result in God getting a greater place as His joy is our strength?
J.T. I think God would keep this before us, that the dispensation is a victorious one, notwithstanding the great failure in the captivity, the failure of Israel which is not overlooked in this book but is fully confessed. At the same time the dispensation is the dispensation, God is God, the Spirit is the Spirit, the Scriptures are the Scriptures, the assembly is the assembly. Let us make full room for the positive side of the blessing. So that the Lord in opening His mouth in @Matthew 5 says, "Blessed" nine times over, as if to stimulate us with blessing.
A.H.P. The Lord's service in the end of Luke is like this. I am referring to where the Lord opens their understanding and then, "He led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them. And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven. And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God", @Luke 24: 50 - 53. I wondered if that might answer to the saints as in a scene like this.
J.T. Very much so. It seems to me that in that passage God is rendering a testimony in the temple of what He is ready to give to Israel. It was there for Israel if they were ready for it. The temple was never so joyous as when those saints went into it.
E.P. Do you think in the first epistle of Corinthians there is the reading of the law, and then in the second the service of Paul to console them, "Lest
{125}
perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief", @2 Corinthians 2: 7.
J.T. He speaks much of Titus joy and his own joy in what had taken place in Corinth through the first letter.
J.S.T. Is the spirit of the dispensation in that verse, "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place. For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish", @2 Corinthians 2: 14, 15?
J.T. Quite so. The second letter to the Corinthians is full of this thought, over-abounding in joy. Like the new bottles full of new wine, the bottles are not burst. To verse 12 of our chapter it is the first meeting of the conference; the second is in verse 13. "And on the second day were gathered together the chief fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to gain wisdom as to the words of the law". It is not the people now, only certain ones, the chief fathers of the people and the priests and the Levites. It is a different character of meeting. It is not in the open place and all the people are not mentioned; it is the chief fathers. And now it looks as if there is progress being made, and the elder brethren, invited brethren, spiritual brethren, want to go further. In spite of the great joy of the first day they want to go further. It goes on to tell us, "And they found written in the law which Jehovah had commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month, and that they should publish and proclaim through all their cities, and at Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive-branches, and wild olive-branches, and myrtle-branches, and palm-branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written". This is a very important and interesting meeting that has been
{126}
taken as a basis for the special meetings in different parts of the world, and I think it is a basis for them, for special invitations to come together, as it says, "to gain wisdom as to the words of the law".
C.H.H. Would you say we have not arrived at this in this country yet?
J.T. No, we have not. The first meeting seems to be as far as we can go in this country. It is just as well for us to accept our limitations for if we do we shall get blessing.
J.R.H. Does the thought of understanding come out in connection with the first day, but the thought of wisdom in the second day?
J.T. That is what we have here. Ezra had done well on the first occasion apparently, and these elder brethren, spiritual brethren, invited men, see that he can do more. God is using this man fully and they come to him now. At the first meeting they ask Ezra to come; the people arrange the matter and then ask Ezra. But this time there is no question of the open place or the water-gate, but of Ezra: they "were gathered together ... to Ezra the scribe"; very remarkable! That is, God is showing that there is more; you can go further and here is a brother who is available. So they say, 'Let us ask him'. It is a question of wisdom, "to gain wisdom as to the words of the law. And they found written in the law which Jehovah had commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month". That had not been mentioned earlier; it had not been spoken of on the first day of the feast of the seventh month; but on the second day they reach the feast of tabernacles.
Rem. Deuteronomy would be the opening up of the wisdom of the words of the law. That is a book that saints have been much helped by in matters that have arisen in our day.
{127}
J.T. Well, quite so.
C.H.H. Would you say that in this particular meeting in verse 13 it is a question of finding things out which you would not have found out in a meeting like the previous one?
J.T. Exactly; the persons present are of greater spiritual depth. Not that there is any reflection on any saint, but there are such things as measure and stature and wealth and princeliness and so forth. All these words denote specialty, and if that specialty affords better conditions for understanding divine things why not employ it? It is a question of using a condition that is conducive to a great end. Then why not employ it? It is only right to employ it.
A.H.P. Some few years ago the Lord used such an occasion as that to bring out the question of His deity.
J.T. Just that. Many such things have come out in that way. The more spiritual the atmosphere, the more likelihood of reaching deeper things. "The Spirit", we are told, "searches all things, even the depths of God", @1 Corinthians 2: 10. And then "The spiritual discerns all things" (verse 15). If you have a dozen spiritual men together you have a means in the hands of God that is of great value. Why not use it? God uses it if you allow Him to.
C.H.H. In accepting our limitations, would you not commend that we have it before us that this might obtain in this country?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord is ready for anything if you are ready to go in for it. This seems to be the first incident of this kind and God blesses it. It is remarkable that it comes in just here.
W.McK. What is the idea of dwelling in booths on the second day? How does that apply now?
J.T. That is the next thing to consider, what this feast means. Verses 14 and 15 say, "And they found written in the law which Jehovah had commanded
{128}
through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month, and that they should publish and proclaim through all their cities, and at Jerusalem, saying, Go forth ...". That is, there is a disclosure from this scripture, chapter 23 of Leviticus, that they were to provide the booths. There it is, it is brought out now, and let us act upon it. What does it mean? Well, Israel did it when they came out of Egypt; that was when they were in the very best condition that they had ever been in, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him", @Hosea 11: 1. Conditions were good; he went after Jehovah in the wilderness and they dwelt in booths. It means they dwelt near one another. They did not need large houses; they could live together. The whole point is that we love one another so that we can be near one another. We notice it here, the getting together in each others houses after the meetings. How the brethren like it! How happy it is!
W.McK. Uriah the Hittite says when David wanted him to go down and dwell in his own house, "The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in booths; ... shall I then go into my house?" @2 Samuel 11: 11.
J.T. That was in war time, meaning that they were in uncomfortable circumstances as compared with houses. Here the thought is that they so loved one another that they could dwell near one another, the nearer the better.
E.P. Would this apply to the breaking of bread being in houses instead of one large hall?
J.T. It might. It really applies more to the saints houses. You notice here where the booths were made, they "made themselves booths" (verse 16). They are not concerned about palatial conditions such as you get in the book of Amos; you will find the allusion there to palatial conditions, commodious, well-furnished, well-appointed houses. They are not
{129}
concerned about that here; they make booths on the roofs of their houses, in the courts of the house of God and in the open space of the water-gate. They are not concerned about any palatial grandeur or comfort; they are concerned about getting together, getting the saints together. We want to be together whatever the accommodation. The saints are there; the joy is in the presence of the saints.
C.H.H. The prophet Haggai stirred them up by a prophetic word on this occasion, for they had been dwelling in their own ceiled houses previously.
J.T. They could provide their own houses but they could not build a house for the Lord.
S.McC. This getting together in connection with the thought of booths in relation to our households, would promote love in a very practical and simple way amongst us. It is very much needed.
J.T. Very much needed. It would be a great victory if the Lord obtained this at the end, because it is the last feast of the year. It brought about conditions in which the saints are happy with one another whatever the external conditions might be. It is not a question of special friendships here, persons I like particularly, but the saints; because they are the saints I love them.
E.G.McA. I was wondering if these booths in these conspicuous places would indicate that in every locality there are houses open for the brethren as they move through?
J.T. That is right. They are not concerned about appearance, palatial or sumptuous conditions; it is a question of the saints being together near one another. It is the last feast of the year and what does it mean? It is going into eternity; the feast of tabernacles is going into eternity! It is the saints loving one another. We are not fit to go to heaven if we do not love one another. This feast means we come near to one another and we do not want to
{130}
go up without one another. God "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", @Ephesians 2: 6.
E.P. In @1 Corinthians 11: 22 the rich were putting to shame those who had not; but in the second epistle under the ministry of the new covenant and reconciliation they would all be rich in the precious thoughts of God.
J.T. Very good. The rich made much of their riches according to the first epistle and they were despising the poor, contrary to the feast of tabernacles.
Rem. God Himself indicated this nearness in Christ coming down in flesh Himself, God Himself dwelling among men.
J.T. He tabernacled amongst us. The word 'tabernacled' is used, which is the idea of the booth, "The tabernacle of God is with men" (@Revelation 21: 3); God comes near to them, living amongst them.
E.G.McA. Would James have the thought of the booth, the tabernacle, in his second chapter, in his reference to the rich man with the gold ring?
J.T. Quite so.
S.P. You do not go down to Cyprus as Barnabas and Mark did in @Acts 15; Paul and Silas go through Syria and Cilicia to see how the brethren are getting on.
J.T. Very significant. In a future day anybody that does not come to the feast of tabernacles will get no rain; there is no love unless you come to the feast of tabernacles. There is much more that could be said about how these booths were made; it says, "Go forth to the mount" (verse 15), and then we are told that "all the congregation of them that had come back from the captivity made booths" (verse 17). So that we are back nearer to the beginning in this feast than in any of the others we have considered.
{131}
C.H.H. Would that suggest the testimony of the assembly's history, that it comes back to apostolic days?
J.T. Well, I think so; it would be as at the beginning; love now is the same as love at the beginning. It is the same thing; I think that is the idea, that the dispensation should end with that; the saints loving one another, getting near one another, going up together. We "shall be caught up together" it says.
Ques. Would these branches be the features of Christ?
J.T. I think each one has its own meaning. We can weave into the olive branches features of the Spirit. Myrtle branches would allude to evergreens, the freshness of life. Palm branches would refer to victory, and we have thick trees for protection.
Ques. This great spiritual height must be reached as a direct result of this meeting of the brothers. Would you say how this might work out today in these meetings such as you have in England, how they might affect the whole assembly to such a point as this?
J.T. It has been suggested that we might have them in this country or in Canada, but we have not been able to reach it as far as I can see. The character of our general meetings is more like the first day. I am sure God would be with us in helping us to reach the second day, to get to the higher level the Scriptures afford, "Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they observed the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance". I think the eighth day leads into what is beyond.
J.R.H. I suppose it is possible to enjoy the feast of booths without having the second day as we have been looking at it together?
{132}
J.T. I think it is. I think we do enjoy it, love is amongst us, thank God. It indicates, I think, a definite point reached when we are able to do something because of love. This gathering is built up on the fact of love, not in the abstract but in actual love. The Lord says, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13: 35. That alludes to it as having a quantity of it. If you have got that then you can proceed with this feast.
J.W. Would the result be seen in Malachi, in the book of remembrance being written?
J.T. I think it would be well to finish with that. The verses read speak of persons answering to the mind of God in a state of things which is wholly adverse to His mind. The word "Then" in verse 16 calls attention to the contrast, to conditions at a given time; 'then' is an adverb of time; the sentence begins with it. The early part of the chapter describes the external conditions. How objectionable to God they were! In verse 13, "Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but ye say, What have we been speaking against thee? Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts? And now we hold the proud for happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and they escape". That is what marked the time. The word "Then" is to call attention to a particular time, and how abominable to God the conditions were! But then there are those, very few but seen by God, those few in that time, in that particular time, those "that feared Jehovah" and "spoke often one to another". It is a well-known passage. I think it is well to call attention to the adverb "Then"; it is God putting things against each other. What delight He has in the saints who fear His name and speak often one to another!
{133}
W.G.T. It seems to correspond with the feast of booths. The real thing is right here, getting the actual branches, the doing of the thing.
J.T. We are not told what they say, it is just that they are dwelling close to one another, brethren talking with one another about what is profitable.
C.H.H. Would it fit in with the second prayer of the apostle, "being rooted and founded in love"?
J.T. Quite so. And how the divine thought is reached in this last book! How God comes back to the thought of sonship, which He began with in those few, the greatest thought, "They shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him", "His own son", very precious!
H.B. Would the expression, "I will spare", link on virtually with the words, "*I* also will keep thee"?
J.T. Quite so. God will do His best to protect us from everything that is against us. It is a comfort that the Lord has made that promise; I think we ought to reckon on it; "*I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial". We are entitled to count on that promise, we are to be kept out of it.
{134}
THE OPERATIONS OF GOD AT THE PRESENT TIME
@Jeremiah 18: 1 - 10; @Ezekiel 37: 1 - 14
I wish to speak on the operations of God at the present time, particularly the sphere of these operations, and in entering on this subject to remind the brethren that in operating, God has entered into an economy, the wording conveying it is, "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him", @1 Corinthians 8: 6. That is the idea of God as presented in the economy in His supremacy as of the Source of all, "of whom all things".
Our minds thus understand that the operations are God's, but that there is in the economy the idea of instrumentality, and that the instrumentality is commensurate with the idea of God -- not creature instrumentality, but divine -- commensurate with the idea of God, and yet operating subordinately. All things are of God, but they are effected by Him who is said to be "one Lord, Jesus Christ". There is no limitation to the power of the instrumentality; it is a glorious one, "All things" are by Him. The word 'by' means instrumentality, and hence we are enjoined in another epistle, "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love", @Ephesians 3: 17. "The Christ" there is an operative term; it refers to Christ as the great divine Operator in the economy into which God has come. He is to be in our hearts, "the Christ", the great divine Operator; and He is to dwell in our hearts by faith. When He begins to operate directly in relation to the coming world, all will be manifest: "When the Christ is manifested who is our life, then shall *ye* also be manifested with him in glory", @Colossians 3: 4. Then it
{135}
will no longer be a matter of faith; we shall "be manifested with him in glory". In the meantime the operations are carried on in a way which the natural eye cannot discern and the natural mind cannot take in; it is for faith. The great divine Operator is to be in our hearts, as it is said, on the principle of faith; but we as "rooted and founded in love".
As I said, in speaking of this I have in mind to call attention to the sphere of these operations at the present time, that is, the saints. Of God's work in relation to creation we are told, "By whom also he made the worlds", @Hebrews 1: 2. It is a wonderful thought, how they were made: "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (@Hebrews 11: 3), but the actual means, the detail, is not disclosed. The immensity of the matter indeed, dear brethren, places it beyond the compass of the creature: "by faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God". That does not mean we can compass the matter, for it is so vast; it is beyond the creature's mind to grasp. Still, we are not left out of it; God would not leave us out of anything in that sense. "The sons of God shouted for joy" (@Job 38: 7), at the time of the foundation of the earth; God let them into it in some sense so that they understood something of it and rejoiced, "shouted for joy". Divine operations always carry that thought; they are wonderful, not simply awe inspiring, but cause joy to those who are in the relation of sons, the sons of God.
We have come into that relation on a higher level than those sons spoken of in the book of Job. We are in relation to Christ, and let into more than they were let into. So that our joy should certainly be always full; every vista of creation ought to occasion joy. Wisdom says that in all this, "I was there" (@Proverbs 8: 27), and I was "rejoicing". It says wisdom rejoiced, showing that there was good reason for it,
{136}
it was not mere sentimental exuberance. There is a good reason for it when wisdom rejoices, and moreover, "my delights were with the sons of men", @Proverbs 8: 31.
The Scriptures are freighted with the idea of delight and joy, dear brethren, carrying us along like a river triumphantly in glory. The Spirit of God is here today bringing in the whole matter, in principle at least, "the earnest of our inheritance" (@Ephesians 1: 14), bringing it into all our hearts. Well now, the sphere of all the operations of God in the economy is men: "rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the sons of men", showing that that is the great idea with God in His creation -- that God brought Christ in where men are, and expressed His delight in Him. That is, He gives the real, supreme lead in all that, both to God and to us: "in whom I have found my delight", @Matthew 3: 17. That voice at the Jordan was intended to give impetus to all that was there, all that was current in the way of faith, to stimulate the whole matter and bring the new order of things into being and set it going by the glorious Man "in whom I have found my delight". It has never ceased, never; it has widened to the inclusion of all the sons. We are brought into that blessed relation to God, with the One "in whom I have found my delight". So God is working with material entirely congenial; that is what I wanted to speak on in Jeremiah.
First I want to show that the prophet in each case is brought into a sphere, directed into a sphere, and the operation is going on, or about to go on. In Jeremiah the sphere is styled "the potter's house", not a potter's factory, but a potter's house. The antitype is in the mind of the Spirit, dear brethren, always, and so God is operating house-wise in this wonderful time. The beautiful thought in @John 8: 35 is that the son abides in the house for ever; He is
{137}
there in that relation as a divine Operator, the Son. What is He doing? He sets free. Immediately preceding that beautiful verse we have the Lord's own words to those who have professedly believed on Him; as disciples of His they should know the truth and the truth should set them free.
Now what one observes in difficulties amongst the people of God is that generally we are governed by persons in our judgment and in our movements. In a certain sense it is right for young people, especially, to follow their leaders, obey their leaders, but if that be mentioned we are introduced to the thought of Christ, "the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come", @Hebrews 13: 8. We are not to slip away from Christ through any leader. The true leader says, "*Ye* became our imitators, and of the Lord" (@1 Thessalonians 1: 6); he passes them on to the Lord. I should be exceedingly grieved to think I misguided anybody through personal influence. Any lead one gives should direct to the Lord, should go on that line. So that the truth is the first thing in this matter; the Lord says, "The truth shall set you free" (@John 8: 32) -- the truth will do it. Hence the point is to begin with the facts of any case and the principles involved governing it. "The truth shall set you free"; and then in the beautiful passage I quoted, the precious pre-eminent Person must be "the Son". He is operating in the house; He would have us in the house; it is the place of affection. So He says, "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free", @John 8: 36. He abides in the house for ever, the servant does not.
And so here it is not the potter's factory, but the potter's house, for God would not descend to the thought of a factory or a workshop; He would say to us, I am operating in a sphere of affection. The very surroundings would help you in the operation. Well, what is the operation? He is making something,
{138}
we are told, on the wheels. It says, "I went down to the potter's house; and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels" (verse 3). It is a remarkable thing -- the wheels revolve, you know, and acquire momentum as they go. He was operating on the wheels and the vessel of clay that he made "was marred, as clay, in the hand of the potter". It is still clay, it is not a finished vessel, it is still in the making. The marring has happened but that is not final. The potter has his own thought and he can remake the same material; and it says, "as seemed good to the potter to make".
Now, dear brethren, one would say that each of us is in the hand of the Potter, each christian, from Paul down. The great apostle was in the hand of the Potter; it is a question of discipline. We are in the making all the time. The Lord says to Peter and Andrew, "I will make you"; the principle is that the operation is going on among the brethren, among the saints. The Potter is operating on the wheels in His house, and marring takes place. What causes this marring? It is a moral matter; it is a moral issue, and hence the remedy is given in the explanation; it is when the person repents that the Maker proceeds to form the vessel as He would wish him to be, as it pleases Him. That is the point, dear brethren. Every one of us is in the making, nobody is to assume that he is a finished vessel. You are not a finished vessel. We are in the making and we do not want to get out of the hands of the Potter in that sense. The marring takes place through the action of our wills, no other way; that is what happened in Adam. We have to take this book allegorically, we have to place it in relation to divine operations in man. In the beginning man became marred in the hands of God, but God did not throw him away. He retained the thought and the process went on, but the moral issue must be faced; and so the explanation is in verses 7
{139}
and 8: "At the moment that I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, then I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them". That is to say, the identity is the same. The true reading is, "the vessel that he made was marred, as clay, in the hand of the potter", meaning that the thing is there, the material is there yet.
Now, dear brethren, let us put ourselves into this, what God is in His love to us, in His operations today. We are in the making, and if there be a marring, what is the secret of it? The exercise of will, nothing else but the exercise of my will. Let Satan in, and of course he mars the vessel; it is his business, as it were, to do that, to act against God. As every single christian believer in Christ comes into being on this earth, Satan is set to damage him. "Hast thou considered my servant Job?", God says (@Job 1: 8). 'I have considered him' -- that is the answer immediately. 'I have considered him'. What has he considered him for? To mar him. Job was in the making, as each of us is, and Satan is watching, 'I have considered'. Satan would say, 'How can I get in there?' God fences us round, or Satan would soon overwhelm us. The Lord says to Peter, "Satan has demanded to have you, to sift you as wheat; but *I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not", @Luke 22: 31, 32. Satan has desires; he meditates. How is the vessel going to be marred? It is marred in the hand of the potter, marred as clay. Thank God for the thought of the clay, that it is still usable and not gone. Judas is gone for ever, gone to his own place. His place was fixed -- a most solemn thing.
In the next chapter we have the prophet directed to another sphere, the gate of the pottery, not the house. It is not marred pottery now -- it is a finished vessel, but this flagon is to be broken; this vessel is
{140}
broken to pieces, meaning there is no salvation for it. The matter is fixed as in the case of Judas. It was a most solemn thing in the matter of Judas, the matter was fixed and he goes to his own place. Peter was marred, as many of us have been, but he was in the making. But then there was this action of will; Satan is ready to get in in the action of will, and hence the marring, but it is the marring as clay. A truly converted person can never be other than clay, in some sense usable to God to make something out of him. You want to let God make the best out of you, make you like Christ; that is His ideal. I have My pleasure in Him, God says, "In whom I have found my delight". If He has delight in me it is because I am like Christ. I am in the making and God is making me according to Christ; and if I am marred because of the action of my own will God would say, I am not going to change My mind about you, I will carry on.
I was speaking about the finished vessel in chapter 19 being a fixed matter, there is no hope for it. In chapter 19 it is the valley of Hinnom; it is Gehenna, the lake of fire for Judas and for the man of sin. There are many whose destiny is fixed before they die, let nobody forget that; I mean from the divine side; Judas was fixed, that of the man of sin was fixed. Many others are like that, persons even classified as the Lord's, their destiny is fixed. It is very solemn. But then, even as to christians, my place in the testimony may be final; I mean to say, if I pursue a course of will as in the assembly. People must behave rightly in the house of God. People coming into the presence of God, into the assembly and misbehaving are not only in a wrong attitude of mind, but it is actually wrong behaviour in the presence of God. The time may come when that behaviour may be fixed on you. You will not be lost, but your position in the testimony is fixed,
{141}
that you have no more part in it -- a most solemn thing. It says, "But *he* shall be saved, but so as through the fire" (@1 Corinthians 3: 15); but you have no more part in the testimony. In @1 Corinthians 14: 38 we are told, "But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant", the matter is fixed. He has settled the matter himself; his will is governing him. He has had every opportunity, and God would say, Let him be that, such as he is. As a matter of fact he is asleep in the mind of God: "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep", @1 Corinthians 11: 30. In the mind of God these people are finished as regards the testimony here; it is most solemn. If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged with the world; it is a dreadful thing to be judged with the world. Think of the period fixed on the divine calendar! This person is out of the testimony, he has got out of it, his will is acting; he is obdurate and ignorant, and will be ignorant. He has shut his eyes to the truth. It is most solemn! "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep". When a person sleeps he is finished, he is out of it as regards the testimony -- not as regards his eternal salvation, thank God! It is the action of will, and God abominates it. If any man will be filthy -- go and speak to him? No! -- let him be filthy still. The matter is fixed, "He that is holy, let him be sanctified still", @Revelation 22: 11. Thank God, there is that side too, do not alter it, keep on, blessed happy thought, keep on in that. "Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still", think of God saying that! The matter is fixed.
Well now, here our parable teaches us that in this instance it is not fixed. The vessel is marred only, but it is still clay, it is plastic. It is still such as the potter can use for his design, to make it according to his design. It is not hardened like the flagon in the
{142}
next chapter that can be broken; it is marred as clay, it is still usable for the purpose of the potter. Peter was still usable, although he failed. He was very marred in the palace of the high priest, but he came round in the making. He was made just what the Potter intended him to be; he submits, he stretched forth his hands. "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire", @John 21: 18. He is carried to martyrdom, which he so wished -- to be like his Master; he is taken on by Christ as He intended him to be. The Lord had said, I will make you something, and he was finally made in the hands of the Potter what the Potter intended him to be. Now, dear brethren, the point is, let us surrender our naughty wills, let us be in the hands of the Potter in every matter. He will make us according to His own designs, a most happy and precious thought; the Lord will carry out His will as we remain clay. The clay is still usable, not a hardened will, but usable for the Potter for what He has in His mind.
Well now, we will go on to Ezekiel. It is another scene. Here the operator is the prophet; in Jeremiah the Operator is God. Now the operator is in the main the prophet, and he is directed into the scene as we are told, "The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of a valley; and it was full of bones". It is full, it is a big matter, a very big matter, and the Lord would encourage us to go in for big matters. Men love to be big, and there is no city more marked by that than this very city of Detroit, by big affairs and men big by their affairs. It is the affairs that make them big, not what they are morally; it is their affairs, their circumstances. So this is a big affair, the valley is full of the bones and the word of the prophet is, "And he caused me to pass by them
{143}
round about; and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold they were very dry" (verse 2). That is, this operator is capable of passing judgment on the material, as indeed every operator should be that God would take on. He takes us on as those who are intelligent in what we are doing, and He would have us to understand the material we are dealing with. It is not clay now, this is another matter; it is bones, and the operator moves round about them. There are a lot of them, it is a big affair, and they are very dry, meaning that this operation is going to be very difficult.
What can be done with a valley full of very dry bones? But bones are marks of identification. "bone to its bone", they allude to the framework of the individual. That is, identification comes into view as bone comes to bone. We say of one and another, He is a tall man, he is a stout man, he is a man of big frame. As soon as bone begins to come to bone we find the identity of the man by his size and framework; this is what God intended him to be. These bones refer to past history. They were not always mere bones, they refer to past history. What is to be done with this great matter? I believe, dear brethren, that the great thought of prophecy is the secret of facing a big matter of this kind.
Prophecy is, I think, the first gift mentioned in Scripture -- I mean gift in the sense of ability to serve. It is exercised by Enoch, and Abraham is formally called a prophet. It is a very old instrumentality for service and is efficient in great matters. I would cite to you how prophecy is connected with great matters in Scripture. In Abraham's case he is brought to the attention of the reigning monarch of the time as a prophet. Who can gauge the power of the prophet? Hear him speak! Another man, Elijah, says to the reigning king, "There shall not be dew nor rain these years, except by my word", @1 Kings 17: 1.
{144}
You see how the thought is linked up with great things.
And so here this is a very great matter. It is the whole house of Israel from that point of view -- I mean in regard to the earthly side of God's operations. It is the greatest matter in relation to God's operations on the earth. The assembly is the greatest matter in regard to His heavenly operations; there is no greater matter than the assembly. We are having to do this very night with the greatest of matters, namely, the assembly of God, and it is being built up, the members made to live from their graves morally. This is not a question of the literal grave; it is persons who are morally dead. But I would repeat for the encouragement and stimulation of everyone here that we are occupied with the greatest of matters. It is a big affair; there is nothing bigger than what we are engaged with, though it may seem very little outwardly; still we are occupied with the greatest work, the assembly of God. All gift and every bit of service has that in mind, it is for "the edifying of the body of Christ", @Ephesians 4: 12. Is it not worth while coming into it? May I not appeal to everyone here to come into it actively? It is a great work. God will be with everyone who addicts himself to it.
"And he said unto me, Son of man, Shall these bones live? And I said, Lord Jehovah, thou knowest". The prophet could discern "there were very many", but he does not undertake to say that they can live. I sympathise with him, for I know how difficult the material is that we have to deal with. One knows in one's self what pains, what trouble, what expense one has been to the Lord, and so it is with every one of us. How hard we are at the outset, how dry, how difficult to affect, to form in the things of God! It is better not to leave these things, but to face them. These are most difficult times; still the work is the same great work. The prophet here says,
{145}
I do not know. The Lord does know. There are many who use that word too often, they say, The Lord knows. Of course He knows, but others know too. Do not say, The Lord only knows; do not say that. How do you know others do not know? There are plenty of brothers and sisters who know far more than you think. They know what has led up to this; they know what has happened; it is well known. Do not forget it, do not deceive yourself. What is spoken in your closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetop. You think it is all secret, but it is known. The prophet however says, "Lord Jehovah, thou knowest". Then the word comes to him again, "And he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah" (verse 4).
Now let me say to any young brother saying a word in the ministry meeting. Bear in mind, the Lord will give you His mind if you want it. Do not flatter the brethren in your address. Notice the word here that he is to use, "Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah". A true prophet will tell you just what you are and it is the very best service he can render, "Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah". Oh, you say, so and so might say, You are hard on the brethren, we will not invite you again; you are too severe on us. That happens; people do not like to be told the truth! It is Ezekiel who discovers that they are dry and Jehovah says, Say *that*, say what you see; just tell them. The word is "Hear the word of Jehovah"; oh, do not turn a deaf ear in any difficulty that exists, do not turn a deaf ear to the word of the Lord! "Hear!", it is your only hope. That word divides asunder between soul and spirit, joints and marrow, a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight. The word of God is like that, and verse 5 says, "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto
{146}
these bones, Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. And I will put sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah". What encouragement there is! You are the very ones, you know, not somebody else. Look at the recurrence of the words 'you' and 'ye'! You are the ones, wherever the word is ministered; it is the present people that are in mind always.
There are great promises here. You are going to come together in all your pristine beauty. It is a question of life, of the identity of the person, whatever he has been before. The bones are his identity. God is going to clothe him now according to His own thought. Let Him do it! It is all for you, do not put it from you. Well, it says in verse 7, "And I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a rustling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone". Now God's work is beginning; the prophet has done his part and God is beginning to work. And so there was a noise and a shaking and the bones came together. "And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them" (verse 8). The sinews and flesh and skin are all there now, but the identity is in the bones. God is going to beautify you as you have never been before; so it goes on to say, "And he said unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live".
The word 'breath' is used. The 'wind' is the great general thought, but 'breath' is really a personal thought and would connect with the New Testament. They were made to live by the breath of God. Why should we hold back? Why should we not place ourselves
{147}
through the prophetic word in the presence of God? There is a noise, a rustling of bone coming to bone, then sinews come up, flesh comes up and skin comes up. It is all now referring to the thought of beautification. And then breath comes in so that everyone stands on his feet; it is not a small matter, it is a great army; we come into a great matter, though outwardly small. So it goes on to say, "And I prophesied as he had commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. And he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off! Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and bring you into the land of Israel" (verses 10 - 12). Think of those words 'you', 'ye' and 'your'. God says, I will take you out of these limited circumstances. It is that in actual realisation but I will take you out of that. Do let Me do it! I will take you out of your graves, for I have been opening your graves. He recognises them now; He says, "O my people", and says "I will ... bring you into the land of Israel". Do not stay out of this, it is yours! God is ready to take you out of all these gloomy circumstances into which your own unfaithfulness and your will have led you, and to set you up in your own land, the land of Israel, a very precious thought. It is a great matter, as I said before, but still every one of us is to be brought into it. God wants every single saint of His in all this. The significance of the stressing at the present time of the prophetic word is to this very end, that the sons of God, every one, should be brought into all this and into the full thought of His purpose, beautified with all new sinews, new flesh, new skin and new life by the very
{148}
breath of God Himself; so that we stand up with an exceeding great army and have part in the land of Israel. "And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land, and ye shall know that I Jehovah have spoken, and have done it, saith Jehovah".
Dear brethren, I suppose what I have said is clear. There is a word in it. It is the attitude of God in the prophetic word at the present time, so that His people should be in the enjoyment of their greatest blessings.
{149}
THE ANOINTING (1)
@Luke 4: 16 - 22; @Acts 10: 34 - 38; @Exodus 30: 22 - 33
J.T. I was thinking of the anointing; we get it first seen in the Lord Jesus. In this series of meetings I want to refer first to the Lord, and then to the way a believer comes in as having part in it; then to how the assembly comes into it in a collective sense, and then to the priesthood in which the saints come into it as priests and as prophets. It is thought that the consideration of this great subject will help us in view of current conditions. I have in mind how they affect the saints individually and in our local settings, our care meetings, the meetings for the service of God, meetings for discipline, in fact all meetings. The idea is that it implies dignity in a moral sense in us and ability to take in divine things and speak of them one to another, and, especially, ability in those who serve, specifically essential gift. It is thought that we should consider it first as seen in Christ, as setting out the full thought, and so Luke has been selected. Both books selected in the New Testament were written by Luke, and he has in mind order and dignity, ornamentation in christianity, especially in the specific services. Hence this incident in Nazareth is selected because it is a local position where the Lord was brought up, where He is seen in His service as representing all these things, beautification in the service. He is seen in a personal sense as serving, but He is also seen in a personal sense as known in the place. Therefore we shall not lose power in the locality where we reside if the anointing has its place with us.
It is significant that the Lord began, according to Luke, in the synagogue at Nazareth. In this gospel He bases his service on a scripture from the Old Testament, linking on at once the ministry in the Old Testament with the New, so that both Old and
{150}
New Testaments are bound together in His ministry as having equal authority. The Lord's own personal attractiveness is seen in this passage; it is said they wondered when He sat down: "The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him"; and then He said, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. And all bore witness to him, and wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth". In Acts in Peter's account of Him it says that He was anointed by God and went about doing good, and it adds that the anointing was "with the Holy Spirit and with power". So we have this specific instance of the anointing with power. Anointing carries the idea of power with it, and then God follows up what He does in selecting a vessel by being with Him in His services.
Ques. Would the incident of the baptism of the Lord in @Luke 3 give us an indication of what kind of experience preceded this? The fact there of the Father speaking after the Lord comes out of the water, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", expresses the feelings of the Father, so that when He goes to the synagogue in Nazareth He is in dignity and power in the sense of it.
J.T. That is very good, entering into our inquiry. It is what precedes the anointing, what is historical; and then the Person anointed comes into view. There is always a moral ground for what God does and what may be added is that in the beginning of chapter 4 He was led by the Spirit: "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness". That is not simply that He was led *into* it, but led *in* it, laying the basis as an example for us, "for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God", @Romans 8: 14.
One of the main features of the anointing is that God can identify Himself with it. Jesus by Himself represented God, as it says, "God has been manifested
{151}
in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit" (@1 Timothy 3: 16), so that everything He did was approved by the Spirit. But then further Peter says, "God was with him", that is, He joins the vessel He selects, the vessel is dignified enough for that. That, I think, is of prime importance, so that there is the representation of God here and He can join the Person who has been anointed. And so in the book of Job we have Job representative of God in the first two chapters, and then Job really failing God, for he dropped to the level of his three friends in arguments. Then Elihu comes in; he justifies God in everything and God comes in after him and identifies Himself with him, which brings about the end of the work in hand, and Job is delivered.
A.N.W. Why does Isaiah say, "The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah hath anointed me"? Is the anointing seen in @Luke 4?
J.T. Yes, that is what he is alluding to. It says, "And the book of the prophet Esaias was given to him; and having unrolled the book he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings". That is, he associates the Spirit of God coming upon Him with the glad tidings. The Spirit is the anointing really.
Rem. The Spirit comes down in chapter 3. The Spirit descending and abiding is an inward sort of thing.
J.T. Yes, and the Lord bases what He is doing in chapter 4 on an Old Testament scripture; it is not what He is saying Himself authoritatively, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me". Anointing and the Spirit of the Lord upon Him would synchronise.
A.N.W. "The Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him; and a voice came out of heaven, *Thou* art my beloved Son", @Luke 3: 22.
{152}
J.T. The dove character would mean that He was sensitive; the sense of complacency in the Person would mean that the anointing synchronised with the Spirit's presence. It is a matter between heaven and earth, between Father and Son, in the third chapter, but it comes out here where the service is more in mind in a way that affects us. We have the earnest of the inheritance, God is upon us, He has sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. The sealing indicates divine ownership.
J.W.D. (Remark about the anointing of Old Testament kings.)
J.T. Just so, we should see how kings are anointed. The whole position seems to be set out in the Lord, that is to say, in what was true of Himself. He says, "If *I* by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you", @Matthew 12: 28. The approval of God had come upon Him because He was operating by this inward power, though in Luke it is evident in outward power and the beautification of the service.
J.B. (Remark as to our learning to take character from the Lord.)
J.T. That is what we get into in time. We follow this example, the perfection of it, of the Lord in His own time. And note how He links with it the Old Testament; so that the Old Testament should never be dissociated from the New Testament as being of less value.
This is the best example that can be given of how order marked the Lord. Take yourself as a minister of the gospel or of the truth, and then look at the Lord here. It is said, "He entered, according to his custom, into the synagogue on the sabbath day". He would not be a stranger, because it was the town in which He was brought up. He had been serving already but now He is serving in His own town,
{153}
suggesting what we are to be in our respective places of residence. "He entered ... into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read". It would be quite enough if we were just told what scripture He read, but it says, "He ... stood up to read", and it is for a purpose. His movements and the fact that He stood up are taken account of. If we extend that to the meetings, it bears on how we sit there; it would not be with our legs crossed as though we were in a railroad station; we should recognise that we are in a holy place and the Spirit's presence should be seen and felt. "The book of the prophet Esaias was given to him". It belonged to the synagogue; it was the local meeting room, we might say, and the Bible was there, the Holy Scriptures, and the Lord was treated with respect by those who were there. "And the book of the prophet Esaias was given to him; and having unrolled the book he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor". He was not there simply on His own account but, as before pointed out, as One who could do this in the representation of God. So the very selection of Scripture is in keeping with this matter of how we serve. It is of great importance that the Spirit enables us to find what is suitable and gives power in every movement. It would have been much more difficult to find a scripture then than now. We must be in power in these details because the congregation will lose interest if we lose power.
In spite of the underlying opposition the Lord was not affected by it. All the eyes were fixed on Him. But to go on, it says, "He has anointed me", and then He says what the anointing is for, "to preach glad tidings". He would be a preacher, an evangelist, a prophet, whatever God had in mind. And then it goes on to say what He is to do, "to preach to captives deliverance, and to the blind
{154}
sight, to send forth the crushed delivered, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord". Then it says He rolled up the book; that is another part of the service, and "when he had delivered it up to the attendant, he sat down". What would that teach us? The Spirit of God tells us all about it in a perfect Model, it shows that all movements should be controlled by spiritual power. And then it says, "And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him". He had the great advantage of being in such power in His ministry as to overcome the opposition which was there against Him. We have the whole thing put before us, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears". It applies to this very place and this very day; that is the way Scripture should be looked at.
L.E.S. (Remark as to Peter's preaching in @Acts 10.)
J.T. That is the apostle, and they were attentive to him. You cannot think of them being anything else. But think of Peter starting out to preach and the local brethren not knowing about it! The local position should be attended to. Some complain because others go off to preach and they do not know anything about it. We must be attendants on the Word; if I go off and the brethren in New York do not know, I am neglecting the position there. Going out to preach is somewhat attractive; but day in and day out looking after the brethren is eldership, and that is what we need. We have both things to think of; we may accept an invitation to preach but then there is the local position to be attended to as well, and that is very often neglected.
Remark as to "attendants on the Word".
J.T. The attendant here handed Him the Bible, but in @Luke 1 the writer speaks of "those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word".
Remark as to @2 Corinthians 6, "fellow-workmen".
{155}
J.T. Paul is making much there of what the apostles were, because they were being neglected.
U.O.G. (Question as to inviting brothers to preach.)
J.T. In your locality do you invite brothers to preach because they are brothers, or because they have a gift? As it has been remarked, in chapter 3 "the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him", pointing to personality, and then "a voice came out of heaven, *Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight". That stresses the Lord's personality; you look at Him as well as hearing what He says. The spirit of the bride in Canticles would fit in here; how she would admire Him!
Ques. (Further question as to inviting preachers.)
J.T. Oh, yes, I think the idea of invitation is good: "Pass over into Macedonia and help us", @Acts 16: 9. But I am sure it is not right to put the service of preaching on one who does not have the ability. The ministry should be in dignity.
A.N.W. The hearers are thus attracted.
J.T. If they turn against the Lord afterward they are doubly responsible because they have seen Him in His attractiveness suggested by the servant.
Remark as to standing up and sitting down in serving.
J.T. Sitting down suggests that you are reposeful and deliberative, you are settled to go through with a matter; but a discourse is usually given standing up.
Rem. You were speaking of those who preach, but the angel could say to Mary, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of the Highest overshadow thee", @Luke 1: 35. Is what you are saying more from the masculine side?
J.T. Yes, because we are dealing with specific gift, "according to the measure of the gift of the Christ". Correspondingly in @2 Corinthians 1 it is
{156}
said that "he that ... has anointed us, is God", but the "us" there would include all christians; we are all sealed and given the Spirit as the earnest. Yet even if we confine ourselves to gift the idea of prophecy is connected with sisters as well as brothers in the Scriptures; their service would be connected with a personal word but yet they have power to serve in a gifted way. We have for example Mary, the Lord's mother, speaking in a most beautiful way, a prophetic way; then there are Hannah and others, and the daughters of Philip were prophetesses. So we have to be careful in looking into a subject like this that the sisters are not shut out. God has anointed us and they are in it from the standpoint of spontaneous ministers, so it reaches every one of us.
L.E.S. (Remark as to the message given to Mary of Magdala in @John 20.)
J.T. She does not announce what she carried to the brethren as merely something she had taken note of; but she had seen the Lord and He had spoken these things to her and she put it in the most informal and simple way, not in the words He used but to convey His mind.
J.W.D. So I am to fill out my part in the grace of the anointing in whatever service I am called upon to do.
J.T. I think we shall see that more fully as we come to @Exodus 40 where we get the subdivisions all working together in the power of the anointing. Now the second scripture helps as to the positive position. It was a very formal occasion, one of the most remarkable we can get. God had wrought in the congregation and they had sent for Peter; the Holy Spirit had had to do with it because He said to Peter, "*I* have sent them". Now the Spirit of God is telling us what Peter said to these people. It is a scene where there is no murderous scheme in the congregation as there was in Nazareth; those in that
{157}
synagogue may not have been conscious of it, but the truth brought it out. There is nothing underlying here; they were listening intently to the word while it was being delivered, therefore Peter would have much liberty in the place. So it says, "Peter opening his mouth said ...". Why does the Spirit of God say he opened his mouth? Is there something in the way he did it? He says, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him". This is something he probably never said before. You could never get another congregation like this in Scripture, with the spirit that was there, "The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (*he* is Lord of all things, ) *ye* know"; he was dealing with what was universal -- Lord of all things; "the testimony which has spread through the whole of Judaea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached". He was giving them credit for knowing something, so we appeal to what persons do know. And then he says, "Jesus who was of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went through all quarters doing good". He was not raising storms and stirring up troubles but He went about through all quarters doing good; that is universal.
Remark as to Peter opening his mouth.
J.T. And the Lord's mouth was opened too; gracious words came out of His mouth. It is wonderful how that organ has so much place in Scripture.
L.E.S. (Remark as to Moses mouth in @Exodus 4.)
J.T. That is an excellent allusion. It should be connected with the Lord's own deep feelings in @Mark 7 where he found a man that was deaf and could not speak right. Aaron could speak well and God had dealings with Moses as to that matter because of the state of his mouth, the state of the organ. It is an
{158}
important consideration because a converted person who is taken up today is one whose mouth has been full of wickedness, the poison of asps under his lips. We need to know how to speak properly.
L.E.S. (Remark as to what a change God made in Peter's mouth.)
J.T. I am sure He did. Think of Peter, how quickly he returned to his own natural way and cursed and swore! He had been with the Lord but he did not yet have the Holy Spirit, but now he has been anointed.
Ques. What do you think of the attitude of Peter in approaching this company? It is a company that God could look upon as qualified, that He could anoint collectively.
J.T. Peter is reserved in his view of this great matter, the entering in of the gentiles, but God is saying, *I* have something to say about it. Then Peter would be satisfied. Why should he say anything? God is doing it! @Acts 10 has to do with the sovereignty of God; God is speaking of the creatures in the sheet according to what they are going to be, not what they are. We could say, What I used to be is one thing, but what I am now is another. Paul could say, "But by God's grace I am what I am", @1 Corinthians 15: 10. You would be afraid to go near the creatures in the sheet, but it is what they are going to be.
J.B. (Question as to foreknowledge.)
J.T. With each one He has foreknown, I am sure He has foreknown him not as wicked, but as to what he is going to be. He selects according to what is going to be because He is going to make them according to His counsels.
A.N.W. God is able to see underneath the surface.
J.T. Peter does that same thing in effect in @Acts 3. The lame man at the gate of the temple called Beautiful wanted to be healed, and Peter discerned
{159}
it. Perhaps we have not the discernment to know who wants to be healed. It is a matter of getting God's mind. What does He foreknow? He sees someone walking daily, and the gospel has in mind that in due course that person will be a believer because he is foreknown. I think it is well to take in the idea of what is foreknown; it is what pleases God and what is made real through the gospel: "Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated", that is sovereign. Those He has predestinated will be called, and whom God has called He justifies, and whom He justifies He glorifies.
Rem. So Peter said, "I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him".
J.T. Quite; He is no respecter of persons; if any one love God the same is known of Him. He salutes you if you love Him; you are an attractive person if you love Him. God knows everybody, but we must read it contextually that He knows you because you love Him. The fact of God foreknowing you is sovereign, it is in view of what He can see in the distance, what you finally appear to be. He is going to predestinate you, call you, justify you, and glorify you.
Rem. God does not think in terms of time.
J.T. He can look on in time as in eternity; He looks down and sees time and sees us acceptable to Him in time, and then all these other things are stated of us.
L.E.S. "If there be a revelation ... let the first be silent". I was thinking of Peter being silent and making way for the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Quite so, he was thoroughly with God in what he was doing: "While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word". And then he says, "Can
{160}
any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as *we* also did?" This is a good lesson for us in endeavouring to preach the gospel. It is not the length of the address that counts but meeting the current condition. The whole congregation was clearly saved. It was a very short address but a perfect address for the moment, and the Lord says as it were, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears".
A.N.W. (Remark as to Peter saying just enough.)
J.T. Yes, enough to make them fit for the Holy Spirit. The point is that they are to be brought in. God has prior right in all His services and Peter said enough. Paul said to the Ephesians, "In whom *ye* also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise", @Ephesians 1: 13. Luke, who recounts this for us, was a vessel the Lord brought in in sovereignty and grace. What he was writing he had heard from others and he did his work well.
We shall have to leave what was in mind about Exodus, in regard to the anointing in the types. It is the Spirit of God giving an account of the anointing so that we might have in our souls a clear idea of it; God uses it in this setting directly for Himself. He is inscrutable, so we have everything to learn about the three divine Persons, and the types would help us.
Remark as to the anointing making persons suitable to convey God's mind.
J.T. Yes, that is the idea of it, that one is made fit to speak. That means that he is not simply a man going to the seminary to learn to be a preacher; when God takes up a man he must submit. Paul, in @Acts 9, says, "Lord", to the blessed Person he had never seen! He says, "What shall I do, Lord?" @Acts 22: 10.
{161}
The natural will is not to come in or it will spoil all.
Remark as to the book of Job.
J.T. God says to Elihu, You must speak. Elihu says, I am ready to burst! Think of Elihu sitting down with those four men! It does not say he said a word while they were talking, but he was being filled up ready to speak out when God prompted him. And when he does begin every word is pure gold.
{162}
THE ANOINTING (2)
@Psalm 105: 12 - 15; @Genesis 28: 10 - 22; @Genesis 35: 9 - 18
J.T. The passage read this morning in @Exodus 30 is to be borne in mind, in which it is said that Moses was to take the best spices: "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, And thou, take best spices -- of liquid myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon the half -- two hundred and fifty, and of sweet myrtle two hundred and fifty, and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin; and make of it an oil of holy ointment, a perfume of perfumery after the work of the perfumer, it shall be the holy anointing oil". It is to be remarked that as the manna alludes to Christ personally, so the anointing oil alludes to the Spirit. We have an account of both; the manna is in chapter 16, the word meaning, 'What is it?' It is a question that we should have answered in our souls, what the manna means. So now we have the anointing oil. The question mark is not so pronounced here, but we have the component parts of the anointing oil which are to be considered in a typical sense. We should be reverential as alluding to the anointing, because the Spirit as a divine Person is operating in such a remarkable and holy way; and first we see Him in connection with Christ as we had this morning. We shall see the matter now in relation to individual believers, how it worked out in Jacob and his becoming sensible of the house of God. Then we shall see it in the views of the tabernacle and the priesthood and the prophets. It is of the utmost importance that we should speak reverentially, for it involves nothing less than a divine Person, God as seen in this way, One who was used to garnish the heaven. See the beautification there! And then in Genesis He hovered over the face of the waters. Therefore the
{163}
Spirit should always be apprehended in our souls as equal with the Father and the Son. The name to which we baptise is the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit; the passage in @Matthew 28 implies that the name includes each Person. We have the Spirit in our souls thus, and regard Him in a worshipful way. Operating in us, He is never less than God, but in relation to the incarnation He has taken a lowly place with Christ, and even more so because He keeps Himself out of view. Still He is the Same, and entitled to that term. In coming so low He does it Himself; it is a question of lowliness, how low He will come. He humbled Himself and He is here in that way and operates as the anointing; that is why we suggested the scripture spoken of this morning and now again brought forward because it informs us typically of what comes out from the Father. What He hears He speaks -- a most remarkable thing! And He does speak here below. It is all to impress us with the importance of reverential feelings. A severe penalty is attached to any imitation of the anointing oil, for it is not to be imitated: "Whoever compoundeth any like it, or whoever putteth any of it upon any strange thing, shall be cut off from his peoples". Any of these 'holy orders' and the like, making a natural effort to put on the Spirit, are highly displeasing to God. If there is to be anything in the way of the anointing it is to be this holy compound.
L.E.S. Do you think Paul in the epistle to the Corinthians has a very similar thought where he says, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" @1 Corinthians 3: 16?
J.T. That is very appropriate -- the three Persons are linked together in that chapter as in @Matthew 28. Our very baptism introduces us into that.
A.N.W. How do we enter into the love of the Spirit?
{164}
J.T. I would say it comes out from Him as the love of God and the love of Christ. I do not know how we could doubt it. We have too the communications of the Spirit that have just been noted, and we have of course in the type in @Numbers 21 the well springing up, alluding to the Holy Spirit; and the children of Israel sang unto it.
J.W.D. Do you think we are to be conscious of the Holy Spirit's personality, not only His control but the infinitude of that divine Person personally among us?
J.T. That is what I wanted to bring out -- the need to make allowance for His own way instead of His being in the background. Christ having come in in humility supports that, and all that is in keeping with it is to be worked out in us, the Spirit becoming in us the Spirit of Christ.
J.W.D. In the end of Revelation it is the Spirit and the bride. Is it right to say that that is the last phase of the Spirit's work personally?
J.T. We had that at recent meetings and it is linked on with what we are saying now; the Spirit speaks to us and witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God. The movement of the Spirit is distinct from our spirits. That passage in @Numbers 21 is especially important because the word is, "Sing unto it". The word 'sing' alludes to alternate singing, persons are answering, but answering in that inquiry-like function. It is like Miriam's response when the women went out after her in @Exodus 15. She answered them: "Sing to Jehovah, for he is highly exalted". It was to the Lord there and not to the Spirit, but it is the same idea, the masculine side and then the feminine, alluding to subjective feeling. And again we have, "Saul hath smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands", @1 Samuel 18: 7; the women answered one another there. Throughout the New Testament too we have instances in the scope
{165}
of song, but the Spirit Himself keeps in the main out of view, and the aim is to work out holiness with us.
G.A.T. Does not Scripture say He will not speak of Himself?
J.T. "From himself" is the word properly there. He does not speak from Himself but He speaks as God; for instance, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", @Acts 13: 2, that is God speaking. Now we might consider in detail these ingredients, the first myrrh, then cinnamon the half (the word 'half' is introduced), then sweet myrtle and cassia, and finally the olive oil, bringing in the thought of oil -- "make of it an oil of holy ointment". The first word would be the key word, 'myrrh', and all the rest come in their places making a single compound. In order to get the gain of the Spirit in Exodus the rock had to be smitten, linking with the suffering suggested in myrrh.
Rem. Regarding the anointing oil, would you touch on the numbers two hundred and fifty and five hundred? How would they enter into the service of God?
J.T. It is not easy to say much beyond the fact that the compound would yield results. The measurements suggest things to the mind in their proportions, and are to be worked out in the Spirit, so that we have the Spirit of Christ. All that is anointed must be in relation to that.
N.B. Do you see any connection between these ingredients and the king's garments in @Psalm 45, "Myrrh and aloes, cassia, are all thy garments"?
J.T. These are things to be worked out, and I think they are worked out in Christ first. The leading thought in all God's operations was the incarnation. We have the types and certain thoughts in the Old Testament but the real truth was in relation to the incarnation, so that we have it permanently established in the universe.
{166}
Rem. God presents the best to us in Christ.
J.T. Yes, the very best, Christ is the very best. These are just types and they awaited the incarnation to come fully into man's view. God dwells in thick darkness but it awaited the incarnation to permanently effect in man down here what God looked for.
Ques. So they are anointed to God. Is that the thought?
J.T. Each ingredient has to be worked out, and the Scriptures afford means of investigation; the Spirit searcheth all things, but He does it for us, and the field of investigation is Himself. We get something all the time we are investigating.
L.E.S. So that Paul presented himself to the Corinthians as "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body; for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh", @2 Corinthians 4: 10, 11. Would that correspond?
J.T. That is seen in a living way in the believer, which means permanent establishment. The thing is permanently established, as he says to the Corinthians earlier, "He that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit". We see in our minds that everything is objectively established in Christ as the Yea and Amen, but the subjective thought is in us.
J.W.D. Are you thinking of the myrrh as the subjective thought in us?
J.T. I am thinking of the initiation or key word, mentioned first. The last word is 'cassia', the same measure as the myrrh, but inasmuch as it is the last mentioned and not the first, I think the first mentioned is the key idea. The apostle speaks of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow.
{167}
Rem. It says the measurements are "after the shekel of the sanctuary".
J.T. They are weighed out according to the measure of the sanctuary, because we are dealing with the anointing from God's side. He is prescribing what should be used. God brings it into Exodus because Exodus sets out divine requirements in matters. In Genesis persons were not given regulations, hence the oil that Jacob used could not be "holy ointment" for it was his own composition. Oil was used too for anointing Saul and David, but God says, I must have *this*. He is still maintaining His own standard, and what should mark us is this oil, that is, the sufferings of Christ, the Spirit of Christ, the "supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" as it says.
Rem. How does the ointment used by the woman in the gospels fit in with this?
J.T. That is another thing, it leads us on to further thoughts now, to what is called "the incense", that is the second prescription, from verse 34 to the end of the chapter. It is what is before God in fragrance, whereas the other is what He would have from His priests.
A.N.W. The ointment of the woman in @Luke 7 was myrrh. That was designed, was it not?
J.T. Quite so, it would be part of this, and certainly she had what would be accepted. What Mary had was pure nard and it is said to be very valuable. There are things presented thus from our side, but God has a standard seen antitypically in the Spirit coming on Christ incarnate and resting on Him, bringing out the personality of Christ; and this same oil is to anoint the tabernacle. Our business is to keep to that standard and not to suggest any less than that standard in representing God here.
Rem. "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured".
J.T. That is it here; we are not to imitate it or put it on our persons.
{168}
J.W.D. Do we not come to these measurements that you suggest by taking on the matter soberly?
J.T. Hebrews speaks of persons who "insulted the Spirit of grace", which is apostasy; so we must be on our guard as to the attitude of our souls on these occasions.
Ques. What do you say in regard to the word, 'unction' in 1 John?
J.T. It is the same thought. How does it read?
Rem. "And *ye* have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things", @1 John 2: 20.
J.T. Unction is the thought, but it is something derived from another. It says later on that "the unction which ye have received ... teaches you as to all things". We surely do not trust to the clerical systems or colleges that bring in some other way of setting up religious systems. The extreme thought of this is seen when anyone says anything against the Holy Spirit; so the word is, "Touch not mine anointed".
Rem. To whom does this reference in the psalm apply?
J.T. There is no reference, no scriptural record, of the actual anointing, but the allusion would be to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The word is "mine anointed ones", so evidently God held them in that way as proof against any other demands. And so with both Abraham and Isaac, they stood aloof from any alliances. Abimelech came to Abraham; he was a military man and sought to make a great show before Abraham who was a man of God; he was conscious of his power because he had established royalty attached to him, and he brought his captain with him to make a military show, but Abraham was not drawn into it, nor was Isaac. When Abimelech came to Isaac he brought his friend as well as the captain but Isaac overcame that too. To such God says, "Touch not mine anointed", whether you are
{169}
friendly or hostile, "and do my prophets no harm". That shows how the idea applied before Exodus; God established the idea of His own in Genesis, that they were His anointed.
Ques. Would all you are saying now apply to the testimony at the present time in regard to the military display and so on?
J.T. That is what the young brothers should lay hold of, what God is doing and saying. He would say, You are the ones I am watching. It is a question of your spiritual manner; is it the real anointing you are displaying before these men? You are by yourself but God says, You are one of My anointed ones. God is very fair to Abimelech, saying, I know you do not intend to do wrong and I kept you from doing wrong. God knows what is in the minds of the authorities; if a man in authority has respect for God, God has great respect for him. This is a matter that needs great attention, and all of us need to keep in mind that the anointing had to do with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Jacob was the last one and when he has recourse to the anointing he brings in the drink offering, an intoxicating thing; he would stimulate and please God and then he poured oil on that and called the place Beth-el. The very fact that I am to represent God here means that there is going to be a house. In Genesis it is abstract, but God is taking account of those who please Him. He has come down now, it is true, but Jacob got the sense that God was pleased to be with him.
J.B. Would Hannah be in line with what we are having here when she says, "He will ... exalt the horn of his anointed", @1 Samuel 2: 10?
J.T. Just so, she had the idea; that word 'the horn', belongs to Samuel. That is part of the prayer of Hannah, but there is not a word of prayer in it. The priest is to walk before the anointed, it is royalty that she has in mind.
{170}
Rem. She brings a priestly offering to the house of God.
J.T. Yes, it is in keeping with her loaning her son to the house of God. She belonged to the house of God herself; she was a real priest, and in her words you do not get prayer, it is praise. One would like to help the brethren now to see how we come into this, and so we see in @Genesis 28 that Jacob has a sense that this is none other than the house of God. He does not think much of it, he says it is a dreadful place. How much does each one here think of it?
G.A.T. Jacob says another strange thing, that God was there but he did not know it. Would that mean that I might be with the brethren and God be there and I not be in the good of it?
J.T. Just so, but you remember God was on the ladder above. In the first passage God brought him a ladder from above and He was on the other end; the angels were the link between Jacob and God. When he comes back to the same spot many years later it is a real house of God, because the presence of God makes it His house.
G.A.T. Has the pouring on of the oil anything to do with taking away the hardness from the stone?
J.T. I think it rather suggests the discipline that Jacob went through. You remember that he was fleeing from his brother who was intending to murder him, and he had a long way to go. The sun was set and this is all he had for a pillow. There was no one to exercise hospitality, but God did: He exercised hospitality in a position of danger. That was all foundation-making time.
Rem. This place Haran in Scripture suggests a halfway stopping place, and Jacob's ideas are hazy here. Halfway stopping places are always rather hazy.
J.T. Just so, and behind that he has left a dark situation. Think of the terribleness of feeling you have a brother that hates you! Think of having
{171}
such a one in the assembly! It says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha", @1 Corinthians 16: 22. God says, I hate Esau; I love that man Jacob but I hate Esau. Jacob was fleeing from his presence. He did not start from Esau's place but from Beer-sheba, but there was the dark thought of the hating brother behind him. We can well understand the exercise he was going through, the sun was going down and there was only a stone for a pillow; but then heaven interfered and he began getting some light. God is going to exhibit the wonderful thought of entertaining, for it is His house. Where would Jacob get the thought of anointing? It was in the family, I would say to any young man or woman here, the idea of anointing is in your family and you should look out for it. Well, as I was saying, the thought of the anointing was in Jacob's house; his father had contributed it to him, and he was coming into it now. There is mention in @Psalm 105 of "his covenant -- the word which he commanded to a thousand generations -- which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; and he confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, unto Israel for an everlasting covenant". That is an immense thing for young people who have believers for parents. It is not simply that I am connected with what my father has been; God says to Jacob, "Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance". God will say to every believer, if he wants to come into the things that are there, I am dealing with you directly, and what others have you may have. It says Abraham dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, but it was God's estate and Jacob was heir to it. We are heirs of God and joint heirs of Christ. We are talking about persons like Abraham and Isaac, and now Jacob is coming into these things. Abraham is not here nor is Isaac, but Jacob is here and God says, I want *you*. You do not get
{172}
mention of God's house in Abraham's or Isaac's history but you get it in Jacob's.
L.E.S. @Isaiah 59: 21 is a very interesting scripture, "And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever".
J.T. Quite so, I think this is very important from a gospel point of view, that young persons in a christian household may see things and perhaps not be despising them, but still they may not be using them. How did my father get converted, my mother and brothers? But Jacob is sent away by himself. He has not renounced his relations with his father and mother, but he is by himself in this position with a stone as a pillow, and God has to say to him directly. God would say, Your parents are not here, this is between Me and you and I am going to give you what they have but not from them; it is not an inheritance from them but an inheritance from God.
G.A.T. Would you say He calls Samuel directly as a child?
J.T. It is Jehovah and Samuel. This is a principle to make clear to all young people. You are getting what your father has got but you are not in the enjoyment of it until you get it from God, not from them.
Rem. So He would say to the young people as He says here, "I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham, thy father". He would bring that same thought today to the young in our households.
J.T. God is discriminative all the way through and brings each one before Him. He says, Why don't *you* get this? From heaven above, the ladder reaches down to Jacob; God is not standing by Jacob here, but He is in chapter 35.
{173}
G.A.T. Would God hold the young people accountable if they do not pay attention to what is said?
J.T. God takes account of every word that comes from them and He takes account of the path that their parents are enjoying.
M.O. Does chapter 35 suggest the gain that is derived from being brought to an understanding of the anointing as having dealings with God?
J.T. We have to examine the history of Jacob from this point onward to see what comes in before chapter 35; he was conscious in that chapter of being more to God than he had been before. God did not come down to him here in chapter 28, but retained His place at the top of the ladder. We have to examine the history to see what intervenes before chapter 35. God had said to him to return to the land of his fathers, not simply to the house, though that is a beautiful idea, but to the land.
U.O.G. Would you say that this bargain he made with God would mean he was now confessing that the blessing must come from God Himself?
J.T. One thing hangs on another. He says, "If God will be with me, and keep me on this road that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and a garment to put on, and I come again to my father's house in peace -- then shall Jehovah be my God"; that is the bargain. It is a hypothetical thought when he says, "This is none other but the house of God" in verse 17, for he also calls it a dreadful place; he is not at home there. But he rose early in the morning and took the stone and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. When he said it was a dreadful place he had been in a different state. Where would he have got the oil? Why would he bring it with him? In a christian household he had something that would enable him to answer to the light that he had gotten in his father's house. He had
{174}
changed his mind clearly about the place and called the name of it Beth-el; he was like Adam, he had to call the place by a name. And then it says, "Jacob vowed a vow". It is a great thing when a young person vows a vow. Jacob feels he can make a vow to his advantage, and he says, "This stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house". It shows how the believer comes into the anointing. The anointing was there already, but now Jacob gets the idea and he is to come into it; the idea is really becoming a living stone.
G.A.T. And this being the case he is now going to have power.
J.T. That is what we get in chapter 35. The intervening history covers about thirty years. There was very little spirituality in his wives; Rachel had some but there was very little there. God can work out His thoughts in the most difficult circumstances. He says, They are not overwhelming, and I am working out something in you. This matter of wages is an important thing among the brethren. Jacob had to deal with a hard sort of man in his father-in-law; it is not always well to seek employment from our relatives and look for help from them. It came into his mind when Joseph was born that he must go back to his family, but his father-in-law knew he was a producer; Laban knew that God was blessing him through Jacob. Jacob says, My wages have been changed ten times, showing that they had a great place in his mind and he remembered it. That is a very important thing just now because some people are working on the Lord's day for extra wages. Wages are very detrimental to us if we make them a major point, so Jacob was detained a considerable time at Padan because of wages when he should have gone back to Isaac.
Rem. What should be done in a case like this? Should we be prepared to suffer?
{175}
J.T. The matter of wages is detrimental if it goes beyond what is normal, beyond what God gives us. Increased wages will not do for God or for us.
Rem. How about a case where wages are in consideration and a brother is working on the Lord's day?
J.T. That is a matter that has to be considered; the point is whether wages are involved. The Lord says, There is one day to which I have two titles; one, that it is the Lord's day, and the other that it is the first day of the week, I am not asking for Monday or Tuesday but for the first day of the week, or the Lord's day; I am taking that one day out of seven for Myself.
G.A.T. It is not exactly what I lose that matters so much, but what the Lord loses from me.
J.T. Yes.
Rem. Would the violation of other divine principles come in here?
J.T. The Lord's day involves rights, and one great saint says, "I was in the Spirit" on that day. If I am ignoring principles, I must consider how long this condition will rule me. We are able to count from the money point of view, but are we able to count from the shekels of the sanctuary?
Ques. Do labour unions enter into this inquiry?
J.T. That is another matter, but connected with it in one sense. There is positive lawlessness connected with the trade union.
Rem. The drink offering would be in keeping with the sacrifice. If wages are not in my mind God would accept the drink offering from me.
J.T. That is the thing, the drink offering is a most interesting matter. What his reasons were for employing it we are not told, but it is intoxicating, it stimulates God. The Lord Jesus was not without that in the way He pleased God; speaking reverently. God could do nothing without Jesus. He lost Him
{176}
for three days and three nights but He was there before anybody else to raise Him. What infinitude in that anointing! And we are in God's counsels; why should we deprive Him of ourselves? God wanted to be near to Jacob; He came down to his side in chapter 35 just to talk to him, and it says, "God went up from him in the place where he had talked with him". The drink offering would be the first suggestion of how he was pleasing to God; God would say, You are pleasing to Me and I can use you.
Rem. God had said to him, "I am the Almighty God".
J.T. It is an outstanding thought, the mighty God of Jacob. Jacob is conscious now that he is seeing God and that it is the house of God; he is coming to the house on these lines, a house pleasing to God. Although there may not be many in fellowship in a locality the thought is that God can be there. He would say, I will make My abode with you, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We must make a sacrifice in view of this. And then the next thing is that God is to have a place in the hearts of the brethren locally; the saints are a witness to God there.
J.W.D. I think that is a very stimulating thought. We think we are poor and weak and feeble, but we are acceptable to God.
J.T. This would encourage us especially where meetings are small numerically.
{177}
THE ANOINTING (3)
@Exodus 40: 1 - 11; @1 Corinthians 12: 1 - 13
J.T. The link between these two scriptures will be apparent to most of us; at least it will be as we proceed in our inquiry. The passage in Corinthians is really the antitype of @Exodus 40. Chapter 12, verse 12, reads, "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ". The allusion there is to Christ as the anointed One; what is mainly in view is Christ in Person. It is not Christ exalted but more the vessel down here, the saints viewed as united to Him. The term 'the Christ' means the anointed one or vessel, and Exodus will help us to see the detail which is in God's mind for us in this way. @Exodus 39 shows that all the parts of the tabernacle passed through Moses hands. It says, "According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, so had the children of Israel done all the labour. And Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as Jehovah had commanded -- so had they done it; and Moses blessed them". It is a corresponding allusion there to Christ as the Mediator, so that as believers we all come under His examination, and we are only passed, as it were, by Him if we conform to the requirements that the book presents to us. It is said that "Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as Jehovah had commanded". Then it is said that Moses blessed them. It is a very auspicious moment, the tabernacle is passed now in all its parts but it is not all set up yet. In chapter 40 it is set up and then anointed. It is thought that what we had yesterday afternoon fits in, for Jacob reached the collective idea; however much or little he understood it, he named the place Beth-el. It was a place where God had come down
{178}
to speak to him, which conveys the idea of the house of God. Beth-el means the house of God, and God being there with Jacob indicates what is meant. It is a place of divine Presence and dwelling and is informal, as we might say. In Genesis God was allowing His work to manifest itself in individuals, particularly in Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The idea of the anointing was in the family according to @Psalm 105, and Jacob coming in, the third from Abraham, entered into the matter of the anointing, first using oil by itself according to chapter 28, and then using the drink offering in chapter 35, oil meaning that God is there and pleased to be there. He had pleasure in Jacob so that the idea of the house is there.
J.W.D. Do you think we need to reach Jacob experimentally so that the drink offering and the oil will be acceptable to God?
J.T. That is the principle running through Genesis. The work of God manifests itself in certain ones and they do things of themselves without prescriptions.
J.W.D. I was thinking of the drink offering. God is everything to us and we ourselves arrive at the truth of God being supreme.
J.T. Quite so. Jacob had the experience in a small way, or indeed fully, because God Himself was there; but the fulness of it is here in chapter 40 in a special way, because God says in Exodus that if He is to have a dwelling it must be according to His own prescription. There was none of that in Jacob's case, it was all from Jacob's side, but God accepted what Jacob did and it felicitously pertained to the house of God. That is to say, Jacob progressed in his apprehension of things to the idea of the house. In the second visit he called it El-Beth-el. The name of the city before was Luz but it is now called Beth-el; however, it is from Jacob's own experience; God is not prescribing things for him, it is what he
{179}
himself does. In many instances in Genesis the work of God is manifest in persons and God accepts it, but when we come to Exodus we have the divine standard and pattern. Everything is according to pattern and standard, and the pattern is shown from above; it is a heavenly matter; so that chapter 40 here is the full result in Exodus. God comes in, we are told in the end of the chapter, and glory fills the house. It is the carrying through of what Jacob reached and God is showing that Jacob was in His line of things. How little he understood when he reached Beth-el and named it! In Exodus the thought is taken up and the divine standard asserted above, not on the level of the earth. Jacob's naming it is on the earth but it is not on that level now, it is on the divine level, so that Moses was called up onto the mountain and was there for forty days and forty nights and received the pattern there. The house of God is really a heavenly thing, but here provisionally.
J.B. Is that why in Matthew's gospel the mountains are spoken of?
J.T. Matthew is really set in relation to mountains; beginning with chapter 5 there are seven of them. As the mountains were round about Jerusalem so are they in Matthew's gospel round about the assembly; it is a heavenly thing come down.
L.E.S. Would you say we have all the basic features of the work of God in Genesis, while in Exodus we have how it should function?
J.T. I think that is right. In the beginning of Genesis we have the creation, as it is called. That is, what had been there before, a chaotic condition, is brought into form, but then that is not final. Chapter 1 is basic and chapter 2 is to bring the fulness of it out, so that the man and the woman are enjoined to multiply and fill the earth and subdue it. Genesis is not complete, there is always a sequence. Chapter 2 is a sequence of chapter 1 and God takes a compound
{180}
name. The added name indicates that God has other thoughts that were not indicated in the first chapter and these thoughts centre in the idea of Jehovah compounded with Elohim; that is to say, God, the Creator, is taking up a covenant relation with men. Exodus is the book of covenant, it is God taking up a fixed relation with men, or with Israel. The work goes on, the effulgence or working out of things, right through the Scriptures until the Lord Jesus appears, and it is said, "For in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell", @Colossians 1: 19. The greatness and fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Jesus, that is the culmination; and now in the assembly we have His fulness, for the assembly is the fulness of Christ.
Ques. When the Exodus system is not functioning in Corinthians, does the apostle in his ministry seek to awaken in them a sense of the Jacob experience or Genesis side of things, to awaken in their souls a sense of where God had spoken to them?
J.T. Quite so, and it is a commandment. The test of everyone's status in the house of God or the assembly is whether he is a prophet or can discern what apostolic ministry is. "Let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14: 37. Genesis is not the place of commandment; commandment is peculiarly in Exodus.
J.W.D. Would you say that the assembly as Christ's fulness is a development?
J.T. Yes. He is the One in whom the divine fulness is. @Colossians 1: 19 says in the original, "In him all the fulness ... was pleased to dwell", without saying what the fulness is; "of the Godhead" is interpolated in chapter 1.
J.W.D. The fulness involves greater expansion; it is a development, is it not?
{181}
J.T. It is what God is morally coming out in Christ. Of course Deity was there in Christ and He is One of the divine Persons, but the fulness is the fulness of the whole without saying what it is. In chapter 2 it says that all the fulness "of the Godhead" was bodily in Him so that it has been brought down to us in Christ, but the first chapter is more general and less specific.
A.N.W. The actual statement as to the assembly is, "The fulness of him who fills all in all", @Ephesians 1: 23.
J.T. That is Ephesians, quite so; Colossians is the personal touch.
A.B. Chapter 2 says, "Ye are complete in him", and does the footnote help? It says, "Or 'filled full', referring to all fulness being in Him. The fulness or completeness of the Godhead is in Christ".
J.T. That helps. So that the first chapter of Colossians is mainly a question of the deity of Christ, the truth of His Person, that He is the Creator of everything and "in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell"; whereas in Ephesians it is that God "gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all". So that the fulness dwelling in Christ, of which Colossians speaks, finds its own fulness -- another thought. It is an extended thought in the assembly, but the assembly is His fulness.
Ques. When you say the fulness of God morally, are you using the word morally as distinct from what God is essentially?
J.T. Yes. What God is morally is what He is in relation to things, but here the word 'God' is not used; it is the fulness personified as it were. What Jesus was as a Man down here was great enough for the fulness to dwell in.
Rem. It is not only the thought of Christ in His Person, His essential Being, though He is God in that too.
{182}
J.T. Oh yes, the three divine Persons are equal, but Scripture refers to the economy into which They have come, that is, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The Father remains in the Deity but in relation to the economy and in relation to creation; and it is in that economy that Christ has the fulness dwelling in Him; in the second chapter it says "all the fulness ... bodily".
Ques. Where would you go for a scripture as to Christ's divinity, His essential Being in its personal aspect?
J.T. I would say @John 1 is the leading scripture for that, giving account of the Word, "In the beginning was the Word" (that is in time and creation too). In the beginning was the Person and there was more there than was understood, but John's gospel was written so that it might be understood. He did not begin to be there. He *was* there; in the beginning He was there. It is implied there that He is Head essentially and it goes on to say, "And the Word was with God, and the Word was God". That brings in the name of God, and that in itself is relative, it designates God as set out in the Father. Paul says, "There is one God, the Father". The Deity is represented by the Father, but John says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God", showing that He had a distinctiveness from the other divine Persons. Then it goes on to say, "The Word was with God, and the Word was God". We are moving upward to bring out the essential deity of Christ, that He had a personal existence as distinct from the other two Persons, and that He was with God, known in that way; and then finally that He "was God". Then we might say, What about the other two Persons? There are not two Gods, only one God, but He was operating as God in one Person. The Others, of course, would be there too, but it was by Him, as it goes on to say,
{183}
"Without him not one thing received being which has received being". It was Christ who made everything.
Ques. Colossians does not go quite that far, does it?
J.T. No. Colossians speaks of Christ as Man; what He is morally is in relation to what He is in manhood, all the fulness is there. In Ephesians it says, "That ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God", suggesting what came out in Christ in a moral sense; so that every attribute of God is there, dealing in creation especially with men.
G.A.T. What you say of @John 1 does not bring before us the designation Son.
J.T. The title Son is not mentioned until you come to verse 14, "And the Word became flesh". It does not say God became flesh, although that might be true because God was manifest in flesh, but "the Word became flesh". He took another condition and in that condition He tabernacled among men, "and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". What beautiful relations were seen there between the Father and Son! Then we go on to verse 18 and it says, "No one has seen God at any time". When we speak of God in that sense it includes the three Persons: "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". This is the great thought of the declaration of the Deity, that is, not in essential being but what They are morally here.
Ques. Would God being all in all fit into the moral thought rather than into the thought of His essential being?
J.T. No one has seen or can see Him in His essential being. God is all in all and God is in us by the Spirit. He is all to us subjectively, but He is in
{184}
us in relation to the Spirit. It does not say 'all *and* all', which would be an external idea, but "all in all", so that the hidden fixity is seen in that.
M.O. @Matthew 11: 27 says, "No one knows the Son but the Father". Is that referring to His essential being?
J.T. That is what is stated there; "nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him". The Son is never said to be revealed and that ought to subdue us as to these matters. We are dealing with inscrutability when we speak of divine Persons in that sense.
Rem. Those who have stumbled in relation to sonship have not looked carefully at @John 1. The Spirit has clarified it for us and the ministry has glorified the thought for us. We must look carefully so that we do not stumble over it and lose the deity of Christ.
J.T. Really the deity of Christ is stressed in it, the inscrutability of His Person. He has come out in manhood yet He belongs to the Deity and never leaves It in that sense.
A.N.W. Would you care to distinguish between what the word 'Godhead' conveys to you and the word 'God'?
J.T. Godhead would seem to stress the thought of God, involving in the word 'head' that It has come out. It is a term relating to the economy into which He has come, the fulness of Deity being in Christ bodily. I think it would mean that it is absolute, it is God absolutely. That is, He is acting by Himself in relation to creation, but there is something in the word 'absolute' that goes beyond that, which we cannot take in at all. The idea that no one has seen Him or can see Him refers to the three Persons in relation to Themselves. Before creation
{185}
that is what They were and we cannot say what names They bore toward One Another then because the names we have are the names of revelation.
A.N.W. Would you object to the word 'system' applied to the Deity?
J.T. I should not like to use that word, inferring that I could put a name on what is inscrutable.
A.N.W. Is the idea of the Spirit in the Godhead?
J.T. As to the absolute Godhead, I do not like to say anything about it. You might say there were the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as now, but that would make two of Them inferior, which would be infringing on the Scripture. We should be careful.
A.B. In @1 Corinthians 8 it is, "To us there is one God", but that is comparing God to other gods. In Timothy it says, "God is one", which is not comparative. Is there something in that?
J.T. Yes, "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one"; that is, in the mediatorial system God being One would mean that three Persons are in Him and united, inscrutably related. The three Persons are in Him and They all have part in the Godhead but we cannot talk about how that works out. What we can take in is the present economy in which we are, for we are baptised to the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
J.B. How do you understand the thought, "My Father is greater than I", @John 14: 28?
J.T. It is in keeping with the economy. The Lord without altering as to His Person has taken a lower place in the economy to carry out the divine behest. That is inscrutable!
G.A.T. It says He "did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God", @Philippians 2: 6.
J.T. He did not think in that direction because He was equal with God.
L.E.S. That matter of the name is one great difference between judaism and christianity. In regard
{186}
of judaism it is, "Hear, Israel, Jehovah our God is one Jehovah", but @Ephesians 4 says, "One Spirit ... one Lord ... one God and Father".
J.T. That is the economy, quite so.
C.T. What about the passage in @John 17 which says, "And now glorify *me*, *thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was"?
J.T. That is Deity; it is extreme. He had that glory along with the Father.
A.M. What is the thought in Exodus where the seventy elders ate and drank before Him?
J.T. Now you are bringing out something that will divert us, but it is well to bring it up. God can show Himself as He pleases; we have to come to it that God can do everything, and so He can come out without our being told in what way. He is inscrutable, no one has seen Him or can see Him; we have to accept that fact, and yet they saw the God of Israel and ate and drank. Cannot God show Himself in His attributes in some way? How could He speak to Satan?
A.N.W. You made a remark yesterday that you bow to it even though you do not understand it and your soul is enlightened.
J.T. Quite so, and you get portions. You find how little you are and how great God is, and that steadies you. So we have to look at the context of such statements. How can God show Himself? In @Genesis 18 when three men came to Abraham in the heat of the day they accepted the invitation to eat there. How can God eat? We cannot explain that, but God can do everything. They ate, and they had a lamb tender and good. How can you explain it? We must just accept the fact that God can do everything.
L.E.S. So in Mark it says He appeared in another form.
{187}
J.T. In @Genesis 18 there can be no doubt that we have a suggestion of the Trinity, but it is set out in three men who can eat ordinary food. You may say, I do not know how that can be, but we are to accept it because God can do everything. Which One was Jehovah? How can we single Him out, and how did Abraham distinguish between the three? There must have been something shining out in Him that was not in the other two. And then Jehovah talked to him about righteous people. How simple God is! He comes down and eats food and says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?" Abraham saw Him there as a Man, so let us accept the fact that God can do everything; the Holy Spirit is here and He will impress our souls.
Rem. What you say will relieve us of a lot of worry if we just accept the Scriptures and go on.
J.T. God will in time give you an abundance to settle your mind, for the God of the whole of the New Testament was really in view; that God came down and ate food! How did Jesus eat fish in His resurrection condition? Spiritually you understand that He could do that, so that Peter says He ate and drank with them after He arose, and all that has to be accepted.
L.E.S. The Spirit of God will operate giving spiritual impressions, and our minds need to be under control.
J.T. Quite so. When we come to Exodus it is not simply Abraham and three men, but Moses and Aaron and seventy elders of Israel, and they "went up". It does not say they went up *the mountain*, but it is moral going up; Moses and Joshua went up the mountain physically, the others went up as a type of what we come into in the assembly. In ascension we go up, so in the type this experience is not down below; it is what you get up above. The higher you go the more you have a sense of God's greatness, so
{188}
that they saw the God of Israel, and under His feet "as it were work of transparent sapphire". Here it was God coming in in Deity, although Abraham in @Genesis 18 also saw that it was God who had appeared to him.
Ques. In Colossians we have the word 'image' used alongside of the word 'invisible': "who is image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation", @Colossians 1: 15. It does not refer to His essential being, does it?
J.T. That would represent Christ in incarnation as the image of the invisible God, so that Thomas said, "My Lord and my God". How could he say that? There was something that impressed him, so that he said not only, "My Lord", but "my God". It means that God was represented. We do not bring God the Father in there but He was represented, "He that has seen me has seen the Father", @John 14: 9. God was there representatively, He had visited His people. But that does not deny that Jesus was Himself in the Deity, and that gave Him all the distinction for those that perceived Him.
L.E.S. God being with us includes what He is in Christ.
J.T. He must be a divine Person to be Immanuel, the fulness could be in no other. And the fulness of Christ is the assembly; that is what we are dealing with now; and what distinction we need in the anointing if we are to be before Christ in His body!
-- .R. Was it revealed to Peter in @Matthew 16: 16, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God"?
J.T. Yes, the Father revealed that to him, but that was not His essential Deity, that was what He was there before Peter's eyes. The Lord Jesus had been asking what people had been saying about Him and then asked, What do you say? Peter said, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God".
{189}
The point is what was before their eyes so he does not say, You have part in the Deity. The anointed One is what we are dealing with.
Ques. When you speak of God being in us, is that true in any way apart from the Spirit?
J.T. I do not think so. Of course there is what is physical, as Paul says, "In him we live and move and exist", @Acts 17: 28. God is in the grass and the earth and makes all things grow. He is in everything and He is making the world go, but He is in us by the Spirit.
Ques. Then the Ephesian phrase, "in all", means by the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so.
G.A.T. Are you connecting the tabernacle with the assembly?
J.T. That is what is in mind and we should go into these great matters. They are infinitely great and we need to be subject and bow to the Scriptures first; we should pray to the Lord to give us understanding in all things. What is in mind is what God had in the house at Beth-el. What Jacob had in Beth-el was, you might say, only himself and God; that was the house; but what companionship he would have, because Jehovah came down to where he was and talked with him! When we go back to Abraham, there were Abraham and the three men, and finally only Abraham and God, but not in the sense of Beth-el. Then when we come to Exodus and seventy go up with Moses and Aaron they see the God of Israel, but that is not the house either; it is just dignity, just exaltation; God is giving them dignity to meet the need. There were never seventy men like these before; even Abraham did not get that view, nor Jacob. It is an exalted view and it has in mind typically the present position and what we are to reach. 'And see! the Spirit's power has ope'd the heav'nly door'. That is opened to us! All
{190}
that line of thought is brought into the tabernacle; it is made a fact in the collective situation.
-- .R. Is the thought you have in mind that in chapter 40 there is a heavenly pattern of the assembly, and that now we get the details of the working out of it in the first nine verses?
J.T. My thought is to show that in the type everything passed through Moses hands, and similarly every christian who came in from Pentecost on, has passed through Christ's hands. There is no use trying to escape; we should have in our minds that we are dealing with God in heaven and we cannot impose anything on Him. He will examine you, and His people will have a judgment of you, and admit you into the assembly. This is the pattern exactly because everything passed through Moses hands and he blessed the people; everything was done as God commanded; we must come to that. The Lord commanded, and it is God's assembly, so that it must pass through the hands of Christ.
G.A.T. This is very searching. "Lord, knower of the hearts of all", @Acts 1: 24.
J.T. So that we examine persons; that is what our care meetings are for -- to examine one another. The Lord is with us in that we must pass judgment; it is according to God.
G.A.T. @Romans 1: 20 says, "For from the world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity -- so as to render them inexcusable". Would that help?
J.T. Well, that is the initial idea. The things of creation express God in His attributes. His hidden power, but that is not Deity, it is divinity. The word 'divinity' there is more what God is as in the fulness; the Godhead is the idea that is inscrutable. The creation is more or less a witness to God in His
{191}
attributes; He made the worlds, and we apprehend by the mind His hidden power and divinity. Divinity is not as strong a word as Godhead; it suggests what He is as operating.
A.M. What is the thought of God being in us? God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness". Is that not God in us?
J.T. No, that is not God in us, that is image and likeness. You must come to the New Testament to find God in us.
-- .R. The scripture quoted refers to moral likeness, does it not?
J.T. Man is like God in a very small sense. In Colossians it is Christ who is brought forward as the "image of the invisible God". Likeness infers that one is like God and it must come before image.
The link between @Genesis 35 and @Exodus 40 is to be kept in mind, because it comes right down to David and he refers to Jacob too; the house of God is connected with Jacob because it begins with him. What is involved is that Jacob had the sense that he could be on good terms with God. That is what young people have to come to, that they can be in holy, happy relations with Christ; He sets us near Himself in holy, happy relations. Jacob felt that and called the place where he had this experience the house of God. God did not call it that but Jacob did; it represents what he experienced in it. We can never fully understand a thing unless we have experienced it.
G.A.T. When we are at an occasion such as this do we come to that in our souls?
J.T. That is what we are about to see. You would say of such a one. He was at the meeting today. So the man in @1 Corinthians 14 is a worldly man who has little interest in God; he goes in and hears prophecy and is converted. The whole company is affected by what he does, because he falls down and
{192}
worships God. If they dispersed and later met the man down the street, and wondered what experience he had had he would say, God was there! They did not tell him that God was with them but he experienced it. So Jacob could say, God and I were in the place, and he named it the house of God.
A.N.W. As to the saying, "God is indeed amongst you" (@1 Corinthians 14: 25), is He only amongst His people, "whose house are we"?
J.T. Quite so. He is not among the people generally, "God is ... amongst you". One can go out and report that God is in truth among you; he can say, I have never been in such a place before!
G.A.T. Where did the man of @1 Corinthians 14 go after that?
J.T. He would be at the meetings always.
J.W.D. Is Jacob's state only maintained as these scriptures are taken in and we are regulated by them? @Exodus 40 is the continuity of the spirit of Jacob.
J.T. That is what I thought we might see and work out in connection with our other scripture, "So also is the Christ". You might say 'the anointed' instead of "the Christ" because it means that the personnel are anointed. That is what the man in Corinthians would feel; it was the most dignified assembly he had ever been in. Then "that God may be all in all" is another thought; that is the true result of prophecy, and we shall come to that later, but the point for the moment is that God is among you of a truth.
R.G. How is Jacob able to call the place El-Beth-el?
J.T. 'El' is God in the sense of power; it is the sense in which He had been made known to Abraham; He revealed Himself to Abraham as the Almighty God. Jacob would have in mind that this God of his fathers was in that place; he had built an altar earlier and called it "God, the God of Israel",
{193}
but here it is the God of Beth-el; that is, it is the house of God and He is the God of it, and it is not simply that He comes in there but that He is to be worshipped there.
R.G. You would have to see and know the Person to use that term.
J.T. It shows that Jacob had the idea of worship. In Deuteronomy we are told He is "the God of gods", but that is a very different idea from the God of Beth-el. If He is God of gods He is over China and has to do with Ethiopia. He has authority to execute judgment against them; but in Jacob's house He has different ideas. The God of Beth-el means that He has come near to us and we must worship Him.
C.T. Do we see this in @Acts 10 where it says that they magnified God? Is that the thought of the house?
J.T. Quite so. Jacob experienced the thought of "a people near unto him" in @Psalm 148 as God came near to him and stood by him. And every young person should think of what he may experience at the meetings. Are they in a hurry to get out? That is the feeling Jacob had at first; he said, It is a dreadful place! But then afterward he anointed a pillar. In chapter 35 he comes back twenty years older and with a large family, and God talks to him and tells him to go to Beth-el. He prepared himself to go and he ordered his family to do the same; so they buried their gods and went to Beth-el, and we are told that Jacob's name was changed, as if to say that God liked him better. God changed Jacob's name at Peniel, and Jacob said much more in Beth-el the second time than he did the first time. In changing Jacob's name at Peniel God did not tell him His own name; that took place when he came back to Beth-el; it is a place of revelation and a place for living, so that the house of God implies God's presence.
{194}
It is a place of life, and Corinthians opens up that it is where things come out and there is prophecy.
-- .R. Reverting back to what we get by the Spirit, would you speak of the man in Corinthians that fell down as getting that impression by the Spirit? Was he filled by the Spirit or was he just impressed by the fact that God was there?
J.T. God was there not only in relation to him but in relation to the whole company, and he came into it. The Holy Spirit is God, we must keep that before us.
J.W.D. In Corinthians certain conditions prevailed and God was not in them. Things can be darkened, but having God among us implies proper conditions, does it not? Just because we have a meeting in our locality it does not mean that there is a condition like this.
J.T. No, indeed; there may be a bad condition into which He cannot come. The divine Presence always implies conditions. So if we are ambitious to be teachers and speaking with tongues and so forth it will darken the position.
J.B. Would the Lord in speaking to the woman in @John 4 bring her to what God had in view in connection with Jacob? There is reference back to Jacob and then He begins to speak in connection with worship.
J.T. He had to refute what she was saying and He was right in that, but even though He refuted what she said she went on and referred back to Jacob. Then she said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship". He said, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what"; you do not know what you worship. She had said, "I see that
{195}
thou art a prophet". What prophesying it was! and she had come into that. Jacob is not presented here as a prophet, he is connected with the house of God. When she said, "I see that thou art a prophet", the Lord did not despise her, but He went on to tell her about worship. Why did He not speak to Nicodemus about worship when He spoke to him? This woman had said, "I see that thou art a prophet", and now there is hope, she is ready to take in the truth; we need to be ready to take in the truth.
C.T. You were speaking of Jacob's name being changed. Will God change our names today?
J.T. Yes, but He reserves the disclosure of His own name; that is an advanced thought. He reserves His own Name but He changes your name under certain conditions. Jacob provided them; he got on well in Peniel; he said to the man who wrestled with him, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me". The woman in Samaria would not say that, though she wanted the blessing as did Jacob. He wanted the blessing, and the ground for the blessing there was that he was powerful, he wrestled with the man to the breaking of the day; he had power with God. That is the point, and that means wrestling in prayer and having the light that God will speak at such a time in the history of your soul. God says, You are changing over your natural will now, and He changes Jacob's name to what means 'a prince'. It seems that Israel means 'prince of God', or 'one that prevails', and God has use for a man that prevails spiritually.
J.W.D. His ego is changed.
J.T. The whole moral being of the man is changed. But did God tell him His own name there? No, He did not. He awaited His opportunity at Beth-el and there in chapter 35 He said, "I am the Almighty God".
{196}
A.B. Is it not beautiful to see in chapter 35 that God was on speaking terms with men? God went up from the place where He had talked with Jacob and Jacob called the place Beth-el, not because God appeared to him but because God talked with him.
J.T. Quite so, that is the ground on which Jacob pours the drink-offering on the pillar. In our reading today we should make clear how in @Exodus 40 the divine requirements are fully met and the tabernacle is set up according to divine standard. We come to the idea of the house in the end of the chapter but the anointing is in verse 9 where it says, "Thou shalt take the anointing oil". We had yesterday the component parts of the oil that was used here; Jacob had no oil like it in Genesis. First the parts of the tabernacle are put together and then the oil is used. That is what Corinthians brings out, for the apostle says, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 12: 3), showing what a place the anointing has and where the oil is. This is the oil we have in @Exodus 40 and it is brought in here after the mention of the court: "And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its utensils; and it shall be holy. And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its utensils". They are all anointed, the utensils as well as the altar; then it says, "And thou shalt hallow the altar, and the altar shall be most holy". In Leviticus the altar is anointed seven times, referring to the Person of Christ who presented Himself without spot to God by the eternal Spirit. The Spirit is greatly stressed in connection with the altar and it is said to be most holy. Then the laver is in verse 11, "And thou shalt anoint the laver and its stand"; and that finishes the matter of the tabernacle. Then we have the matter of the priests; and when we come to verse 34 it says, "And the cloud covered the tent of meeting,
{197}
and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle". You can see we have come here to something much greater than Beth-el; God came there and stood by Jacob but now we have the glory filling the tabernacle, and it says that "Moses could not enter into the tent of meeting, for the cloud abode on it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle". We have typically the greatest collective thought here.
A.B. Would mutuality be in mind, the co-ordinating of all Israel in the matter?
J.T. That is what Exodus teaches us, it is the main thought after chapter 35; the tabernacle is the whole thought, you might say, with the exception of the breakdown in chapter 32. This thought we are engaged with now is the dominating idea in Exodus; it is the house of God and everything must conform to the commandment.
-- .T. Do you mean the anointing is the full thought here in Exodus, and that we are part of the assembly as the anointed vessel?
J.T. Yes. We are getting help now as we are challenging ourselves as to what we have in the system, in the tabernacle, and in our houses, and whether we are anointed. That is what we are aiming for and Corinthians enriches the idea greatly for us, telling us that in order to say, "Lord Jesus", in the assembly we need the Spirit.
T.U. You have said that anointing is in view of testimony; is this a further thought here?
J.T. Yes, this is the full thought of God in the type. He has complete control of the tabernacle and He is restful in it. Even Moses cannot serve in the presence of this glory, for God says, I thoroughly accept all this and I want it all to Myself.
G.A.T. Is this the answer to the affliction of the saints?
J.T. The offerings for the tabernacle in chapter 25 and now this result are the answer, and God is
{198}
saying, I am perfectly restful here. It is what is heavenly down here in testimony. It says further, "The cloud abode on it ... . And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel journeyed in all their journeys. And if the cloud were not taken up, then they did not journey until the day that it was taken up". It is a testimonial position and everything is controlled by the cloud, it is the presence of God among us. There is a greater thing than elders or deacons -- God is greater, and this is God Himself.
Ques. Would the early chapters of Numbers fit into this? The end of @Exodus 40 seems to be a point stressed in @Numbers 9.
J.T. It is the external position there but in Exodus we are presenting ourselves, "whose house are we". In early Numbers the priests and Levites are brought forward as the only ones to have to do with the assembling of the tabernacle, and after that thought the next thing is the priesthood. The people themselves are viewed tribally in Numbers and also militarily. These are all features that exist in the wilderness where we are to view ourselves as sojourners. But here we have the idea of the tabernacle as composed of the saints, and God is there of a truth so that anyone who comes in realises that God is there, and the whole system is regulated by the cloud.
Rem. So that priestly service and levitical service are for the saints and to the saints. It is a concrete idea and we are not to look at the matter abstractly.
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. Is @Acts 2 the antitype and @1 Corinthians 12 the inauguration?
J.T. @Acts 2 is the inauguration of the position, the initial idea, and then in Corinthians Paul is dealing with the gentiles. The question of the Spirit and the anointing is before us in these meetings and
{199}
heaven would challenge us as to whether we are alive in the assembly and taking part in our place according to divine ordering. Is my functioning in the power of the anointing? Am I functioning at all? Am I living? Each has his place and each part is to be functioning in the power of the anointing. You cannot even say, "Lord Jesus", without the power of the Spirit.
J.W.D. There is the suggestion of a supreme state of soul that Moses could not enter into; is that not the interior position? And do we hold our own personal relations with God in the system as greater than all that serve in it?
J.T. Yes. God is fully delighted with what is here. He is wholly complacent in the scene and even Moses cannot serve. It is God Himself who is present.
Ques. Is the anointing the Spirit objectively, and the cloud the Spirit subjectively?
J.T. The cloud would just mean the divine Presence, it is a symbol and is what is seen outwardly. God Himself is inside, dwelling there; He is in thick darkness, but nevertheless there. In christianity He is here in light.
G.A.T. In @1 Corinthians 15 God is all in all.
J.T. That is so. The tabernacle is not final, it is a wilderness position but the principle is there of God being all in all; He fills the whole scene.
L.E.S. Over against our calling Jesus 'Lord' by the Holy Spirit is the one who says, "Curse on Jesus".
J.T. It is an awful thought that anyone should say, "Curse on Jesus".
L.E.S. Why is it brought in there?
J.T. It is the exposure of the conditions in the wilderness. If there is rivalry in the assembly the devil gets in and there is something of that kind.
{200}
U.O.G. What is the difference between the cloud and the Spirit?
J.T. It is the same idea, but it is all to be viewed contextually. Here the cloud is mentioned first as covering the tent of meeting, and then the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. The glory filling is another thought; it is not filling the tent of meeting; the word for 'tabernacle' is not the same as 'tent of meeting'. The tabernacle is the full thought of where God dwells but the tent of meeting is where God meets us. As God meets with us conditions change and God is with us, we realise His presence, that is the inside. In verses 36 to 38 we have striking emphasis on God's presence. God's dwelling; those three verses are to be taken by themselves.
T.U. Is the glory linked with one specific meeting or with every meeting?
J.T. The glory is present in every meeting. There is more than one glory because we go "from glory to glory", but here we have only one general idea and that is the place of God's dwelling. The cloud conveys the public idea and indicates that God is there. You take off your hat in the meeting and are reverential because God is there.
R.G. Is the cloud in verse 36 a confirmation of chapter 33?
J.T. That was to honour Moses. Moses pitched his tent outside the camp and God honoured him there; but this is not to honour Moses here. God is saying, so to speak, I can go on without you; I can go on with no Moses in authority and no Levites. It is God; God will tabernacle with men.
C.T. If I come to the meeting with the end of the chapter in mind will it regulate me?
J.T. Quite so. We should look for the glory in every coming together. If we look for it, we shall see it.
{201}
-- .R. Is this the viewpoint of looking at it from the mountain? "How goodly are thy tents, Jacob".
J.T. There it is tents; this is the tabernacle. The allusion there is to how the saints are set around the tabernacle of God.
J.K. Would that contribute to this condition?
J.T. That is what is to be seen, the proximity of the houses where we dwell to where God abides. Those were the dwellings of Jacob, but there is also the dwelling of God.
{202}
THE ANOINTING (4)
@1 Peter 2: 4, 5; @Exodus 29: 1 - 9, 21, 43 - 46
J.T. Priesthood is in mind at this time, and the passage in Peter was suggested because the saints are formally, as christians, brought forward as a holy priesthood to offer up sacrifices to God by Jesus Christ. I thought that we should have an authoritative scripture from the New Testament, and then what we read in the Old Testament asserts the fact that priesthood applies to all christians. The priesthood is carried on by the saints "by Jesus Christ" which would correspond with what we have in Exodus as to Aaron and his house. Exodus affords instructions at remarkable length as to priesthood, chapters 28 and 29 both being very long chapters and both occupied throughout with the priesthood, showing how important it is in the divine system and how it secures the presence of God. In the closing verses read God says, "And there will I meet with the children of Israel; and it shall be hallowed by my glory. And I will hallow the tent of meeting, and the altar; and I will hallow Aaron and his sons, that they may serve me as priests. And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will be their God". This is the permanent position secured in the tabernacle and the system is maintained in a living way by the priests.
L.E.S. Is there a link with what we had in our previous reading in that Peter in his epistle brings forward the priesthood first and then goes on to the house of God later?
J.T. That is what I thought, and @Acts 2 gives us the inauguration of the system. Christ being at the right hand of God received from the Father the Spirit of the Father, as it says, "Having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear". What
{203}
was manifest before the eyes of men was thus explained. Peter being used to set out the truth of the inaugural position; and now in writing to persons of the dispersion he mentions the fact that though far away from Jerusalem and separated from all God's original arrangements and personnel, yet they were a holy nation there among the gentiles. They had their High Priest, for though dispersed they carried on the service of God by Jesus Christ.
These chapters in Exodus are written to instruct us in detail as to Christ in ourselves, for we are not dealing with something at a distance, indeed there is something that exists at the present moment in this room for Christ and for God. God would impress us with the greatness of the priestly family, Aaron and his sons. Chapter 28 speaks of the garments of the high priest and also of the sons of Aaron, but is very brief about the latter. The chapter is expressive of God's thoughts, every item they wore expressed something of God, something to dignify and consecrate Him in: our thoughts; that is what the garments really mean. And then chapter 29 is to bring out how the priests were anointed as thus garbed. Underlying the anointing are the thoughts of God, the dignity and holiness attached to the priestly family, and so it is incumbent on each one of us to be sure that we belong to that family and to associate ourselves with our Aaron as the great High Priest above.
L.E.S. Would judgment beginning at the house of God refer to the priestly side being seen?
J.T. It is a time of judgment and Peter alludes to that in chapter 4, "The time of having the judgment begin from the house of God is come". We are the house as well as being the priests. Have you something else to say about the judgment?
L.E.S. Is the judgment based on the priestly side being in evidence?
{204}
J.T. Yes, the judgment was discerned in the Urim and Thummim; the idea of lights and perfections is suggested by them. It is through them that matters of judgment in the assembly are solved.
C.T. In chapters 28 and 29 is the thought in priesthood the thought of service?
J.T. That is right, it is a good key note in both chapters. We are helped in the service in this wonderful dignity.
A.N.W. Is the reference in Peter to our being built up in relation to the development of the work of God in our souls, or is it the maintenance of the house all through time?
J.T. I suppose Peter was informing them that the position in which they were thus addressed should be kept in mind because they were dispersed, the word was "to the sojourners of the dispersion". That would mean that they had been Jews and had become christians, but still had the land and thoughts of Israel in mind though they had been ousted from that position and were dispersed among the gentiles. Peter was impressing on them that they were not losing anything at all, because they really are themselves unofficially what had been at Jerusalem; they had everything among themselves as dispersed. That would not apply to gentile believers because they never had anything to do with Jerusalem; they were not scattered but were right where they had been brought up, whereas the Jews were dispersed from some other place, many of them from Jerusalem itself where the temple was. So Peter was telling them that they were themselves the temple and the priesthood, and that the service of God must be carried on by them.
A.N.W. In reality they had lost nothing but had gained as becoming christians, and the work of God is carried forward in them.
{205}
J.T. That is the point. The dispersion is an allusion to the government of God, for every Jewish person is suffering under the hand of God in that regard, and the more he suffers the more the Lord will take account of him. Peter's epistles were to impress this upon the Jewish christians in those provinces. It does not say that Peter laboured in his work of instructing the saints; the word 'laboured' is connected very much with Paul, but Peter in teaching the Jews would turn their minds to Exodus, like the Lord Himself in His discourse on the way to Emmaus. He would open up this chapter and other chapters in Exodus to them, and now that is our privilege, we can speak from these scriptures to one another. It must be exceedingly interesting to heaven that we so far away in the West can turn to these passages that Peter would have used.
L.E.S. The link here with Peter is remarkable, and then you referred to Paul, which makes one think of what is said about his movements in regard to Bithynia, that "the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" to go there. The Spirit of Jesus would be connected with the anointing oil, the myrrh and suffering.
J.T. Quite so. You mean that Paul had laboured among the dispersion and now the Spirit of Jesus would have him labour in Europe, which is in principle labouring in America, because America is Europe extended. The Spirit of Jesus turned him this way, the man in Macedonia representing the gentiles of the West, as he says, "Pass over into Macedonia and help us", @Acts 16: 9.
Rem. It is important that before Peter speaks of the great character that attaches to the people of God he stresses the movement of souls toward Christ and the idea of a functioning priesthood. It is not based on birth, because we are not born into the priestly family.
{206}
J.T. We can only take up the type here of Aaron and his sons. His daughters have a place too according to Leviticus, so the priesthood is really a family, not born but called. It is called in the same way that Aaron is called. But then in addition Christ is constituted a Priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec. But Melchisedec had no children, which brings him personally into greater relief. The way it is set out in Hebrews is intended to bring Jesus into great prominence, so Melchisedec is just himself with no father, no mother, no beginning of days nor end of life, and he abides a priest continually. We may look with profit at the way Paul treats of this subject of priesthood and it will not interfere with our line of thought. Undoubtedly Paul is the writer of Hebrews and so he is impressing the Jews in his epistle. Peter would look toward the East and write to Jewish christians, but Paul would look toward the West. He does not call the saints priests in Hebrews; only Christ is Priest, and I think when we are in the period of waning christianity our only hope is Christ, we should be filled with His greatness; "Such a high priest became us", not as priests but as christians. Christ is the One from whom to learn priesthood in Hebrews, but Peter said as looking toward the East, "Yourselves also ... a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ". No doubt Paul would endorse that with other terms, but he does not bring it forward in Hebrews.
E.I.E. Would you say a word as to the difference between the Melchisedec and the Aaronic priesthoods?
J.T. The Melchisedec priesthood would bring out the greatness of Christ alone, without any family, so we are not sons of Melchisedec at all. It is a question in his case of how great a person he was, and how great the saints are to have such a High Priest,
{207}
"For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens". That indicates how great the saints are.
A.N.W. Peter would indicate a strong affinity between the living Stone and living stones. What is meant by the living stones?
J.T. Surely it is Peter's line to introduce the thought of the living Stone and the living stones because Peter is a living stone according to what is said by Matthew, Peter meaning 'a stone'.
J.W.D. Shall we have any relation to the Melchisedec priesthood as such in the world to come?
J.T. He is not set with a family, and it is a question of how we come in under him. Aaron is the priest at the present time, from the standpoint of functioning. Aaron was a dying man, but Melchisedec is not so presented; he represents Christ personally as John would present Him. The book of Revelation, which is John's volume about priesthood, says that Christ has "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father". We are made priests to God in @Revelation 1, then we are priests of God and of Christ in chapter 20. It is perhaps applicable for us to look at the book of Revelation in connection with our subject. In chapter 20, verse 6, it says, "Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection, over these the second death has no power; but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years". In the first chapter John in his preamble says, "And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father ...". So we are priests in the first chapter, active priests toward Him; the thought is presented in the objective case; but in chapter 20 it
{208}
is more that we are of God and of Christ; we are in relation to God family-wise. Whether it means that we are derived from or whether that we are belonging to God and Christ, in any case it establishes our status there. In chapter 5 we have another set of saints, and verse 10 says He has "made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall reign over the earth"; so that the book has priesthood in mind applying to ourselves and also to others later. The Melchisedec function is to be all millennial and he is not stated to have any children or family or even any parents.
Ques. In these thoughts of John in chapter 1 it is "priests to ... God", and in chapter 20 "priests of God". Does that correspond with Peter's thoughts of the holy priesthood on the one hand and the royal priesthood on the other?
J.T. You might say that. The link with Christ is remarkable, and in the millennium we shall have a priestly place of course. Ezekiel opens up much as to the actual service in that day before God, the priesthood there being related to Zadok; he is the priest in that setting and not Melchisedec, the allusion being to a person who was victorious under David. The link is with that, I think, because he was one who suffered loyally, allying himself with David in his time of affliction.
-- .R. Will you say a word as to sonship? It does not come in with the Melchisedec priesthood, does it?
J.T. Oh, yes. The One who said He was a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec saluted Him as Son in Hebrews, and He is saluted as Priest by God according to @Psalm 110.
Ques. Does the verse help that says, "Our Lord has sprung out of Juda", @Hebrews 7: 14?
J.T. That is suggestive of His sonship. But Melchisedec is a different order of priesthood from the line established in Levi; he stands alone as alluding
{209}
to Christ, just as John pictures His uniqueness in his gospel; having neither father nor mother, nor beginning of days, nor end of life, he abides a Priest continually. He is a divine Person and stands alone. But He is not to stand alone as to christianity because we are associated with Him in the family sense according to the Aaronic viewpoint, and so Exodus is a type generally of christianity, it is the present time.
G.A.T. Do you look at the saints as together in a general way as a kingdom of priests?
J.T. We are made a kingdom, it is a political thought. The idea is that He has made us a kingdom, and priests; priests are a distinct thought. The idea of a kingdom in that sense is that we have power to go on, the shout of a king is among the saints. We are not protected by any earthly means, but we are protected morally and spiritually; we cannot count on man's kingdom to protect us.
-- .T. Does the kingdom suggest power to maintain the rights of God?
J.T. Yes, to maintain them in a spiritual way, and you may be put to death in doing it. The Lord said we are not to fear those who kill the body; they cannot go beyond that, but the kingdom enables me to go through victoriously even as Christ who was slain in His victory. What we get in @Acts 7 really depicts the power of the kingdom, that Stephen knelt down and prayed as they were stoning him and said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge". The kingdom would give you moral power to be victorious; the Lord said to Smyrna, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life".
G.A.T. Would what you say now be the kingdom of God made good in our souls?
J.T. It is what we are conscious of, and there should be power in our souls so that we are not overpowered by circumstances.
{210}
C.T. Is it a different thought in @Revelation 5 where it speaks of God's kings and priests?
J.T. That alludes to the saints that are coming after us: "the things that are about to be after these" alludes to chapter 4 and onward, so it has in mind the Lamb on the throne and how He makes kings and priests to God in that day.
J.W.D. Does it suggest that there is a common bond between all families in the Revelation?
J.T. Yes, so that though the book itself is dealing mainly with what is future from chapter 4 to 19, yet viewed in that way as treating of ourselves and of what is coming after us it is a binding book. The assemblies have the book and yet the remnant in a coming day has a link with us. Anybody that persecutes the Jews will have to answer for it, just as God has said that anybody who touches Cain cannot do it with impunity. Even though he has a curse on him God has not lost sight of him.
E.I.E. Would it help our young brothers at the tribunals if they would think of themselves as part of a kingdom of priests?
J.T. That is the thing. We are able to pray for the tribunals and their members, but the young men are morally greater than they. The idea is foreseen in Romans where God has made us a kingdom and we "reign in life". Christians "reign in life"; that is the kingdom for every one of us; the life enjoyed in Christ is a part of the gospel and it makes us victorious in all circumstances, especially before the tribunals. They are reigning, but so are we reigning and we reign by suffering, "We are put to death all the day long ... but in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us", @Romans 8: 36, 37.
G.A.T. Would Paul before Agrippa support that thought? He says, "I count myself happy", and he wished that all were like him.
{211}
J.T. Quite so; "I would to God ... all who have heard me this day, should become such as *I* also am, except these bonds", @Acts 26: 29.
R.G. "All are yours; and *ye* are Christ's, and Christ is God's", @1 Corinthians 3: 22, 23.
J.T. That is the position; reigning is manifest in the kingdom and it belongs to each one of us.
--.R. Does Paul have that in view when he says, "The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us", @Romans 8: 18?
J.T. Just so, the position is to make us independent in every way of things here.
J.B. Would the greatness of Jacob be seen in that regard as he blessed Pharaoh in the spirit of the anointing?
J.T. Yes, quite so; Jacob and all the other anointed ones are superior.
A.N.W. So that on the kingly side we set forth the excellencies of Him who has called us.
J.T. I think all that is very applicable at the present time. I may be a prisoner at the hand of men, but I am free; if I am a priest I am reigning.
G.A.T. I know we do not show what we should; at the tests we are weak.
J.T. That is to be owned by all of us but the Lord and the Spirit add Their help to our weakness so that we should not fail. If we are in doubt what to do the Lord will make a decision for us: this help is all in the system that God has set up so that we shall reign in life. But now that is a general outlook on the matter and what we are engaged with particularly is the anointing, the priesthood, and the oil by which the priesthood is anointed. First of all we have, "This is the thing which thou shalt do to them to hallow them, that they may serve me as priests, take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish, and unleavened bread, and unleavened
{212}
cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil -- of wheaten flour shalt thou make them. And thou shalt put them into one basket, and present them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams". All this refers to redemption and then, "Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring near", which means that they are to be served, "and shalt bathe them with water". The idea of death was there; God as incarnate in Christ came by water and blood, "And thou shalt take the garments, and clothe Aaron with the vest, and the cloak of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and shalt gird him with the girdle of the ephod. And thou shalt put the turban upon his head, and fasten the holy diadem to the turban, and shalt take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him". The first great matter, after redemption is provided for, is that Aaron is by himself; he is pre-eminent in all things, even in the anointing. In chapter 40, which we had in our previous reading, it says the sons were to be anointed as he was anointed, but he was anointed by himself. In type Christ is anointed by Himself "with the oil of gladness" above His companions, and that is important, for He must always have pre-eminence.
G.A.T. Is that why you started yesterday with the Lord being anointed?
J.T. He is not seen as anointed for the service of God in what we had yesterday; it was rather what He was doing towards man that was in mind. What we read here is more in relation to service God-ward. He is to serve Me, God says, in the priest's office; Christ is pre-eminent in that. And then further, "Thou shalt bring his sons near, and clothe them with the vests. And thou shalt gird them with the girdle -- Aaron and his sons" -- Aaron is kept separate -- "and bind the high caps on them; and the priesthood shall be theirs for an everlasting statute; and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons".
{213}
Although anointed separately, he is still linked with his sons as our Lord Jesus is with us.
T.U. Is there any link with the reference in Peter to offering "spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God", @1 Peter 2: 5?
J.T. That is what is in mind. If Peter had five readings as we are having here you may be sure he would turn to Exodus, and so we are on sure ground in linking what Peter had then with this book.
T.U. In the epistle of Peter is there any feature of priestly service where we function without Christ?
J.T. I do not think so. We ought to offer everything, whatever it is, in the name of the Lord Jesus and He presents our prayers according to the figure in @Revelation 8: "that he might give efficacy to the prayers of all saints at the golden altar which was before the throne".
T.U. What about addressing the Father or God in the morning meeting? Some brothers finish 'in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ' and some finish abruptly, without reference to Him.
J.T. That would be a question of scriptural example. In all courts they allude to precedents which have been accepted; and in regard to assembly matters, we have precedents set out in the book of Acts so that we can go by them. The thought is that everything is presented to God in the name of the Lord Jesus, "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". That is, the Spirit is active as we present things through the Mediator to God, and that is the general principle; we do not do anything without Him.
T.U. What would you say about @Romans 11, where Paul says "Amen", without referring to Christ? Is it permissible either way?
J.T. Whatever Scripture warrants is acceptable. God has confidence that if we are omitting the name of the Lord Jesus we are not forgetting Him.
{214}
-- .R. Would it be covered by the scripture, "And everything, whatever ye may do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him", @Colossians 3: 17?
J.T. That is a good reference. Now to get to the gist of this chapter, the sons are brought in in verses 8 and 9. It is a long chapter and we cannot enter into it all, but in verse 21 we have further allusion to redemption for that must be the basis of our anointing. "And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons garments with him". There we have Christ and the saints. His pre-eminence is already fixed in our minds in the early part of the chapter so now God has confidence in us that the service can go on with due allowance for the dignity of Christ.
A.N.W. How does the anointing of Christ typically stand in relation to the statement, "He that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one", @Hebrews 2: 11?
J.T. That passage is a near thought to priesthood for though we do not have the actual word we have the suggestion of it. Indeed it really refers to priesthood although the word 'sanctifies' serves the purpose; it is a question of the Person of Christ. In @John 12 the corn of wheat falls into the ground and dies and as it does it bears much fruit; it is an agricultural thought to show that we are one with Christ, we are of a kind with Him, the Sanctifier.
G.A.T. Does it not also say, He "has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions", @Hebrews 1: 9?
J.T. Yes, and it is to bring out that the writer is bent on establishing in our souls the supremacy and superiority and pre-eminence of Christ in every connection.
{215}
To return to our chapter, what is to be noted is the importance of the garments. In verse 21 they have a great place as gathering up the teaching of chapter 28, "And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him". Now this raises the whole thought of garments. God says in @Luke 15, "Bring out the best robe", put divine thoughts on the saints, clothe them with My thoughts; that is what is in mind. It is a question of what God's thoughts are about us, how we are regarded by Him.
Rem. @Psalm 133 speaks of brethren dwelling together in unity and then, "the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the hem of his garments".
J.T. Yes, it ran down to the hem; that would mean that the holy anointing oil running down to Aaron's hem would beautify his person. It is for beautification. And the beard is not merely to keep him warm; it is beautification also, but it is entirely disregarded in modern times. The oil runs down to the hem, suggesting a finished matter; the garment is not loose but it is hemmed, referring, I believe, to Christ and the assembly; it is a finished matter.
C.T. I suppose that although Aaron's garments were set off by themselves, yet his sons garments would be like his.
J.T. They would correspond. Chapter 28 is largely about Aaron, but the sons come in just at the end and what is stressed is their high caps. Aaron has a turban, alluding to the wonderful intelligence of Christ; but the sons are high-capped and they have linen breeches, meaning that there is the negation of all earthly activities. Whatever way you look at the garments, the anointing is on all. God is anointing these qualities.
{216}
Ques. When you speak of the negation of fleshly tendencies have you in mind that in @Leviticus 21 we have two words used in connection with Aaron's progeny, his "sons" and his "seed"? The word 'seed' is used as distinguishing certain ones who had fleshly disabilities or disqualifications. How do such disabilities come about?
J.T. Are you thinking of difficulties with persons due to the working of will in themselves? Those disqualifications would be something in themselves; but sons of Aaron would be the full thought in the priestly family, and even his daughters are included. That is the family side more, the dignity side. But in these two chapters the garments are stressed, conveying what God's thoughts are about this matter.
J.W.D. We should have ability to think of the saints in that way.
J.T. That is the point; I can clothe you and you can clothe me with divine thoughts, not party thoughts but divine thoughts. God is able to speak of people abstractly and to disregard all outward defects. In John's epistle it says, "Every one begotten of God does not sin", (@1 John 5: 18); these are wonderful thoughts to extend to the saints and to one another.
L.E.S. Is there a link with @Acts 20, "the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own"? Would that fit in with these thoughts of the blood?
J.T. Quite so, it refers to His own blood, Christ's blood. It is helpful in our everyday relations one with another if we are able to extend divine thoughts to the brethren. I shall love them if I can clothe them with the thoughts of God, but if I do not do it I shall not respect them.
A.W.Jr. You mentioned sisters earlier, and in Peter it speaks about the wives and feminine apparel, "whose adorning let it not be that outward one of
{217}
tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel; but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price", @1 Peter 3: 3, 4.
J.T. In that chapter we have the wife praying; "Ye husbands ... giving them honour, as also fellow-heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered", @1 Peter 3: 7. So the wife comes into the prayers and that sets out priesthood in function. Husbands are to dwell with their wives according to knowledge, "that your prayers be not hindered"; meaning that the wives are the daughters of Aaron, having part in priesthood.
J.W.D. We think of the saints in this exalted way in regard to the morning meeting almost exclusively, but we need to look at them in that light all the time.
J.T. It is an immense subject for investigation as applying to the assembly meeting. On the Lord's day how do we sit down together in relation to one another? What are our thoughts in relation to the brethren? One sister said, I could not listen to the prayer because I was watching the feather on another sister's hat. She was lost to the service; she was not thinking on the prayer, not occupied with the priestly garments.
J.B. In Kings it speaks of the keeper of the wardrobe.
J.T. All matters of clothing come under what we are saying, and there are many references to it, but no other chapters say so much as these do. The whole of chapter 28 is about the high priest except one or two verses, for God is always clothing Christ so that He may have the first place in our hearts. When we think of the linen breeches the suggestion is of the priest restraining the flesh, because linen has a cooling, non-irritating effect on the skin. We should
{218}
be sober and not too enthusiastic about anything, even spiritual thoughts. What we want is divine thoughts, and not one thought only, for you cannot clothe persons with just one thought.
-- .R. Your statement regarding the saints in the morning meeting is helpful. All that we do there should be in the power of the Spirit, even the giving out of hymns and the way they are started.
J.T. Yes, the thing is to be occupied with God's thoughts. It is not then the time for mending things; it is the finished product, the hem of the garment that is in evidence as the service is going on.
J.W.D. We are referring to service God-ward, are we not? How does the composition of the anointing oil, including the myrrh, link on with that?
J.T. The anointing oil is composed of myrrh, and two other ingredients half as much, and then cassia as much as myrrh. Is your question how that enters into the service of God? Do you not think that when we leave the dwellings of Jacob in the morning we realise that Satan has been ready in every dwelling to offset the right feelings of the saints so that they might be unequal to the service of God? To rectify that there is the system that God has set up with the Advocate above interceding for us, and the effect of that is to bring us back to what Christ was here. He was never upset; He went into Martha's house and she criticised Him and He said, "Martha, Martha ..." and she was set right. So I am to set myself right before I leave the dwelling of Jacob; I am not upset by the systems which are around, I have my high cap on, my affections are free and pure, and I have power as suggested in the linen undergarments so that I can join in at once when I come to the assembly. I am thus able to think with God and to clothe that young sister or brother with divine thoughts. These are things for our souls to consider. And then the bread coming
{219}
first in the service reminds us that "we being many, are one body", and we clothe ourselves in that way.
G.A.T. As coming under the influence of the anointing oil we can do that.
J.T. That is the point, we come under the influence of the oil and we are reigning in life and are thus able to take part in the assembly in liberty and power.
C.T. Do I understand that as I leave my home I am to consider my garments?
J.T. Yes, get into priestly trim or else you will not be able to take part in priestly power in the assembly.
We should look now at the end of this chapter because it is of prime importance. Verse 43 says, "There will I meet with the children of Israel; and it shall be hallowed by my glory. And I will hallow the tent of meeting, and the altar; and I will hallow Aaron and his sons, that they may serve me as priests". This is a fixed matter, all according to priesthood, so that God's affairs are taken care of. So when the time comes in the service we are able to use the right hymn; there is a time for everything and the time for singing requires not only the right tune but the right words. The priests are all anointed so that there is praise right from the start. Then in @Psalm 133 we see that it is a finished matter because there is the hem of the garment. The next psalm brings in the priest and it is the last song of degrees. That is how matters stand in the assembly, a hymn is given out and we know how it is to be sung, and then we proceed with the bread and cup and what follows on that, because we know there are other glories to follow; and so we go up, and finally we go out on the upper level, not on the lower.
U.O.G. So that what follows is beautiful, "And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God". Would that be the outcome of it?
{220}
J.T. Yes, God is now among us.
L.E.S. So while priesthood does not go through into eternity in its official setting, yet the persons are there; and the fulness of it would be seen here, as it says in @Revelation 21: 3, "God himself shall be with them, their God".
J.T. Beautiful! What incentive there is for our service in all that, and what may be reached so that the position is fixed and the priesthood carried on! God can trust the priests.
G.A.T. Is there a higher thought than priests in the morning meeting?
J.T. Yes, priesthood is only to meet the corrupting conditions in which we still are; but in eternity there will be no need for priesthood. The priests protect the position to keep out evil, and they are intelligent in knowing what to do.
G.T. Is priesthood based on sonship?
J.T. Sonship is the greater thought, it is a family matter.
A.B. The holy garments would protect us from surrounding evils.
J.T. That is the idea; the point in priesthood is that things are kept pure and in power.
A.B. In Zechariah Joshua the high priest was clothed with filthy garments, but those that stood by were told to take them off him and put on festival robes.
J.T. This chapter has a most stimulating finish as we bring it down to ourselves. "And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who have brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, to dwell in their midst: I am Jehovah their God".
C.T. So the whole thought is that God has done this, He has brought us out.
J.T. Yes, and He tells us here why He did it -- that He might dwell with us. It is a great incentive to make way for Him and to understand this wonderful matter of priesthood, anointed priesthood.
{221}
THE ANOINTING (5)
@1 Samuel 2: 10 (2nd sentence); @1 Samuel 16: 11 - 13; @1 Kings 19: 15 - 18
J.T. It is hoped that through this book of 1 Samuel the Lord will add much to our subject, especially as we have Christ in mind as King; and then in 1 Kings it is in mind to touch on the idea of the anointing of prophets. We have seen Christ in the gospels anointed in relation to the preaching, and in @Acts 10 anointed by God in relation to His general service, and God being with Him in that service. Then we have had the general thought of the anointing of the saints and how we come into it, and the assembly viewed as anointed in the types of the tabernacle and of the priesthood. So what remains is what enters into these scriptures that we have read, that is the king and the prophets. Inasmuch as the saints are regarded as kings there will be a reference necessarily to us in that capacity; but 1 Samuel will also afford opportunity to bring in the general position of ministry yielding fruits as seen in Hannah and Abigail. Hannah alludes to the anointing in a very significant way in her prophetic message as she says, "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed". In the phrase, "his anointed". David was undoubtedly in mind as a type of Christ, and the Spirit of God stresses his personal appearance as entering into his qualifications for the anointing. That is perhaps additional to anything we have had in mind so far.
As to Abigail, she comes in after Samuel, a prophet of God, dies. He is a great minister in the book and clearly she has profited by his ministry because she corresponds with David femininely. This will profitably come in for review, and I should like to remark that the feminine side is really the product of
{222}
ministry, for clearly Abigail is the product of Samuel's ministry. She was informed of David, although not necessarily acquainted with him personally, and she had the mind of God about him as the anointed so that she speaks of him in chapter 25 as "bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God", as she says, "because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil has not been found in thee all thy days. And if a man is risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God". Thus she has a clear view of David and she is introduced in the chapter as bearing a correspondence to him in a personal sense, as verse 3 says, "The woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance". The understanding would allude to what was of God in the ministry at the time, chiefly through Samuel, so that there is a certain richness in this connection which the Lord brings before us as obtainable at the present time and the anointing is in line with it in view of results for God.
L.E.S. How would the thought of judging come in in relation to the anointing: "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth"?
J.T. I suppose it shows the wide outlook the prophetess had, if we can speak of Hannah in that way in relation to the whole of her word. Among other things she said, "My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up in Jehovah", and later, "For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed", and further, "Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up. Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up, he raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, to set him among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; for the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon
{223}
them. He keepeth the feet of his saints, but the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; in the heavens will he thunder upon them. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed". So that what you refer to would seem to be included in a very wide range of thought, including the pillars of the earth and the fact that He had set the world upon them; and that is the habitable earth according to the note, so that it is not only Israel that is in mind. Hannah had a wide outlook therefore, and she would include the whole position of God's operations and feel the need of judgment in the ends of the earth, its extreme limits.
Ques. Is there a suggestion in Abigail of the result of this stabilising effect prefigured in the pillars? Her knowing David as the prevailer, and being strengthened by God against the elements set out in Nabal might be suggestive of our knowing Christ as the Prevailer and King in the presence of the elements around that are opposed.
J.T. In that light the repudiating of her husband is an element that is important because we are to repudiate natural links if they have turned away from God.
Ques. Would the words of king Lemuel help? "It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine", @Proverbs 31: 4.
J.T. That idea is seen in Abigail and I think she has thus to be viewed as a product of ministry. Christ as typified in David, the anointed of God, is said to be "ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance". He manifests the vigour of life, and Abigail does so too. Saul would represent the opposite, the want of freshness and vigour; he was a big man, but David was taken up because of the evidence of life in him. And so with Abigail, she comes in as replacing
{224}
Samuel in a sense, being connected with his death, but as a product of his ministry. She refuses her husband and designates why.
Ques. Are you thinking of the husband now as the public position and David as the link with Christ? Samuel seems to be the last public link between God and the people.
J.T. Abigail takes the place of the assembly, the espoused of Christ, corresponding to Him in life over against the system and those in it, so that Saul is just called "a man" by her. The position, therefore, is held in the vigour of life both in Hannah and in Abigail. The book began with Hannah forecasting the same thing, bringing out the prophetic spirit in a woman. She spoke of the anointing of God, and the whole book becomes one of the most prolific in our subject especially in view of current conditions on the earth. What a need there is for David, that is Christ, that we might have the thought of the assembly in this aspect! Great difficulties will then be overcome as to Saul and Nabal. Nabal is still the nominal husband and Saul is still the nominal king but there are great prospects of victory because of the vigour of life connected with the anointing.
A.B. What is the suggestion in, "He will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed"?
J.T. The horn is a symbol of power and so the thought of progress increases in the thought of kingly power, the horn of the anointed one.
E.I.E. You were saying that the prophetic thought and priesthood are both in view here in Hannah.
J.T. What is your thought of the priesthood in her?
E.I.E. I thought her language would give that idea.
J.T. She clearly had prayer in mind and prayer represents priesthood. She had prayed previously
{225}
but her voice had not been heard, only her lips moved. Similarly the servant of Abraham prayed in his heart, showing that one can pray without the voice being heard. She prayed and got a definite answer, but then what she says later is not exactly prayer, we might say it is prophetic.
J.B. Would Hannah be on the line of movement toward God in contrast to Eli?
J.T. She is over against Eli and his house, so that Jehovah in His judgment of Eli reveals this to Samuel. What He speaks of is not yet the ends of the earth but judgment in His house and judgment must begin at the house of God; He has a definite judgment of Eli and tells it to Samuel.
J.W.D. Is your thought that priesthood as seen in Hannah should be characteristic of us?
J.T. I was thinking of that. She is exceedingly interesting because from the outset she is an object of rivalry, a very bitter experience, and she has an outlet in prayer; it is all to promote the house of God. In her there is already displaying itself what is God's objective to reach in Samuel, because Samuel is the fulness of his mother.
Ques. Do the roots go back to the book of Ruth? Does the thought of anointing begin there and continue on in Hannah and go through her finally to David? Is that the sequence of the prophetic ministry?
J.T. Well, it runs through, quite so. One of the most suggestive thoughts is the proposal in @Judges 9 to anoint a king over the trees. Very great partisan feeling was current, a leader was put forth and he only accepted the proposal because he was useless, he was a thorn bush, that was what Jotham's parable taught. Such a one would oppose the anointing of God, for His anointing is not of a thorn bush; similarly Adonijah was supposed to be king, but Solomon was the Lord's anointed.
{226}
S.McC. The fruit of Samuel's ministry in Abigail is that she knows what to do and when to do it; and she has the means to do it, do you not think?
J.T. Yes, that is good. Many have means to do good but no thought. The sacrifice Hannah took up to the house of God showed she had means, and certainly Abigail had means; she made use of plenty of the right kind of means.
-- .R. What is your thought of means, does it refer to spiritual qualities?
J.T. Well, that is what Mr. McC. would have in mind.
A.N.W. You spoke of Solomon being anointed over against Adonijah; would the idea be akin to "Jehovah and ... his anointed" in @Psalm 2 as over against what is appointed by man?
J.T. Quite so.
J.W.D. Would this line of thought help in exercises in our localities as to spiritual leadership, the anointing being connected with kingliness?
J.T. Yes indeed. We have already mentioned "the shout of a king" and the thought is greatly enhanced by adding the anointing to it. What enters into that matter by contrast is what is becoming somewhat common in the world, to put up a leader that is replaceable by someone else, and Jotham's parable suggests that no one would accept such a position but a useless brother. He gives a list of the persons who refused the crown and then Abimelech. Jotham's brother, who had slain seventy of his brethren is symbolised in the thorn bush. That is the kind of man he was, he had nothing to leave, he was an idler. The others in the parable were well employed and each functioning in his own position as assigned to him by God. No one could yield sweetness like the fig, nor wine like the vine, and that is God's ordering; each is set to function profitably for God and man. Why should I leave a profitable
{227}
position like that? each one says; the only one that will do that is the thorn bush. So, as I was saying in regard of leadership, Gideon became a leader. He was very humble and disclaimed any power to deliver Israel, but God said, "Go in this thy might", @Judges 6: 14. He was like Agur in Proverbs who did not pretend to have any knowledge, but he did have knowledge. That is the kind of man needed; let him show his leadership by leading; a man is what he is, not what people make him.
-- .R. Is the thought of mutuality represented in the three who refused to reign?
J.T. They rather represent the thought of obligation to God; they had a right judgment of the fact that God had constituted them just as they were and that men were trying to take them out of that position and put them into another, and that is what is all around us. But what christianity calls for and exemplifies is that there are leaders who lead, they know what to do and they do not wait for the brethren to put them into the position.
S.McC. So in @2 Samuel 5 it says, "Even aforetime ... thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel". Even before he was king the leading was seen in David, before he was outwardly in the position.
J.T. That is good and what confirms that is Joshua. Moses says in @Numbers 27, "Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in". What is required is one who can move around among the brethren, that is the point, one personally known as to how he goes out and how he comes in. He is not a brother who stays out late at night and we do not know where he is; we know what he is doing and what his motives are and then how he leads the saints as God may
{228}
constitute him to lead, as it says, "who may lead them out, and who may bring them in". God said, We will take Joshua, he is a man with the Spirit and that is what is required. You cannot rightly say to a local brother, You take the lead today. Let God act, let a man show what he is.
L.E.S. Matthias, who filled the apostleship after Judas, had really come under the touch of the Lord in His coming in and going out.
J.T. He was experienced in that sort of thing, and all the apostles had that experience, no doubt.
S.McC. When leadership is on the arbitrary line the element of love is lacking. Of David it is said, "All Israel and Judah loved David", but that is never said of Saul.
A.N.W. The thought might be further seen in Moses words, "That the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd".
-- .A. Is there a point in the fact that Saul was anointed with a vial whereas David was anointed with a horn?
J.T. There is a point in that. As to anointing Saul, the circumstances were very peculiar because he had not proved himself to be one who could bring the people of God in and out. Party leaders might lead them out but not in, the idea is to bring them back.
L.E.S. Is the idea of leadership seen in relation to the houses of Chloe and Stephanas over against the official leadership of others, the spiritual instincts of their houses recognising and discerning what was in Corinth?
J.T. Yes, so that the house of such a leader would be crowned. Stephanas meaning 'crown'; they addicted themselves to the saints for ministry. That is a good point in a spiritual brother; he is not looking for a crown but he has it already, not the kind of crown the brethren can give him but one which he
{229}
has because a christian is crowned by the Lord and what could be better? So Paul says, "Ourselves your bondmen for Jesus sake", @2 Corinthians 4: 5.
-- .R. Referring again to Saul, when he was going to the man of God he had nothing to give him.
J.T. Which is very different from what we have just heard about Abigail who had plenty. She knew what to do and had the means but Saul had nothing and he did not even find the asses.
J.B. So Paul speaks of Stephanas as having supplied what was lacking on the part of the Corinthians.
J.T. That is good, they had something, "what I have, this give I to thee", @Acts 3: 6.
So Hannah affords a good start for us and then we come to David, as it has been remarked. Saul is anointed in chapter 10 and God shows that He did His best for him, but he failed. Something must be in the person himself and Saul failed very seriously, so that God anointed another in David; and, as has been remarked, Samuel had a vial to anoint Saul but for David he had a horn. When we come to Solomon it was a horn taken out of the tabernacle, showing that the character of the anointing is in mind in these cases.
Ques. Saul represents the man risen up against David, but I wonder if you had anything in mind in connection with the feminine side used in connection with the adversary of Hannah?
J.T. In Hannah's case there was a rival wife and it was a bitter experience; I suppose it would suggest the enemy endeavouring to hinder what was evident in her. Clearly she was a brave woman and the rivalry would enhance that and manifest it in her, so that in the end she succeeded, she triumphed! She said, "My mouth is opened wide over mine enemies; for I rejoice in thy salvation". No doubt the Spirit
{230}
of God would have us to understand that in the latter days there would be real enemies to the Messiah.
Rem. It almost seems as though the beauty and excellence of the work of God is accentuated and developed by adverse elements in opposition.
J.T. Hannah's contribution here to the service of God would have the last days in mind and it shows how she made the matter hers. There is no use in speaking of things abstractly; we must meet the situation. Abigail did that too, and David.
Ques. Is a good deal of the opposition today and the difficulty in localities feminine in character, risen up and directed against the collective side of the position? It is not an attack against Christ or Paul's doctrine, but it has an adverse effect upon the brethren, the meeting, and the assembly in the locality.
J.T. I am glad you brought that up, because it is said that Mr. Darby used to enquire when difficulties arose, "Who is she?" in connection with the source of the trouble.
-- .K. In Judges it says, "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes". It was a critical condition and did Hannah feel this?
J.T. Yes, that is it; Hannah is the deliverer, you might say, because Samuel is her fulness and she is the root of the matter; God is working through her. The devil is working through her adversary, another woman, but deliverance comes in through her and that is why she is so distinctive and triumphant in bringing in the anointed one. He is going to triumph, his horn will be lifted up. Let us keep to the idea of the anointing, not man's anointing but God's anointing, because man's anointing is sure to fall to the ground and disappear, but in God's anointing we see the idea of someone in whom He is working and there is triumph.
{231}
Rem. Verse 11 brings in the positive side of the position in the boy ministering to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest, as though her song rendered definite profitable results.
J.T. He was wonderful for he ministered although things were difficult, like David who later led the people out and brought them in. It is difficult to proceed when there are others there who have the official place.
-- .R. Does, that bring out that in a difficult day Hannah bridged the gap?
J.T. That is the idea in the book, it is the remarkable history of how deliverance comes. As we said previously, whatever the circumstances may be, the great principle of christianity is reigning in life, and thus Hannah triumphs, and so does Abigail, in difficulties. That is what this book indicates -- Hannah triumphing and David triumphing. Hannah had a rival woman in the house and Abigail had a churlish man; the man was a Calebite but that did not help; it was a question of what the man was in himself.
-- .T. Samuel was the result of great exercise in Hannah.
J.T. She asked for him and he was thus a child of prayer; then she lends him to the Lord, a remarkable word! She says, in effect, I know I shall get him back, get him back in a far better way than I expect.
-- .R. Speaking of feminine affection, it did not over-influence her when it came to caring for the boy because she gave him up.
J.T. It meant sacrifice, but we can afford to lend all our things to the Lord. We can give them, but to lend is to suggest that they will be returned, and we get a good return.
J.W.D. Do you think the quality of anointing connected with kingship suggests the Holy Spirit?
{232}
J.T. I think that is what is meant according to @Exodus 30; the ingredients there point to Christ and come out here below; we are anointed with the Spirit of Christ.
J.W.D. In service do the features of life and the anointing connect with the presence of a divine Person as seen in Christ Himself?
J.T. Quite so. So that when we consider the character of the anointing in Saul's case it shows that it was not the real oil, nor was it in other anointings such as that suggested in the trees wanting to have a king; but when the horn is mentioned, then the Spirit of God has in mind the death of Christ. It was not a vial, which is a glass material, but a horn, and it was taken out of the tabernacle to anoint Solomon. That order of things must go through. In chapter 16 Jehovah said to Samuel, "Fill thy horn with oil", fill it; it must have been in Samuel's mind that it was a vessel to be used.
L.E.S. Is there a link with Ephesians, "according to the power which works in us"?
J.T. Quite so; and Paul had a horn in @Acts 19, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" That is suggestive of the anointing, and woe if you do not have it! And so it was through him that it came and he would have in mind the idea of the tabernacle. What they received and what the gentiles received generally was the same as what was received at Pentecost, so we have the same power as they had. Similarly when Peter and John went down to Samaria the Samaritans got the Spirit through them; that is, God uses servants mediately so that the Spirit may be given and the persons thus anointed. James says, "Is any sick among you?" that is, one of us, "let him call to him the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord", but it is "the prayer of faith shall heal the sick". He has been ill
{233}
and not able to serve but if he is to be cured it is that he may continue in the testimony unimpaired. The elders have the oil, and they are of the assembly.
A.N.W. Would you confine the baptism of the Spirit entirely to the Lord Himself?
J.T. Well, He is the One that baptises. God gives the Spirit, Christ gives the Spirit, and also the Spirit acts Himself and comes on people; but the apostles at Jerusalem had power so that the Spirit was received through them; and in the same way those at Ephesus got the Spirit through Paul. It is very suggestive as showing us how we are brought into the anointing; we must not throw these things aside, they have a purpose.
Ques. Would you say that the apostle approached Corinth in the first nine verses of his epistle with his horn in his hand?
J.T. They were wonderfully enriched by God, there was nothing lacking in gift, but from the subjective side there was a great defect and so Paul begins almost at once with the Spirit. He reminds them of divisions among them and speaks in a remarkable way of the Spirit of God in the second chapter; he shows them that we have the mind of Christ and brings out what the anointing is in regard to intelligence.
S.McC. Do you think Samuel's personality would enter into this matter of "fill thy horn with oil", it being his horn?
J.T. Do you not think God is saying, 'You must wipe away your tears about Saul, do not mourn, we are going to lose that brother or sister but you cannot use the horn and go on with the tears'? He says to him, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him ... ?" God is not going to use a man like that and we must stop our groans; we are being occupied with one who has been usable, but is
{234}
not now. God says, I have rejected him and you cannot use the horn of oil with that mind and those tears.
Rem. The time to mourn is before Jehovah has rejected him.
J.T. Quite so, but now, Jehovah had definitely rejected him.
L.E.S. In Corinthians it says, "That the approved may become manifest among you", @1 Corinthians 11: 19.
J.T. Paul says, "When your obedience shall have been fulfilled", when you stop mourning for the persons God has rejected you will not be looking on things after the outward appearance. "His letters ... are weighty", these persons would say about Paul, but they would also say hard things about him, that his bodily presence was weak and his speech contemptible, and the Corinthians were listening to that; therefore he says, I do not want to deal with you but I will deal with those men "when your obedience shall have been fulfilled". So here Saul is really dealt with in principle but not yet actually and Samuel must stop mourning about it. Saul was right in chapter 14 but in chapter 15 he was wrong and at the end of chapter 15 it says, "Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned over Saul; and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel". Now He says to Samuel, You must stop mourning for Saul; it is a party feature to seek to carry on someone whom you have idolised and admired after God has rejected him; we must get someone else. Then God says, "Fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons". He did not even leave it to Samuel to determine which it was. He said, "I will tell thee". It was a matter of rejecting those of Jesse's sons who should not be king and God would say as each came forward, This one will not do. But Samuel thought
{235}
differently, showing how hard it is to get away from party leaders.
L.E.S. Paul said to the Corinthians, "Ye have reigned without us".
J.T. Here it was without Jehovah and with party leaders; so we come to verse 11, "And Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men?" The one who is to be king is "less than the least of all saints"; he is not aspiring to it but he is keeping the sheep. Jesse says, "There is yet the youngest remaining, and behold, he is feeding the sheep", a sort of sustaining touch. Joseph talked about the eleven bowing down to him and Jacob did not like it very well; Jacob was a spiritual man and so was Jesse but spiritual men get darkened in a matter like this; but Jesse mentioned the thing that qualified his youngest son, "he is feeding the sheep".
-- .A. Does David come in on the line of headship? It does not say he is caring for the sheep but "he is feeding the sheep".
J.T. Quite so, which implies considerable knowledge. What the sheep should have he is supplying, "And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither". The father is being brought into the current; it is well to see people come around to the right thing. Well, God had been watching David and He was now going to make him something, so Jesse brought him in and then the Spirit of God says, "He was ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he". There was no delay, the thing must be done at once, and it was done -- a most beautiful picture! It is fine to see such a one come up when the brethren have been in the dark. God Himself takes the matter in hand so that when the person He is going to use comes into presence there is no mistake about it, he is the one. It is the first mention we
{236}
have of David save as he is mentioned prophetically; but here he is, the beloved one!
A.B. So we do not have any mourning now. It says in @Isaiah 61: 3, in relation to the Lord, that He has given "the oil of joy instead of mourning".
J.T. We see how that enters into this; the scene is beautifully changed and we are told, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he". There is no doubt about it and his own person shows it.
U.O.G. It says, "Arise", so they must have sat down.
J.T. "Arise", quite so. They must have sat down but as he comes in he becomes the whole object and "Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren", not in a private room but "in the midst of his brethren".
-- .T. It was quite different from Saul's anointing.
J.T. Quite so. And now for the few minutes that remain we might look at the anointing of Elisha. There is no record that Elisha would actually anoint, but there are three persons mentioned to be anointed by Elijah and they are each anointed to do just one thing; it is not a general idea. It is said, "Jehovah said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, anoint Hazael king over Syria; and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint prophet in thy stead. And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay". That is what Jehovah said, so they are definitely anointed for judgment. Elisha's slaying would be of a different character from that of the others, and he does not himself anoint anyone; it was one of the sons of the prophets that anointed Jehu. Each of these men was anointed for a specific purpose but the prophet was especially in mind because he was to
{237}
take the place of the one spoken to and clearly there was to be moral quality with him. The prophet here is the main thought and so it is that he slays on that principle; that is his place.
Rem. The last verse you had read suggests the reminder from God to Elijah that the reason for this replacement was the state of soul in himself. Elijah having said, "I am left, I alone".
J.T. God had someone in his stead and that would be to correct Elijah. God accepted his resignation and He proceeds to give him a wonderful outgoing, saying, as it were, You anoint these three men and adjust matters on the earth, and I will give you a wonderful outgoing. We get in 2 Kings what Elisha really was and how he slew people; it was by raising from the dead and changing conditions, making barren places fruitful and so forth, showing that we have to pursue the meaning of these words about slaying and not take them at first sight; we must see what is meant.
Rem. Hannah says, "Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive".
J.T. Just so. Surely the Shunammite woman's son was made to die for a purpose, but he was made alive, for Elisha's ministry was one of grace not judgment.
-- .R. Would you speak of Elisha's ministry as being an evangelical ministry?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. What about the sword in his hand? How would that be reconciled in our minds as to the ministry of grace?
J.T. It bears on what Romans teaches: "If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink". A young brother was being taught by the clergy to take the sword and that @Romans 13 meant that that was the only thing to do; to be prepared was not murder, and to kill a man on
{238}
the battlefield was not murder. But the Lord said, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought". But they will not fight, the sword has to be put into its place. @Romans 13 says about the government, "It bears not the sword in vain; for it is God's minister, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil", but @Romans 12 says, "If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head". That would be worse than using the sword if you made it literal; but if it is grace, the enemy is to bow his head to grace and he can be your enemy no more.
U.O.G. The Lord's ministry goes still farther, "Love your enemies".
J.T. Quite so, I am speaking now of the effect of the thing and how Scripture turns things around to mean what they do not seem to mean on first sight, and it is so about this matter of the sword.
J.W.D. I think that is very interesting. I had not seen it that way, but really there could be no other way.
-- .T. The fact that grace reigns does not mean that looseness is allowed; righteousness should be maintained.
J.T. In Elisha's ministry of grace there is an exception in regard to the forty-two children, but it was the bears that killed them; Elisha did not.
-- .K. When the Syrians came into the camp of the king of Israel he would have slain them with the sword but Elisha said, Give them food.
T.U. Is that grace reigning through righteousness?
J.T. Just so.
J.B. In Luke it says, "Let him sell his garment and buy a sword" (chapter 22: 36). In Luke where grace shines out the Lord speaks of the sword.
{239}
J.T. That is to be understood on the same principle, it should not be taken literally. What does the Lord mean? He speaks in parables sometimes and parables often hide the truth, so that we must learn to understand; "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear". The ordinary man does not understand and that greatly enlarges the difficulties which we have to contend with. The men that our boys in the army have to meet are worldly men; they do not understand that he that has no sword does not need to buy one for protection; Peter took the sword and took off the ear of the priest's servant, but the Lord would say, That is not what I mean. The Lord meant that the two swords they had were adequate testimony to what He was saying and for the moment they were to be without protection. He says, Put that back into its place, you are misunderstanding what I said.
J.W.D. I suppose buying it would relate to ourselves in @Matthew 18; we take the sword in that sense in our care meetings; it brings life out of death.
J.T. Quite so, if one is seeking recovery.
A.B. In Luke the Lord is ministering in relation to the state of the disciples and they are exposed in the one taking the sword; we learn from that instance that they did not understand what the Lord had in mind.
J.T. It is like a little sign hung out, that the Lord is passing from one dispensation to another and we must understand what He is saying.
Ques. When He says, "It is enough", is it the result of disappointment on His side? In the ordinary sense two would not be enough.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord would say, Understand what I am saying about the sword.
G.W. The word of truth is really the sword. Does it involve the right use of the Scriptures?
{240}
J.T. That is what they had to learn, and Paul had to learn it too. A brother once said that when you come into the meeting you hang up your sword with your coat. That is a mistake because you may find an enemy inside. Do not hang it up with your coat, carry it along -- the sword of the Spirit.
A.B. "For the arms of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful according to God", @2 Corinthians 10: 4.

FEMININE FEATURES IN 1 SAMUEL (1)
@1 Samuel 1: 1 - 28
J.T. I have been thinking of 1 Samuel and the feminine teaching there, of sisters or women mentioned in that book, beginning with Hannah. It is thought that by the Lord's help this book will, in five readings, yield much to us in the sense of the assembly in character coming into view. This matter is what is in mind principally, not the abstract view of the assembly but the practical view. This will require that we look at the sections which speak of women, principally chapters 1 and 25, the latter treating of Abigail. The thought that will open up, I believe, will be that Abigail particularly is a product of the ministry current at that time; she appears as corresponding with David. The ministry is intended to develop correspondence with Christ in the saints, and this chapter will help us as to what is basic in relation to all this, and experience in suffering, peculiar suffering on Hannah's part. She answers the priest as we notice in verse 16: "Out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto", a remarkable presentation of experience!
J.W.D. Do you think there seems a suggestion of what you may call a spirit of inflation in this man? The official side as suggested in Elkanah seems to be marked by inflation. I was wondering whether the objective side was weak and poor.
J.T. The male side is certainly that. Elkanah, whilst he has a place in the Chronicles as being the father of Samuel, certainly has a good opinion of himself, and what he says of himself could not meet the exercises of Hannah.
Rem. You mean in what he said about being better than ten sons (verse 8)? He had a big opinion of himself, had he not?
{242}
J.T. Yes, according to the facts mentioned, he maintained a religious character. We are told, "And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh" (verse 3). Then we are told about the two sons of Eli being there; it is a sad picture that is immediately given, these bad men there in the house of God. And then the other wife, Peninnah, evidently a very provocative woman -- unreasonably so, as is usually the case where Satan is acting -- she provoked Hannah. It is a remarkable word used of her -- "her adversary" (verse 6), she was characteristically an adversary of such a worthy person. Why should she be that? It is unreasonable. It is said, "Her adversary provoked her much also, to make her fret" (verse 6). Hannah was under the discipline of God; it is discipline, because it is a question of spiritual education; but her adversary evidently knew that, which made it all the more serious for Peninnah, that she should be characteristically an adversary; she carried it out by provoking, and brought about the tears. Hannah "wept and did not eat", it says. Her husband, who may be regarded as a brother that would speak platitudes, did not touch the real issue, especially in bringing himself forward -- a very nauseous sort of thing. It was as far from relief as it could be, telling her he was better to her than ten sons! She would be a better judge of that than he.
Rem. I see the meaning of this word 'adversary' is well given in the footnote to @Psalm 8: 2: 'the'adversary'of Christ, or'oppressor'of the remnant, from within'.
J.T. That is important. There are two words in that psalm, the inward enemy and the outward. Peninnah represents the inward; she is very near to us in daily life. She was not just like Rachel and Leah, they were natural sisters; these are not natural
{243}
sisters, so that the provocation is all the keener. I suppose it may point to the Jewish remnant in the future, but we find experiences of this kind constantly in those who are in the fellowship and near us, and it may be in our houses, too, for "A man's enemies are the men of his own household", @Micah 7: 6. It is a making process for us, and it certainly was for Hannah, because she not only reaches her goal -- I mean she got a son -- but she contributes to the house of God as in chapter 2.
G.A.T. Is it your thought that this spirit may be found amongst us today?
J.T. It is to be found amongst the brethren all along, throughout the history of the assembly, I was thinking of what Paul experienced in Corinth from the men there who perhaps got light through him: "Because his letters, he says, are weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught", @2 Corinthians 10: 10; that is the sort of thing.
Ques. I was wondering whether this Elkanah was something like the brethren at Corinth, divided in affections.
J.T. No matter what subject you touch on, Corinth will help you as to fact. The apostle suffered keenly from those who were there. They were the fruits of his own labours but yet his enemies.
Rem. They were much taken up by what was outward, but very little on the inward side.
J.T. Quite so.
E.G.McA. Did you suggest that Elkanah would represent the natural, and Peninnah the adversary, as against what is spiritual, to interfere with God's thought in bringing in the son? I mean interfering with the spiritual element in the meeting producing what answers to this.
J.T. That is how it stands. Elkanah evidently loved Hannah, but was beside the mark in what he had to say and in his whole outlook. Any anxiety
{244}
she had would be just an incident in his mind, and he would think to make it up to her by what he was. That is a poor thing. He could not modify her sorrows, but he thought he could. It is like brothers or sisters saying, Well, let us have love one for another. That is just a matter of platitudes, instead of reaching the root of the thing and seeing what is causing these tears.
Rem. But in the midst of all this Hannah is true to her name, which means 'grace'.
J.T. There would be no unseemly circumstances between herself and Peninnah; she would suffer.
G.A.T. Would you say that Hannah did not think Elkanah was better to her than ten sons?
J.T. She did not. If he was seeking for compliments, he did not get any!
J.W.D. Why do you think she was under the government of God? Was it for the end that was to be produced spiritually?
J.T. I would think so; it is the way God reaches His ends. Why should this be? It is a very extraordinary situation. This other wife is so unreasonable; she has all the advantage in that she has a family. Why should she be so unreasonable? Why should she be characteristically an adversary? It seems it does not happen without God. If we take the general situation of the world today, it is no accident, it has not happened without God. That is the way to get at it -- what God is aiming at in it. He is aiming at something in this woman that is going to make her a leading sister. This is how God reaches His end with us, and how we reach His end too. She came to very much more, I would say, than she had expected; God did far exceedingly above all that she asked or thought, because, as we are told in the next chapter, Hannah prayed, but there is not a word said here about prayer. She is greater than she thought she was; God made her that.
{245}
S.McC. Do you not think that in our meetings and the position generally, the element that Elkanah suggests, which would sap the strength of the position, is not so easily discerned as the provocative side in Peninnah? The self-complacency of an Elkanah that goes on in routine fashion to the meetings and the like is not so readily discerned as the Peninnah side.
J.T. This seemed to be just a passing incident, but Elkanah would bring himself forward, which is a poor thing. A brother might say, Well, we are getting along pretty well here, and why not fall in with what is going on? He is missing the real position; there is something wrong and he is not discerning it.
J.H. Do we trace this abundance of grief and provocation to what she received at the hands of Peninnah, or as connected with the saints and feeling the state of the priesthood?
J.T. I think it is part of the general position, because Hannah and Peninnah are mentioned in verse 3. That is an element of the position from which she is suffering, but Eli's contact with her is another element which she had to deal with. She is suffering from the whole position, but particularly from this person who is called "her adversary". She is the one the enemy is using.
J.H. It is clear she has in mind gain for the house of God.
J.T. That is the point to get at. She has Samuel in mind, and then she herself is a producer for the house of God in chapter 2, as we shall see. This is a basic chapter in regard of God's ways in those whom He would use; we all need to go through similar experiences. The enemy finds those he can use to attack at close quarters.
C.C.T. In order to be contributors to the assembly, do we have to pass through this experience of weeping and not eating?
{246}
J.T. It is to bring us into correspondence with Christ; that is the aim of all discipline. So that the assembly in Revelation is said to be the Lamb's wife; that is the moral side; she is in correspondence with the Lord in suffering. She has the bride's place, but she has been in the wifely condition of suffering through all the centuries.
S.McC. "Now these are the generations of Pherez", @Ruth 4: 18. Do you think Hannah is morally of that generation, on the line of breaking through?
J.T. She goes through, quite so, like Pherez; that is what his name signifies, the power to go through things; like the three mighty men of David who broke through the camp of the Philistines and got what was needed for David. It is a question of laying ourselves out for going through. Hannah carries this out, but in the spirit of grace, for that is what her name means. "The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ", it is a Philippian requirement (chapter 1: 19).
Ques. Would you say this is the Spirit of the Lord coming out in her?
J.T. That is right. It is the Spirit of Christ in a feminine sense. It is remarkable how much you get of that here and in Luke; it is a similar state of things in Luke.
Rem. Would "the mind of the Spirit" be brought before us here? I was thinking of @Romans 8: 27: "But he who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit". Would that be seen in Hannah?
J.T. Quite so, she is a vessel of the Spirit; that is what she is. She knows the position exactly, and the word 'prayer' covers the chapter -- a person knowing how to pray without speaking; "her lips moved", the body principle is brought into it. The Lord is the Saviour of the body, which means the physical body. She was not praying in her heart like Abraham's servant, but "her lips moved". That is,
{247}
the physical body is available to the position so that there was testimony to her prayer, but it was mistaken by the priest. She was a real priest and he thought she was drunken. He should have been able to discern a real priest, but he thought she was drunken, as also the mockers did at Jerusalem. It is the same sort of thing.
Rem. Then she clothes the boy with the proper name, Samuel.
J.T. Quite so. Prayer is the point; her prayer is really in the first chapter, but the second is her song: "And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exulteth in Jehovah", chapter 2: 1. It is hardly prayer, but praise. The first chapter is the praying chapter really, and moral glory was in the prayer. Her lips moved; the body was brought into it and observed by a priest, but he did not understand it; he could not tell the lips of a priest. The lips of the priest are spoken of as keeping knowledge; he did not have the knowledge. Still, he could be adjusted, and God honoured him too in a way.
S.McC. It is not altogether the hidden side in Hannah, your allusion to the lips is important; that would mean outward expression.
J.T. That might be connected with @Luke 8: the woman who touched the Lord's garment had nothing to say; she did not tell the Lord, she touched the Lord's garment and virtue went out from Him to her, but she did not acknowledge it. She ought to have fallen down and given thanks to God; that is what Luke brings out, the result of the work is to bring about priestly conditions. But she did not come forward; she did not answer fully to that. But then the Lord Jesus asks, "Who has touched me?" and she told Him all the truth, and He called her 'daughter', giving her a place in the family. @Luke 8 suggests the idea of virtue, the virtue that went out of Him; I think the idea of virtue is how the body is formed.
{248}
Here it is a priestly matter; the priestly idea runs through; *she* is the real priest in this chapter, and her body is brought into it, as Malachi says, "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge", @Malachi 2: 7. Her lips were employed and the professing priest did not understand; he did not discern a real priest, neither did her husband.
J.S. Does it indicate that our prayers should rise out of the circumstances through which we are practically passing?
J.T. If you were to visit all the prayer meetings throughout the world you would find we are praying about the same thing. The pressure upon us is producing the prayer, and that is Hannah's case. "Think the same thing" -- that is unity. That does not show on our lips, but what she was thinking of was shown on her lips; the priestly state was there in her body.
J.W.D. You are not speaking now of utterance. How are you looking at the lips?
J.T. It is the body brought into it.
J.W.D. What is discernible in me, in my actual movements in relation to the testimony?
J.T. That is the important thing; to discern one another according to our priestly qualities.
J.W.D. Not what we say.
J.T. No; it is not in what we say, but still the body is brought into it. We can only discern each other in looking at each other and seeing what is there. Paul looked at the man in Lystra and saw that he had faith; that is discerning what is there. It is an important thing to know the brethren, and to discern the priestly qualities that are there.
Ques. "Pouring out her soul before Jehovah" (verse 15), was that an outward expression?
J.T. That is what she says, "And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; (now Eli the priest sat upon the seat by the
{249}
doorpost of the temple of Jehovah;)" (verse 9). This is another side-light of the general position. There never was supposed to be a seat in the tabernacle; no seat is mentioned as it was to be built, but he had one, and beds were there too, in his day, showing the general position. And then it says in verse 10, "and she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept much". What a sight this must have been for Jehovah! But what is the priest's judgment, Eli's judgment? It says in verses 11 to 16, "And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. And it came to pass as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth. Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved", very beautiful, I think, because God is giving an outward testimony to what is going on inwardly. "But her voice was not heard; and Eli thought she was drunken. And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before Jehovah. Take not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto". Well, that is beautiful. It is the expression of the body, what our bodies are to be. The full expression requires the voice, the throat, and the lungs; but it is the heart here -- that is, the inward state of things, and the lips expressing that her body is in the thing. That brings out what we are, because how can we tell what each one is except through what comes out in our bodies? The Lord is the Saviour of the body
{250}
because it is so essential; the bodies of the saints are essential to the expression of Christ.
Ques. Would you say that is part of the fellowship?
J.T. It is the outward position we are in; we are brought into the fellowship, and it means we are bound up together, partners one of another. In @Luke 4 Peter's wife's mother is brought before us, and she had a fever; the Lord rebuked the fever and she rose up and served them. That is the expression of the thing, what she did; and then the fellowship comes in in the next chapter. There are two words mentioned, showing what goes on outwardly, how we know one another.
Rem. In her prayer to Jehovah does Hannah really commit her whole exercise to God? She prays for a man child. She does not pray that her enemies might be disposed of, but that God would come in and clear up the situation.
J.T. There will be plenty of displacement in the book; it is full of it. But she is not looking for displacement, she is looking for a positive new thing -- a child asked of Jehovah. It is not to displace Peninnah's children, but to bring in what will be useful in the house of God, so that Samuel prevails until "all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that he was established a prophet of Jehovah", @1 Samuel 3: 20.
Rem. She was not just satisfied with praying to God in regard to the matter, but the exercise went to the extent of her committing her son to God as the One by whom the situation might be changed. Sometimes we go a certain distance in expressing fellowship, but how much committal do we have after that to see that the thing is carried out?
J.T. Yes; she loans her son. She does not say 'give', meaning she would have a lien on him. She has a lien on her son, and God admits that fully;
{251}
she brings up a little coat every year. But Samuel prevails; that is "the fulness of him who fills all in all", @Ephesians 1: 23. That is the one idea in the book.
Rem. Her responsibility does not cease; she continues to carry her responsibility.
J.T. She came up every year to him with a little coat.
Rem. Why does Hannah speak of a "man child" (verse 11)? Why not a son?
J.T. She is stressing the word 'man'. The most remarkable allusion to that is in @Revelation 12: 5 where the Lord Jesus is said to be a "male son". Why should the word 'male' be used? It is to stress the male side, but it is sonship in Revelation; Hannah does not go so far as this.
J.W.D. She says "no razor" (verse 11); she must have had a very strong secret link with the place a nazarite would have in that position.
J.T. "No razor" would follow out the male side; the removal of the beard and the cutting off of the hair is stressing the male side.
Rem. Do you think she had the whole exercise in mind in speaking of "Jehovah of hosts" in her prayer?
J.T. She had big thoughts, "Jehovah of hosts" is a big thought about God; and the offering she brings up when she brought her son follows that up. It says, "And she took him up with her when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah to Shiloh" (verse 24). She had big thoughts, three bullocks. She would be noticeable by whoever looked after the bullocks and cared for her; it would be a big matter. Where is she going? She has the infant, but he is weaned; the link is gone between him and her in this special sense. But she is going to maintain her link with him in the house of God, and in order to do that she brings big things
{252}
with her, stimulating things, which would make an impression there. So Phoebe too made an impression in the house of God; Paul uses a word in regard of her that indicates she was a patron. She was not an ordinary person helping the saints; she did it in a big way for she evidently brought the letter to Rome. I like that -- a sister making an impression in the house of God -- three bullocks, an ephah of flour and a bottle of wine! And the little babe was there; he was not morally a babe; he was weaned, "a weaned child with its mother", it says in @Psalm 131: 2; Samuel is just that; that is what she brought to the house of God.
Rem. She lent him to the Lord; as you say, she had a lien on him, she says, "No razor", and the child is weaned, and she brings three bullocks. Does she look on to the completion of her exercises in bringing in this mighty man, Samuel? She sees the end of things.
J.T. That is it. A babe will never do in the house of God, amongst the saints, but it is the end she has in mind; she is viewing the thing abstractly, what it is going to be, and that is what the Lord sees. He sees us as we are according to His own formation in us; He sees the end from the beginning.
Rem. God brings us through exercises, and if the result is not something for the house of God the exercise is of no avail.
J.T. No; you want to carry out the vow, "When thou vowest a vow to Jehovah thy God, thou shalt not delay to perform it", @Deuteronomy 23: 21. She made a vow and she is going to carry it through in a big way. It is to fully materialise and it did, for Samuel filled the whole scene.
Rem. The start must be by a vow, as we have an impression.
J.T. Our great forefather Jacob began with a vow at Bethel; he would give God a tenth of all he had.
{253}
Rem. There already were children of Peninnah and the sons of Eli, but the exercise with Hannah seems to be that there should be one of quality.
J.T. That is it. Chronicles does speak about the sons of Peninnah, but Samuel is the outstanding son of Elkanah; the sons of Peninnah and Eli are not much. These are the basic thoughts negatively; Samuel is going to fill the scene.
J.F. Would it be first the natural and then the spiritual?
J.T. That is what comes out in this book.
Rem. In the early part of this meeting you connected Hannah's prayer with the meeting for prayer all over the world -- that we pray for the same things; and I wondered if these things that Hannah brings up would show she would have the end in view positively in her soul? The bottle of wine would have some indication of joy for God in it.
J.T. Yes, indeed. It is a stimulating thing in the way of producing joy. One bullock is a large thought, but three is full testimony to largeness, and the ephah of flour is perfect humility in that largeness. Elkanah did not have the flour. He applies the idea of ten to himself (verse 8). The ephah is one idea, it is humility according to God. That enters into the whole position.
Ques. Would it go as far as @Ephesians 3: 21: "To him be glory"?
J.T. Quite so; "until we all arrive ... at the full-grown man", @Ephesians 4: 13. Hannah had that in mind; this little boy must not remain a little boy, she makes a bigger coat every year. There is no evidence that she went up to measure him before she made it; the *man* was in her mind, and the ephah of flour would mean that; it is humility of that kind.
S.McC. In verse 22 she says to her husband, "I will wait until the child is weaned; then will I bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah". It is a
{254}
very exalted thought that she has in her mind at the beginning; not 'that I may present him', but 'that he may appear' -- one of the great thoughts in the Old Testament.
J.T. Quite so; it is a question of what he is going to be; I think she had big thoughts. For the moment they are largely potential, and the little coat every year would indicate how the potential idea was materialising.
S.McC. Do you not think in practical difficulties in our localities one of the great things is this matter of having big thoughts and recognising what is potential, and then moving in relation to it and in relation to God?
J.T. Looking for potentiality becoming actuality -- that is what is meant. You can see how her mind would be trained to the idea of increasing largeness in the boy, and the Spirit of God pays great attention to that. He grew and ultimately he filled the land: "the fulness of him who fills all in all", @Ephesians 1: 23.
Rem. This kind of thing would give great stimulus in a locality, the great thoughts that filled her mind and heart; and so she was spiritually in advance of her day.
J.T. She is the leader in the book; she is leading here spiritually. No doubt myriads of God's people from that time to now have gained through her in this principle of suffering and prayer and the great thoughts connected with them, and in looking for these thoughts to materialise; as Ephesians says, ministry is that we might "all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man" (chapter 4: 13). That enters into this book.
J.W.D. She seems to be able to draw Elkanah into the thing to a certain extent, because these three bullocks and the ephah of flour and the wine could
{255}
hardly have been brought in if he had been antagonistic. Do you not think spirituality of this kind would draw all into the current of the thing in the meeting?
J.T. That is how it works out. There are brothers who are old and they keep outward order with what brethren believe; the standard of brethren, they carry on; Eli represents that in a way, and Elkanah more so. He was a sort of man who worshipped at the usual time of the year, and the point now is whether you can carry such with you if God is going to move in the meeting, because these men are really not moving with God. They are content with present circumstances, as if they were all right, when they are all wrong. But God is coming in; that is the point, and He has a vessel. Her lips indicate she is a vessel; like the woman of Samaria, she left the water-pot. God has a vessel; He must have a vessel, and the vessel implies the body as well as the mind.
Rem. So she is able to say, "For this boy I prayed; and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him" (verse 27). She is able to present the result of her exercises.
J.T. Jehovah is mentioned from her point of view, and the thing to see is that God is coming in in this son who is pleasing to Him, and that He has found a vessel in her that He can employ. She is a suffering vessel, she calls herself that, and she is the leader. She is leading in the position; she is bringing in a Samuel and a David. That is the way the book opens up, expansion in what is right, and what is not right is set aside, that is, what is going on with the routine side of things and not discerning the spiritual side at all. We may have our regular meetings and everything in order and not be exercised about the spiritual, or what is going to be for God at all perhaps. Neither Elkanah nor Eli had any thought about what God was going to do. Eli was seated by
{256}
a doorpost of the temple; things are pretty good, he would tell you. He would tell you about the bright side; he would not tell you about Hophni and Phinehas, although it is to his credit that he rebukes them, but the result did not reach anywhere. It is to Samuel God opened up His mind; that is remarkable, that God has vessels He is using; and we shall see how these self-complacent persons are set aside for the real vessel whom God has discerned and has now in His hand.
Rem. There is a time when she is not able to eat, and then there is a time when she does eat, and then there is a time when she is able to present something.
J.T. You can see she is a real person, her lips moved in prayer, her heart is affected and she has her offering.
Rem. Would the three bullocks suggest the joy produced in @Luke 15, really for the Godhead?
J.T. That is good; quite so. In one sense that is the greatest chapter in Scripture, because it is a question of God in grace; it is christianity; it is the Trinity in unity in grace. Everything is there: "Let us eat and make merry", @Luke 15: 23. And the reason is given for it.
Rem. Would these three bullocks indicate that Hannah had in mind that God was going out beyond the confines of Israel, taking in the universal thought? It says in verse 10 of chapter 2: "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth".
J.T. It is a full thought in sacrifice. One bullock is a big thought, too; but she has three.
Rem. I was thinking of that in Leviticus; one bullock was a great offering.
J.T. Yes.
S.McC. What do you understand by what is said after that, "And they slaughtered the bullock" (verse 25)?
{257}
J.T. That is the idea; it is *the* bullock, not the bullocks. We have the plural thought which precedes the singular; the plural thought is the bullocks, but the article is the thing, the kind of thing, whether it be one or three. It is the kind of thing, I suppose all these things are for our minds; God works in our minds to make men out of us.
Rem. I would like a little more on that. You say three implies the plural and one the thing? How does that apply practically?
J.T. One bullock is a big idea; three is the completion of that. Three is usually the full thought of a thing in testimony to what it is, but the thing itself is represented in one. You do not need to get a herd of bullocks. God brought a bullock before Adam to be named; He did not bring a herd; He brought one. He brought a woman before him. One represents the thing.
Ques. Would the other two represent the support and continuance of the exercise?
J.T. I think the meaning would be the increase of the idea; the idea is abstract, and the increase of the idea is that the thing reaches out universally. How large her thoughts are! Here you get the concrete thing that she brings, and the bottle of wine is clearly the joy that cheers the heart of God and man. It is a figure of a thing that cheers God. We have to understand God to know what would cheer Him.
S.McC. Would the three bullocks suggest more the objective side, the greatness of the idea of the bullock in her mind; but the ephah of flour and the flask of wine is the balance on the feeling side on her part?
J.T. Yes; and then the idea of the *thing* -- the three different things. The bottle of wine would be as good as a barrel in what it suggests. She was thinking for God. The ephah of flour is the one Man, the one Man Jesus Christ, "For I have espoused you
{258}
unto one man", @2 Corinthians 11: 2. If you had a million ephahs it would be no different, it is the same idea; one expresses the thought.
J.W.D. It would have the character of a peace offering according to Numbers, "And when thou offerest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice for the performance of a vow, or for a peace-offering to Jehovah" (chapter 15: 8), and then it specifies what it is.
J.T. That is just the chapter that covers what we are talking about.
J.W.D. She had not only the burnt-offering in her mind but the expansive idea of the peace-offering.
J.T. The performance of the vow comes out here.
J.W.D. The extension of that influence in a wholly spiritual way.
J.T. You feel you are in the presence of priestly grace now. Your mind is gradually drawn away from Elkanah and Peninnah and her family, and from Hophni and Phinehas and Eli, to this one great thought of what answers to God's mind. God is coming into this thing now; He has pleasure in the scene.
Rem. Does Paul in going through his experiences in the Roman epistle eventually rise to the greatness of God in His thoughts, and give glory to God in that connection?
J.T. Do you mean in chapter 11?
Rem. Yes, verse 33: "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor? or who has first given to him, and it shall be rendered to him? For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen".
J.T. What an end to be reached! It is one of the great doxologies of the epistles. That is, you might
{259}
say, the principal thought, and that is what comes in here. You have the basis for a doxology, and the second chapter is pretty much that sort of thing; we will come to that later. Romans is very rich, basically rich, so that we go on to Ephesians directly from it. You do not necessarily need Corinthians or Galatians if you are normal. It is from Romans to Ephesians.
S.McC. The flask of wine is a very special thought in the book of Samuel. Hannah had it, the men going up to Bethel had it; David had it, and Abigail had it; whereas Saul never had it. He has a cruse of water.
Rem. Would you say why all this takes place in Samaria? It is not Zion or Jerusalem.
J.T. It is on the way; it is a provisional setting. Divine ways are in view in the book, what David will do. You feel the position widening out to completion. Of course the Old Testament never brings in completion, but you have the thought of it here, "the fulness of him who fills all in all". David touches on that in @1 Chronicles 29 where God is Head to him, where they made Solomon king a second time (verses  11, 22).
Rem. Would you say that in the second chapter there is a scene where God completes the exercise, "Hannah ... bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah" (chapter 2: 21)?
J.T. She has a family from God really -- a great stimulus to us on the feminine side. You can see from the very outset how God uses that side. From that side you get expansion. So that to Adam the word was, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it", @Genesis 1: 28. There are great expansive thoughts, but subjugation as well.
Ques. Would you say why God allowed such a person as this woman to go through such deep sorrow and exercise?
{260}
J.T. It is to bring us into accord with Christ. We are never much in the testimony until we go through sufferings, and God designs the sufferings for us; they would hardly be effective otherwise. You can see this whole matter was designed by God.
Ques. Is it because I have been going on with something that is contrary to the mind of the Spirit before this?
J.T. Not necessarily; God takes one up. In @Jeremiah 18 it says God made a vessel and it was spoiled, and then He makes one that pleased Him. That is what He is doing with Hannah; it does not seem that she was spoiled; there was no wickedness with her like Mary Magdalene; Hannah does not represent that.
Ques. Did God have this thought in His mind when He says in @John 9: 3, "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents"?
J.T. Quite so, and yet the man is blind. It is God operating from His own point of view to accomplish His ends. You cannot say there is anything wrong with Hannah. If Job's three friends were there, they would say, Hannah, there is something wrong with you; but there is nothing of the kind. It is God taking up this vessel and fitting her for a certain purpose. The assembly is made like Christ in suffering, the Lamb's wife.
Rem. I think that is splendid, because the Scripture says in verse 5, "But Jehovah had shut up her womb. And her adversary provoked her much also, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb". That would show that God was not her adversary in shutting up her womb; it was for His own purpose.
J.T. It is remarkable how this same thing comes out in others such as Sarah and Rebecca. God touches us in the place where we feel things most.
{261}
Rem. Does it not seem that Hannah had more faith than Sarah? Sarah did not believe, but Hannah had faith.
J.T. Clearly she had; the discrepancies are all outside of Hannah; there is nothing against her at all.
Rem. Do we not see by verse 23 that there was some movement in Elkanah? He did not annul her vow according to Numbers.
J.T. No, he is a fairly good brother, but he is not the brother God can use; he is not able for the moment, but still he is brought into line. We do not want to lose anyone; he is clearly a man that can be adjusted, and even Eli -- there is something about him too that is praiseworthy.
Rem. Eli is greatly moved at the end of the chapter by what Hannah says when she brings her offering.
J.T. It would look as if he worshipped. I think it is very beautiful that she goes to the trouble of explaining to Eli the whole matter. She might have said, You ought to have known better, but she does not. She is a suitable sister. She says to him (she is a good deal like Sarah -- she calls him, 'lord'), "Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman, that stood by thee here to pray to Jehovah. For this boy I prayed; and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him. And also I have lent him to Jehovah, all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah" (verses  26 - 28). She will never get him back, but then she is getting him back all the time. That is the idea of the great institution she is brought into. She will never lose part with Samuel; that is what we have in the community. Then it says, "And he worshipped Jehovah there". That would mean she is helping the elder brethren Elkanah and Eli.
Rem. Is the 'he' Eli?
{262}
J.T. I think so; it is to bring out the power of a priest -- the power of a sister with the brethren as she is with God; it is very beautiful. She is saying, Here is the boy; I am carrying out my vow, not only has my prayer been heard, but I am carrying out my vow.
Rem. What is represented officially in Eli is seen in moral expression in Hannah.
J.T. Real priestly power.
Ques. What was her thought in telling Eli that she was the one that stood beside him?
J.T. He ought to have known the whole matter, but she influences him, and he is capable of being influenced in the right direction, which is a great matter. So that we do not lose the brethren; the fact that they are not thoroughly in the thing we are going on with is no reason why they should be excluded from fellowship, unless there is something against them. She said, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit, but now here are the results. It shows what she accomplished in bringing about a worshipper.
Rem. She speaks very definitely. It says, "And she brought the boy". That is not lost sight of until we get to chapter 4.
J.T. There is the idea of growth. An infant is not a boy. Luke calls the children that were brought to Jesus infants, but Matthew calls them children; an infant is a child in the beginning of its history. The Lord takes them on according to Luke. But Hannah observed that Samuel had grown a bit; just like the Lord Jesus, the boy grew. Every mother is taken up with her infant, and when he begins to walk and talk he becomes more interesting.
Ques. What is your thought about the weaning?
J.T. Weaning is disunion from the natural, but not necessarily from the mother, because we were remarking that @Psalm 131 refers to a weaned child with its mother. We do not forsake the assembly.
{263}
We are brought up as infants, and nursed for a while, but when we are weaned we do not say we are independent of the brethren; we do not give up the brethren. Not even a Paul would be independent of the brethren.
Rem. He "took courage" when he saw them.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. But he is able to stand by himself.
J.T. That is the idea; you are able to stand by yourself if necessary.
Rem. While he stood by himself, he says in two or three places: "Pray for us".
J.T. Quite so, there always was a brother with him when he wrote, "All the brethren", he says to the Galatians; that is a great matter.
Rem. The maternal thought should go through. Moses mother never lost contact with him even while he was in the court; and then when he was grown he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
J.T. The early influences are all there. The children come back to them if they are rightly brought up, however far they may go.
S.McC. Do you think there is a suggestion in @Romans 9 of displacement in Paul? He says, "I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart" (verse 2), and he has in mind the greatness of God's thoughts: "of whom, as according to flesh, is the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen" (verse 5). He had in mind the One coming in and filling the whole scene.
J.T. Very beautiful. He had uninterrupted pain in his heart; that was the secret of his going to Jerusalem, it was because he loved Israel that he went.
Ques. What is on your mind that we should get out of this reading?
{264}
J.T. Oh, it is the suffering side, the praying side, the feminine side in all these matters, so that God has a vessel to carry on with, and the official class are displaced by what is better; not that they are proved guilty of anything, but there is something better. Samuel fills the scene. What we shall have this afternoon will be chapters 2 and 4, with the wife of one of these sons of Eli in chapter 4; and then later in chapter 9 the young women that met Saul and directed him to Samuel; and then the women who celebrated David in song; and we may touch, perhaps, on Merab and Michal; and then Abigail. That is the line, as the Lord directs, which we may follow. Abigail is, you might say, the full balance of Hannah.
{265}
FEMININE FEATURES IN 1 SAMUEL (2)
@1 Samuel 2: 1 - 21; @1 Samuel 3: 19 - 21
J.T. The first ten verses of chapter 2 represent a point reached in the field of testimony. We have referred to the discipline through which Hannah passed, and the incoming of Samuel, but now we get the spiritual product, it is a contribution; these verses 1 to 10, are a contribution to the service of God, and they stand as a point reached to be observed henceforth. The Scriptures contemplate the products of exercise, which are usually introduced by the conjunction 'and' throughout Scripture, especially in the early books, so that this is entitled, "And Hannah prayed, and said". It is a sort of heading such as we have in @Acts 16: Paul and Silas "in praying were praising", it says (verse 25). This is not a prayer really, or if it is, it is more in the attitude of her heart than in her words; it would be observed, I think, in all the history of the testimony that there are such products as this which stand out as landmarks. So that during our own times, extending back for over one hundred years, we have had products from exercises that were experienced by the people of God, such, for instance, as the house, the truth of God's house is outstanding -- the product of the Bethesda sorrow. We have had the outstanding truth of eternal life after another sorrow, another conflict. Then following on that we have had the truth attached to the local setting of the assembly and much ministry under that head, and other things, such as the sonship of the Lord Jesus.
Hannah's contribution here corresponds, and we can see how outstanding it is and distinct from what she had been through, although it is the product of what she had been through in measure; but still it is a prophetic utterance. The great prophet had potentially already come in, but she is a prophetess
{266}
herself, though this is the only contribution we have from her. The same applies to the Lord's mother; she had a similar product of her exercises in @Luke 1: 46 - 55. I think it will help us to keep this in mind in what is seen here, so that Hannah begins by saying, "My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth is opened wide over mine enemies; for I rejoice in thy salvation" (verse 1). It is clearly a poetic as well as a prophetic utterance or contribution, and it finishes with the word 'Christ' really, that is, the "anointed"; the end of verse 10 says, "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed". You can see clearly that Christ is in mind, the coming in of the Lord Jesus.
Ques. Would you say it takes on the characteristics of a psalm?
J.T. It is more a celebration really, although it must be a psalm because she had the experience, "My heart", she says -- she is now speaking of herself, her own experience -- "My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth is opened wide over mine enemies ...".
Ques. Would it be like @Psalm 45: l, "I say what I have composed touching the king"?
J.T. That is the principle of it. The psalmists usually have experiences; they begin with that, but they go beyond their own experience. That is, the Holy Spirit carries us along far beyond anything that we have experienced, as we shall see in this inquiry, and in that particular psalm too. @Psalm 45 is one of the maschil psalms; it is a teaching psalm; this is similar. So that we have, "There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee, neither is there any rock like our God". She is speaking to God; she has been speaking of Him, now she is speaking to Him, "For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. The bow of
{267}
the mighty is broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are so no more, even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up". That is the resurrection of course, "Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up, he raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, to set him among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; for the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them" (verses  3 - 8). So that whilst it is what she experienced to start with, it widens out universally.
J.H. Would @1 Corinthians 14 be in line with this, as to what you said about prayer in this prophetic utterance? "I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding", @1 Corinthians 14: 15.
J.T. Yes, just so; it must be in the attitude of our hearts. It seems to me the richness that is there must have been in her heart, or the Spirit would not call it praise. It is to bring out the richness that was there; she goes far beyond need; she is celebrating.
Ques. Do you think our experiences form a basis for that?
J.T. Yes; you begin with experience, and that gives you a certain amount of authority. If you have had no experience, you have no authority in speaking to the people of God. The brethren know you have not, but experience affords authority, and that gives you a spring-board by which you can launch out, as the Holy Spirit enables you, to vastness -- to infinitude you might say, because she speaks here of the balance of the earth; she says at the end of verse 8, "For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them"; that is an immense thought!
{268}
S.McC. In @Isaiah 33 the word to the remnant as regards God is, "He shall be the stability of thy times", verse 6. Do you think there is an allusion to the inward stability in God in Hannah's word, "Neither is there any rock like our God"? Whatever may have marked Elkanah or Eli and Eli's sons, she was fixed inwardly in relation to God.
J.T. Yes, quite so. She begins with the word, 'rock', that is in verse 2, "Neither is there any rock like our God". That is a good point in ministry, a good contribution; it means we are on sure footing, on sure ground in what we say.
S.McC. It is very interesting that 1 Samuel should thus begin with the allusion to God as a Rock by a woman, and the second book, chapter 22, should end with a song to Jehovah as a Rock by David.
J.T. Just so, he widens out the experience; chapter 22 of 2 Samuel is a good link because it leads us into the book of Psalms. It is called a psalm there, and it is a psalm in the book of Psalms, @Psalm 18. It is very beautiful! David says, "I will love thee, O Jehovah" (verse 1). Not only had he composed the psalm triumphing in God, but he prefaces it in putting it into the book of Psalms by his love for God, which gives him increased authority in writing.
J.W. What do we understand by the horn?
J.T. Oh, just power, it is a symbol of power, meaning that she has power now. She is not a weeping woman now; she is not in dread of her "adversary" as she calls her. She is not a weeping, overcome person; she is a victor, and she attributes it to God. "My horn is lifted up in Jehovah", meaning it is in the power of Jehovah.
J.W.D. Do you think a great many features that come to light here are not enjoyed spiritually during this dreadful situation of things? God can lead this woman that represents subjective formation into the fulness of these thoughts.
{269}
J.T. She is one of the psalmists really; this is the great spiritual product that results from what is recorded in chapter 1, that is, God is getting His part. He has His book filled with poetry, because it is one book, the 'ands' or the conjunctions run right through the book. As we get it in @Exodus 17, it is "the book". She is like many others such as Hezekiah and Jonah and Habakkuk, outstanding contributors to the book of God, the poetic book of God, so that she stands in line with the psalmists, though in an isolated position. We can see what I have been referring to as to our own times, how God brings out results and gets results whatever happens.
J.W.D. The matter of the sonship of Christ, which you referred to, was really unreachable until the subjective condition of the saints was helped so as to fill it out.
J.T. That is what I was thinking in this book, the feminine side is to bring that out. Hannah and Abigail balance each other; the subjective state is there, but the product of it is that no matter what happens the thing stands. We can see that it goes back in the history and it is unalterable in result.
C.C.T. In chapter 1 she has bitterness of soul; in chapter 2 she has power, she has an outlook.
J.T. She has a horn. The word 'horn' is used throughout the Scriptures for that purpose, to symbolise power.
Ques. Would there be a similarity to the songs of degrees -- @Psalm 120 to 134 inclusive?
J.T. I would think that. The psalmists began with their own experiences; she begins with her own experience and ends with Christ. @Psalm 133 is the Anointed above, that is, Aaron's head anointed, so that the thing comes down to the hem of the garment. That section speaks about Jerusalem being built as compacted together, and the hem of the garment means it is a finished product; those psalms
{270}
contemplate a finished product. What can be finished save as Christ is at the top and love from Him flowing down? That is really what she reaches; she reaches the Anointed here.
Rem. Is that why she says "our God" and not "my God"? "Neither is there any rock like our God".
J.T. Does she say "our" always? She says in verse 1, "My heart exulteth in Jehovah", that is God; God is in His greatness before her soul. "My horn is lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth is opened wide over mine enemies; for I rejoice in thy salvation". She is speaking to God, speaking about Him, and then speaking to Him. Then she says, "There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee". I am only going over the ground to see how her soul is running. She is speaking to God, speaking of Him and to Him, "Neither is there any rock like our God". That is, chapter 1 would indicate that for us it would be a question of the assembly; for us there is only one; we are embracing the saints in what we say. Then she goes on to celebrate further: "For Jehovah is a God of knowledge", meaning she knows Him; she can tell you about Him and teach you, "They that were full have hired themselves out for bread", now she is speaking about what she has observed. So that it is what God is to us, and how we can speak to Him in liberty, and then bring in the brethren with us, for we are all caught up together. Then she teaches us as to God; it is like a maschil psalm; it is a teaching psalm.
S.McC. In these first five verses of chapter 2 you get written down the workings of her soul that were going on in chapter 1; I mean, the sufferings and the great grief and provocation; she was silent in all that, but now, established in this with her horn lifted up, she is able to speak thus and God gets results from it.
J.T. She is celebrating God and able to speak to
{271}
Him at the same time; then she teaches about Him, especially as the God of knowledge.
S.McC. She says, "There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee, neither is there any rock like our God. Do not multiply your words of pride, let not vain-glory come out of your mouth; for Jehovah is a God of knowledge" (verses  2, 3).
J.T. She is thinking no doubt about Peninnah, but she goes wider. That is what I think we should see, how you go wider as under the power of the Spirit of God, because really she is speaking under the power of the Spirit of God. As David says, "The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, and his word was on my tongue", @2 Samuel 23: 2.
J.S. Is this in keeping with @Leviticus 1? I was thinking of the slaughtering of the bullock, and in @Leviticus 1: 7 it says, "And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order on the fire; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar". Is she carrying that out, laying the matter out in order from chapter 1?
J.T. Note it speaks of the head; it is what the offering is intelligently, what it represents -- intelligence, and how God uses our intelligence. She has it here, she has intelligence by experience, but she has intelligence by the Spirit clearly, because there is a product by the Spirit of God.
G.A.T. Would you say a word as to the difference between having it in our hearts and having it in our heads?
J.T. The head is a part of a man's being -- it is essential because it implies intelligence; it implies wisdom, too; so that Paul, in approaching the service of God says, "I speak as to intelligent persons, do ye judge what I say", @1 Corinthians 10: 15. That is, we are able to judge what he is saying, like the Bereans.
{272}
Wisdom that we have from God is acceptable to God. Paul would have the Ephesians know his intelligence. He says, "By which, in reading it, ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ", @Ephesians 3: 4. "My intelligence", he says -- remarkable that there was such intelligence as that on the earth! So that if anybody has intelligence or any other quality from God, it belongs to the saints and He wants the saints to know it and get the benefit of it, not that they might be occupied with the person, but with God, and what He has wrought in the person. That is the thought in the head being offered.
G.A.T. If I have intelligence, what I give out must be good in my heart first.
J.T. Quite so. You need a mind and intelligence to minister.
Rem. The napkin in the tomb was appreciated more than the other grave clothes; it was wrapped in a place by itself, showing the appreciation of the intelligence in which the Lord moved.
J.T. That is right; some hand did that. We are not told who did it, but it shows that that was a great element in connection with the resurrection. The napkin that was about His head was folded; some hand did that and put it in a place by itself, calling attention to it; of course it involves headship too, and this book is full of that. Dagon fell before the ark and his head was cut off; the head of Goliath was brought down and carried to Jerusalem.
S.McC. You were drawing attention this morning to a beautiful suggestion in chapter 1, verse 13, "Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard". Now we come into the expression of it in this chapter.
J.T. Vigorous expression too; voices are involved here.
{273}
A.S.B. Why does the song make much of the way in which God has ability to reverse things? A few verses in Hannah's song are filled out with the ability of God to do that, "The bow of the mighty is broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are so no more, even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble" (verses  4, 5).
J.T. It is one thing against another, it is a form of poetry; the book of Proverbs has largely taken on that character of one thing over against another. If we have any experience at all, it is experience of what is going on all the time; God is changing things over and of course our prayers enter into that. Her prayers entered into this: she was the barren one, but she finally bore six, because it is said here in verse 21 that she had three sons and two daughters. God did that, it is God changing things over; as you say, reversing things, so that we are encouraged to go on praying and praying. Things will come about; it may take months or years to bring them about, but He will bring them about certainly.
J.H. She celebrates His mercy and judgment.
J.T. I have no doubt it is the framework of the psalm; we see it is carefully worded, if we have time to follow in detail what is in it: "Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up. Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up, he raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, to set him among nobles"; that is an added thought; and furthermore: "he maketh them inherit a throne of glory" (verses  6 - 8). She stops there to bring more out of that one point as indicating what God is doing now through the gospel. But anyway the general thought is what God can do, so that we have a basis for prayer in so many things.
{274}
J.W.D. In regard of this thought of what is poetical, the psalms being in the form of poetry, is there something of a poetical formation brought into the body out of all these issues that you are outlining? It is not prose, it is poetry. Does it suggest that out of the exercises there is a kind of rhythm of joy and spiritual felicity and happiness body-wise?
J.T. That is very good. Tell us more.
J.W.D. I was thinking of poetry in relation to the body; there seems to be this poetic idea.
J.T. I would say that fully; God has made man so that he should be poetical. When we come to the analysis of the book of Psalms we find extraordinary methods governing what is written, the acrostics, for instance, not only in the Psalms but in Proverbs. The Psalms were written on the basis of language, showing how thoughtful these brethren were whom God used, because poetry is called a science; really it is a science in the true sense of the word, in a divine sense. It involves felicity inwardly and an avenue for feeling, an avenue for strong feeling, whether loving or otherwise. God has constituted man so that he can be employed in that way -- that God Himself should so employ him. If we start with the Bible we would be impressed, I am sure, with poetic felicity. You get it from the very start; some say that the account of creation is poetic. You come on down to Jacob, to a man like that -- what a beautiful chapter @Genesis 49 is! It runs right through, one might say, and I think that our hymn book is not behind. The hymns of Mr. Darby are sublime, they are the acme of poetic production in the present dispensation. We have no hymns from apostolic times, the earliest one I know of is from the eighth century. God has given the opportunity to the saints to bring out what would express truths poetically from time to time.
{275}
Ques. Do you think that poetry is a means by which others are distinctly impressed?
J.T. It catches the ear; it is intended for that.
E.G.McA. Would not that include the thought that the service of God is dressed in beauty? Poetry is the human language in a beautiful form, so that the service of God would be on that line.
J.T. We sometimes use the expression, He is a bit prosy, or flat. The poetic touch is stimulating, and I believe that is why Scripture is so full of it. The Spirit of God has indited what is full of singing as in the Psalms; He represents the feeling side of the testimony, "The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters", @Genesis 1: 2. There is feeling and that runs through.
N.B. Would there be any connection between this and what we have in the epistles? This is speaking to God, but the epistles are speaking to one another in psalms and hymns.
J.T. These are psalms that are ready for us, not what we make ourselves. They are not bookshelf things; the hymns are to be used not only in the meeting-room, not simply at the piano either, but expressive of feelings, to keep the atmosphere high.
S.McC. It is interesting in connection with what you have said about the Spirit of God that David says in @2 Samuel 23, "The sweet psalmist of Israel saith, The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me" (verses  1, 2), as if the Spirit of Jehovah is peculiarly linked with the sweet psalmist of Israel.
J.T. Very nice. That psalm, and as we have had already, the 45th, are maschil ones. @Psalm 45 says, "My heart is welling forth with a good matter" (verse 1). It is addressed "To the chief Musician. Upon Shoshannim", which is said in the note to mean 'Lilies'. Then it says, "Of the sons of Korah". That is to say, clearly, for persons who are the subjects of mercy, which are ourselves of course -- subjects of
{276}
mercy. And it is called "An instruction", which means it is a teaching psalm; and then finally, "a song of the Beloved". That is, it is full of feeling; that is the heading and it is inspired; that is not what the translators put in, it is inspired. And then he begins, "My heart is welling forth with a good matter", it is inside himself; not coming upon him, but in him. That is what the psalm is, I need not go into it; we often use it. It makes a great deal of Christ, but it makes a great deal of the queen too, bringing out the King, and the queen at His right hand; not the daughter, but the queen in the full thought, which must be there to balance the purposes of God. That gives that psalm a very peculiar place in the book. We cannot afford time to go any further on that line, but this matter of "his anointed" at the end of Hannah's product is to be noted.
The thought of "his anointed" suggests Philip's preaching; he preached the Christ; however well I am preaching or otherwise, I am preaching the Christ, I am preaching of One who can do everything well. And that is what the Spirit of God tells her to put in here, "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed" (verse 10). I pray for that at the present time -- "the ends of the earth". It is very remarkable that all the parts of the earth are brought up before people today, people are becoming acquainted with every part of the globe; God made them all -- the oceans and seas and rivers and mountains. It is very remarkable how the Lord is enabling us to get the full scope of it into our minds, because He is going to take it on presently; He is going to put His right foot on the sea, the Pacific and the Atlantic and all will come into it, because whoever has the sea has the power. It involves inscrutability really, you cannot tell what is in the sea, but you can what on the earth. Well now, the Spirit
{277}
of God tells her to say here, "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth"; that is not so much in prominence now. "And he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed". So that she reaches up there and gives us infinitude to think of -- the means God has in His power of accomplishing all His purposes.
A.R. It is remarkable that the present conflict is for territory. She says it belongs to God.
J.T. Quite so.
E.G.McA. I am wondering about that last part of verse 10: "And he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed". Has God the habitable earth as a solid foundation to work out His thoughts in connection with the Anointed?
J.T. The habitable earth is a good word there, because wisdom was rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth. God has His Atlantic and His Pacific, the Arctic and the Antarctic Oceans. These latter are cold places, but God has His sunny places, I mean He has that part where He will put man, and the earth is securely founded: "The earth standeth for ever", @Ecclesiastes 1: 4. Things are all immutable with God. Even as to the Jews, though -- as it says in @2 Kings 21: 13 -- they are wiped like a pan now, wiped and turned upside down, yet God will finally take them up in a solid way. He has His Christ, the One He has anointed to do things, and He does them well.
A.R. Do you think the idea of the Pacific would be to remind us that God has that in reserve?
J.T. The sea is His; the Pacific is the largest of the oceans; what fishes there are in it we do not know. Really Asia has been the world of the unknown, but now God is opening it up, and there are kings there that He will use later on according to the prophecies.
{278}
S.McC. Hannah begins with "my horn" but ends with "the horn of his anointed". Would you say in regard of ourselves, that whatever help or power we know and experience in present circumstances fails of the intent to which it is given if it does not merge in the greatness, which you have been suggesting, of "the horn of his anointed"?
J.T. I think that is very excellent. Her horn is what she was experiencing, but now it is His Anointed, and His horn, what God would make of Christ. We are waiting for Him -- the man Child, as we had it this morning, the male Son. He is to stay up there until the time comes for Him to shepherd the nations with the rod of iron.
Rem. Is that something like @Psalm 72, "O God, give the king thy judgments, and thy righteousness unto the king's son" (verse 1)?
J.T. Quite so, beautiful! "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended" (verse 20).
Rem. Hannah might have said, The prayers of Hannah are ended, in the presence of the Highest.
J.T. Quite so.
A.R. Will the Lord's reign on earth cover the whole earth?
J.T. Yes, clearly; prophecy is full of that. We have been dwelling on the way the earth is formed; that is, there is a cold extremity and a central warm belt; God has all that and He has places of pleasure for men. So that Paul in speaking of this to the Athenians says, "God ... has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth", @Acts 17: 26. That disposes of the race question. God has made them all, "for in him we live and move and exist". That is a basis for a common thought and feeling which men have moved away from, but Christ would bring it all back. It is of just one land that God says, 'I spied it for you', as
{279}
if He were in the air and looked down and saw this land of Canaan. He says, 'I spied it for you and set it apart in My mind for you'. In Deuteronomy He describes what a land of wealth it is. God knows what He has put there; these things are there physically and God knows they are there. When you come to the government of God, God knows what He put in this country. It is the salvation of the whole position; it is God. And the things are all here, everything that is necessary to save a world; that is the government of God. But what I was speaking of earlier was not the government of God but His purpose, and the earth is the sphere of His purpose; He is going to have us for Himself and He tells us what He has put in it, for us -- for man. So that when the Lord Jesus comes Paul says, "He has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed, giving the proof of it to all in having raised him from among the dead", @Acts 17: 31. It is very remarkable that that should come out at Athens, because it is a question of knowledge, what men should know.
J.W. Does Paul not appeal to them along the poetic line there? He says, "As also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring" (verse 28).
J.T. Just as in @Numbers 21, where the Spirit of God says, "Rise up, well! sing unto it" (verse 17). You have Him in your heart as the great objective power to bring Him back to you. @Numbers 21 is full of poetry.
E.G.McA. "Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth". Hannah was really in the good of @Psalm 2: 8: "Ask of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance, and for thy possession the ends of the earth". Is that word 'judge' in verse 10 on the line of rule?
{280}
J.T. Yes, in the same sense as the book of Judges. God will judge the earth in righteousness. It is a question such as the two women brought to Solomon; he knew who was the mother of the child. It is not simply authority, but wisdom and affection too.
A.R. Is the present pressure to bring out our confidence in God which would find expression in our prayer meetings? We have assurance that He controls the whole earth.
J.T. We were saying earlier that if you were to visit the prayer meetings all over the world you would hear the same thing.
Rem. Abraham said, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" @Genesis 18: 25.
J.T. All the earth -- China and Japan -- all the earth.
J.H. You mentioned this morning the priestly feelings of Hannah; is there any link in her expression as to the anointed with verse 35? "And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed continually".
J.T. There is clearly a link between the two; this is "a man of God" who is saying that. The man of God begins to speak in verse 27: "And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt ... ?". Then in verse 30 he says, "For them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. Behold, days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house. And thou shalt see an oppressor in my habitation, amidst all the good that shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever. And the man of thine whom I shall not cut off from mine
{281}
altar, shall be to cause thine eyes to fail and to grieve thy soul" (this is for Eli); "and all the increase of thy house shall die in their vigour. And this shall be the sign to thee, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them. And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest". Then in chapter 3 God speaks to Samuel and tells him what He is going to do to Eli. It is remarkable how this chapter that we are reading brings in the Christ, whether it be the king or the priest, because verse 35 brings in the king, "and he shall walk before mine anointed continually". The priest is subordinate to the king now, he had not been, but he is now, that is the change that is coming about. The king must take precedence over the priest, whereas it was the priest before; Eli was supreme in the nation, but he is not going to be henceforth.
E.G.McA. "He shall be a priest upon his throne", (@Zechariah 6: 13); you get the two combined in one.
J.T. Just so, royalty goes before priesthood, because what man is comes into view and you must have power to deal with it.
S.McC. It is remarkable that you have the whole compass of the Lord's official glory -- in this chapter: Prophet, Priest and King all enter into this chapter.
J.T. All coming from a woman; that is a word for the sisters. The Lord seems to be having the sisters in His mind all the time lately, because He is going to take us up to heaven shortly and He wants a subjective state. The assembly is to be the Lamb's wife; there is not to be any insubordination, and Hannah is intended here to represent that side.
E.G.McA. Do you mean the bride, the Lamb's wife, is to be suggested now in the subjective side in the sisters -- the way the clothing is prepared, the white linen?
{282}
J.T. It is the righteousnesses of the saints, the totality of them.
G.A.T. What would you say that the Lord has in His mind in the sisters?
J.T. To bring out the assembly subjectively, the real thing wrought out in us. The feminine side is taken up in such persons as Hannah, but it includes all; when you come into the assembly it includes all of us.
G.A.T. Hannah evidently did not have herself in mind in verse 5, "Even the barren beareth seven"; she had only six. Did she leave room for Christ in that?
J.T. It is said that every godly mother expected or wished to be the mother of the Messiah. That is what Mary became, and she is glorified in that sense; she brought in the Messiah; her song might well be fitted into Hannah's. God did great things to her; no one ever had such an experience as she had, or ever will have.
N.B. What would you say about @Judges 5? We have a sister and a brother singing together there.
J.T. That is good. The sister has a great place in Judges, but when we come to the cloud of witnesses it is the brother; I mean @Hebrews 11 does not mention Deborah, it mentions Barak. Deborah helped to put Barak in his place; the masculine side must have its place, but he got it through her, showing how the sisters can help. Manoah got his place through his wife also.
S.McC. It is remarkable that Mary's devotions seem to travel in the same channel of expression as Hannah's. There is a marked similarity between the two.
J.T. It is what the Mighty One did to her, Mary says; she celebrates that. There is a remarkable correspondence between the two women's expressions.
{283}
Rem. @Proverbs 31 says the virtuous woman's husband is known in the gates; is that the thought?
J.T. That is the thought exactly. Now just to carry on for a little as to Hannah's influence, you will see how Elkanah, as we have been saying, is really promoted spiritually through his wife. It says in verse 11, "And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house", as if he is set up through her; he is fitting into the result of his wife's faith and spirituality; he is getting the good of it. He is riding on the crest of the wave so that he has his place, and in connection with that it says, "And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod" (verse 18). That is the point we are touching; we are touching what supersedes Eli. Eli is going to be superseded, not violently taken out of the way, although he fell backwards and did die in violence in that sense; but he is superseded before he died. That is, the ground is filled by Samuel. Elkanah has a place in Ramah in his house where Samuel lived; that is, something is set up there and it is all due to Hannah; she is the leader in all this.
And now the young boy is said to minister to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest. And then we are told from verses 12 to 17 what terrible men these sons of Eli were, how violent they were -- persons who are formally called priests; because both of these men are formally called priests in chapter 1, "And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of Jehovah, were there". How solemn it is that we should be that by profession and be violent men! Just see what it says about them in verse 12 of chapter 2, "Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial"! How very solemn that is, how searching it is, that one should hold such a position and be a son of Belial! They are called priests of Jehovah, but now we have a real priest in Samuel. The Spirit of God tells us what these men were, that "They
{284}
knew not Jehovah. And the priests custom with the people was, when any man sacrificed a sacrifice, the priest's servant came, when the flesh was cooked, with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand; and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up". He saw to it that it was a good strong one; it was violence of the priesthood in the service of God, "So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there. Even before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee, but raw. If the man said to him, They will immediately burn the fat entire, then take as thy soul desires; he would say to him, No, but thou shalt give it now; and if not, I will take it by force. And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah". The Spirit of God gives us that picture as soon as the boy Samuel is anointed. God is setting them aside, and saying, as it were, Am I not justified in setting them aside? But I have someone to go on with according to what is in My mind, and that someone is Hannah.
Ques. In chapter 3 it says, "Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah" (verse 7). Is his ministering to Jehovah (verse 11) entirely a result of Hannah's teaching?
J.T. It is the way he has been influenced and brought up so far. The fact that he did not yet know Jehovah meant that God had not formally worked with him; but evidently as far as her influence went he was in the way for it. We are told, "Train up a child in the way he should go", @Proverbs 22: 6.
Rem. The sons of Eli lacked such a mother; their mother is never mentioned.
J.T. Quite so.
C.C.T. What is the thought of the boy ministering? He has not matured yet; he is still a boy.
{285}
J.T. He was just a boy but even then he was in the line of service; it is all due to his mother, to how she looked after him. So that it goes on to tell us in verse 18, "And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod". There you have the priestly touch. In verse 11 it says, "And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest". In verse 18 the real person is owned, it is Samuel, the one that was asked for, and he is girded with a linen ephod; he has the priestly garment on.
G.A.T. What you are saying now ought to be an encouragement to our young men if they are not free and peaceful in the presence of older brethren. Are there not times when we are hindered on account of older brethren, more gifted brethren, being present?
J.T. It is good when the young men have liberty, and they are getting liberty, do you not think? That is what is indicated here, the progress of Samuel. In the second mention of his ministry he has the linen ephod, that is, the young men have to remember that they have to let no one despise their youth. The ephod is to protect them, if they have it. It was said to be linen, and they are to be clothed around the loins with linen, which means what sobers them, keeps them sober, so that they are not to be despised. A young man may travel in intelligence far beyond his father, but he has to be sober. "Let no one despise thy youth" means you are so sober and manly that no one can say anything against it even though you stand up in the presence of older brethren.
C.C.T. So that in chapter 2: 21 it says, "And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah", and in chapter 3: 1, "And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli". That leaves a way open for the young brethren to grow and minister.
{286}
J.T. Just so. In verse 11, as remarked, he is a boy ministering to Jehovah. In verse 18 it is Samuel, a boy, ministering before Jehovah; it is not simply that he ministered to Him, but before Him; he is under Jehovah's eye. God is looking at what we are doing and saying. But then we are told in verse 19 the part his mother has in this ministry, "And his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice". That is a beautiful thing, that she should be brought in here. He is lent to Jehovah, but he is still hers. She has links with him and she is watching his growth, and you may be sure if there was anything inconsistent with the years he had acquired, she would point it out to him; and that gives a great scope to mothers with their children, because a maternal word can do that. As sitting in the assembly, of course, she is not his mother, but she will have opportunity to say something to him at home that he may need to hear.
G.A.T. You mentioned this morning that she did not go up to take his measure first before she brought the coat. Would that be spiritual instinct, that she knew how much he was growing spiritually?
J.T. That is just what it is, she had confidence in him; there is not a word mentioned that she had any reproof at all for him. The Lord's mother rebuked the Lord, think of that! But we are not told that Hannah ever rebuked Samuel.
J.W.D. Is not this rather a new feature? There is nothing in the Mosaic law about levitical boys ministering in the temple; it is something new and distinctive.
J.T. It is a novelty, but a divine novelty. God's order of things is not static or stale, it is continuous, and life is continuous. Here we have a remarkable feature -- a boy, it is not a child but a boy, and each passage that follows indicates growth.
{287}
J.H. Would it show that the condition of things in Israel was so low that God used what there was?
J.T. It is all attributable to this woman -- she lent him. It is a remarkable thing that God should borrow anything, allowing Himself to be in that position of borrowing, but He is doing it. He is saying to Hannah, I so honour you that I am indebted to you for this boy; and she evidently has access to the temple, at least in some sense, when she brings the coat up.
G.A.T. In verse 26 it says, "And the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men".
J.T. Well, exactly. But how remarkable it is that God admits of her mind or judgment being a standard for her son in the temple! God did not prescribe for the size of his growth. He prescribed for the priest's clothes, but he is leaving this to his mother. It is to bring out how she is honoured; how heaven honours such a mother as this. Here is the mother of Samuel, and Samuel is serving, and what is she doing? She has gone up to sacrifice with her husband; she did not come alone, and that is suitable, that she should come with her husband.
A.R. The whole system depended on her. Eli was worthless.
J.T. Eli is just gradually being displaced by this product of Hannah's, and God is allowing Hannah access to the temple. Let the brethren decide what size his coat should be? No, let his mother decide. She has loaned him; she has a lien on him. It is simply to emphasise the spirituality of this remarkable woman.
E.G.McA. It says in verse 18, "And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod". Is that God's endorsement of Hannah naming her son in verse 20 of chapter 1?
{288}
J.T. That is right. It is like the use of the article -- take men or persons of distinction, when they are recorded personally it is "the Samuel"; that is the meaning of it, that there is nobody else in mind. The whole list, or nearly all the list in the genealogy in Matthew is "the Abraham", "the Jacob", that person, known in heaven, a known generation in the testimony. Samuel is acquiring a place in the testimony: that is what is meant. "Samuel ministered" -- you might think he was fifty years of age, but he was not; but the person is there.
N.B. How do you connect all this with verse 7 of chapter 3: "Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him"?
J.T. That is another side of the matter, that God is taking him away from Hannah. Hannah's influence is mentioned and I think all we have been dealing with so far is to bring out the distinction Hannah has in relation to Samuel. But now God says, I am taking him over, no matter how much influence for good you have. Without God, what good would it be? Everything must be for God, of whom and through whom are all things. Samuel is of God, not simply of Hannah but of God.
A.R. God is bringing him forward, not his mother; and over against that God is operating to harden men's hearts -- the two sons of Eli -- God was minded to slay them.
J.T. God has His man before He sets aside other men; therefore Luke in giving the genealogy of our Lord Jesus Christ traces it back from Joseph, the Lord's reputed father; and it is "of", "of", "of", right back to God; Adam was "of God". Everything must go back to God, of whom and through whom are all things, so that Hannah is out of the picture now, it is God.
{289}
U.O.G. Would you give us the application of the linen ephod and the little coat?
J.T. Well, the linen garment for the priests in @Exodus 28 refers to a fabric that tends to sobriety and balance; an ephod is, of course, the priestly garment. It is an open garment that shows you belong to the priestly class, and he had that on him; it is said that he was girded with a linen ephod. He is a priest, and needs to be kept balanced and sober. Think of a boy breaking bread and then going out to play tennis and football and everything every other boy does! They should get it into their souls that they are different. It is not to be all natural amusement, they should learn to be sober; they are breaking bread, and there is some responsibility attached to that. That is what the linen ephod means, he is not just an ordinary boy; he is an extraordinary boy.
C.C.T. The coat evidently could not be bought; it had to be made by her.
J.T. It had to be made by her and God allowed her to do it.
E.G.McA. This linen ephod is very striking in contrast to verse 12. In spite of the awful conditions seen in that verse. Samuel was protected by the linen ephod.
J.T. Yes indeed, as over against the two men that God would slay.
A.S.B. Is it not encouraging that we see here what is for God developed in spite of men?
J.T. It is developed in Samuel, and that is important. He must have seen what Eli's sons were doing with their three-pronged articles of violence; and the people of God were being damaged by them, because it says they did it to all Israel. It says in chapter 3: 19, "And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.
{290}
And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah". "The word" is a very important thing to notice -- the revelation by "the word"; the mind of God is being disclosed, that is what is meant by "the word".
G.A.T. How do you connect Samuel's word with Jehovah's word? None of Samuel's words fell to the ground.
J.T. That would be like his ministry; but the revelation by the word of Jehovah means that God is making Himself known to you or to me as to His mind. One wants to know His mind, what He has before Him.
G.A.T. Should we not be exercised about the words that we speak, that they should not be foolish words?
J.T. Quite so. It is like printed ministry. Of course the ministry as it is given orally ought to be held in the hearts of the brethren, that is, it falls to the ground if it is not held in the hearts of the brethren for the heart is really the receptacle; but the written ministry is also an indication of what should be kept from falling to the ground. Falling to the ground simply means it is lost and forgotten, but Samuel's words were so valuable that they were kept and treasured by those who heard them.
J.K. Hannah took notice that growth was taking place and others also are brought into that; in verse 20 they knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.
J.T. That is what I thought we should have before us at another meeting; the effect of ministry on persons who were living at the same time. Samuel's ministry is current in this book, and what is the effect of it? I believe we shall see that Abigail is the product of Samuel's ministry. If we have a ministry let there be a product of it. Samuel's words
{291}
not falling to the ground meant there would be a product, those in whom his words would be kept; they are not in cold storage; they are kept livingly and that means formation. I believe that David and Abigail refer to life, what Christ is livingly. David was ruddy, and Abigail was in correspondence. She was a woman of "good understanding" -- that relates to the ministry; and of a "beautiful countenance" -- that is the life. Thus she is the product of Samuel's ministry.
E.G.McA. So Paul said to Timothy, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things", @2 Timothy 2: 7.
J.T. Timothy would be formed by what Paul said.
A.R. Paul had a good product in Titus; he was really a model; he set him forward as his own product.
J.T. Just so; at Jerusalem you mean.
{292}
FEMININE FEATURES IN 1 SAMUEL (3)
@1 Samuel 4: 19 - 22; @1 Samuel 6: 7 - 16; @1 Samuel 9: 11 - 14
J.T. Pursuing our subject, we shall with the Lord's help see suffering of a peculiar nature in these first two instances; that is, the wife of Phinehas, and the milch-kine employed to draw the cart on which the ark was. Then in the third scripture we shall see the intelligence that may attach to young sisters, spiritual intelligence; the maidens mentioned there had a remarkable knowledge of Samuel, and became guides to reach him. The first scripture follows on our inquiry of yesterday, and relates to the government of God according to what had been announced by the man of God to Eli; and in the execution of that government this woman appears with right feelings and intelligence -- negatively of course -- but still she had an apprehension of the glory and that it had departed. It is important to have discernment enough to know when glory that had been attached to a position departs, so that there may be suitable humiliation and inquiry about it. She leaves a landmark for us in Ichabod, for in the acceptance of the negative -- which he represents -- we come again to the positive, as we duly apprehend the situation and humble ourselves. The line of recovery, as over against Ichabod, is in the milch-kine. They are not dying in maternal exercise but are living milch-kine, meaning they provide milk. They leave their calves behind, sacrificing in doing so, and die at the end of their service.
E.G.McA. What is the significance of the death of Phinehas wife as bearing on this development?
J.T. It is governmental; her husband is already slain and her father-in-law dead. It is God coming in governmentally to deal with an evil condition, so as to remove it and make way for better conditions. The milch-kine become the agents of that, which is
{293}
very remarkable, because they are expressly feminine in their exercises -- leaving their calves, lowing as they went. They are milk-bearers, but contrary to nature they went the one way in their movement.
J.W.D. What would you say about the great place the ark seems to have among the people generally, particularly with Eli?
J.T. I suppose that may be a matter of how we should regard Christ, what is to be apprehended as Christ now, not literally Christ personally, but what He is in testimony, that in which He is represented. They are profoundly affected by what happened. It would suggest today persons who take account of what we have from God, what others have been used to inaugurate and we are moving on with; and that has come to an end. This sorrow of the woman is the basis of recovery negatively; she had intelligence in her death. She had thoughtfulness to name her child Ichabod; that is very remarkable.
J.H. Do you think verse 4 shows she had an apprehension in her soul of the glory of God as connected with the ark: "The ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth between the cherubim"?
J.T. She would have that in her mind and would appreciate that form of designation. I think she is the remnant, the overcomer in this particular setting. She dies in that, but she is nevertheless an overcomer in her intelligence, and left a testimony as Hannah did; she had light in her soul and she left a testimony in a poetic contribution to the service of God, a negative but still a real testimony to God, as feeling conditions; and this became the basis of recovery.
J.H. Does this expression of feeling suggest that she was capable like Hannah of unfolding great thoughts?
J.T. Just so, the expression is remarkable: "And Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and
{294}
encamped beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and the battle spread, and Israel was routed before the Philistines; and they slew in battle array in the field about four thousand men. And the people came into the camp; and the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch ourselves the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies. So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth between the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there by the ark of the covenant of God", @1 Samuel 4: 1 - 4. This is the Spirit's record, and the beautiful expression undoubtedly would be taken up by this dying woman: "the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth between the cherubim". But what a sorrowful thing, what a solemn thing, that these two men whose conduct, whose lives had been depicted as so wicked, should be there! Faith would discern that in such custody the ark must come to grief.
Rem. What is the difference between this and the occasion in @2 Samuel 15 of Absalom's rebellion when they take the ark out of the city and David tells them to take it back? David refused to have the ark go with him, it was to return to its place. What was the point here in removing the ark out of its place?
J.T. That is David's confidence in God that He could bring him back and show it to him again if God took pleasure in him. It is a question of the persons responsible here; where were the persons here that God could take pleasure in? These two men afforded Him no pleasure, but the contrary; and this instance of the milch-kine taking the ark
{295}
back was what David doubtless had in mind. David says, "If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again and shew me it", @2 Samuel 15: 25. It is what God can do, so that David sends it back to the city.
E.G.McA. There seems to be a sequence here in the scripture you have just read about these two men being with the ark, and then their death, and the death of the wife of one of them, and then the return of the ark. Does it indicate that we may often resort to the official, legal, correct side without recognising the holiness of God's side of things?
J.T. That is just it; that is what had to be judged in this early part of the book. These men were utterly unfit to have to do with holy things and yet they were there, but only there in an outward way.
G.A.T. What have you to say about Phinehas wife grieving over her husband's removal?
J.T. That was suitable, but that would not be her meaning in the use of the word 'Ichabod', in saying that the glory had departed. She says, "The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband" (verse 21). The latter would be legitimate natural feelings, the death of our father or mother ought to occasion feelings to us; to be without natural affections is condemned in Scripture; it is a right feeling. But the ark of the covenant was undoubtedly what governed her soul.
S.McC. It suggests @Psalm 78, another of the maschil psalms, a psalm of Asaph. There things are viewed from God's side, He "gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor" (verse 61). Here it seems to be connected with the people, "The glory is departed from Israel".
J.T. I think it is a right feeling and ought to be found in a spiritual person when a calamity comes. Whatever the immediate occasion of it, this is a
{296}
calamity; even the death of Eli was a calamity. The death of Saul was a calamity from David's point of view; he had right feelings and lamented Saul and Jonathan, and yet Saul was his greatest enemy. I think God honours that, a right spirit; we do not carry with us natural hard feelings or hateful feelings, even if there is some ground for resentment. God wants us to have the spirit of Christ, as we see it in Hannah; she had none of these hostile feelings toward anybody. There was an adversary which she recognised, but even that adversary is a relative after the flesh and God honours having right feelings about it.
G.A.T. That is very helpful, because I think we lack a little on that line. If one of our natural relations does not feel as we do, we are prone to feel we should not have anything to do with him. You would not go with that, would you?
J.T. Well, being without natural affections is condemned in Scripture. We are usually *too* occupied with the natural, but the natural must be observed to a point in a balanced way, because we must remember that the Lord said to the man who wanted to bury his father, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead" (@Matthew 8: 22) -- let the spiritual be predominant. He would have to leave the Lord to go and bury his father; he could not take the Lord with him, but from the standpoint of the government of God He is with us in regard to natural feelings.
E.G.McA. So that according to the Old Testament one could defile himself for his father or mother.
J.T. Just so.
A.R. There are very few Ichabods around; there are lots of Phinehases but very few Ichabods.
J.T. That is good. What have you got to say about that?
A.R. The natural is usually perpetuated; she might have called him Phinehas.
{297}
J.T. Yes, indeed, an honourable name; even if her husband did not honour it, the great Phinehas did; he had an everlasting priesthood. But she passed over that and used the negative, she accepted the truth that the glory had departed.
S.McC. So that whenever this child was seen, the exercise raised would be not so much as to the mother, but as to Christ. Where is the glory?
J.T. Just so.
Rem. Would you say that chapter 4 expresses the general state of the people at that time?
J.T. Yes, it does. It is a most distressing chapter, because the ark of God is taken. It is like the celebration of the Lord's supper by independent parties without the proper state for it, which is obnoxious to God.
Rem. This woman takes account of all Israel in what she expresses, that "The glory is departed from Israel".
J.T. She had a national outlook, which is more than a family outlook. She had a family outlook because she referred to her father-in-law and her husband, but she went further than that; she had a national outlook in Israel.
Rem. Would that help us on the line of recovery, not merely feeling things in our localities but the bearing of the general position?
J.T. Just so. After all the fact of her father-in-law and her husband being priests was not the main thought with her because she says, "The glory is departed from Israel".
J.W.D. Do you think that many times in the history of christendom it could be said the glory is departed?
J.T. I would think so. The Lord's letters to the churches would help us as to that. His letter to Ephesus, which is the first one, says, "I have against thee", @Revelation 2: 4. He could say a great deal that
{298}
was in their favour, they had tried those who said they were apostles and were not, and found them liars; we need God to help us to find people liars like that. But as we come on to Pergamos we have what is against them: Antipas is slain among them. It looks as if the glory was either departing or had departed when such a man as Antipas could be slain among them; he was a faithful witness.
J.W.D. That is what I thought, and the milch-kine would show the glory of what had come in as coming back in our day. But this subjective state of Ichabod is the basis of it.
J.T. Just so, in a negative way. *The Collected Writings* and others are full of that, that God is not with man's organisations, whatever their pretensions. Even the Reformation did not re-establish the ark. Even the Bible, our authorised version, for a time carried with it the apocrypha, indicating real darkness.
J.H. Does this woman represent the remnant side seen in Thyatira?
J.T. That is the idea, the remnant; that is just the thought.
J.W.D. I was wondering whether it would not be helpful for our young people who are in the truth, to see that a kind of spirit of travail is needed in relation to the dreadful condition of things current in Christendom.
J.T. You have Pergamos, the third church, with Antipas slain: "slain among you", @Revelation 2: 13. In all these cases the Lord is seen walking in the midst of the seven assemblies; it is, so to speak, the "in the midst" period. In chapters 2 and 3 of Revelation He is there, but clothed not in priestly garments but in judicial garments; so that you can hardly say that, properly speaking, the glory was there, even in Ephesus, in view of the fact that He is not the High Priest; He is not clothed in priestly garments. His
{299}
love is sealed up, His affections are sealed up, He is girt about the breasts with a golden girdle, not about the loins, but the breasts. If the girdle had been on His loins He would be still serving in a priestly way, but He is serving as a Judge, which would mean it is a condemning time. He is walking in the midst as if He were judicial. There is a certain glory attached to His walk even as a Judge, but it is very solemn that judgment is in mind, for He says, "I have against thee ...", @Revelation 2: 4.
J.C. Does the fact of Antipas being slain among them suggest that there was a condition there which would allow that sort of thing?
J.T. The 'anti' would mean he was against the condition there; so that to the next church, which is Thyatira, the Lord says, "But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel" (verse 20); I am against that. There is no more opportunity given her at all; He said, "I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent", so that He casts her into a bed and those that carry on with her into great tribulation, "and her children will I kill with death". That is the finish; the glory has departed entirely, because He says to the remnant, "But to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come" (verse 24). And now the overcomer is to await another order of things; he is to await the coming kingdom.
A.R. The ark in captivity affected cities and affected even the bodies of people. I suppose we might see that work out in church history. When it was in the hands of the Philistines, they had to suffer governmentally.
J.T. That is the next thing. God widens out His dealings. He stretches His hand out on the enemy,
{300}
and the remarkable thing is that the Philistine priests have some light about the ark and what is becoming to it. That shows what we may look for in unexpected places, someone to lift up his voice in view of recovery -- in view of relief. But these milch-kine are sufferers; they represent the feminine side in a very striking way. They are really spiritual because they go the right way; they take the one way, as if God is doing it Himself for the protection of the ark. From the time it was taken by the Philistines, it was entirely in God's hands. There were no Levites or priests; the ark was exposed, but it was protected and brought back; that is to encourage faith in God.
J.W. Would the house of Chloe in Corinth represent the milch-kine?
J.T. Yes, it is a feminine thought; Paul learned about the state of things at Corinth from her.
J.W. She would represent the spiritual features.
J.T. She would indeed; if the glory had not already departed in Corinth it was on the way to it, and she became, as it were, the light-bearer.
A.B. Is there something of the feature of suffering seen in the wife of Phinehas over against Eli? When he heard the news there was no spiritual or moral reaction to it; it says, "He fell" (verse 18). But when the wife of Phinehas hears the news it says, "She bowed herself and travailed" (verse 19), meeting the circumstances with moral power.
J.T. There was movement inwardly, you mean, with her? Eli was an old man; we are told he sat on the seat by the wayside, and it says, "Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see. And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the battle, and I have fled today out of the battle. And he said, What has taken place, my son? And the messenger answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the
{301}
people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for the man was old, and heavy" (verses  15 - 18). All that description is remarkable; it is what you might call governmental. People who go in for a certain line of things are not true, as in his case in regard of his sons; he was not true in his house. But he carried on; he was old but he had regard for God and the ark. But he had failed to judge himself in a certain line of things and I believe God says, It must be that way, it is a fixed matter now, and there is no hope for him. He goes out that way; he was a man that sat down in laziness and grew heavy and blind, but yet he retained a certain respect and regard for what was of God. But the stigma is never lifted from Eli, it was the government of God. One has noticed it; this is a warning lest we go on with anything, whatever it be, that God has called attention to, which we should have judged and yet have not judged. You may be carrying on your service, but you have not done this certain thing, and the matter is fixed and you will finish that way. It is the government of God.
J.H. When you spoke about his being alone, had you in mind the fact that there were women standing by the wife of Phinehas in verse 20? "And as she was dying, the women that stood by her said, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son".
J.T. This is the feminine side that is stressed here. Eli is gone and Phinehas is gone, and his brother is gone, but this woman is yet alive and the women are active about it. It is a maternal scene, peculiarly so. She has life yet. Eli fell back; it is a sort of apostate suggestion without saying too much against the man; but he failed to judge what was
{302}
especially called attention to by a messenger of God to him. As the Lord said about Jezebel, "I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent ...". Therefore He says, "Behold, I cast her into a bed". That is a finished matter, that is the end of her career. Well now, this is the end of Eli's career; but there is this overcomer, feeble indeed, but still it is said she bowed herself, which is an act of power, and travailed: "for her pains came upon her. And as she was dying, the women that stood by her said, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son" (verse 20). There is something positive in this. In Eli there is nothing; it is a finished matter under the government of God, a most solemn matter; but not so with her, there is a product, there is a living testimony. It is negative, but still it is from her; it is what she has left, a monument; just as Hannah contributed to the service of God. There is nothing like Hannah's contribution here, but still there is the testimony from this dying woman that the glory had departed. Her mind became widened and enlarged, she says, "The glory is departed from Israel". She is a real Israelite.
G.A.T. She died under deep and real exercise.
J.T. That is the point, that is why it is mentioned. We do not even get her name, we must go by the account.
G.A.T. Why is it held back until she dies?
J.T. Well, it is to bring out what is there, like John's ministry, John's gospel; John will enlarge on anything that is of God, however little. If it were not for John's account of Martha, we should never have thought anything of her but that she was a poor critical woman; but John brings out the other side.
A.B. Is it not important to see that in both cases, Eli and this woman, it is the reaction to the tidings concerning the ark of God? It is not something that
{303}
happens before, it is the immediate crisis; and so there is this reaction with the wife of Phinehas.
J.T. She did not have to do with the ark directly; she was not an official priest. The old man did have to do with it; he was a high priest and it was his occupation, like a leading brother in the meeting or a leading man among the brethren; it took all his time, you might say. He was an old man; well, you would expect him to have some thought about the things in which he was serving; but here is a person who has nothing to do with the priesthood officially, and yet she says something about it which is right. He does not say anything; he fell backward.
A.B. It corresponds with Philadelphia; "She bowed herself" is like "Thou hast a little power".
J.T. That is right. Thyatira is the end of the priesthood, of one order of things, and Philadelphia is the beginning of another. There is a little light here; the milch-kine are not women, but it is a feminine idea; they are milk-bearers and they have calves; they are occupied in a living way, contributing. They are the ones here that represent the spiritual element -- they go right along by the one way.
E.G.McA. Although they were milk providers, they would not now use that for the natural but for the maintenance of the spiritual.
J.T. That is the principle; we have the spiritual element here, so that they go on without any guide, and they go the right way. It is God guiding them.
Ques. Why does it say she did not answer the women or take it to heart?
J.T. She accepted it that she was dying, there was no hope. She died in faith: she had power in saying what she did, "And these all, having obtained witness through faith, did not receive the promise" (@Hebrews 11: 39); she is like that. It is a very little glimmer, but it is there. If you have a little strength, God takes account of that and makes much of it;
{304}
if there is none elsewhere, the more will be made of it. If there is nothing much around but you have a little, the more will be made of it. If a thing is scarce it will be honoured.
A.R. Do you think there is some instruction in this in regard of our going home to be with the Lord? With Eli there is complete prostration, but there is moral power in the wife of Phinehas.
J.T. That is the way to look at it, "She bowed herself". It is said of the Lord in John that His death was an act of power; He dismissed His spirit. He was not expiring as if He could not help it, but He dismissed it in an act of power.
A.R. The two milch-kine are doing Kohathitish work.
J.T. That is what they are doing, carrying the ark.
A.R. And yet they are producing food which belongs to the land; the land flowed with milk and honey.
J.T. Just so, very good; we get that later -- milk and honey. That is good because it is a heavenly thought.
J.H. In chapter 6, verse 9, the lords of the Philistines say, "And see, if it go up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, it is he who has done us this great evil; if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that touched us; it was a chance that happened to us". God evidently answers in this way.
J.T. There is something in those priests; we cannot say very much about it, but for the moment anyway they are under divine pressure, as in the case of Dagon. They are saying right things; their minds are running in right channels; the Philistine element is not there; they are not big men. God had already brought in what effected this among them, that is, the fall of Dagon. Things were going down with them, but the Israelites were not doing it; it was God,
{305}
that is the point just now. God can do things, He can bring the ark back without the Israelites, without the priests.
Rem. God recognises a certain lack of intelligence on the part of the Philistines in that He allowed the ark to come back on the cart, while in David's time there was a breach made when that was done.
J.T. There is a want of intelligence, but not a want of instinct; the instinct is there without the intelligence, and God honoured the instinct. The kine refer to instinct; they could not speak, they could low; they could make a noise for their calves. It is not a priestly position, but there is, nevertheless, an evidence of the work of God on the line of instinct. That is what the lower creatures represent usually in the types, the instinct they have.
S.McC. Do you think there is a suggestion in the golden jewels and golden images of how in the last century there was recovery of the truth of the Person of the Lord? Religious minds were tending to attach to certain fixed ideas, like the Athanasian creed and the like.
J.T. There was a general movement of God. Unconverted men even took on the truths that were revived, and the study of this chapter is important in that they have a certain knowledge, these priests of the Philistines. It is said in verse 2, "And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners" (not the military men; they have the idea of the priesthood); "saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? tell us wherewith we shall send it to its place. And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel", (notice the fine expressions they have; they are not opposing the Israelites for the moment) "send it not empty". God had told the Israelites they were not to come before Him empty. It is remarkable that men like that should have the idea of trespass; they are not vaunting themselves.
{306}
God has turned the tables against them; Dagon had fallen down before the ark. Someone has some intelligence; what would christendom be if there was not something in it? Even the Roman Catholics have something; one could find certain times when they speak the real truth.
E.G.McA. Would you suggest that while the exercise is going on, represented by the dying of this woman, God is preserving His Christ? I mean He is typified in the ark in the Philistine hands, and eventually it would be seen how God worked in the recovery of the ark. At the present time in the history of the church there does not seem to be a great regard for the Person of Christ, but God has preserved Him. He has brought Him back to those who really hold the truth in exercise. God works out the thing through the Philistines, in adverse circumstances and opposition.
J.T. Quite so. The truth of the Lord's Person is spreading, the truth of sonship and eternal life too. The truth of sonship is of special prominence; the whole of christendom has been affected, and they are speaking of it. Where did they get it? God is there; God can go where we cannot go. God has access where we have not access, and they are talking about God here; they are not talking about Dagon. They are talking about righteousness, because they speak of a trespass offering.
G.A.T. Would there be any connection between the Philistines asking what to do with the ark and Pilate asking what to do with Jesus?
J.T. Just so. There was someone there to give him the answer, if he had only listened. His wife gave him good advice; she was the overcomer in his house, and these cattle are the overcomers in the Philistine world, and Phinehas wife is the overcomer in a defeated Israel. In a time of darkness and disaster, she is an overcomer; she has light in her
{307}
soul and she has power; she dies in power. But Ichabod is living; Ichabod did not die, and that is the idea. God is now operating. Ichabod is not used; it is a question of what he represents negatively, and God is going to bring in the positive in these cows. They are not Ichabod, they are not radiating a negative idea; it is a productive idea. They are milch-kine and they have calves, it is a living suggestion, and they go on the right way. It is a living God we are dealing with now in these cows.
E.G.McA. Would you say that as a result of the recovery coming in the joy that is seen in verse 13 is amongst us now? "And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping the wheat-harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it".
J.T. They got light too.
A.R. The priestly service commences to function somewhat in that as soon as the ark got back they presented an offering.
J.T. Just so; the ark coming back is the next point. It says they "rejoiced", which is right, as has been remarked, "And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite" (notice, the *cart*) "and stood there; and a great stone was there. And they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine as a burnt-offering to Jehovah. And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah" (verses  14, 15). Now we are on known ground, we have Levites; not priests yet, but according to God they are priests. Now we are getting on safe ground, but yet it is a very feeble condition because God is coming in governmentally and slaying them because they have looked into the ark. They are like Unitarians, they looked into the ark rudely. God deals with that and the ark is carried up into the house of Abinadab, but we have to await David and Solomon for the full result, and they are assuredly coming.
{308}
Rem. Is this what was going on in the first epistle to the Corinthians? The ark did not have its place.
J.T. That is it. To make the thing practical, it corresponds with the early elements in recovery; the great evangelical movement came in in the eighteenth century with Wesley and many others well known; I believe it would correspond somewhat with light breaking in. Yet there was not the order of God, the system that God has established in Christ in heaven; the priests and the Levites were not understood. These men carried on the clerical principle, but still there was something there that God was doing, and ultimately we have the true idea of Christ and the assembly. This comes in suggestively under David, as in @Psalm 78: "And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved; and he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever" (verses  67 - 69). It is clear that @Psalm 78, written by an experienced man, gathers the whole matter together. It is by Asaph, a great singing man; he is the author of most of the psalms in that third book of Psalms. He was himself a great leader under David, a man that had right feelings in all this. So that we go back in the historical part of the psalm and we see from the light that Asaph gives us that God was operating here with a view to bringing the ark back. We must not despise what these cows represent; if we see a brother or sister with instincts, although they are not breaking bread, we do not despise them; we test them out as to what they think about the ark.
G.A.T. They are carrying the thing in the right way; persons are turning their faces the right way if they are looking toward breaking bread.
J.T. Quite so; and these kine have something to give, some milk and some calves; it is a living state of things although not regulated by intelligence.
{309}
When we come to the assembly Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons" (@1 Corinthians 10: 15); the milch-kine do not represent that, but they represent instinct.
A.B. Is there something in what the Philistines say in verses 8 and 9: "And send it away that it may go. And see, if it go up by the way of its own border"? It is not exactly the milch-kine, it is the prerogative of the ark itself.
J.T. Just so; the "it" is the ark.
G.A.T. I would like to get a little more help as to a brother or sister turning their faces the right way and yet not breaking bread, as to how we should act towards them.
J.T. You have respect for them; you may as well tell them the whole truth, because these milch-kine were going to die. We shy at that.
G.A.T. What does that mean?
J.T. It means that the road we are on is that we are going to die -- to enter on it fully we have to die, "Daily I die". Paul says (@1 Corinthians 15: 31); he was working on those lines all the time. If you tell this to persons of that kind, you are very apt to turn them aside; but that is the truth, we have to come to death. In New York we have often talked about how many persons have passed through our hands, promising men and women; they just disappear in time. They come to see what is really meant, that it is an out-of-the-world position and they have to accept death for it; that is what these cows had to come to.
A.R. The cows are doing true Kohathitish work. Every Kohathite that carries the ark ought to be prepared to die.
J.T. Quite so.
E.G.McA. You told us something of that last night when you spoke about the new tongues; you led us on to death.
{310}
J.T. Quite so; tell us more.
E.G.McA. I gathered from what you said last night that if we spoke with new tongues it was according to the stand we had taken in fellowship, and it simply meant death to all that the old tongue spoke of.
J.T. Quite so.
J.W. Where is the ministry of Samuel during this?
J.T. That is another thing, he is out of sight for the moment, but you may be sure he is with God; there is not a word about him from chapter 4 to chapter 7, which is remarkable, but it suggests the resources that God has. God is saying, These cows are not really what I have, and the wife of the priest is dead; well, what is God going to go on with? The cows die too. But God has His Samuel, He has him under protection, and He is going to bring him out, that is what you get in chapter 7; as soon as you come to Samuel he knows what to do.
G.A.T. Does this suggest the private life of Jesus before He comes out in the ministry?
J.T. Yes, that is it. God has His man in reserve; Samuel knows what to do. If the Philistines attack, he does not bring the ark in; he brings a sucking lamb in and God thundered on the Philistine; God did that, but Samuel knew what to do first. That is the next thing.
Ques. Are these matters the working out of the words of Samuel?
J.T. Quite so; you may be sure he is saying things that the Spirit of God has not been pleased to tell us; we know that he must have been saying things; he is a prophet of the Lord, and he was not silent you may be sure. He may have had Bible readings, for all we know! There were Bible readings away back in 1820 before Mr. Darby came on the scene, in this country and Ireland and Scotland. I
{311}
only allude to that to show that God has these secret things; His Spirit is operating all the time.
E.G.McA. Do you mean by that that as the result of the way God worked this out, we are sitting here this morning in the truth of the teaching of Samuel typically, the ark having been recovered from the hands of the Philistines?
J.T. There is something going on, and we must have eyes to see and ears to hear. Samuel will not be quiescent with this condition, but God is not pleased to tell us what he is saying; God draws a veil over that until chapter 7, and then you get Samuel and he knows what to do.
J.W. Would there be concurrent lines in the return of the ark and the underlying ministry of Samuel?
J.T. That is the point; what God is going on with secretly.
J.H. Samuel says "to all Israel" when he is an old man, "I have walked before you from my youth up to this day. Here I am: testify against me before Jehovah", @1 Samuel 12: 2, 3.
J.T. That indicates his service; it was certainly a prophetic service and a priestly one too; he was not a priest; he was a prophet, but he acted as a priest, "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge", @Malachi 2: 7. And if you look at chapter 7 you will see at once how he meets the position. It says in verse 5, "And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray Jehovah for you. And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day" (he did not tell them to do this; it is a commandment of God, but he is leading in it), "and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah". Light is breaking in from the priest. And then it says, "And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah". He is a judge now as well as a prophet -- a man that could
{312}
do anything that required to be done in an emergency. "And the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah; and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel; and the children of Israel heard it, and were afraid of the Philistines. And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. And Samuel took a sucking-lamb", that is very beautiful; they knew what he could do, they knew he had power with God; "and offered it as a whole burnt-offering to Jehovah; and Samuel cried to Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah answered him. And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines advanced to battle against Israel. And Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were routed before Israel" (verses  5 - 10). That is Samuel, so that we are on the line of victory now.
But we have to go on to the young sisters for a little while in chapter 9. God gives the different feminine phases in this history for our profit and guidance. This chapter tells us about Saul and Saul's father, it gives us his long genealogy; and what comes out is that there were lost asses, another phase of weakness, and Saul is sent by his father to find the asses. He takes his servant with him and he does not find them. God, in this simple way, is exposing Saul before he comes into the kingdom, so that faith will understand what may be expected. It is still the judicial dealing of God in setting up a king like this, but he is giving faith an inkling of what may be expected. He did not find the asses, and now he is going to find Samuel. How is he going to find Samuel? Well, he needs guidance. "As they went up to the ascent to the city, they met maidens going forth to draw water" (verse 11). These are young sisters occupied profitably. They are going to draw
{313}
water, like Rebecca, suggesting church material in youthfulness, "And they said to them, Is the seer here?" Notice the word 'seer', a man that sees, which is so much needed because Saul did not have that power, "And they answered them and said, He is; behold, he is before thee: make haste now; for he came today to the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place. As soon as ye come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people eat not until he has come, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterwards they eat that are invited. And now go up; for this very day shall ye find him. And they went up into the city. As they were coming into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel was coming out towards them, to go up to the high place" (verses  11 - 14). Well now, this passage introduces what is most remarkable, because it is for young sisters, as to what they are occupied with. If there are meetings going on, or brothers coming or going, or if there is a new book of ministry, they know and they can guide others. They are not occupied frivolously; they are occupied with this great event, that Samuel is in that town and they know all about his movements and what he does. They say, so to speak, Now you go that way and you will find him; they are definite.
A.B. The words of Samuel did not fall to the ground, but had found a resting place in the hearts of these maidens; like Rhoda when Peter was released from prison, it says she recognised the voice of Peter.
J.T. These sisters belong to Rhoda's class and she belongs to them. It is a remarkable word coming in to the book of Samuel, of a piece with the structure of the book. We must have the young sisters; we must have them with us, not coming to these meetings for natural causes, but coming in relation to Samuel. Samuel is the man of God, and he does
{314}
things, and they know what he does and why he is there: If you go that way you will find him, they say.
C.C.T. These maidens are very busy drawing water; I suppose that is the reason they were able to give a sure answer.
J.T. They are quite sure; they were guides.
A.R. They were up-to-date in church history; they were talking about 'today', the word is used four times.
J.T. Very good.
J.W.D. We never find that men drew water in the Old Testament; it is a peculiar feature of women's service, I suppose it was connected with this feast.
J.T. Clearly; they were definite in what they were doing. Deborah speaks about "the places of drawing water" (@Judges 5: 11); they were going to draw water and here is a needy man and they can tell him exactly what he wants and where to find it.
Rem. They did not volunteer the information; they answered.
J.T. Just so, very seemly, just as Rebecca did, she responded to the servant. They are very definite; they say, "Make haste now, for he came today to the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place. As soon as ye come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people eat not until he has come, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterwards they eat that are invited". What a perfect knowledge they had of the whole ritual, because that is what it is; there is ritual to christianity; we ought to know what is to be done.
J.W. It is a remarkable thing that Saul does not seem to have any knowledge of Samuel; his servant alludes to the seer and the servant provides the offering.
J.T. Just so; he is a 'yes' man here; he had no initiative.
{315}
C.C.T. "And now go up", they say (verse 13). Do the maidens command Saul?
J.T. It is a word that fits in there; the men needed guidance and they are getting the guidance. You know how comforting it is if you miss your way and someone can tell you it definitely and surely. The word 'way' is really christianity in the book of Acts.
Ques. Would you say that the activity of these maidens is really levitical in principle?
J.T. Just so; they are guides.
M.B. Is it a reflection on Saul that he was unable to recognise the greatest man of his day when he met him?
J.T. Well, the Spirit of God has recorded all this for faith. You might think God is coming in for Saul; but faith would discern beforehand that it was not so; there must be a David, the way must be made for David. David is mentioned in the book of Ruth and faith would look for him.
J.W.D. In @1 Corinthians 11 there is something that a woman alone can do in connection with contributing to the assembly that a man cannot do for her. I was thinking of the women's service in the Old Testament, women drawing water. But in @1 Corinthians 11 we have the order in creation, and this has relation to the Lord's supper. If the women do not take this up, no one can do it for them; a feature of the house will be missing. I mean woman's attitude to the man and having the head covered.
J.T. They are to do the thing; quite so.
J.W.D. It is something that falls essentially within the range of their service like drawing water.
J.T. Yes.
A.B. Is there something in the fact that where the overseer is referred to in @1 Timothy 3 the word 'ministers' in verse 8 involves sisters, the footnote
{316}
having a reference to Phoebe in @Romans 16? I was wondering whether these young maidens were an asset to Samuel in relation to his own overseership.
J.T. They were serving Samuel too, you mean. Quite so.
J.H. Their ability to answer the question as to the seer and their drawing water would show spirituality on the inward side.
J.T. That is what I thought we might see; there was intelligence. The milch-kine represent one feminine feature -- that is instinct, motherly instinct, and they yielded milk. Here there is a contribution on the same line, but it is another feature, a feature of agile intelligence, youthful intelligence. They know exactly what is happening that day, 'today' is mentioned several times; they are up-to-date spiritually, they have a full knowledge of what is up to the very minute in what God is doing.
J.H. You were saying a seer is one who sees?
J.T. We are told the difference between a seer and a prophet: "In former time in Israel, when a man went to ask counsel of God, he said, Come and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was in former time called a Seer" (verse 9). An allusion is made to the change-over in the use of the word. The word 'seer' is a man who sees; a prophet is a man who speaks for God. It is the same sort of thing, but it looks as if there was advance in the use of the language. Progress in the testimony necessitates fresh words, fresh designations, so that the divine vocabulary is enlarged. It is remarkable that the change comes in here in this setting.
J.H. The idea of the seer is not dropped, is it?
J.T. Not at all; only you have two thoughts instead of one. The word 'prophet' is more dignified as representative of God, "He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a
{317}
prophet's reward" (@Matthew 10: 41), showing that a prophet had acquired a great status in the testimony.
J.H. Would these thoughts be necessary in a meeting for prophetic ministry?
J.T. Just so; we need to see who the prophets are and designate them.
J.C. Are the two thoughts linked up with Jeremiah? The question is asked of him, "What seest thou?" @Jeremiah 1: 11 and @Jeremiah 13; @Jeremiah 24: 3.
J.T. He shows he is a prophet; he sees and can name things as he sees them.
{318}
FEMININE FEATURES IN 1 SAMUEL (4)
@1 Samuel 18: 6, 7, 17 - 21
J.T. We have been anticipating the advent of David and now we have reached it in the order of this book, and what has been before us ought to prepare us for the anointing, which has been, dwelt upon in speaking of chapter 2. In this chapter David typifies Christ as drawing out our affections and our praises. We may look also at the narrative of his anointing in chapter 16: 11 - 13. We have really come to the realm of love in the book; and in all God's operations and the fields in which they are we must make room for love and its activity, bringing out persons who can love and who appreciate what is lovable. David is mentioned here by name, "The Spirit of Jehovah came upon David", @1 Samuel 16: 13. We are reminded of the incident afforded in the synoptic gospels, how that when Jesus was baptised and the windows of heaven were opened to Him a voice announced heaven's delight in Him and the Spirit of God came upon Him in the form of a dove. David here really corresponds in type with the expression "beloved" as we read of the Lord Jesus. "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", @Matthew 3: 17. God has in type reached a point of rest now in this book.
As we proceed into chapter 17, and throughout chapter 18, we have love, masculine love first, and then feminine love; but David is the lovable one. So that this afternoon we might be engaged with this side of the subject, and challenge our hearts as to whether we appreciate lovable persons, those lovable not from the standpoint of nature, which is apt to enter into these occasions, the natural feelings of young people; the Spirit of God resents that, especially as when we are convened. All that is contrary
{319}
or extraneous should then be shut out that there may be room for the real thing -- the real quality -- what is called "the greatest of these". We may well challenge our hearts as to whether we can name what is lovable and whether we are among the lovable persons. We cannot expect, it would be unfair to expect, that we should be interesting to the brethren unless we are lovable.
S.McC. Would you say a word as to the difference between David, the meaning of his name being "beloved", and Jedidiah, meaning "beloved of Jehovah"?
J.T. That is the name given to Solomon: "beloved of Jehovah"; it is an interesting link. That name was prophetic, I would say; this is historical, but David is really a lovable person by his conduct. Solomon had not done anything yet when the name was given; as to him it is a prophetic thought.
S.McC. How would you place the two in the New Testament, the idea of David, the beloved, and what we have in Solomon?
J.T. I think David represents what is especially lovable. Christ made a point of presenting Himself to the disciples as risen from the dead; He presented Himself living; that is, He takes an attitude towards the brethren for a purpose: He presented Himself living so as to affect them. The Song of Songs is the opening up of this; the point of it is the working of love, the outward display of love so that it should become reciprocal. It is a book of reciprocal affections. The Lord laid the way in showing us how to love and how to be lovable, that is, you are worth loving. Hence He selects John, and the Spirit of God tells us through John himself that he was the one whom Jesus loved, I think David presents that side; it is a historical matter that he was a lovable person. He is first mentioned historically as a person, meaning he is really that at once as he comes before you,
{320}
because that is what the Spirit says of him, "For he was a youth, and ruddy, and besides of a beautiful countenance" (chapter 17: 42). That is how he presents himself, not that his attitude is the point, but you cannot help seeing it as he is there.
Well now; as to Solomon: as Paul says of Jacob and Esau, there was nothing good or bad in the children before God pronounced His thought of them: "I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau", @Romans 9: 13. That was the historical result of what was there in those two children before they were born; one was lovable and the other was not. Esau was not lovable, whereas Jacob was lovable; that was prophetic; the historical part had not come in yet, but it would come, and it is Malachi that is quoted there. So Jedidiah is a prophetic name, "And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake", @2 Samuel 12: 25. But David gives him another name; he had good ground for knowing that he would be a Solomon, a man of peace, for that had been announced to him before, but Jedidiah had not been announced to him before. That name did not appear before; that was from Jehovah Himself at that particular time. All that would come out in Solomon came into his mind, that he would be lovable. Jehovah loved him in a prophetic sense you might say, because of what would come out in him; I think that is the way it stands. So it is with ourselves: God knows what will come out in us; though in one sense we are all lovable, "chosen ... in him" (@Ephesians 1: 4), and "taken ... into favour in the Beloved" (verse 6). That is, "beloved" is the idea, the great thought of God, and we are "taken ... into favour in the Beloved" -- that is David. I do not think we are accepted in Solomon. It is the word 'beloved' in @Ephesians 1: 6: "He has taken us into favour in the Beloved".
{321}
G.A.T. Do you think we ought to be exercised that we should do things that would be lovable amongst the brethren?
J.T. Yes, but that of which I am speaking now is really the principle of election: "elect of God". We are to be "holy and blameless before him in love" (verse 4). If I understand the idea of the foreknowledge of God, it is that He sees what you are in the picture, a prospective picture, what a product you will be. That is what He loves; He selects you because of that.
A.R. The power of attraction is very extensive; I think the word 'love' is used about five times in chapter 18. It is love's chapter, you might say.
J.T. That is right; that is what I thought, and I thought we might have it before us because it belongs to this line of things. If you do not make room for love you are failing. Love never fails, and we must make room for it and for what it is to be lovable.
S.McC. "But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them" (verse 16).
J.T. Yes, he had shown himself. He is not like the Pope. Who knows what he is like, unless you knew him when he was young? When he becomes Pope very few see him, but a lovable person is to be displayed. So Moses thought of display in proposing to Jehovah who was to be leader in @Numbers 27; he says, "Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in" (verse 16). Let him "go out" and "come in before them" first, before he is recognised as a leader; let him show himself.
T.S. Is that the same basis as the choice of Matthias in the beginning of Acts?
{322}
J.T. Yes, he was one of those who had 'assembled' with the brethren; 'assembled' is a verb; it is not simply that he was there, but he assembled during "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among" them (@Acts 1: 21); he would be a man like that. He would see beauty, he would see apostolic power in the Lord Jesus; that is a question of the testimony. It is the same thing in @Numbers 27: Moses had in his mind that the man that was to replace him when he died was to go out and come in before Israel; that is our matter. Every Israelite ought to know Joshua, because he went out and in before them; he led them out and brought them in; so that the leaders amongst us must indicate that they are lovable personalities. Let all see them and then you have confidence in them, proving what you see in them.
S.McC. That is very interesting because the same thing applies in David; when you come to the second book it says in chapter 5, "Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel" (verse 2).
J.T. Yes; that was good ground for making him king, or anointing him; but what is before us now is the *person* going out and in so that you can see him; and that is what the Lord does as risen in the Acts. According to Luke's presentation, He "presented himself living".
A.B. It says in chapter 27 of Numbers, "And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him, by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in" (verse 21); the note says, 'mouth' -- at his mouth. Is that a further thought, or is that the result of what has preceded?
J.T. The question is who the person is there; it is, I suppose, what comes from the Urim. The priest would have to say the thing; Joshua would stand in
{323}
relation to the priest, as I understand it, but there may be a question in the original as to who is referred to in the "his"; but anyway the place is in relation to the Urim, and it is a question of light; and the priest is brought into the movement. So that Joshua and Eleazar go together as Moses and Aaron went together. Anyway, the idea is there in the movement in and out.
J.H. Would this going out and coming in be seen in Samuel? It is said he walked before the people from his youth.
J.T. That is the point. He is calling attention to what they saw.
J.H. Would it be right to carry it on to the Lord Jesus, John the baptist taking account of Him walking?
J.T. Yes, that comes out in @John 1: first in verse 29, how He walks toward John, so that John names Him; he names Him by His walk -- the sacrificial walk; that is what is meant. The Lamb of God is sacrificial, and He is mentioned coming to John. But in the next statement where John is standing and Jesus is walking it is the name 'Lamb' still, but He is not coming to John; the sacrificial thought is in abeyance. It is a question of the Person, and he calls attention to Him. He says, "Behold the Lamb of God", without saying any more. The next speakers, in answering Christ say, "Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher)". That is not sacrificial, that is teaching, they have still another thought. They must have seen something in Him so that they recognise Him as a Teacher. That is a general thought, not Rabboni, my Teacher, but Rabbi.
J.W.D. "The Spirit of Jehovah came upon David from that day forward". Do you link that up only with Christ personally? Or is there some sense in which the light of David breaks into the soul, and
{324}
desire of heart awakens in that connection, and then the Spirit of Jehovah will come upon us in that extended sense?
J.T. Do you mean a believer now?
J.W.D. That I might be lovable; I suppose every one of us would like to be lovable. The Spirit of Jehovah would seem to link on with the thought of supporting that as He comes upon David.
J.T. Yes; David would be maintained in his lovableness by the Spirit.
A.R. He became lovable through moral qualities, because Saul was still on the throne and really should have been the leader; but here is a man winning the hearts of the saints, not by what he is naturally like Saul, but by what he is morally.
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Would you say that his early years would be seen as a help in developing his lovable qualities?
J.T. That would come out. That is a point that he makes himself, a point in which Eliab would discredit him. Eliab would set aside his strong point; he says, "With whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?" (chapter 17: 28). He says it in scorn, as if David was neglectful; he implied that he was neglectful, but he was not; he had left them with a keeper; his shepherdly qualities were there. But what we are aiming at now is what attracts the women in the type; we are dealing with the feminine side in this book and we have alluded to chapter 18, how the subjective side has an object, that is, love has. We are now come into the realm of love in this book, and we are to learn how to be in it, whether in a masculine or feminine way; and the first person said to have loved David here is Jonathan. Michal loved him too, but Jonathan loved him and all Israel loved him, and all Judah loved him. The women are said to have come out in verse 6 of chapter 18: "And it came to pass as they came, when David
{325}
returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambours, with joy, and with triangles". David is supremely their object, not in any single personal way as Michal loved him, but they were praising him; they were occupied with him because of his prowess, because of his victory over the giant; but lovableness was already attained in chapter 16; it is already a sequence. He was a lovable person, a person to be praised.
C.C.T. Is the singing and the dancing an outcome of love?
J.T. You feel that love enters into it. Applied in the antitype, it is love for Christ, and as Paul suggests, it is a collective idea which you do not get in Romans exactly; it is in Corinthians. Paul is aiming to attract the hearts of the Corinthians in a collective sense, "For I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11: 2. That is a great general thought that enters into the epistle to the Corinthians. It enters into the assembly, and I think that corresponds with what we have here, how David was acquiring that place, drawing out the affections and praises of the women.
Ques. Would the idea of the women suggest maturity?
J.T. 1 Corinthians develops the idea of feminine maturity, womanhood. We have already alluded to Chloe -- she was a watchful person; the Lord says, "But what I say to you, I say to all, Watch", @Mark 13: 37. She had discernment and sent a word to Paul that saved the saints in Corinth; she would be a model. You may be sure she would correspond with @1 Corinthians 11 where the subject comes up as to headship from God to Christ, and Christ to man, and man to woman; the main thought is the woman
{326}
in view of the Lord's supper, in view of Christ acquiring His own proper place in the hearts of the brethren collectively. You get womanhood there outlined, and the apostle appeals to woman first as to a covering. The word 'covering' means covered as illustrated in Rebecca in @Genesis 24; she took a veil to cover herself in view of Isaac's presence. As soon as she hears it is he, hears his name -- for the servant says, "That is my master!" not "my master's son" any more, but "my master" -- she "took the veil, and covered herself" (verse 65). Well, we are coming to the Lord's supper, and the veil has a place. In @Genesis 20: 16 Abimelech bought a veil for Sarah. He says, You have not had one; it is a reproof. He said aright; she needed a veil so that she should not become attractive to others. The Corinthians were not to become exposed to others in looseness; the idea of the veil is a covering. The idea in 1 Corinthians is authority; authority is what comes down in the way of command; you are under authority. Now Sarah did not have that kind of thing on her head at all according to what we have in @Genesis 20. In chapter 18 she called Abraham "lord"; Peter tells us about that (@1 Peter 3: 6); but in chapter 20 before Abimelech she says she is Abraham's sister, which was not a true representation of the facts at all. It exposed her. So that the true idea is to be clothed with what indicates that you are espoused to one man, and you do not pay attention to others. We are to be to Another, to Him that is raised from the dead. The veil in @1 Corinthians 11 is clearly to protect the saints from looseness in regard of the Lord's supper, because it is there that the Lord Jesus is presenting His great love to us -- "This is my body which is given for you", @Luke 22: 19. It is a marriage ceremony; it is like a covenant He has made between the assembly and Himself. The covering on the head is to preclude looseness.
{327}
E.G.McA. I think you referred that to the long hair in Detroit.
J.T. It is given as a veil in nature. That was a good reason, as the apostle says, why he should impress them with the need of having a covering.
Rem. In the opening chapters of Corinthians do we, so to speak, get the names of the other sons of Jesse, and then David is brought in; in chapter 11 David is given his place?
J.T. Very good; they were big men in the early chapters of the epistle.
A.B. You were referring to Luke earlier. Is this principle brought out there in relation to the Lord in chapter 3: "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (verse 22)? In chapter 7 in the house of the Pharisee the woman comes to light utilising her hair in relation to the headship of Christ. In chapter 8, three women are brought in in relation to Christ.
J.T. That is most instructive, especially as in Luke. It is a gathering up of assembly material in subjection, so that in chapter 8 you have the women who accompanied Him and ministered to Him of their substance, and they are like wives, like the virtuous woman of Proverbs; the Lord is known through them.
J.H. Is it not remarkable that whilst they came out to meet king Saul, they should celebrate David in this way?
J.T. It is on the same line as Eli, on the line of replacement, or I might say, displacement. The idea is that Saul is tasting the bitterness of displacement; not simply that God is setting him aside, but David is morally setting him aside and the women are doing it. The women have the mind of God; they have not gone the whole way yet, they are ascribing something to Saul, but that has to come to an end.
{328}
G.A.T. Do you get something like this in @John 5 where the Lord healed the man at the pool and the man later went out and told the Jews that it was Jesus, and after that they wanted to kill Him? Would there be the same spirit of jealousy there as with Saul?
J.T. Yes; quite so. Wherever there is jealousy you may be sure there is something to be jealous of -- "Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol", @Song of Songs 8: 6. "Jealous" is one of the names of God. But here it is satanic; the jealousy of Saul is awful. He proposes that David is to be his son-in-law through one of his daughters, as it says, "Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time" (verse 21), which probably means he was professedly son-in-law in his engagement to Merab who was given to someone else; but now he is to be engaged to Michal. But what has he in mind? He was going to use his second daughter to slay David. That is murder and hate, but love is in the chapter.
G.A.T. Are you emphasising the seriousness of engagements?
J.T. Just so; it is a covenant.
G.A.T. What do you think is so serious about engagements?
J.T. Saul inferred that the engagement to Merab meant that David was his son-in-law potentially anyway. He says here, "Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time". The first time must have been the engagement to Merab, that she was to be given to him; he says, "Behold my eldest daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife" (verse 17), as if that was settled. The "second time" would allude to the first sort of engagement to Merab, but she was given to someone else, showing that Saul was a truce-breaker. It says, "And it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite
{329}
as wife" (verse 19). It was the prerogative of the father to give his daughter and he did it clearly; he had some motive for that. And then he gives him Michal, so that he says, You will be my son-in-law a second time; he is deceiving David in order to kill him. That is hatred in the presence of the realm of love.
C.C.T. In the realm of love the enemy commences to work: it says in verse 9, "And Saul eyed David from that day and forward". The enemy goes to work as soon as love goes to work.
J.T. That is the Lord's supper, that is what we are seeking to bring out as to Corinth. It is the Lord's supper that brings out the love of Christ. His peculiar love for the saints, "This is my body which is given for you", @Luke 22: 19.
S.McC. In our own times, do you think the enemy has employed the Churches of England and of Rome along these lines in relation to Christ?
J.T. I think that is right, because Michal really did love David; and I have always considered that the Anglican system has some regard for Christ, and I believe God has honoured it; but of course it will come to nothing in the same way that Michal became untruthful. The Church of England is becoming worse and worse, gradually being displaced.
S.McC. I was thinking of what the Lord has in a feminine way, how we should be concerned as to this over against these pretentious systems that the enemy is using in hate against Him. It is a very real matter.
J.T. It is indeed. We were speaking about this out in the West and it came to us that the devil may give one a wife. A brother may get a wife from the devil, or a sister may get a husband from the devil -- that is this -- that is Merab or Michal. Saul is deliberately giving him Michal in order to destroy him. The contrast is. "Whoso hath found a wife hath found a good thing", @Proverbs 18: 22. David is not looking
{330}
for Michal or Merab, it is Saul's work. We have to look out how marriage is proposed in that way; is the devil doing it or is it the Lord?
G.A.T. Would the idea of the devil be to destroy in the brother or sister what would be spiritual?
J.T. Exactly, spoil them for the testimony. Look how many we have had to refuse to walk with because of unholy alliances with worldly people!
Ques. Do you think Pergamos is Merab? Does she represent what went on in that assembly?
J.T. Undoubtedly; that is where Rome began to develop as it is today.
F.M. It says in verse 10, "And it came to pass the next day that an evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house". What is your thought in connection with that?
J.T. I would call that a judicial act of God. We get in chapter 19 another reference to Saul prophesying. It says in verse 19, "And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth by Ramah. Then Saul sent messengers to take David; and they saw a company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as president over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied"; and then in verse 24 Saul prophesied himself, I read that so that we might get the context of the passage. The Spirit of God came upon a man like Saul just as He came on Balaam; that is the Spirit of God taking hold of a man and using him according to His pleasure. That is a great matter to keep before us today, the kind of men God may use in this terrible conflict. In chapter 18 it is a bad spirit, that is an awful thing, that is judicial. Saul is so degenerate that he eyed David in murderous jealousy and God allowed the wicked spirit to come
{331}
upon him, and we are told, "He prophesied in the midst of the house, but David played with his hand, as on other days; and the spear was in Saul's hand. And Saul cast the spear and thought, I will smite David and the wall"; it is a wicked spirit. Paul says to the Corinthians, "No one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus", @1 Corinthians 12: 3. It is a wicked spirit that is in Saul in this verse, but it is the Spirit of God in chapter 19. That is a very remarkable thing, how God acts. If a man goes on a certain line you get judicial action and a wicked spirit, and that is what is going to happen to christendom; that is how it is going to finish up. Saul enquired of a wicked spirit and Samuel was brought up to him; Samuel is brought up to rebuke him, but he is led to enquire of a spirit of Python. If we play with these things, judicial action is sure to come. If we cultivate hateful thoughts, God might let it be that way, and you will die that way.
E.G.McA. The culmination of the career of Judas was that Satan took hold of him; he toyed with the temptation first and then Satan took possession of him. Is it not a rather incongruous situation that a man should prophesy with a spear in his hand?
J.T. It is a wicked spirit.
J.W.D. Do you think the people rise with real spiritual affection toward David, and God operates to bring to a conclusion what is evil?
J.T. How terrible it is! We are right in the love chapter, and the great person that is so attractive is here; his very name means he is a beloved person, he is attractive, and you have this awful spirit of envy in Saul so that the evil spirit comes upon him and he actually speaks in the power of an evil spirit.
J.W.D. How far would Jonathan's love be carried? Would it link with Michal's in a nominal sense?
{332}
J.T. It is more than nominal with him. David says it surpassed the love of women. He celebrates the love of Jonathan, which, I think, means that Jonathan typifies a real christian who loves Christ; but he clings to the natural and dies with his father. He is a *real* person I think.
C.C.T. There was an inward movement. It says, "The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David" (chapter 18. 1).
J.T. Quite so; he "loved him as his own soul".
G.A.T. I would like to hear what you say about what Jonathan said to Saul when he was getting ready to kill David. He says, "Why should he be put to death? what has he done?" @1 Samuel 20: 32.
J.T. He typifies a real christian who does not come into separation. He does not leave the old relationships, the relationships into which he was born, but he really loves Christ. There are many of the Lord's people like that today; they do not leave the associations into which they were born, but they are genuine.
C.C.T. What about the covenant they made? Jonathan made a covenant with David.
J.T. That was kept, too; there was a real link between David and Jonathan. With Michal I should not think there was much beyond natural affection; she despised him in her heart later. What could you think of that?
F.M. Would the evil spirit be the same as the spirit of Python?
J.T. That is the sort of thing.
Ques. What would you say about the queen of Sheba? She was attracted to Solomon.
J.T. She was a real person; of course she is a typical person. She came from the south, and the Lord takes her up Himself and compares her with the generation in the midst of which He ministered. She came from the ends of the earth, He says, to
{333}
hear the wisdom of Solomon. "A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, more than Solomon is here", @Matthew 12: 42. She came to hear it and brought things with her; there is no indication that she was other than genuine.
A.R. It was wisdom that attracted her, whereas here it is more the idea of lovability, the personality of the man that attracts. Is that right?
J.T. Just so. Well, all that was in mind for this reading was just to bring us into the realm of love, and you see how hatred comes out. The devil cannot let that go if he can get it in amongst us.
E.G.McA. Do you find these lovable persons in Philippians, and a lovable company in the Thessalonians? They are "in God the Father" in 1 Thessalonians, verse 1; that is the attractive side. Then Paul speaks of the marvellous way in which their love multiplies, and says, I learn to love you. In Philippians he nursed them as a nurse with her children. Then in Philippians, Timothy and Epaphroditus come in. One goes in the love of Christ to bring a true report down, and the other is willing to die for them. Is it along that line?
J.T. Just so. In chapter 4 of Philippians he speaks of certain women who laboured with him, and there were two of them that did not agree with one another. These are all most interesting features, because they point out the component parts of an assembly, and how we are to watch; where there is a good state of things generally, how the devil will try to come in with hatred to spoil it. That is chapter 18 here, Jonathan loved David and stripped himself; he loved him as his own soul. These women praised David and yet did not despise Saul; they praised Saul too. Michal loves David and all Israel
{334}
and Judah love him. The devil would bring in hatred, and that is what you get at Corinth. Paul says, "But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ", @2 Corinthians 11: 3; and in the verse prior to that he says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ". We are speaking of Christ and the assembly.
C.C.T. Do we get a clique in chapter 18: 22, "And Saul commanded his servants, Speak with David secretly, saying, Behold, the king has delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son-in-law". Is there not a clique formed there against David?
J.T. That is a great danger, personal friendships and under-currents to carry out some design -- some terrible design. This was to kill David.
T.S. Is love particularly in mind in Philadelphia?
J.T. Quite so; it is the lovableness of Philadelphia that is in mind, "They ... shall know that *I* have loved thee", @Revelation 3: 9.
T.S. I was thinking it especially mentions the key of David; David is brought into it.
J.T. David is brought into all these fine things in Revelation, because he represents quality and personality.
A.B. Is that not what the name Philadelphia means -- 'brotherly love' -- the love of the brethren?
J.T. Just so; that is what the Lord loves -- brotherly love. We shall become lovable as we love one another, because He loves us collectively. It is not only that He loves each of us, but He loves us collectively; that is, when we love one another we are lovable.
E.G.McA. This spirit of Saul, which he would like to have carried on in Michal, is it not seen in 2 Corinthians where some denied the place Christ
{335}
had in the ministry of Paul? It says in chapter 10: 10, "Because his letters, he says, are weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught". They were trying to belittle Paul, that Christ might not have His proper place. Is that the same spirit?
J.T. Just so, they attacked Paul; they may have said much that was right about Christ, but they attacked Paul.
G.A.T. "And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted", @2 Timothy 3: 12. Would you say that if there is such a brother or sister living piously it is not the person that the enemy is after, it is Christ?
J.T. It is the dislocation of the assembly. That is what Corinthians brings out, so that Paul makes a good deal of what was current in that assembly, "No one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12: 3. He is bringing out the spirit that operates in us. The Holy Spirit is essential to the maintenance of the collective position. You hold yourself, as sitting with the brethren, in relation to them all, hold yourself collectively, and the love that is operating makes us lovable to Christ. That is the great thought that we are at now.
J.C. It says, "And the women answered one another as they played, and said ...", @1 Samuel 18: 7. Is the idea that we should seek to stimulate each other in love in this way?
J.T. That is right. It is the way of singing that Scripture warrants, beginning with @Exodus 15. You remember the song of Moses; Moses and the children of Israel sang it. Then it says, "And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances. And Miriam
{336}
answered them", @Exodus 15: 20, 21. You do not get the male side in the singing there. It might be illustrated in the choir; it is the male and female voices. The answering refers to responses in the singing; that is what you get here, it is a responsive matter. The women are all in it, they are singing and they answer one another.
J.W.D. This matter that you are suggesting -- love collectively -- is it an abstract idea?
J.T. Just so, if we can understand what you mean by the word 'abstract'. I believe we are taken up in the first letter to Corinth as furnished in every way by God, coming behind in no gift, and when we come to the Lord's supper the apostle says, "I speak as to intelligent persons". That is what I would call abstract. He is not really saying they are all intelligent, but that they are so abstractly, because they have the Spirit. Is that what you mean?
J.W.D. I thought there was something abstract, but there was something concrete too. I might be able to think of the local company that I walk with as linking me on in some vital living way with Christ personally.
J.T. The abstract idea is really most important, because we sit down together. Your own house is one thing, and the assembly is another. We come from our houses and sit down together, and the word that applies is 'abstract'. You are regarded as intelligent persons, and moreover, we regard each other as lovable, and we are sitting, not as so many units, but collectively. We are sitting collectively with the assumption that we love; it may be just assumption, but anyway the principle is there. So the apostle says, "Purge out the old leaven", @1 Corinthians 5: 7. That is a very concrete thing, the real thing. It is to be put out as dung, "according as ye are unleavened" (verse 7). That is abstract. We hold ourselves in that way. We do not hold ourselves as sitting together
{337}
according to what I may have seen, some incongruous thing I may have observed, but keeping to the idea of love and learning to love in principle, and the Holy Spirit takes charge. Therefore the meeting begins and it increases in power.
J.W.D. That attitude of mind permits divine Persons to have a free way amongst us.
J.T. That is the idea exactly. The instruction for the Lord's supper is to set us down together with right principles, and the Holy Spirit takes on that position and enlarges it and enriches it, so that we come to more at the end than at the beginning.
A.B. You would not say the end of the second epistle is abstract, would you? The apostle says, "Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (chapter 12: 15).
J.T. Just so; it is not abstract with him, it is active.
T.S. Just what is the intent of chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians as to the outlet of love?
J.T. Oh, to show you what it is; to bring out how important it is in the economy. It is a commodity, so to speak, and when you come to the finish it says, "And now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and the greater of these is love" (verse 13). It is not the greatest, but the greater. It would seem as if the comparative degree is enough and it speaks for itself, all else is subordinate to it; "The greater of these is love". It is to bring out the greatness of the quality, what it is.
T.S. Just why does it not come in before the Supper?
J.T. The order of the truth is the public position in chapter 10, which is the fellowship; we do not get the word 'fellowship' in chapter 11, it is in chapter 10, because it is a question of our being
{338}
trustworthy when we are not under each other's eye. In chapter 11 it is the inclusive thought when we are all together, hence what we have had about headship and the feminine side; and the Lord tells us at this time in His own words what He delivered to Paul to tell us: "This is my body, which is for you" (chapter 11: 24), the utmost limit or extreme to which love went for us. But when you come to chapter 13 the apostle presents a picture of love, an account of love, a delineation of love, and almost personifies it, so that the Corinthians could at any time look at that picture and compare themselves with it, so that it might be in them. The apostle did not mean to look at it as a picture on the wall, but that it might be a concrete thing among the brethren, and in order that we might have this ministry; that our ministry meetings should be practical, not objective merely, but that a person who speaks should be an example. You sometimes feel as a brother gets up to speak, I do not know whether he is morally equal to that; he may be saying good things, and yet he is morally unequal to them. That is the idea, the persons themselves ought to be equal to what they are saying, to bring personality and quality into the assembly.
J.H. I would like to ask about this matter of love in connection with that statement in Ephesians: "he that loves his own wife loves himself" (chapter 5: 28). What does that mean?
J.T. That is a mystery that has to be understood; I do not know that it can be explained, "This mystery is great", Paul says; @Ephesians 5: 32. It is a great mystery, that very thing that you are saying, but he says, "But *I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly". It looks as if most of us married people could say, I know that by experience. But I think you would rather be transferred to Christ and the assembly, the great mystery of God, and learn the
{339}
meaning of it there, because that is what Paul had in his mind.
E.G.McA. It goes on to say, "For no one has ever hated his own flesh" (verse 29).
J.T. Quite so; you want to get the good of it, but Paul says, "*I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly". The state of humanity as it is, with which marriage is connected, is a corrupted condition, and it is not so easy to prove the thing today because it was started in an uncorrupted condition. In @Genesis 2 you get that word, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh" (verse 24), and that suggests Christ and the assembly. You cannot get it in a corrupted world now.
A.R. It is Christ and the assembly before sin came in.
J.T. It is a sinless state of things that is in mind.
R.G. The singers answer one another here; should we connect that with praise and singing prompted by others?
J.T. The word is 'respond'; the singers respond; something is sung by one set and another part by another set. Choirs really are in mind.
C.D. Is love productive in that way, especially in the Supper?
J.T. I think we get the shell of the assembly, which David and Solomon represent; the thing was already taking form in Israel. You get similar voices in 1 Chronicles in relation to David. This thing is typically leading up to the assembly as suggested in Abigail, which we shall have tomorrow if the Lord will; that is Christ and the assembly in type; Solomon, which is the full thought, will come in later. The thing is taking form as soon as you get David in power; the service of God is there in principle.
{340}
A.R. How do you hold yourself at the Supper, as loving Christ in a feminine sense or a masculine sense?
J.T. Feminine; all collective love is feminine. Jonathan represents masculine love, which would be sonship -- what we are to God, or as the brethren of Christ. That is masculine love, but collective love is feminine. We get the kernel of it here; it will come out more fully in Abigail.
A.R. @John 20 would be masculine love: "Go to my brethren and say to them" (verse 17).
J.T. Just so.
G.A.T. The end of Revelation is feminine.
J.T. That is the thought; she has made herself ready.
Rem. Abigail would not say, Saul has slain his thousands. She would leave Saul out altogether.
J.T. She would. The full thought of Abigail has not been arrived at yet, but it is beginning; they are beginning to love Christ collectively.
E.G.McA. Then in the light of being at the Supper, loving and being lovable, it says, "Let a man prove himself, and thus eat" (@1 Corinthians 11: 28); that goes farther than abstaining from evil. The Supper should test me as to whether I love and whether I am lovable.
J.T. Just so; @1 Corinthians 11 is what is in the assembly as convened; it is not what is outside.
S.McC. In the assembly, when you move from the Supper and move forward in the service and come to the family side, do you hold yourself in relation to what you are individually in relation to God's choice, or do you hold yourself in relation to the collective side still?
J.T. It would be collective after the Lord's supper, because it is the assembly and Christ. We must make room for Christ and the assembly; that is collective. Then we have the thought of the brethren
{341}
of Christ -- the "many brethren"; then we have the thought of the sons of God, that is, so many persons, but in that relation. Is that clear?
S.McC. That helps; but in the matter of sonship, do you view sonship in its totality in relation to all the sons, or that each one is a definite expression of God's wisdom and His choice in the matter?
J.T. I would not individualise it, because it is glory to God in the assembly. The sonship idea is there, the brethren of Christ. It is in the assembly, so that we are always in the sense of the collective; so many sons, but in an enclosure, because the heavenly city is an enclosure.
J.W.D. It does say in the collective setting: "When shall I come and appear before God?" @Psalm 42: 2.
J.T. That is right; that is the only setting; not that we may not worship individually, but not when we come to the assembly. There nobody should. It is a collective idea right through and goes right on to eternity. The sons of God are all one and in that setting.
A.R. The assembly would be in a false position to assume to be a son with a Father. To assume to be the only son with a Father would be false, would it not?
J.T. Usually the idea is in the plural. When God said, "Let my son go", that was Israel figuratively, but the application of 'son' is usually in the plural.
J.W.D. Would you not say that when you get up to give thanks to the Father your own personal conception of what is proper to the state of sonship enters into it? You are not expressing a collective state exactly, are you?
J.T. I should not like to say anything that I could not in principle apply to all that are present.
J.W.D. But it is your own personality?
{342}
J.T. Well, that enriches the whole company. Take Paul; supposing he was in assembly, if he got up to address God he would address Him in relation to those that were there.
J.W.D. It would be himself.
J.T. He would be able to do it better than anybody else and it would be richer because of his state; still, he would bring in all the others.
J.W.D. He would not be just a vessel for the expression of others?
J.T. I think the thought is that we get up with the collective idea. Without the Holy Spirit there is no possibility of reaching these things. Even though the measure of the saints may be small, the presence of the Spirit enlarges each one, and you are greater while you are there than you are elsewhere. The presence of the Spirit would affect everybody present and the Holy Spirit operates in that connection according to the state of all.
G.A.T. When we are speaking to the Father we use the word 'we'; in that way the one that is speaking would be the mouthpiece for all.
J.T. You would not like to speak in the singular.
S.McC. Do you see any difference between the collective position in the masculine side and the collective position in the feminine side?
J.T. There is a difference. The time after the Lord's supper ought to be properly feminine on our side; it is Christ and the assembly. But then God and the assembly has to be provided for too; that would be all masculine.
S.McC. On the feminine side it is not so many persons but one entity. On the masculine side it does involve so many persons?
J.T. It does; only the idea of the assembly is always there.
A.B. God tabernacles with men; it is always in the plural.
{343}
J.T. The assembly is there but the men are there too.
A.R. What you say is excellent. It is glory to God in the assembly. Even if we touch eternal conditions, the thought of an entity is the thing *in toto*, is it not?
J.T. Just so.
J.H. Do you think we are tested in linking on with all the saints, not only in our thoughts but in what we say, linking on with what has already been said by others?
J.T. I think so. Colossians contemplates love for all the saints, and significantly enough, the only use of the word 'Spirit' in Colossians is "love in the Spirit" (@Colossians 1: 8), so that the Spirit is in the assembly and the love is always radiated and circulated by Him. That is, the apostle's idea develops into a very concrete sense of unity and lovability in all of us. That is what makes the assembly so wonderful; it is the home of love.
E.G.McA. How do you understand the verse in @Hebrews 2: 12, "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises"? Does the Lord connect the brethren there with the assembly?
J.T. You have two thoughts; the ideas of brethren and of sons are both there. The assembly always stands; it is the great system of God. It is never abrogated at all. We never think of anything eternally other than that as to ourselves.
E.G.McA. There is no son isolated, or one brother?
J.T. Oh, no.
T.S. The closing statement of @John 17 says, "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them".
J.T. That is a good scripture to bring into what we are saying.
{344}
S.McC. What one had in mind in asking that was not so much isolation but that in sonship each one has a specific identity. It is not merged in one whole as you have on the feminine side, the assembly being one entity.
J.T. I think you are right there. The idea of the assembly is not stressed in that, but it is there nevertheless, and the glory is in that.
J.H. Do you mean the idea of greater or lesser comes into this matter of sons of God?
J.T. It would. But where love is operating you are not thinking of each other in any such sense at all. It is all on the elevating principle. Love is reigning really in the assembly. I think we should keep in mind what a great organism of God it is, for we are not so many people in space. The design is that we are to be held in the position, and that the most dignified of all positions.
J.W. Is that why Paul says in writing to the Ephesians, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" (chapter 1. 3)?
J.T. Just so, "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages" (chapter 3: 21). The word 'assembly' goes through.
A.B. Does it help to keep in mind the great culminating thought in @1 Corinthians 15: 28, "That God may be all in all"?
J.T. That is another good thing to have before us. He is all and in all in the assembly. We have to make room for the other families, but the assembly stands, so that the tabernacle of God is the idea.
N.B. What would you say about the Lord's part in the assembly service, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises"?
{345}
J.T. That shows that the Lord has a place there, I would say that comes in in the actual service after He has had His portion -- Christ and the assembly, "*I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly". But then we must make room for the Father and for God.
E.G.McA. It speaks in @Acts 20: 28 of the assembly "which he has purchased with the blood of his own". That is for God, is it not? I was wondering whether the feminine side is particularly for Christ; but when you come to sons you are under the leadership of God; it is the assembly, but rather looked at as sons.
J.T. That is right. That is what I would say.
{346}
FEMININE FEATURES IN 1 SAMUEL (5)
@1 Samuel 25: 1 - 20, 32 - 44
J.T. This chapter is the climax of our present inquiry. Abigail presents typically the full thought that is in mind. Experience is contemplated here, so that we have to assume history, preceding history, in looking into this chapter. She is a product of ministry; Samuel represents the ministry in this book. Abigail has to be taken as one who, as her own words showed, was conversant with history; she knew the history of David and the history of the opposition to him, so that she is seen as corresponding with David in a personal sense. What we noted yesterday in chapter 16 enters into this chapter as to his personal appearance and his lovability, indeed, his name means 'beloved', a word that has a great place in the Canticles. Canticles is a book which has to be taken in connection with all these types of the assembly, because it furnishes poetic forms of expression and marital forms; it is full of them; it is a love book, and is called "The song of songs, which is Solomon's". There are masculine and feminine sides there presented in the forms of expression in the book; it is typically Christ and the assembly, or Christ and Israel. God has hardly any place in it literally, so that it enters into the service of God in relation to the Lord's supper.
We rightly designated chapter 18 of 1 Samuel the love chapter, but it is the hate chapter too. Hatred is there, and the intervening chapters between that and this, between chapters 18 and 25, contemplate the bitter hatred of Saul; but David is progressing, personally progressing. In chapter 19, without referring to it formally, we have him saved by three elements inclusive of Michal; his preservation hinges on her among two other elements. First Jonathan saves him from destruction, or threatened destruction,
{347}
and then Michal, and then the prophetic ministry saves him. I am referring to all this because it enters into our subject, how love will protect Christ or what represents Him here. Christ as He is known here; and the last element used in chapter 19 to preserve David is, as I said, the prophetic ministry. Samuel is presiding, a sort of president of a college of prophets, so to speak, which is very significant, because it is real prophecy; so real that it absorbed and overwhelmed the messengers of Saul in their murderous intent, and overwhelmed Saul himself. It is real prophecy; the Spirit of God came even on Saul. That is a great feature at the present time -- it is increasing in importance -- the prophets and their ministry. We have spoken of the glory of the ministry; well, the prophetic is the most effective especially because, as here, it acts even upon unconverted people. They may remain unconverted, but for the moment they come under the power of the prophetic word and serve the purpose as did Balaam. Then what follows is Saul definitely rebuked by David; and now we come to this chapter where Samuel dies, as if to remind us that that ministry is over and what replaces it is Abigail, but Abigail and David.
J.W. Does the character of the opposition carry a different form this time as seen in Nabal?
J.T. It does. He is a churlish man; he is not attempting to slay David, but he is thoroughly against him. We have a picture of him here; it is said that he had his business in a different place from his residence, apparently he lived at Maon but his business was at Carmel; that is, he was a man of great affairs. He is said to have been very great, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. I do not know that we have anyone else spoken of whose belongings were counted in this way except Job. "And he was shearing his sheep at
{348}
Carmel. And the name of the man was Nabal" (verses  2, 3), which means a fool or an ungodly or impious person. So that it is a grievous picture -- he is an intolerable sort of person, and yet he is a Calebite, meaning he had a remarkable ancestry, showing how we may degenerate from our ancestry. He is the husband of Abigail.
Now he is seen as approached by David in a most gracious way. This is all to bring out the details of the position. It is said, "Then David sent out ten young men" (verse 5), these have to be noted too; the young men of this chapter have to be well noted because they are important. There are a great many young men now, it is remarkable how many of them appear at these meetings, and young women too; it is always a challenge as to why they are here, why they are at these meetings. I think we shall see that these are so to speak, assembly men, at least one of them is; they are with David. We are told in verse 14 that one of Nabal's young men "told Abigail", as if he understood that she was in the position to arbitrate; she is the leading person, as the assembly is the deciding body in Matthew -- the last word is there. These are important facts because we are in the presence of the assembly in type, in fulness, like the queen by the side of the king in @Psalm 45: 9, "upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir". It is the qualities of Abigail that have to be noted, but one of Nabal's young men apprised her of Nabal's rejection and of the scorn heaped upon David. These ten young men were sent to Nabal and David says to them, "And thus shall ye say, Long life to thee! and peace be to thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be to all that thou hast! And now I have heard that thou hast shearers; now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missed by them, all the while they were in Carmel. Ask thy young men, and
{349}
they will tell thee. Therefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; for we come in a good day, give, I pray thee, what thy hand may find to thy servants, and to thy son David" (verses  6 - 8). That is a beautiful address, the Spirit of Christ is in that. The young men are capable of carrying that message, so that it says, "And David's young men came, and spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased". They did not prolong their word; that is very good.
G.A.T. There is a time to speak and a time to be still.
J.T. Yes.
J.H. Abigail being of a good understanding and a beautiful countenance would be in line with what we had last night in connection with what is inward and outward.
J.T. She is presented immediately to us by the Spirit as having a good understanding and a beautiful countenance, meaning that although she had a terrible husband, a husband that would worry her life, yet she is not overcome by that; she is greater than that. It is to bring out the character of the assembly; it is not to be overwhelmed by conditions such as difficult persons to deal with.
G.A.T. Would you mind speaking a word for Nabal? Do you not think he gave a very fair reason why he should not give anything that he owned?
J.T. That is a question. We are now dealing with Christ and the assembly; David represents Christ, and his address to Nabal is very respectful and very gracious. If Nabal had pursued the history of the book, as evidently Abigail had, he would graciously bow and thankfully grant David all that he needed; but he is unworthy, he is entirely unaffected by the ministry.
G.A.T. He said he did not know, but you say he should know.
{350}
J.T. Well, David was there to be known. Did not everybody else know David?
A.B. It is interesting that the young man says in verse 14, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master". He had recognition.
J.T. How did *he* know? That is the idea. A real and exercised person will know. It is humbling when you get leading persons in the meeting who do not know what is current, because these things are to be known and the assembly has ears. Some leading brothers do not know what is going on, they are not conversant with the current history of the testimony. See what Nabal says, "Who is David?" (verse 10). That man is writing himself down as a fool, and that is what he is accounted to be; that is the meaning of his name, he is writing himself down as that. It is the Spirit of Christ that will test us out.
G.A.T. Is that the reason why the first mention of Abigail speaks of her as having understanding? She knew what was going on.
J.T. That is what I thought. It says, "The name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance" (verse 3). We have just to read the book to see that she had a most remarkable understanding.
A.R. You cannot expect to get much out of a leading brother like this when he is exploiting the brethren; he is trying to get all he can from them.
J.T. Yes; and he is not living with them. The 'Carmel' spoken of here is not the real Carmel, according to the note. The word is a park, it is a pleasant place; it may be that he lived in his business, that seems to be the idea.
A.R. That is where he is making his place of business.
J.T. Just so.
{351}
S.McC. Over against Eve and Rebecca and the other types of the assembly, how do you view Abigail?
J.T. As just what she is called, "a woman of good understanding" (verse 3), which means she is conversant with matters; she has used her mind; she was conversant with David because she knew what to say to him about himself, about the matter that had risen up against him and about other things. I believe that is why she is such a striking type of the assembly viewed as having experience with the things of God; possibly typical of the beginning of the Acts when the saints had experience with the Jewish conditions. They had to do with the Sadducees and other such conditions; the remnant of Israel was there and was still in relation to those conditions. The saints had to arrive at a judgment of them, which they did.
J.H. In the presence of all the ministry, should we not look for these features more now than ever before?
J.T. Yes; the saints have to deal with these 'fool' conditions, conditions under that influence. What is said of him is, "Nabal is his name, and folly is with him" (verse 25). The clerical system involves that, and the saints have had to do with it, and they have learned it in experience; they take on church qualities in the experience, that is, they take them on because they are to be taken on in the ministry. However weak the ministry may be, the real thing is current and the real saints are taking it on.
S.McC. So that in matters that arise in our localities, instead of going beyond the locality and writing away for help (not that one is making little of any help) we would in the light of an Abigail know what to do and how to act.
J.T. I think so. The care meeting is one thing and the ministry meeting is another; both are seen
{352}
in this chapter. The care meeting is like the young man laying the matter before Abigail, he knew the facts and placed them where they should be; he tells nobody but Abigail, apparently. The ministry meeting is what we are alluding to in chapter 19; it had already come in and it develops in her because she knows what to say and what to do. The ministry ought to help us in all these local difficulties.
G.A.T. Neither the ministry nor the messengers affected Nabal.
J.T. Well, that is just so; that is what is said. He is so churlish that Abigail herself tells us about him later. But the young man here in verse 14 says, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master" -- he knew it was the spirit of blessing and not of cursing, and that is what is to mark us, "Bless, and curse not", @Romans 12: 14. And he goes on, "and he has insulted them. And the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we companied with them". These are the young men of David; these men are current. But this is the young man of Nabal speaking, and he is giving his side of the position. He goes on, "They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them feeding the sheep. And now know and consider what thou wilt do, for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household; and he is such a son of Belial, that one cannot speak to him" (verses  14 - 17). That is his own servant saying that, so that it is a true witness of his condition. So Paul renders a true witness to the condition from which he was now seeking to detach the saints of God, that is, judaism. He says in the epistle to the Thessalonians that the Jews are against all men.
W.McK. Is it important in verse 5 to see that the greeting David sends is in his name, so that what
{353}
comes before us in assembly is in the name of the Lord Jesus?
J.T. That enters into it too. We were calling attention to the correspondence there is with the early days; it was the Nabal character and the Jewish character that Paul, generally in his ministry but especially in the epistle to the Galatians, was seeking to detach the saints from. It is said in John's gospel, "The doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews" (chapter 20: 19); it was this element. And the apostle says about the Jews to the tender Thessalonian assembly, "For ye, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus; for *ye* also have suffered the same things of your own countrymen as also *they* of the Jews, who have both slain the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have driven us out by persecution, and do not please God, and are against all men, forbidding us to speak to the nations that they may be saved, that they may fill up their sins always, but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost", @1 Thessalonians 2: 14 - 16. That is a word, to the tender gentile assembly, but involved Ephesus, that is, it is the twain made into one: "that he might form the two in himself into one new man", @Ephesians 2: 15. It is the assembly properly, and the apostle is acquainting them with judaism, what it had become, how impossible it had become, against everybody -- God and men.
E.G.McA. Would these ten young men be represented in the following verses 1 and 2 of @1 Thessalonians 3? "Wherefore, being no longer able to refrain ourselves, we thought good to be left alone in Athens, and sent Timotheus, our brother and fellow-workman under God". Would there be a connection between those ten young men sent from David and this young man?
{354}
J.T. That is good. The same thing is true in Corinth, Timothy is sent in the same way. Paul brought Titus up to Jerusalem, as you will remember, according to @Galatians 2, and he was representative of the work of David's men. They did not compel him to be circumcised because the work of christianity was so complete there was nothing to add to it.
E.G.McA. As to this young man that came to Abigail -- would you say the influence of Nabal had no effect upon him, but he was entirely under the sway of Abigail?
J.T. That is remarkable, how intelligent he is! He puts the matter on her and the ability she had: "And now know and consider what thou wilt do". He is not telling her what to do, because the brothers in the care meeting enquire and get the information and place it where it belongs. It is the assembly's prerogative to execute whatever is needed to be done.
A.R. I think that is excellent, "Tell it to the assembly" (@Matthew 18: 17), is that the idea? The young man is telling it.
J.T. Just so.
J.H. David's young men had been very good to Nabal's servants, and really had a right to what he asked for.
J.T. Quite so. Our brother was seeking to defend Nabal, but you do not want to make a defence for a man like that in a care meeting. What our brother is saying now is that it is a matter of right, because David had done him a great service.
J.H. Would there be much of the Nabal spirit amongst the Corinthians? Paul speaks of the rights of those who labour in the gospel.
J.T. Paul says, "So also the Lord has ordained to those that announce the glad tidings to live of the glad tidings", @1 Corinthians 9: 15. The Corinthians were ready to give him their money.
{355}
H.B. Does it link up in any way with @Matthew 18?
J.T. That is the sort of thing, he will not listen to the assembly.
J.W.D. Do you get that sort of thing again in Philadelphia? What form of opposition does judaism take amongst ourselves?
J.T. It is the legal doubting side, I think; unreasonableness goes with it, unfairness and refusal to recognise obligation. Now Nabal is obligated to David, but he is utterly repudiating that thought. And so it is; you find certain conditions where obligations are repudiated. Take Paul at Corinth, what obligation they were under to him! Whatever else is the case, he says, I am your father. It was through his service they were converted, how could they ever pay back that obligation? I think you will find that that sort of thing comes into our care meetings, and we need this chapter to acquire the Spirit of Christ, whether we see it in David or in Abigail. But it is to be noted that Abigail is really leading here. The Spirit of God seems to make her in a certain way superior to David; not that it could be so in the antitype, but it is to bring out what the assembly is in Matthew really, what power it can have, and how much we need the Spirit of Christ in dealing with matters in the care meeting.
C.C.T. The Abigail spirit should be carried out in our care meetings on the understanding side, and the beautiful countenance would be brought out as a result.
J.T. The matter of the spirit shown in the care meetings was brought to my mind lately by a brother writing to me from a distant city and speaking of the distressing way in which the brethren spoke to one another. We ought to be respectful, it is useless to talk of loving one another unless we respect one another. This brother said the brethren were not able to speak to one another with due ordinary
{356}
respect. I know well enough what that is by experience.
G.A.T. It is not so bad now as it used to be.
J.T. I do not think it is.
Rem. Why is it that our care meetings are so long? Why should they not be in line with the other meetings?
J.T. There is something in that. If I may refer to the meetings in the old country, the care meetings in London are very brief -- about an hour and a quarter, and also in Glasgow. Each case is to be taken up on its own merits. In your city of course your care meeting should not be very long; but where there are, for example, ten meetings to attend to once a month, a great many things come up, and we should take time to settle matters.
C.C.T. Would you leave exercises over to the next month?
J.T. That is a question whether we should. If there are current matters to be attended to they should be attended to; it is better to sacrifice so that they may be cared for.
J.W. The exercise in @Acts 15 was completed, was it not?
J.T. That is the thing; every month should be a completed matter, both financially and otherwise. At least that is how we find it and it works well.
R.G. "And now know and consider", verse 17 of our chapter.
J.T. Quite so, it is to be done now; and what you find is that Abigail made haste, she did not put it off; it might have been a disaster if she had. It says in verse 18, "And Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skin-bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred raisin-cakes, and two hundred fig-cakes". She did it at once.
{357}
J.W.D. It would seem that if we are in the spirit of the dispensation at the care meeting matters would come to a comparatively rapid conclusion as in this chapter.
J.T. If we carve the matter out -- if we lay out our responsibility, as it is said; "Take care of the assembly of God" -- if we take that on and make it a monthly matter, the Lord says, "I am with you always", and He is with us in that. These are the things He leaves to us ourselves, but He says, I am with you in that.
J.W.D. The ten young men and their concentrated evidence brought the matter out fully. Do you not think that where there is a divided spirit about a matter, it is difficult to come to a conclusion?
J.T. Ten would be a numeral of responsibility.
Rem. How do you look at the provision made by Abigail? Does she exceed her responsibility through her knowledge of David?
J.T. That is the next thing to see, the female side under her hand, that is what you have in mind. It is said that she *took*; this is important, I mean the material side of the matter. The Spirit helps in the solution of difficulties so that you have something to meet conditions. So it says, "And Abigail made haste" (verse 18). Her great ancestor made haste in a critical time, to prepare a meal for three Persons that came to him -- for God Himself. "Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skin-bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred raisin-cakes, and two hundred fig-cakes, and laid them on asses. And she said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she did not tell her husband Nabal" (verses 18, 19). That principle had already been set out by Jonathan, not to tell Saul. The husband side, the male side, the responsible side, has to be left out at times. It is a question
{358}
of love and care, and Abigail is a type of the assembly from that point of view; Matthew is the antitype.
E.G.McA. She was a woman not only of great intelligence but of great resources. As you say, she did not tell her husband, but in verse 25 she says to David, "Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal". She says, that is not the point before us -- it is your interests, and she goes through this wonderful speech to him with him in view all the way through as to his coming glory. Is that the idea? Would not that close up our care meetings sooner?
J.T. I think that is good -- having the glory of Christ in mind in everything. She is very careful to tell him about Nabal, she says, "Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal". That is a remarkable word about her husband.
A.R. What did you mean by Matthew being the antitype?
J.T. The assembly is viewed as perfect as an institution; the assembly is a divine institution by itself, having prerogatives, actual prerogatives from heaven. It is representative of heaven as in @Matthew 18.
A.R. Do you mean in what she brings or what she gives?
J.T. No, what she is herself, and what she has under her hand. @Matthew 18 contemplates the assembly as a finished institution, a completed institution. In verse 17 the matter is told to the assembly and her decision is binding.
J.W.D. You are speaking of what you recognise independent of what may be the outward expression of it; you recognise the divine institution in a locality as apart from the actual condition.
J.T. You take it up abstractly really, we have to do that now, but God is with us in that.
{359}
A.R. "Whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens" (@Matthew 16: 19). God accepts that.
J.T. That is what I mean. There are absolute prerogatives down here to settle matters, so that we are never driven to the wall; we are never puzzled; and the point is to be like Abigail and think the thing out, consider what we are going to do. There is constant inquiry about what we are going to do, and how we are going to meet this or that. The first thing is to think ourselves. Do not expect distinguished brothers to think for us; the obligation is on us to consider the matter ourselves.
J.H. Would you open up a little more about Abigail not telling her husband?
J.T. Nabal represented judaism, and whatever takes on that character is not to be considered at all; we move on without it.
G.A.T. I suppose if your husband is not in fellowship with you, you would not come home from the care meeting and tell him what took place.
E.G.McA. Are you considering Nabal more as a condition than as a man married to this woman?
J.T. Oh, yes, it is a condition -- whatever may represent judaism now. He is coming under the government of God, he is banned, he is shut out of the whole matter. She says, "Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial", it is not simply a foolish man, but a man of Belial; he is governed by the devil.
G.A.T. Would you explain what that word means -- 'Belial'?
J.T. It refers to the power of Satan. It is a form of expression referring to positive wickedness from the devil; that is what is meant. She calls him a man, as she does Saul later; she calls Saul the king a man.
{360}
A.B. Does verse 25, the verse at which you commenced to read, indicate there was no change with Abigail? She says at the close of the verse, "And I thy handmaid did not see the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send", indicating the circumstances had made no change with her. If she had been there and known of it, the condition would not have been there; the provision would have been made just the same.
J.T. She would have done what was right; that marks the assembly. Rome has taken on this claim but never acknowledges the rights of Christ, she repudiates them; she says, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow". If Abigail had known the facts she would have done what Abraham did. She goes on to say in verse 25, "Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal", and then she tells David what his name means. You see, she is like Adam, she can convey what the name means: "For as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him". That is a settled matter with him.
A.R. I think I can understand why Paul characteristically did not go up to Jerusalem; I suppose that is why he says in Galatians, "O senseless Galatians" (chapter 3. 1).
J.T. That is what he means. He went up later to his sorrow; he found Nabal there; the account of his arrest and all that followed was Nabal.
J.W.D. This state would deliver us from fear, would it not? We often fear the Nabal element. If we have a conception of the glory, or an apprehension of it in our souls we would operate from that viewpoint.
J.T. Just so; so that one great point in our care meetings is to be able to name things. What do you think, brothers; and What do you think? Of course it is right enough to ask. One brother might say, I feel ..., but it is better to say, I know. Name the
{361}
thing at once. That is what David says about her, that she had discernment; he says in verse 33, "And blessed be thy discernment". She could name her husband.
C.C.T. I was thinking of being able to name things; not only was she able to name it, but able to tell the meaning of the name. We ought to be able to follow that out in our exercises.
J.T. Just so.
E.G.McA. Is this a subjective state exemplified in Abigail? Does she save the responsible element exemplified in the male? As David says, "Except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me ..." (verse 34).
J.T. Just so. David drops in a certain sense (though he is a type of Christ) so as to bring out the greatness of the assembly, what it is as left to itself, because that is the position. The Husband is away in heaven, and we are here to represent Him, and I think Matthew shows that the assembly has authority to represent Christ not only in the abstract thought, but that actually the grace is there. Sonship underlies the position before we get to chapter 18, implying that the grace of heaven would be there in what was done.
J.H. Abigail seems to show great feelings, she says, "Upon me, my lord, upon me let the iniquity be" (verse 24).
J.T. That is the acceptance of obligation, which is a great point made in the Scriptures and in our care meetings. We are obligated to a matter, to look after it. It says, "The glory of kings is to search out a thing", @Proverbs 25: 2. I believe that enters into our care meetings. As we actually are -- just so many people -- we have no status really beyond enquirers. We take on the form of authority in assembly with others, sisters and all, but in the meantime it is a tentative matter; we are searching out
{362}
things and it is the glory of kings to do that; we are just so many persons.
S.McC. In Matthew's gospel the Lord in His ministry alludes more to the final end of things and the judgment of His enemies than in any of the other gospels. Is the point that the assembly as in @Matthew 18 -- the vessel of administration and of grace -- restrains Him, speaking reverently, in the present dispensation in regard of judgment?
J.T. Yes; it maintains Christ, it maintains what He is here. He says, "And behold, *I* am with you all the days, until the completion of the age" (chapter 28: 20); so that His ascension is not given in Matthew; it is held out of sight, as it were. In the same way there is much in relation to David that is not mentioned here, but things are held out of sight so as to bring out something else. It is to bring out the mystery of the assembly in Matthew: "Tell it to the assembly".
Rem. Is it noticeable that while Abigail acted in haste, yet the provision she took was ready, it was available? The sheep were ready dressed; Nabal had just been shearing the sheep, but what she had had taken available form.
J.T. You are really just directed back in your thoughts to Rebecca, an earlier type of the church. She was always ready, too -- plenty in the house, everything was ready. The care meeting effects that, things are looked after and kept tidy, according to @Psalm 133: 2, "to the hem of his garments", that is a finished thought.
J.W. Is the assembly used governmentally then for the judgment of Nabal, in the recognition of the rights of Christ? It seems that Abigail told him nothing more or less until the morning light, and when she tells him his heart dies within him.
J.T. It is the way the government of God acts in relation to the assembly. There are two collateral
{363}
lines from Pentecost, the actual direct work of God, and the government of God. Bearing on that the first thing that comes under the government of God is judaism; the decision of the assembly in Jerusalem in @Acts 15 is to show how assembly prayer met the Jewish attack. It was a finished exercise, and was met in the assembly -- the whole exercise; the letter was sent down, and it was finished so far as that went.
J.W.D. What is your thought as to the hem of the garment? You remember the woman that touched the hem of the Lord's garment; is the touch a kind of power operating inwardly?
J.T. I think it refers to the completeness of Christ here, because it was an administrative time peculiarly attached to Himself, only that He brought in the twelve. They did not know what was going on, but it was a finished position; Christ and the twelve apostles involved a finished position, and the dispensation at that time was carrying on in a finished way. You always find whatever He did, He did it well and did it completely.
J.W.D. I was thinking that this thought of completion is important. Certain very wonderful things come out of it.
J.T. Just so.
J.K. Would that be suggested in what David says, "Go up in peace to thy house" (verse 35) -- the completion of the thing?
J.T. Yes, the thing is settled; so that the Lord says to the woman, Go in peace. That is the principle of the dispensation; faith comes into it and you can finish the matter.
A.R. David had in mind to slay Nabal, but he says to Abigail, "Blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed" (verse 33). How do you look at that?
{364}
J.T. The Lord had already said that he should not use the sword, typically it was not the thing to do. David was not to use violence, typifying Matthew; it is not the time of violence, it is the time of the long-suffering of God in grace, but reaching an end, because Nabal died in ten days. He did not die at once; it was a prolonged thing. It brings out the real thing in the saints, the Holy Spirit in the saints. Nabal comes under the government of God in time. It is a question of our patience.
A.R. Does Jerusalem come under the government of God in type?
J.T. Quite so; the judgment of that had already come in, "God has judged your judgment upon her", @Revelation 18: 20. The judgment has already come in in Abigail and the young man. Nabal was already judged; he was just set aside; he is not to be questioned or brought into the matter with her. The Lord says of Thyatira, I have done so-and-so, and that is a finished matter with her; and He goes on to Philadelphia.
G.A.T. In the beginning of the meeting you said a good deal about the young element in these young men. Now are you leading us on to experience in Abigail? She had more experience than the younger ones.
J.T. She is a woman of experience, and experience with a remarkable man, but she maintains her good understanding and her beautiful appearance, her countenance, which is a great triumph.
G.A.T. She completes the thing.
J.T. She goes through to the marriage. The whole marital matter is settled here, and I believe that is where the defect was during the Middle Ages. The Reformation tried to settle the matter, but it did not, it was only partial. But the more recent revival is a more effective thing, because we have reached Christ and the assembly. The reformed condition did not
{365}
look for heaven; it was simply a change of conditions. But now we are 'called out', the word 'assembly' means 'called out', ready to go up. The midnight cry has gone forth, "Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him", @Matthew 25: 6. We are ready to go.
E.G.McA. Do you mean all the revival of the marital affections for Christ is preparatory to the taking up of the assembly?
J.T. That is it. We have arrived at the finish, and this chapter is a type of the finish whether it were in early days or now in the recovery.
A.R. @Revelation 18: 20 says, "God has judged your judgment upon her", referring to the Babylonish system. I was wondering whether we as saints should not have power to judge present military conditions also.
J.T. We ought to have a judgment about everything; God does not do anything without informing His prophets. I believe among the brethren you get true impressions; no spiritual man would assume to be a prophet about things, but at the same time he has impressions.
E.G.McA. In this passage we not only have the ability to judge in a negative way, which in one sense is the way we are taking this up, but the ability to heal, to bring in a situation that is perfectly agreeable to the One whose interests we have at heart. Just arriving at a judgment is not enough.
J.T. What you see in David is that he shines here most when he speaks about Abigail. It is a question of Christ and the assembly -- to bring out the greatness of Christ and the assembly.
J.W.D. Does this marriage link on with @Revelation 19?
J.T. Pretty much. Tell us more.
J.W.D. The marital thought coming out in administrative matters links up with @Revelation 19.
{366}
J.T. That is right. It is a section at the end of the book, full of hallelujahs; that is victory! "The marriage of the Lamb is come". Much is said about Babylon and her destruction then. "For the marriage of the Lamb is come", that is where we are; it is the finish, "and his wife has made herself ready", @Revelation 19: 7.
J.W.D. I was wondering whether the fact of the brethren getting clearer on this line of the truth links on with the Lord's appearing and has that in view.
J.T. Yes; Matthew says, quoting the Lord in the parables, "Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him" (chapter 25: 6). That has been going on for a good while, and the time has come now when we are about to enter in; and I believe @Revelation 19 is to show that as a result of the history and the effect of the ministry on the assembly, she is then complete: "For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready" -- His wife -- that is historical.
J.H. Would that expression and also the fine linen given to her, which is "the righteousnesses of the saints", be the full working out of the administration of the assembly here?
J.T. I think it is to bring out the whole history. We were speaking about the care meeting -- one scripture to support us in it is, "In the multitude of counsellors there is safety" (@Proverbs 11: 14), and then, "The glory of kings is to search out a thing", @Proverbs 25: 2. In the last chapter of Proverbs we have the "woman of worth"; that must be historical, the allusion is to what she is, and then we are told what she does, and that is what enters into @Revelation 19: 8, "His wife has made herself ready. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure"; she is allowed to array herself in fine linen. Nobody else will be allowed to do it because the garment implies what she is. It is
{367}
not that she can go and buy the garment she likes; she is allowed to have the fine linen, just as we might say in regard of royalty, 'Only a queen can have that'. It is a distinction, she has qualified herself so that she is allowed to be arrayed in fine linen, it is ornamentation that is in mind, she is entitled to that because of her history. I believe that is Abigail in type; that she knows all about the current history is evident in the way she speaks to David.
A.S.B. Is Nabal like one we have referred to in Ephesians, "drunk with wine, in which is debauchery", @Ephesians 5: 18? On the other hand we have the beauty of Abigail coming out in relation to the spiritual side, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come", @Revelation 22: 17.
J.T. We are not to be filled with violence, but with the Spirit.
A.R. She comes "down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God", @Revelation 21: 10. Does that suggest what she is in herself?
J.T. It belongs to her; it is not given to her there. It is granted to her according to her royal state to be "clothed in fine linen ... the righteousnesses of the saints". The plural 'righteousnesses' would be to include every one of us or to intensify the idea, because she is marked, abstractly anyway, at the beginning and at the end and all the way through by righteousness. There is no thought of anyone having any place with God without righteousness; she is recognised as having it, and plenty of it.
G.A.T. What period of the church's history are you referring to now?
J.T. At the beginning; what beautiful traits of the assembly you find in the book of Acts! Your heart is thrilled as you see the work of the Spirit in different persons. Take Lydia and Phoebe: these are suggestions of the beauty of the assembly according
{368}
to what we have in this type, mature persons. Now Phoebe was a dignified person; she is called a patron, a person who can confer advice with dignity without making you little. She is great herself, but she does not want to make you little; she represents moral greatness in the way she did things in Cenchrea.
J.W.D. It makes the historical side of the ministry very interesting, it is a part of our own glory. Often in readings we try to bring everything down to affect ourselves, but the historical side is our glory.
J.T. Just so.
J.H. Every maintenance of the rights of Christ is found in the fine linen.
J.T. That is the thought; *your* righteousnesses are in it.
A.R. A great person in the world will make you feel little in his presence, but not a spiritual person; a spiritually great person never does that.
J.T. The Lord never did that. Peter says to Cornelius, I am a man like yourself.
G.A.T. That is a fine spirit to bring into the care meeting; you do not make any feel small or great.
J.T. You are what you are; Paul says, "I am what I am", and we all recognise that. This is not a David chapter; this is not so much Christ as the assembly. The Spirit of God, as it were, places David so that Abigail shines, and David shows his best thoughts; he appears at his best when he is talking about her. He does not say anything about Nabal or Saul or his own exploits; he is talking about her, and she is talking about him. But he is at his best in this chapter in talking about her. He retires to talk about the saints -- to put glory on them. So he says to her, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me. And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging myself
{369}
with mine own hand". -- As a matter of fact, she maintains typically the dispensation by her grace; she prevented a happening that would discredit the dispensation, and he sees that now. And then it says, "So David received of her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person".
Then we have the contrast in Nabal, "And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was drunken to excess" (verse 36). "Drunk with wine, in which is debauchery", that is this man. So it says, "She told him nothing less or more, until the morning light. And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. And it came to pass in about ten days that Jehovah smote Nabal, and he died" (verses  37, 38). That is the government of God; that is the way things are going; we do not take the sword; God does. There are two things under which we come: the government of God, and the direct action of God which is in the assembly. That is our position.
E.G.McA. This is another finished matter.
J.T. Just so. Nabal is under the government of God ten days. Abigail did not poison him; she did not do anything to put him out of the way, God did it. He is judged already by her and by the young man; we have a judgment about everything that is going on in the world today. God is working governmentally according to our prayers, if we are with Him; He honours us, and things are happening on account of our prayers. The main thing now is the young men; they have to be watched and preserved, and if this war is going to destroy them either morally or physically it is most urgent that the war should
{370}
be stopped. But the government of God is usually gradual, because He works something out in us morally. He uses the rod, then He destroys it.
F.M. It says, "about ten days" in regard to Nabal.
J.T. That is what I was thinking; it could have been done at once, but it was not.
G.A.T. Is that why we sometimes grow impatient, we cannot wait the full time?
J.T. "Have patience, therefore, brethren, till the coming of the Lord", @James 5: 7. The intention is to bring things to a positive finish (all as to Nabal is the negative thing), so it says, "And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil; but Jehovah has returned Nabal's evil upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her as his wife. And the servants of David came to Abigail to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee as his wife. And she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife". She comes in like Rebecca, she links on with Rebecca, because *she* goes to *him* -- he might have come to her, but he did not. It is a type. It is to be pointed out that she brought her damsels with her, "five damsels of hers", meaning the feminine idea is stressed in her companions; it is a feminine idea, just as with Rebecca, she brought her damsels with her too. The feminine idea is to be stressed in these last days, and if it is to be stressed there must be suffering.
J.H. Is it not a remarkable expression in verse 41: "Behold, let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash
{371}
the feet of the servants of my lord"? Does that find expression in what Paul said, "To me, less than the least of all saints", @Ephesians 3: 8?
J.T. Just so; by love serving one another.
Chas.T. Is this similar to Esther's exercise? She says, "If I perish, I perish", @Esther 4: 16, and the result is Mordecai speaking peace to all his seed.
J.T. Just so. As we said, the five damsels here refer to the feminine quality, and in abundance.
Rem. She said to the young men, "Go on before me" (verse 19), but here the damsels followed her.
J.T. Very suitable.
A.R. Being subject to the Christ -- is that what you mean?
J.T. Just so; that is the attitude in which the assembly is set by God; she is subjected to the Christ.
A.S.B. Does it help us to see what you had in mind if we go back to verse 1? There Samuel died, and the ministry is cumulative now in Israel. The features of Abigail are to be brought out with the intent that they are to be for David.
J.T. I think it is very beautiful. It is a finished matter right through, and that is what God is aiming at, to do things properly. The matter is finished.
S.McC. Would you say a word about verses 43 and 44? "David had also taken Ahinoam of Jizreel; and they became, even both of them, his wives. But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim".
J.T. That is a cloud over what we have been saying about the finished side. The two wives go on to Israel; there is more than the assembly in mind. It is David, you might say, set up with these two wives, they are his household; we know that later they are both mentioned as taken away by the Amalekites, so that they are definitely in his household. I suppose the Lord would indicate that in the
{372}
counsels of God you have Israel and the assembly too.
E.C. Is it not remarkable that Abigail is released from an undesirable husband and David here is released from an undesirable wife?
J.T. That is another thing that goes on -- adjustments. We were thinking of that this morning, the constant need of adjustment.
E.C. Still Michal is mentioned later.
J.T. She is, but she despises David. That is a most sorrowful thing about her, and her judgment is fixed.
S.McC. What you have said about Abigail this afternoon should teach us to place greater value upon the working out of administration in our localities. Every result seems more and more to win the affections of the assembly for Christ.
J.T. That is an excellent thought to go away with.
J.W. "I ... have accepted thy person", that would be a commendation.
J.T. I think that runs through; he had said before, "Blessed be thy discernment". He is at his best in speaking about her. The Lord seems to love to bring out the truth of the assembly; Mr. Darby was the vessel that God used to speak about the assembly after the general position was reached; that was his constant theme. The Lord gave that full scope, and now He has brought us back to it, but more in the local working out of the truth of the assembly.
G.A.T. What would you say about the transfer from Samuel to David?
J.T. Well, Samuel represented one side of things; but now he is dead, that is to be noted. It is a certain line of things that God had used according to what we had earlier in our readings, but now it is another line; that is another thing completed. His ministry was completed and now it is another thing, it is Christ and the assembly.
{373}
E.G.McA. As following the type, we do not need Samuel now we have David.
J.T. No indeed. You might prophesy in the church, but it is to support the truth of the church.
{374}
LEADERSHIP
@2 Timothy 2: 22
I wish at this time to speak a word to the dear brethren in regard to leadership; not leadership by persons (although bearing in mind at the same time that properly leadership is by persons), but for the present purpose I intend to speak on leadership by *things*. This phase of the matter will help us to be practical, and the constant demand is for breaking things up into parts so that the education may be simplified. Young learners often ask in meetings: Say something about this or about that; not, Say something about him or about her; it is a question of *things*. In truth we come to follow persons, that is, the leadership of God and of Christ, and of the Spirit; but what is in mind now is things, broken up, dealt with severally and yet in relation to one another, for the truth is one whole. But we learn in part; we may as well admit that for it would be very foolish to deny it even in natural things. But before approaching and dealing with this one verse, very well known amongst us, I wish just to read a verse or two from @2 Peter 1 to bring out what is meant in my remarks: "Simon Peter, bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have received like precious faith with us through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ" (verse 1). That is, the "like precious faith" is seen here not through God, but through His righteousness; so that we have to understand righteousness to understand how "precious faith" is to be received -- not simply known, but received; because believers are nothing if they are not receivers. And then he goes on to say, "Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord"; that is, peace is multiplied "in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
{375}
Lord", that is how it comes. And again in verse 3, "As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue". Now, dear brethren, notice these things as they are mentioned; His "divine power" has given to you certain things; it is not said that *God* has given to you these things -- of course that is true -- but "His divine power" has given them, and they "relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue". Notice the things that are mentioned, and how they act on each other, great phases of the truth broken up for us and seen acting. And then he goes on to speak of "glory and virtue, through which he has given to us the greatest and precious promises" -- not simply that God has given them to us, but He has given them to us "by glory and virtue".
Now several good sermons could be preached from these verses, I am not preaching from them; I am simply bringing them in as a prelude to what I have in mind so that we may get down into the lowest class of learning, as I would like to get down to it myself in seeking to unfold the ABC of the truth. Finally Peter says, "that through these" -- not through me, not through God or Jesus or the Spirit, but "through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature". I would urge every young brother and sister here to write down these things in the order in which Peter gives them here, positive things, each acting of itself in relation to the other things. Scientific people use one thing to promote another, and use that other to promote something else, always having a great end in mind. That is how Peter starts his second letter. Second letters usually deal with the state ensuing from the first. What is the reaction from the first letter of this great servant Peter? He had evidently heard as to it. One is impressed with
{376}
the remarkable increase in these holy convocations amongst us, and the inquiry is, What is the reaction after each? Is there simply a drop, so that the next one has to take up the same thing? If that be so, degeneration is the general result of these meetings, and "If the salt also has become savourless, wherewith shall it be seasoned?" @Luke 14: 34. To start up another series of meetings would not meet the case; we should be heading to apostasy.
You will see how material Peter is, how substantial he is in the matter of the source of things; so in the second letter he says, "to stir you up by putting you in remembrance" (verse 13), and he goes on to the utmost bounds, as I might say, of the universe, the spiritual universe and the material universe. It is somewhat of a drop from the spiritual to the material, and if the Spirit of God has to have recourse to the material then it is pretty evident we have not been living in the spiritual.
Well, I leave that now; that is my preface, and I go on to my text to bring out these leaders, four of them: "righteousness, faith, love, peace". These are the leaders, and we are to follow them; not severally; for they are one, the truth is one whole, but apprehended in parts. The first part here is righteousness. There are four as I said: "Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace". You do not devote Sunday to righteousness, and Monday to faith, and Tuesday to love, and Wednesday to peace; you follow them all every day, and other ones besides. These are not the only things that lead us; wisdom also comes in. But the first one here is righteousness, and it is one of the scarcest things there is in this whole world -- righteousness; yet it is here -- it has always been here, and it is contemplated as moving first in this passage. The word is 'pursue', which suggests a little more than following, because you might follow leisurely, but this will not admit of that. We are in an
{377}
emergency time, dear brethren; things are coming up every day that have to be met, and righteousness enters into every one of them, and it is moving fast. If you are not diligent, if you are just dilatory or neglectful, it will get out of your sight so far that you cannot see it, meaning that you cannot see afar off. That is what Peter says; he speaks of certain things that you might have seen that should have been added to what you have, and if you have not got them he says your sight is poor, and you have forgotten that you were purged from your former sins; not the present ones, but the former ones. You "cannot see afar off", he says. And that answers a lot of questions as why people do not see when issues arise; the fact is that the light is moving so fast they lose sight of it -- they cannot see afar off. You would not wish to be afar off from righteousness, but in case you do get far away from it by your conduct, then you do not see it at all; and you call light darkness and darkness light, and you call evil good, and good evil. These are most serious matters, and they are common even among the people of God.
So that the word 'pursue' has to be noticed here. You can test yourself as to how much agility you have in looking out for righteousness in every issue that comes up, and they are constantly coming up. Here is a man in the ninth chapter of John's gospel and both his eyes are closed, he is blind; and the Lord's disciples inquire from the Lord, "Who sinned, this man or his parents?" (verse 2). Their minds were moving on fairly good lines in asking that question. The Lord said, Neither is true; neither his parents nor he have sinned. Later on the Pharisees say to the man, You were born in sins. They were blind; the Lord says it was not so at all; they could not see.
Well now, as to this matter of righteousness, I venture to connect it with Matthew's gospel. Timothy is like Mark; these two young men were taught by
{378}
the apostle. There are a great many young men amongst us now, and their safety lies in keeping near to spiritual people -- not launching out by themselves too much; yet they have to learn to stand on their own feet and find their own way too, but they should not ignore examples.
So I venture to bring righteousness into Matthew. Timothy, as I say, was a young man, and he doubtless read Matthew's gospel -- probably it was written in his time (the gospels were all written, I judge, after the epistles). Paul says, "Give thyself to reading", (@1 Timothy 4: 13); he told Timothy that, and I would urge everyone to give attention to reading. You say, What reading? Certainly not the magazines or the novels; some do read them and get blinder and blinder by doing it.
Now Timothy might say to Titus, or to any other young brother he knew (I may say Timothy was going on pretty well most of the time, but the apostle had to say to him at one time, "Be not negligent of the gift that is in thee", @1 Timothy 4: 14. And here he says, "But youthful lusts flee"; so that no one of us is beyond the necessity of these exhortations, even the most spiritual). Timothy might say to Titus, Did you see the gospel of Matthew? That is a bit of news; Titus might say, I have not heard of it yet. He would be very interested to see it. And at this point I may say that the gospels are written to amplify and exemplify the epistles, that is what they are for; to corroborate, amplify and exemplify the epistles. And the two brothers Timothy and Titus might say, Well, it would be very interesting to hear what Matthew has written about the Lord; because they would know that Matthew was an apostle. He was a tax-gatherer and became an apostle; he became a follower of Jesus, he rose up from his desk and laid all aside to follow. There is nothing said about whether he tidied up his money matters, not a
{379}
word. He just left his desk as it was and followed Jesus, and he made a great entertainment for Jesus. Obviously he was greatly affected by something the Spirit of God caused to affect him in the walk and life and ways and words of Jesus.
Matthew was a money man, a banker; and more than that, he was a tax-gatherer. What would Matthew say about Jesus? What would be his point of view? It is most important to get the writer's point of view, no matter what the book is, because the principle in divine things is that the Lord lays out the basis of the book; He lays out the basis of an address. So it is in John's case for example, John the apostle and the prophet. The Lord told him how to write his book of Revelation as a prophet. He laid out the basis of the book -- the great outline. He said to him, "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these", @Revelation 1: 19. Now what is the principle of Matthew's book? There are going to be twenty-eight chapters; although that was not under the direction of the Spirit of God. Chapters and verses are useful, but divine books are not written on that principle; they are written for intelligent people, persons who can read paragraphs as well as sentences, persons that know the alphabet. Even the psalms contemplate the alphabet, letter by letter; certain psalms are laid out on that principle. How will Matthew view Jesus in his book? The righteous One -- that is the basis of the outline, the great general thought in Matthew. I do not indicate that there is nothing else in it, because Jesus is presented -- "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham". That is the way it begins. And He is righteous; His reputed father, Joseph, is a righteous man. The Spirit of God, dear young people and brethren, has in mind to make us righteous if we are not that yet, and if we are christians at all the
{380}
absence of righteousness is a shame, a disgrace; in fact, we are not characterised as christians if we are not righteous.
And so Matthew enlarges on the righteousness of Joseph, the reputed father of Jesus. It is very important to have a righteous father, it is a God-given thing to have a righteous father and a righteous mother; but if you do not follow in their steps you will gain nothing in that sense. God has given you a righteous father to pay attention to his ways, and the Lord's reputed father was a righteous man; he was righteous in relation to his wife. It is the greatest demand to be righteous in regard of your wife, or the wife in regard of her husband. Then when it comes to the Lord Himself in ministry, when He was about to be baptised, He says to John the baptist, "It becometh us" (you and Me, John, or Me and you), "to fulfil all righteousness". That is how Matthew presents the Lord Jesus -- "all righteousness" -- not only the claims of your wife or your husband or your children, but the claims of all or any with whom you have to do. As I said, righteousness has been in the world since its outset; it has never left, the devil has never been able to drive righteousness off this earth. The first one that is called righteous is Abel, God said that his blood is righteous. If we are to shed our blood, dear brethren, it is to be in righteousness; we are not to suffer for evil but for righteousness. Abel heads the list of the righteous people who shed their blood in righteousness. If you look into it you will find Matthew says more about righteousness than any of the other evangelists; he has the assembly in mind, the great judicial vessel that God has here to deal with matters, "Tell it to the assembly" is the injunction in @Matthew 18: 17. It is the residence of righteousness, so that your matters will find a fair examination and decision there.
{381}
Now I come to faith, that is the next thing that we are to pursue. The thing is here, thank God; He has kept it here, but it moves fast. An emergency arises; it is there in a moment. Things come swiftly, so do not get your eye off it, keep your eye on faith and let your feet keep up with it, dear brethren; "pursue" it, the apostle says. It is an emergency matter, this epistle is an emergency epistle; and the words 'pursue' and 'flee' are before us. 'Flee' evil things; do not be dilatory about dealing with them, do not stop around them or give them any place at all, 'Flee' them, it says -- "Flee youthful lusts". Joseph is a great example for young people in the fleeing of youthful lusts and the pursuing of what is right. Both words are energetic words; flee the evil and pursue the good, "pursue ... faith" which, like righteousness, has been in the world since the beginning. The world has never been without it, the presence of it here has put the world under judgment. You may say, Where does faith come in? I would say in Mark's gospel; faith is connected with Mark. But, you say, it is everywhere in the New Testament. So it is, and it is very little in the Old -- the *thing* is there but the word is hardly used. Then why do I say it is in Mark? Is it not more in Romans than in Mark? The words 'believing' and 'faith' are about the same; but I am speaking of Mark and I want you to follow what I am saying.
Mark says in two passages what I have in mind. In the first passage he quotes the Lord Jesus as saying, "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe in the glad tidings", @Mark 1: 15. That is, have faith in the thing; that is the point -- follow that. Do not be without faith, because whatever is not of faith is sin; you will be beset in every direction if you have not faith in activity. Mark quotes the Lord Jesus as saying, "Believe in the glad tidings". You say,
{382}
That is one of the most practical expressions, because it is believing in the Lord Jesus. But "believe in the glad tidings", it is the *thing* that I am talking about. But how does this work out? Well, if I am to believe in the thing, it is like a book; it is a book full of the idea of faith, and it is for me to read that book and re-read it and understand it. Believe in it; every word in it is to be gone into and believed, so that you are a 'faith' person: you have faith in your soul and you do not let it get away from you but you pursue it. A believer is a faith person, a person of faith; in other words, he is a believer.
Now the passage I have just quoted is in the first chapter, but the one I am going to quote is in the last chapter, there the Lord says, "He that believes and is baptised shall be saved" (verse 16). Notice, "He that believes", "and he that disbelieves shall be condemned". Notice the word 'believe' in both clauses of the verse. It is an awful thing to have hanging over your head that if you have not faith you will be damned! It is an awful thing to speak of but it is necessary; you are in such danger! It is not simply that the Lord has done certain things to save you, it is a question of your state and that you shall 'pursue' this thing, 'faith', and never lose it. And then Mark goes on to quote what the Lord says after that -- I will just read it to you to call attention to what faith ensures to us. Notice when I read the verses that it is not a question of what is apostolic, the matter is for us christians. "And these signs shall follow those that have believed [notice that!], in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well" (verses  17, 18). These are the things that people who have faith can do -- believers, those who believe.
{383}
Dear brethren, listen to what Mark is telling us here; he is telling us about what we are to pursue, having fled youthful lusts: "pursue ... faith". And Mark is telling us what the Lord Jesus said about this matter of believing and what accrues from it to persons who believe. The verse says that in the Lord's name "they shall cast out demons". You say, There are no miracles like that now. But I am speaking of principles now, and I am not going to say there are no such miracles as these; there are such miracles as these, if I may call them that. If there are not there is no christianity; God would make us real christians, real believers in things to prove the reality of what faith yields to us. And the first thing that is said is that in the name of the Lord Jesus they shall cast out demons. Now the invocation of the Lord's name is essential to our very existence in this world; there is no power against the devil without it; every time we meet it is on this principle. So that "in my name they shall cast out demons", cast out the power of the devil. Is that not a reality? It certainly is. If there is anything I am more conscious of than another it is that the Spirit of God is greater than the devil, and greater in me than the devil. Whatever length that may go is a question; it may vary under certain conditions, as at the beginning compared with now, but the fact remains that the power in the believer is greater than the devil, and it confounds him. We must rely on this power and invoke it; and we do invoke it without knowing it. The devil would snatch up all our meetings if it were not for it.
But then it evidences itself in more detail in how we deal with one another, the power we have in dealing with each other in daily life and in fellowship -- how we deal with evil. The epistles refer to these matters; they come out in different epistles, and how the apostles proved this power! But I just give
{384}
you the suggestion now of the present application. Without this power there is no possibility of carrying on -- if we are carrying on. That fact that we have been carrying on through these years is a proof that the thing is real; a proof of the power that is in His name. Let us prove it -- let us look out for the proof of it too; it will confirm us more and more.
Then the next thing is new tongues, that we speak of things differently. You may say, These are different languages they can speak; but that is not the point. It is not 'tongues' simply but "new tongues". We read, "With their tongues they have used deceit; asps poison is under their lips", @Romans 3: 13. In our conversation with one another, is it the new or the old? Is it the new tongue or the old? If faith is energetic in us, it is the new one. We certainly ought to be able to speak with new tongues; we can challenge ourselves in all our conversation. "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another" (@Malachi 3: 16) -- in what tongue? Was the poison of asps there? Was the throat an open sepulchre there? No. According to Romans we supersede all that in the power of the Spirit of God, so that our conversation is holy, it is a 'new tongue'. In the barber's shop, or the railway station or the workshop, listen to the language! It is the devil's language very largely, defiling and corrupting; whereas the christian brings in the new -- holy words and feelings which the Spirit of Christ imparts to us. We speak right. The Lord groaned in His spirit when a man could not speak right.
And then we have further, "They shall take up serpents"; that is, they can handle what is of the devil and dispose of it without damage. We could not have a care meeting and handle what is evil without this. We are superior to it, we can take up serpents. I trust the dear brethren do not think I am fanciful; I know what I am saying is the truth.
{385}
Without these things we could not go on; let us cultivate them. It is a question of faith, let us pursue it and never be without it.
Then the next thing is drinking a deadly thing, things that come up that we do not know about and may be poisonous. But faith antidotes that, like the flowing of living water in the types. Flowing water is not so susceptible of defilement. Where there is no volume of water there is danger; it is volume that counts, plenty of spirituality, plenty of the things of God. Then, although you may imbibe things unknowingly, there is no harm. It is a question of the state inwardly, let us take care of our state. "Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded; for out of it are the issues of life", @Proverbs 4: 23. That is what is meant; with the power of serpents and in drinking things you do not know of, the poison is nullified; the antidote is so powerful that there is no damage. That is an immense thing, it is a question of faith. Let us pursue it and never be without it, because it is always available.
And then, "They shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well". Christians have power to help one another; they have power in regard of their bodies. James says, "Is any sick among you?" (we are never without the sick) "let him call to him the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick" (chapter 5: 14). You understand I am not advocating what is called faith-healing (scriptural terms and words are taken up in a false way), but I am speaking of the truth; what is stated; what power faith has in regard to the bodies of the brethren. Is this not a reality? It certainly is a reality, I could give much testimony to the reality of this thing -- the power of faith over the bodies of the brethren; one's own body and the bodies of the brethren. Faith is intelligent
{386}
in what it is doing; it knows that God has restricted human life, and that this is the time of eternal life in testimony. Eternal life belongs to another world, "that world and the resurrection", but it is here in testimony. We do not live longer because of this, that is a matter of the government of God. Christianity is in the sphere of the government of God, and the testimony of the reality of the truth of eternity has come.
Then referring again to our leaders in @2 Timothy 2: 22, "love" is John. John is the great love evangelist. I have left it for the last and, dear brethren, what a great thing it is for heaven to see a loving people, a people who love one another! Do not fail to 'pursue' that. Pursue all the four things, "righteousness, faith, love, peace", but love we must of necessity pursue with the brethren. That word is said of all of them, but particularly love, "Pursue ... love ... with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". Do not be among them without it, you are a stranger if you do not have it. You do not want to be that. People sometimes say, I was not thought of very much; I went to the meeting and nobody said much to me. Well, love is attractive to love. Why was John the evangelist so attractive to the Lord Jesus? He must have been; he was the disciple whom Jesus loved, so that he is entitled to speak of love, and he does speak of it. No one speaks more of it than he does, and one of the passages in which he quotes the Lord is, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13: 35. It is a people who have that commodity amongst them, and if you come in amongst them they will notice you if you have it; if you bring a little more they will make room for you. It is a commodity that is highly valued amongst them. They will not make room for you because of your birth, because of your position, because of your
{387}
good clothes, because of your money, but they will make room for you if you have love, "Love amongst yourselves". If you are able to exercise love amongst the brethren you are a mighty person. If you are able to exercise love where love resides you are not a small person; you are a notable person if you contribute to this great matter -- love amongst the people of God.
Well, I have sought to put my thoughts into words, to frame them in parts and make them intelligible, and I feel I have succeeded in some little measure. I count now on the Spirit to make it more intelligible, as the Lord says, "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: ... for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you", @John 16: 13, 14. So that we make room for the Spirit, and He will enable us to put all these things together so that they become profitable that we may characteristically, and in times of crisis such as we are in now, "pursue"!
{388}
THE LORD'S COMING TO HIS OWN AS SEEN IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (1)
@Matthew 28: 2 - 20
J.T. In divine incomings there is the idea of coming and *seeing* and then there is the idea of coming and *remaining*. In @Genesis 11 God came down to see what the children of men were building, He did not come to stay but rather to see and condemn; then what Moses and the children of Israel built in Exodus also had in mind divine incomings, but the tabernacle of God was in mind there and God came to stay. There was a full examination of the structure and it was approved, Moses representing God in that sense, and also anointing it to show that it was approved, and then God came in Himself in glory, came in and remained, as it were. Now these scriptures are typical of what is in mind in the closing chapters of the evangelists regarding the Lord coming after He arose, and here verse 16 is particularly in mind, "But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted. And Jesus coming up spoke to them"; what follows shows that they were approved and commissioned. The idea of the assembly had been introduced by the Lord in chapters 16 and 18, viewed in both chapters as having an administrative constitution, and it is hoped that we may be able to confine our thoughts to that, involving as it does the kingdom of God which is largely treated of in this gospel, and the assembly in relation to it. The idea is authority with administrative service, not service God-ward exactly but service in an administrative and authoritative sense. So there is means in the assembly to deal with matters whatever they may be so that we can carry on. The whole chapter has been suggested, with the exception of the first verse,
{389}
because it bears on what has been remarked and indeed in a larger sense the whole gospel does this. Righteousness is greatly stressed in view of this administrative institution because there should be moral authority as well as divinely appointed authority, and moral authority develops on moral grounds. Therefore we have from the very outset great stress laid on righteousness, particularly in the tenth chapter in which we have certain valuations which enter into this great matter. The Lord says after appointing the twelve, "He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me. He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward". The position is greatly strengthened on these moral lines as well as on commissioned or authoritative lines, and we have a list of values as they stand, namely a prophet, righteous man and a disciple.
J.D. Bearing on your subject it is remarkable that Joseph is spoken of as a righteous man in view of his dealing with the matter of Mary, so that the gospel begins with the great thought of righteousness.
J.T. That is very important and illustrates the line running throughout, so the Lord in speaking to John the baptist says, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" (chapter 3: 15). So that we are reminded in dealing with matters in the assembly that we must deal with details in the little things as well as in the big things.
J.D. The Holy Spirit in the assembly is maintaining the rights of Christ as Lord and the power for administration is in the assembly on that line.
{390}
J.T. It is in mind to bring that out. When we consider the kingdom it is a wider thought dealing with the heavens, so it is called the kingdom of the heavens in this gospel except for one or two places where it is called the kingdom of God, showing that heaven is brought into the position. That is, in assembly decisions and administration, "whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens" (chapter 16: 19). Heaven is brought into the matter and earth too.
C.H.H. @Matthew 1: 1 says, "Son of David, Son of Abraham". Would David represent the kingly side and Abraham the righteous side?
J.T. David is named first, although the line begins with Abraham, because that view of the kingdom is in mind. When we come to David in verse 6 it is, "David the king", so we must keep the kingdom in mind; with the king decisions are deliberate and power is there in what proceeds.
Ques. Are authority and administration the bases on which things are maintained here for God?
J.T. Yes, and the commissions are in chapter 10, which is important. In connection with the appointing of the disciples Mark says, "He appointed twelve that they might be with him", but Matthew says, "And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, so that they should cast them out, and heal every disease and every bodily weakness. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who was called Peter". There is the principle of leadership established; not only is authority in each of them but one is mentioned specifically, "first, Simon".
Ques. Would "Whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens" bring in administration in assembly responsibility?
{391}
J.T. Yes, the assembly as established is constituted, as you might say, in authority and there is no 'if' as to it; "tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer", @Matthew 18: 17. There is no 'if' as to assembly authority; it is viewed abstractly but it is there; viewed from the abstract point of view it is really infallible because its commands and decisions are bound in heaven.
Ques. Does the thought come out in connection with Matthew himself who was occupied in gathering taxes for Rome?
J.T. It is very good to bring that in because he was occupied administratively, sitting at the receipt of taxes, and the Lord inducted him; there was no 'if', it was just "Follow me". The first principle on the moral line is the authority of the Lord, and Matthew did follow Him. He is also to be regarded as a man of importance, and he used this importance immediately for the Lord and brought in certain ones that the Lord could evangelise. His calling was not a bad calling; it was an administrative matter and he was carrying it on, but the Lord said, "Follow me", and he did it. He is called Levi but his apostolic name is Matthew, which is very instructive; he is going to be employed now by the Lord in administrative matters.
Rem. The power to bring him into subjection was thus expressed by the King.
J.T. Quite so. From the very outset authority was brought in by commandment, but this is something more than commandment, because "Follow me" involves the Person; the spiritual touch is there. No one is of any use at all without the spiritual touch in the things of God.
J.W.D. Matthew links the thought of administration with the assembly.
{392}
J.T. The idea would be there. In regard of the people of Israel coming out of Egypt it is of note that whatever was found of God in Egypt was taken on and the people spoiled the Egyptians. God gave them favour in their eyes so that when they asked for certain things such as silver and gold and clothing they gave them to them. That is to say, the principal thought with the Lord as regards His system in this city is to spoil the other system and leave it a shell as much as possible with nothing in it that belongs to Himself. What is of value is taken away and God weakens the system until He leaves it just a shell.
R.R.T. In mentioning the twelve apostles here is there the thought of how the Lord is taking account of what is characteristic with each individual in view of administration?
J.T. Quite so, the names would mean that. The twelve are called "disciples", "And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power", @Matthew 10: 1. That word 'power' indicates the dynamic exercising of authority, showing that they were qualified to cast out unclean spirits and to heal every disease and every bodily weakness. The gift of power for these things is remarkable! These men were able to do the thing and they were called upon by God to do it; the idea of the names is attached to that. In parallel the mighty men of David are mentioned in the beginning of his reign in Chronicles; and at the end in Samuel there is not one missing. The idea is that they were men able to *do* things, mighty men! I believe Matthew and Mark, especially Matthew, had in mind men able to *do* things, not only because they were appointed but because they had power in a dynamic sense. That is real power, and their names were taken from that.
R.R.T. That is an important feature in connection with administration; certain conventions of this
{393}
world fall because there is no power to carry out their decisions, and our administration will fall unless there is the power to carry it forward.
J.T. That is what Matthew and Mark have in mind particularly -- power! They also have in mind great men, mighty men: "Now the names of the twelve apostles are these". These twelve men each had a designation, so that in the meeting for discipline you would be reminded of the designation of each.
J.D. The earthquake and the angel sitting on the stone would set aside the great system of this world and introduce a new kingdom.
J.T. Yes; that would be seen in the whole passage before us. "And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men". Well, that is all impressing us with the power, not simply authority in the sense of commandments because of being told to do the thing, but undoubted ability to do it. That is a feature of Matthew and he himself is representative of it. So here you have the real thing; nobody is destroyed, for the angel destroys no one, but the power is there and everyone is to fear.
J.W.D. It is the application of dynamic power.
J.T. It is *real* power, really to enlarge in a simple way the question of authority. He came in with power and authority as vested in himself. "And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men". It suggests the way the whole universe is seen, so to speak, as well as how the men are affected, though they would come in in a special way as men are what Matthew has particularly in
{394}
mind. Men are coming in to be formed into an institution called by the word 'assembly'; it is properly from a Greek word meaning 'called out persons', called out in view of being in a certain position. So it is, according to Hebrews, "the assembly of the first-born", such persons as those. And these are all in the kingdom which really supersedes the great word 'assembly'.
C.H.H. "Clothing white as snow" would suggest the moral side as linking on with the power.
L.E.S. Would what is found in Isaiah link on here? "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Seraphim were standing above him, each had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he flew. And one called to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" @Isaiah 6: 1 - 3.
J.T. It was an array of power and the prophets were able to see that; Jeremiah saw something too and what he saw was to support his ministry, and similarly with the other prophets. Matthew is on Old Testament lines and what is new is now introduced by Christ Himself. The angel is representative of heaven's authority and power; he evidences the idea and it is seen first by the women. Then the Lord comes in and He greets the women particularly, saying, "Hail!". The way the Lord salutes these women is very beautiful! It was not men but women, a very important matter because women are part of the constitution of the assembly. This chapter shows how heaven respects them and the Lord Himself particularly so.
L.E.S. "Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us'", @Matthew 1: 23.
J.W.D. The stone is rolled away, and do we have the guarantee that everything in the nature of stone
{395}
which will interfere with the assembly will be rolled away?
J.T. That is very suggestive. Stone may be representative of what is of God of a permanent nature, but here it would suggest a great obstacle in the way in the minds of those lovers of the Lord and "an angel ... came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it". The thing is done! So in our difficulties we shall find that the divine hand has done the principal thing. We come up against real obstacles and what are we going to do? If we proceed we shall find that the divine hand has been there before us.
R.R.T. The sign of real triumph is to sit upon it.
J.T. There is a certain serenity in the attitude of the brethren in the way they can sit still and be wise. God is with them, as it says, "God is indeed amongst you", @1 Corinthians 14: 25. The man thus impressed falls down, convicted of all, judged of all, and worships God.
Rem. God has everything under control.
J.T. The stone is rolled away and the angel is sitting upon it; no one is interfering with that! "His look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow"; there is warning in that.
J.D. What is said as to the women comes in in connection with the assembly meeting. It is important that the sisters should be there in all affection, sympathetically regarding the situation; it is to such the Lord says, "Hail!"
J.T. Very beautiful! In that connection we purposely omitted reading verse 1 of this chapter. Why were the women there? They came to look at the sepulchre -- a futile occupation! They had light as to it too, but they did not walk in the light. It says, "Now late on sabbath, as it was the dusk of the next day after sabbath, came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre". Well, what
{396}
did they have in their minds? It was very nice to look at the sepulchre, but there should have been more in their minds. Luke tells us that suddenly two men in shining raiment stood by them, and they rebuked them and told them what the Lord had said when He was with them in Galilee, "And they remembered his words". Sure enough, it was in their minds only it was dormant! So the thing is for us to realise that our minds are to be active.
J.D. It is a question now of following the present words of ministry.
J.T. I think so. Where are our minds? If something comes up today about which you are not clear, do you have to go to this one and that one? You had much better tax your mind. What about yourself? what have you here? The two men were saying what the Lord had said in Galilee and as they talked the sayings came back into the women's minds; then of course there was no further difficulty, I believe that is the point, because these women came with dark minds however commendable they might seem, and so we have the men in this position to impress their minds. Then it is said in our chapter, "And the angel answering said to the women. Fear not *ye*". Only sisters were there, and they with dark, inactive minds, but heaven was tender and sympathetic with them, saying, "Fear not *ye*", and the 'ye' is emphatic. The Spirit of God shows that the sisters have special consideration at this juncture; they were to be a part of the system in the upper room in Acts and so they needed tender consideration if they were to be of any use at all; they must be handled tenderly. And then it says, "for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one. He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see
{397}
him. Behold, I have told you". The idea of seeing enters into their message.
L.E.S. For the understanding of the ministry do we need the sensitiveness of the Spirit suggested in the character of a dove? It would help us to be balanced in the truth.
J.T. That is good, I am sure. The point is that we have to tax ourselves because what we are in involves a system, an organism. No one can explain the organism of the human body, and the Lord intended that because He intends the idea to enter into this system, the assembly, in which we find ourselves. It is an organism and involves great refinement and sensitiveness.
C.H.H. "O knowledge too wonderful for me!" @Psalm 139: 6.
J.W.D. Body organism makes for one mind, and most of the letters sent around would not need to be answered if we understood how the body organism works out locally.
J.T. I think that is right. Let us tax ourselves as to what we know. Has He told us? The two men in Luke reminded them of what they knew and the women came to it, so with those going to Emmaus, their hearts burned within them; they were affected inwardly.
J.D. The angel says, "Go quickly", and the women are evidently obedient to the angelic ministry so that as they are in the path the Lord meets them. They had listened to the ministry and taken it on.
J.T. Quite so. This is angelic ministry of course dealing with the inauguration of christianity but it is a primary lesson that we have to learn, to come under the authority of heaven. With Philip it was not the Spirit that told him to go to Gaza but an angel, yet when he went we are told that the Spirit took him on.
{398}
We ought to see the importance of the women's place here and how it is carried through, so that the term "your women" is mentioned in Corinthians. It is thus carried through into assembly matters and I believe there is instruction here for those who are of the organism. Are we sensitive and do we remember what we have heard? Are we keeping things in our minds? We should be ready to be ministered to and ready to keep up with whatever is current. This is the principle on which the body functions, not by writing letters to some brother five or six thousand miles away but by taxing what you know yourself. There is no need for it, especially in view of the time it takes to get a letter back; tax yourself! The Spirit of God is ready and He will give understanding.
L.E.S. "And *ye* have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things", @1 John 2: 20.
Ques. Would that be "according to the power which works in us", @Ephesians 3: 20?
J.T. Just so; as it says here, "He is not here, for he is risen, as he said". There is no need to go to anyone else for instruction, tax yourself! The "as he said" would show that they had heard what He said.
R.R.T. The case with us may possibly be that we need adjustment as to where the Lord is at the moment. They were seeking Him, the crucified One, in the grave, but their thoughts were directed to the fact that He was not there but was risen and was going before them into Galilee.
J.T. And the idea of appointment is a kingdom principle. The word 'appointment' is used in verse 16, "But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them", and that implies acting under directions, the authority of the Lord entering into it. The word to the women was by the angel, "Behold, I have told you". He
{399}
spoke with authority, and that principle runs down to the present day, in a greater or lesser degree, in a prophet, or a righteous man, or a disciple. It is a poor thing not to have some authority; I need it in my work if I am an employer, and I need to know how to order it according to God. The next thing is that they are doing what the angel has told them and are doing it quickly, not at a later date but "going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples word". How many things are done quickly by us all, and how unreliable we often are! But what we get here is reliability; they carry the message that they have received and the Lord comes to meet them: "And as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail!". They were carrying out the message and the Lord saluted them: "And as they went, behold, some of the watch went into the city, and brought word to the chief priests of all that had taken place". That was the devil's work. We are prone to speak of women as carrying false information but these women carried the things they received intact and the Lord came in and saluted them.
J.D. The Lord here speaks of the disciples as "my brethren", speaking of the institution of the assembly.
J.T. So there is advance, and the word 'ran' here is progressive. The angel gives a short word, and then the Lord uses His own word, "Go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me".
L.E.S. In reporting ministry it is needful to bring in the spiritual state in which that ministry is conveyed.
J.T. I think that is good.
Rem. The meeting place here is Galilee, despicable in the eyes of men.
{400}
J.T. That is another thought, that the position in Galilee is one of reproach.
J.W.D. This word 'hail' should be in evidence in administrative matters, and the Lord's being with us would tend to moral power.
J.T. That word implies that we are to be respectful to the brethren, a great factor, for if we have no respect for the brethren we shall certainly never love them.
C.H.H. In @Romans 16 we have a list of salutations to different brethren.
J.T. That is the idea. The word 'salute' is used many times there.
Rem. Please say a word about, "And they coming up took him by the feet, and did him homage".
J.T. Why should He be held by the feet? What effect would that have upon Him? What was intended by them? The woman in @Luke 7 anointed His feet but they are not doing that; they would detain Him and it was not the time for that; the Lord was taking up a new position. We might say, There was no harm in what they did, but it is out of keeping with this position of haste.
C.H.H. The thought of Galilee was intended to clear their minds of current ecclesiastical ideas.
J.T. It would be a word for christians in the early days, and especially for the Jews, because when the work of God began with them it was indicated that they were not to make much of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem came under great discipline and was terribly treated as it were by God. I suppose the Jews would be affected by the traditions of Jerusalem, but it is important in christianity to be held rightly in regard of what is traditional. Tradition speaks of that which is on old lines and the elder brethren must be careful that more is not attached to them than is due, for we have to accept reproach on the line of refusing traditions.
{401}
L.E.S. What is the thought in the mount of Olives?
J.T. That is where He comes, which is important.
R.R.T. Thank God for the position of reproach!
J.T. That is where the power lies and it is the position definitely appointed. It reminds us of the mountain viewed by Abraham and its import as brought out in @Genesis 22. In @Genesis 8 we have mount Ararat on which the ark rested; it rested on the crest of the mountain, but special spiritual importance attaches to the mountain in chapter 22: 14, "On the mount of Jehovah will be provided". Mountains are a great feature running all through Scripture and Matthew emphasises them; here the mountain is the place of appointment.
R.R.T. It is a great thought that while in the position of reproach yet we have available the mountain in the midst of Galilee.
J.T. That brings up our point for this meeting, "the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them". It was the great object in their minds on the way, "And when they saw him, they did homage to him"; how affected they were! They worshipped Him! This is a system of things in which the Lord is to be worshipped for He is a divine Person and that must colour everything. It is not simply that He is viewed as such but He *is* that, He is God, as John records it in the words of Thomas, "My Lord and my God". That is what the Jews will say in a coming day and that is what we are to say, too.
Ques. Does this principle of moving according to divine appointment make way for the Lord to come in, and in coming to remain?
J.T. That is true. The disciples are keeping His appointment and that gives them moral status with Him. They are incomplete, only eleven, but still they carry out the divine commandment.
{402}
J.A. The mountain is the thought of superiority, is it not?
J.T. It is the place of provision, "On the mount of Jehovah will be provided", so the disciples are governed by the commandment and I believe that is the basis of Christianity from the Matthew viewpoint. Although a broken number, eleven instead of twelve, and today we have two or three instead of one hundred and twenty, yet locally the position is immutable on the line of moral righteousness; and further the position here is stabilised by the Lord saying, "Behold, *I* am with you all the days, until the completion of the age". What a word that is! What stability!
J.D. Why does the writer say anything about those who doubted?
J.T. The Lord makes no allusion to the broken number nor to Thomas; He is not speaking because of the doubters, He is going forward.
R.R.T. The footnote in regard of the word 'doubting' would help. If there is hesitation in regard of worship in connection with the Lord it is a solemn matter.
J.T. "They did homage to him, but some doubted". It is the idea of hesitation. The Lord is not stopped by the two going to Emmaus nor by the doubters; the eleven, representing the general position, are right.
C.H.H. Does worshipping Jesus as a divine Person imply that there is full deity there in manhood?
J.T. Undoubtedly there was some such thought in their minds; I would take it for full value. The Spirit of God records that "when they saw him, they did homage to him". "And Jesus coming up spoke to them", because the mountain would be nothing to Him without them; so in John He came to where the disciples were.
{403}
Rem. The Lord comes to us at the Supper.
J.T. He comes to us, and He came to them. "And Jesus coming up spoke to them". If any one of these eleven had been late they would have missed this, but they were there. Suppose you were to be there and you were not there! I think anyone trifling in mind and neglectful and as such coming in late is wanting in this respect; these things are to be taken account of because they enter into the constitution of the assembly.
J.W.D. Do you mean this principle of going to the mountain?
J.T. What the mountain was then is now the assembly where the Lord provides much. In @1 Corinthians 14 the whole assembly in one place would suggest the idea of the mountain of God.
C.H.H. In Hebrews we are said to come to mount Zion.
J.T. We are said there to have come to eight things and the first thing mentioned after the allusion to the intrusion of a beast is mount Zion, a question of grace. So Luke says, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon".
Ques. Does the mountain speak in a peculiar way of divine resources? Isaiah speaks of the mountain of Jehovah's house being established on the top of the mountains.
J.T. And Ezekiel says, "This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain ... is most holy". It is a question of moral strength and that must enter into the assembly.
Rem. Divine teaching is respected.
J.T. Just so. "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
{404}
I have enjoined you". You get that transmitted to @Acts 2 where "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles" (verse 42).
Ques. What is the difference between power and authority?
J.T. Well, it is a question of what is in mind in English because the word 'power' covers both, it covers both commandment and authority, and power supports the command; the two ideas are expressed in the same word. Suppose a policeman arrests a man, he must have something to show that his authority is from the government. Well, these men here are just eleven Jews, you may say, and they are told to go and make disciples of all nations. But are they just Jews? Presently, ten men shall take hold of the skirt of a Jew, "saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you", @Zechariah 8: 23. There will be power with them then, but that is not so here, this is simply going out amongst the nations to convert them and is more the thought of moral power because the Spirit of God is with them, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations" -- a great order! Making disciples is not simply telling a man what to do but relates to what the man is himself, as when the Lord said to them, I will make you fishers of men. There is clearly the suggestion of power in what they were commanded to do and these things must be in ourselves individually; that is the point in what we are looking at, that we might learn to *do* these things and be governed by these principles.
Ques. In @Matthew 10 they are first called disciples and then later on apostles. Is authority connected with apostles?
J.T. Just so, and what we have looked at in that chapter shows they were qualified to do certain things. "And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, so
{405}
that they should cast them out, and heal every disease and every bodily weakness" (verse 1). That is the power to *do* things, and then in the next verse they are called apostles. The title 'apostles' indicates that they were representative of the Lord, they were His apostles, and to them was committed real power for casting out of demons and so forth. That same idea is what is in mind here; it is apostolic: "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you. And behold, *I* am with you all the days, until the completion of the age". That is the position, because in Matthew it is a question of how we are to carry on in the position and how it becomes practicable.
L.E.S. So the question is how far this power over demons and bodily weaknesses comes into evidence at the present moment.
J.T. That is the question we are stressing now, bearing in mind that there is a difference between the synoptical gospels and John's gospel, the former dealing with the beginning of the dispensation and the latter dealing with the end, so that in effect a great change comes about. We are not now relying on outward signs but on the Spirit of God and power in a moral way, so that John speaks of a man being born again -- how much greater than an outward sign! That is what was coming in in the Spirit's day, and so we do not need these signs now. John does not call the Lord's acts miracles as the other evangelists do but refers to them as signs, just calling attention to what was there. The Spirit is here now, and John stresses the Spirit and makes way for Him.
Rem. In @Acts 19 it says, "And God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul". How do you look at that?
{406}
J.T. They were needed then. If a brother amongst us could raise the dead or heal the sick how many people would we have coming to us? Everybody in this city! But there is nothing moral in that, it would be just a nine days wonder and when the man died that would be the end. But the power of God is to affect a man so that he is born again -- what a great matter! That is greater than raising the dead. You say, How can that be? But it is true. "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes; thus is every one that is born of the Spirit", @John 3: 8. Think of that! What a man he is -- born of the Spirit of God!
J.D. Why is it "baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"?
J.T. It is kingdom truth and it introduces us into the assembly. The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit Each have a say in this, so that if I am baptised to Them there are great possibilities. The mission here was to the nations; presently it will be to the Jews, as set out in a great measure in chapter 10, which contemplates what enters into christianity but what came out in judaism. The disciples were not told there to go to the nations but here they are sent to the nations, and what power goes with them as they go to make disciples of all nations, introducing them to the realm of the Father, Son, and Spirit, the economy in which God is known; baptism opens the way into it. The suggestion in the word 'to' is that you are for God and He is for you.
J.W.D. Would Matthew's teaching fill out the names of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit with spiritual completeness?
J.T. The preaching here is by moral influence; Matthew gives a Model. He presents the Lord Jesus saying, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and *I* will give you rest. Take my yoke
{407}
upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart", chapter 11: 28, 29. "Learn from me" is the objective thought; you see something in someone else and are affected by it. To make disciples I must not only preach but I must be the thing; Jesus was altogether what He said.
Rem. The first three gentiles brought their households too to be baptised as a result of the preaching, Cornelius, Lydia and the Philippian jailor.
J.T. Very good. Baptism was to make them representative of christianity. Paul and Silas represented it to the jailor and Peter to Cornelius; the Lord was particular to make them the thing before sending them out.
J.D. In the baptism of the eunuch both he and Philip went into the water.
J.T. Quite so. Philip was the thing, and the Spirit of God seizes on that point to rapture him. He sets out the idea of christianity just as much as Stephen did, for these two men were models; they were both deacons and models of christianity. What would become of christianity if we had not models? Such persons influence others, and make us say, I want to be like him.
Rem. If a person has been sprinkled with water instead of being submerged would it be right to baptise him again?
J.T. Well, if it has been done in the name of the Lord it is accepted in heaven and I would not baptise a person like that again; he is baptised and as such is held responsible by heaven.
Rem. Persons should be actually buried in the water.
J.T. That is the moral thought but still heaven accepts the other. The whole christian profession is held responsible by heaven and almost all in it are baptised like that. At the same time I would say that if a person's conscience would not be satisfied without
{408}
being baptised again I should have no difficulty in doing it; if it is necessary for a good conscience by all means do it. I was asked about that by a Roman Catholic who did not know whether or not he had been baptised and I said, If you were born a Catholic it is quite right to assume that you have been baptised; however, if your conscience disturbs you by all means have it done again. The Lord is merciful and it is good to satisfy your conscience but there is hardly a christian living that heaven does not regard in the light of having been baptised.
Rem. It is important that this thought of making disciples and baptising is linked together; it is one matter.
J.T. The preposition 'to' is helpful because it is introducing you to something; 'in the name' involves power but 'to the name' is introducing you into something and it is well worth your while! It opens the way to enjoy things in God's realm.
R.R.T. Would you use this formula today?
J.T. Yes, I think so, 'To' suggests the objective thought introducing you into something through the three Persons, whereas 'in' suggests power.
R.R.T. So you would baptise in the name of the Lord Jesus and to the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
C.H.H. Both words are used in @1 Corinthians 10: 2, "and all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea".
{409}
THE LORD'S COMING TO HIS OWN AS SEEN IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (2)
@Luke 24: 28 - 53
J.T. The same subject is in view as in our first reading, that is, the Lord coming to His own, only we are to look at it now from the standpoint of Luke's account, having his first treatise in mind and leaving Acts until perhaps the last reading. But I think we should again call attention to the women that enter into the account, and especially as Luke has the assembly in mind as functioning, not merely in an administrative or disciplinary sense but in the service of God, and therefore sisters are immediately in mind as set out in 1 Corinthians, Timothy, Titus and indeed generally. Luke gives us what may be called the constitutional side of the assembly as presented in chapter 8 in a man, a woman and a child; the girl of twelve years of age is raised up, the demoniac man is sitting, clothed in his right mind, and the woman is healed from the issue of blood. She is called "daughter", and it is the daughter of Jairus that is raised up, so these three seem to form the foundation proper to the assembly and there, as in this closing chapter, much prominence is given to women. It is said of them in the end of chapter 23, "And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed". That word 'placed' is to be noticed, it is not 'lay', and earlier we have the word that the Lord placed Himself at table in view of the Supper. But then chapter 23 goes on, "And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the commandment", showing that these women were governed by right principles outwardly, "But on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in
{410}
the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the aromatic spices which they had prepared. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment. And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among the dead? He is not here, but is risen, remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day. And they remembered his words; and, returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest". And then we have mention of Mary of Magdala, and Johanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the others with them. Later we have a sister again in the two that had gone to Emmaus, for one was evidently a woman, probably the wife, so that the sisters are in much prominence and it is thought that we should keep them in mind not only as presented in Matthew but in regard of the comeliness of the assembly as convened. It was noted this morning that they represent a very necessary element but one liable to be unduly influenced, able to maintain certain right feelings and sentiments and yet to be dark and uncertain and unobservant of what has been taught. Such persons may be going to the meetings and listening and saying, 'We had a good time', and yet forgetting what has been said, so that when difficulties arise there is no certainty but a having to look far afield to get help.
Rem. The element of intelligence should be with us.
J.T. Just so. The women moved by commandment here but they had forgotten what they had
{411}
heard and were dark as to it, but heaven moves in the situation by means of two men in shining garments, suggesting heavenly habiliments, and they appear *suddenly*. That idea of suddenness runs through Luke; the visitation is urgent, and we may look for it especially if darkness is unduly found in the saints, and uncertainty and forgetfulness of what has been taught; heaven has to be abrupt at such times in calling attention to it.
J.W.D. Sisters are especially seen in relation to the development of feelings in the assembly.
J.T. Yes, that is good, and the idea of adornment is attached to them in the instruction of the apostles. Peter and Paul both speak of their adorning, and Peter also speaks of the hidden man of the heart. The feminine side is apt to be secretive but if it is to be secretive let it be in the sense of affection for Christ and that the mystery should work out in that connection, so that they keep things as Mary kept things in her heart.
C.H.H. The feminine side is stressed in the recovery of Israel, "seven women shall take hold of one man ...".
J.T. That is so. We had the ten men this morning taking hold of the skirt of the Jew, but the seven women want a name, "Let us be called by thy name", they say, whereas the ten men say, "God is with you".
R.R.T. Is this a proper feature with the women, that they are linked with Him as having come along with Him out of Galilee?
J.T. It is. That refers back to chapter 7 where we have a delightful, remarkable feminine product with the testimony that she loved much because she was forgiven much; she was a person with strong affection for Christ, based on forgiveness. Then the next chapter says, "And it came to pass afterwards that *he* went through the country city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad
{412}
tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him, and certain women who had been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities, Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance". Their history goes back that far and now they are with Him here. I think this feature of the part the sisters have publicly in the assembly is important; it is not exactly the administrative side which is so fully developed in Matthew but the side of divine service, service God-ward, involving their comeliness and sensitiveness in a holy way. The hidden man of the heart provides adornment but not in a physical sense, and all this is touched on in the epistles. 1 Timothy gives instruction regarding younger sisters and older ones, even mentioning the age of sixty years and one being put on the list for assembly giving, and all this fits in with what is comely before God and man, yet offering assembly material of spiritual wealth.
J.D. In regard of their following the Lord what would you say of the next verse, "And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath according to the commandment"? Would that answer in a way to the ministry which not only involves following the Lord into death but requires divine visitation suddenly by angelic ministration?
J.T. Well, the suddenness is peculiar in this section; it appears as though it had been already needed in the earlier part of the gospel, but we have now come to a critical time. Simeon earlier said to Mary, mother of the Lord, "Even a sword shall go through thine own soul; so that the thoughts may be revealed from many hearts", and here we have come to that time; it had happened, indeed, when the Lord's mother had been at the cross. But as she continues
{413}
with the company she enriches it and the Spirit of God refers to her in a very peculiar way. Think of what she knew about the Lord! She had knowledge no one else could have. The time had come and passed when the sword should go through her soul; she had pictured these things. Indeed earlier we are shown that she was a spiritual woman for she added to the service of God when she went to the hill country of Judah. She had said, "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour", @Luke 1: 46. The Spirit tells us too that she kept all these things about Christ in her heart, and now she has been at the cross; John says she was there. Is she going to continue to maintain what she has gained? Is she going to keep on keeping things in her heart and pondering them? Will she continue in that way to add to the wealth of the company? Luke speaks of Mary in his second treatise and says that she was there in the upper room and the Lord seems to be everything to her now; natural relationships have proved to be utterly useless and untrustworthy. But the Lord succeeds in making relatives useful, for not only His mother but His brethren were found there in the upper room; so Acts continues the narrative and we see that Mary was successful in going on and as far as we know she continued to enrich the assembly.
J.W.D. In connection with these exercises two men stand by in shining raiment and the sisters are to take account of that in regard to their exercises.
J.T. We have to pursue the thought of the sisters in this enquiry because there is much to be noted. In what the two men say to them there is no flattery at all. It says, "And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among the dead?". Thus we are reminded of the need of asking questions of our sisters that require an answer; there should
{414}
be an answer. "Why seek ye the living one among the dead? He is not here, but is risen; remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day". Now this is a challenge to their hearts with no flattery or commendation in it. They should have remembered, and now the ministry of the two men aids them and brings out the need and the condition. Then they remember what they had heard and carry this living truth in their souls, for it says, "They remembered his words". They leave the sepulchre and go to the brethren, leaving the dead -- that was a finished matter and it was a question now of the living saints.
R.R.T. Is your thought that this word is especially addressed to the sisters or would it be for the whole company?
J.T. The men here paid especial attention to them, and wherever the word of God is ministered they are present.
J.D. After the appearance of the two men the sisters seem to need no further adjustment but go from the sepulchre to the disciples. How would that apply today?
J.T. Well, they had the truth in the main, so to speak. We might say they were devoted women to be up so early and no doubt they were sincere, but sincerity is no virtue if I am wrong, and this had been a move in the wrong direction because they did not remember the things ministered.
J.W.D. Would you open up a little how we are to get the sisters functioning by asking them questions?
J.T. As far as the assembly goes their part is to be silent, but this is the secret, mystery side in which they may help. It bears on what they have inwardly.
J.W.D. Would asking them questions bring that out?
{415}
J.T. It might do that. As we have said, in the assembly their part is to be silent but this is a question of what is inward and Mary, the Lord's mother, represents a sister who is able to keep things: "Mary kept all these things in her mind, pondering them in her heart".
J.W.D. Although a sister is silent in the assembly her mind is active spiritually.
J.T. Quite so, and her affections too, so that Mary is said to be in the upper room, "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren", @Acts 1: 14.
C.H.H. Would all this be educational for the sisters in view of Pentecost so that they might have intelligent part in the administration according to the prophecy of Joel? "And it shall be in the last days, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream with dreams; yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I, pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy", @Acts 2: 17, 18.
J.T. That is a point to bring out because at Pentecost this inaugural scripture in Joel was fulfilled. Bondwomen are mentioned, and they were the thing; and sons and daughters were there, young persons.
L.E.S. It says of Anna in @Luke 2 that she was "of the tribe of Asher" indicating a spiritual idea that goes right through, and she continues in the temple night and day.
J.T. That is in keeping with Luke because he really links on with Ezra and by extension with the whole history of the testimony, for Ezra begins the book of Chronicles with Adam. It is the first name in that whole work, so that there is the carrying down
{416}
of the truth through Luke into the New Testament, attaching it to Anna and then to these sisters we have been speaking of and ending up with Paul in Rome. Luke was evidently an accurate man, he records with method, and these thoughts help us greatly as to the feminine side in regard to the assembly; not the assembly viewed generally but more as together, emphasising the comeliness and treasure that are in it in those who keep things in their hearts; they are like a reservoir of spiritual power.
J.D. Would the thought of Hannah in 1 Samuel help?
J.T. She is very suggestively connected with Mary because Hannah is praying and yet we do not hear one word! And then in chapter 2 we have what is called prayer but it is really praise; it is a celebration, you might say, to Jehovah; and so with Mary.
R.R.T. In connection with the matter of questioning the sisters would it be right to bring in Rebecca? Her family said to her, "Wilt thou go with this man?". And here in Luke they were following Him.
J.T. There is also the questioning of Sapphira, because in truth she is regarded as a sister. Peter challenges her and brings out the truth.
J.W.D. Sisters as being silent publicly would minister to the idea of depth of feeling.
J.T. They sing David's praises in the book of Samuel, which helps at this point. Hannah is brought in in that book and also the women that praised David, "Saul hath smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands", @1 Samuel 18: 7. That section brings out masculine and feminine affections, the masculine side being in Jonathan of whom David says, "Thy love to me was wonderful, passing women's love", @2 Samuel 1: 26. In @Exodus 15 we have a parallel idea, the women following the example of Miriam who takes her tambour in her hand and adds to what
{417}
Moses had sung in a masculine way. So that there are two sides to the singing, and now as we come into the New Testament, of course, there is also singing. And singing is not the same as speaking, it is melody; it is for God.
C.H.H. The section that comes before the Supper in @1 Corinthians 11 speaks of the relation of man and woman.
J.T. What is indicated there is very important, and then what comes after the Supper is that the women are not to speak but they are to have their part in the service. And indeed what we are considering now begins with the Lord's supper, for Luke infers that the two going to Emmaus were a man and woman.
C.H.H. "Neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord", @1 Corinthians 11: 11. There is the balance.
J.T. As the Lord's supper was instituted in Luke it would look as if it was instituted with just the twelve, "And when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him", but it was inaugurated as something that could be added to. Feelings, not law, enter into the testimony of the Lord's supper, and the Spirit then saw, as it were, the controversy that would come in and so He rendered unquestionable testimony to what happened. These things enter into the beginning of our chapter because they are the beginning of assembly service God-ward.
R.R.T. Though the woman is to be silent in assembly yet her mouth is not altogether stopped for it says in verse 10, "who told these things to the apostles". And that would apply today, that there are places where a sister can open her mouth.
J.T. By all means! That is a cardinal truth. Take, for example, the household of Chloe, she acquainted Paul with what was current at Corinth, with very important
{418}
things too! Her household might link with Abigail and her young men who were ready to say the right things at the right time.
Ques. Would the last verse of the chapter include these women, "And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God?"
J.T. You might say that, but it is a question of accurate enquiry as to whether it has reference to the apostles or to the whole company; it requires close attention. In general after the Lord is introduced in verse 36 the instruction is largely to do with the public testimony; thus He says to them in verse 44, "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled. Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures, and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem. And *ye* are witnesses of these things", I think the '*ye*' there applies to the apostles, they are the ones who are mainly in view.
Rem. The apostles are now the accredited witnesses to carry things forward.
J.T. That is what links this section with the beginning of Acts. What has been said about the feminine side in our gatherings is of the utmost importance because they bring in a wealth of feeling and affection and sentiment, but these are to be accompanied by sincerity and truthfulness. So that secretiveness in this sense carries power and influence; such are those who "love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption", as seen for example in Mary of Bethany who anointed Him with pure nard.
{419}
R.R.T. The tendency with us is not to give this matter its proper place and when the sisters come with godly exercises regarding a matter we are unconcerned and their words appear like idle tales.
J.T. These women go and tell the apostles and those with them. Truth is truth, and it is carried in power and influence.
R.R.T. We are to take account of the exercises brought through the sisters.
J.T. As witnesses, quite so.
Ques. Is the feminine idea to be carried forward in the twelve because the church includes both the feminine and the masculine sides?
J.T. Well, it is hardly connected with the twelve. The women are seen here as in connection with the apostles and also in the beginning of Acts we get such as Mary in the upper room; suggestive of that side we have the prophecy quoted from Joel.
J.W.D. Would not the work of God in the twelve have feminine qualities too? Brothers have feminine features of God's work.
J.T. Viewed as the assembly, of course, the feminine is carried right through. The assembly is the bride of Christ, which is a feminine thought, and then there is the idea of the sons of God too.
Ques. Is the idea of sons of God a higher thought?
J.T. I would think so; sons of God is the greatest level we can get.
Rem. "Passing women's love".
Rem. Sisters can enter into the thought of the sons of God too.
C.H.H. What is actually being stressed is the part of womanhood as in contrast to brethren.
J.T. Just so. The assembly viewed as Luke presents it to us is functioning God-ward; it is not only in a public sense exactly, so that the sisters have a large place in the gospel.
{420}
But we should not occupy all the time with that side, we come now to the two on the way to Emmaus, helping us as to the circumstances of the Lord's coming to a position where He is wanted. So it is said, "And they drew near to the village where they were going, and *he* made as though he would go farther. And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining". It should be noted that these are both of the assembly yet they are going away. But now they are almost ready to return to the place where they should be and they begin to manifest features that belong to the assembly. The word 'constrained' is used, and the Lord is ready to be constrained in that sense, constrained by love.
L.E.S. They needed the full development of the truth itself; I am thinking of the underlying condition in which the truth is to be known by us, and only the Lord could set it out.
J.T. I think that He looks for desire with us. Undoubtedly His whole service to them was to bring about this very thing. What does ministry accomplish in us? His making as if He would go farther would bring out what had been accomplished. Will they really want Him? Is the general underlying condition of the place that the Lord is wanted or can we get on without Him?
Rem. Lydia constrained Paul to abide with her.
J.T. She is really representative of assembly qualities. And so here the Lord made as if to go farther and they constrained Him saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining". That was an intelligent remark.
R.R.T. It shows how far the Lord will go in love. He will be constrained by these two. It is not a large company, just two.
J.T. That is the point, because both man and woman are secured, representing assembly material.
{421}
The two are taken account of here whereas Matthew says "two or three".
R.R.T. You would look for such features as these in a locality, even in two or three.
J.T. They would not take No for an answer, so to speak. The Lord is looking for such.
J.W.D. The constraining was not due to sentimentality. They had been truly affected by His words: "having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself".
J.T. Quite so. The influence of the scripture is beautiful. The Lord would use the types to show that they spoke concerning Himself.
J.D. This would be a special voice to those whom the Lord uses in service. Is my service such that it brings into view the Person of Christ in this way so that the hearts of the saints respond to Him?
J.T. That is good, and so @Luke 10 brings out this matter, where He sent out seventy persons, two and two, to go to every city and place where He Himself was about to come. Will the twos make a way for Him? Will their visit to the places so impress persons with the thought of Christ and the attractiveness of His Person that when He comes the door will be wide open? So ministers are to secure an open door for the Lord amongst His people and we are not to forget that.
Rem. The writer of the Song of Songs speaks of the Lord as gone; the loved one did not let Him in.
J.T. That is good. She would not let Him in because she was not ready to get up; it was not that she did not love Him but the love was not strong enough and the Lord departed -- a very solemn thing!
A.D. If we are prepared for adjustment the Lord is ready to come in.
{422}
J.T. That is how it works out. The ministry should be adjusting, in that way, and that is what comes out here. As the Scriptures are ministered to them how it affects their hearts! They burn within them; but still they are not ready to turn back yet. Nevertheless what is produced in their hearts makes room for what follows, and then it is the Lord's going in and breaking bread that turns them back to the company.
J.D. "Having begun from Moses" -- what an opening up of the Pentateuch!
J.T. Yes, how He would open it up! I suppose the walk may have taken two hours, well, He went over the ground in that time. Think of the ground He covered!
Ques. Would the experience of the two going to Emmaus be a good thing for us on Lord's Day before the morning meeting? It would be a touch from the Lord in that way.
J.T. The word 'constrain' is a beautiful word. It is found in @2 Corinthians 5: 14, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised". The love of Christ affects us in that way, so that we go to the meeting and we are entirely for the Lord, to love Him who died for us and was raised again. And then there is the other side that we *want* Him there, and that means that we leave our houses and sit down together in assembly that we might constrain Him. He is amenable to influence of that kind, I cannot imagine His coming to a company where He was not wanted, a company taken up with earthly things. We say the Lord is with us, but He may not be! Do we want Him? That is the point.
{423}
Rem. Joseph could not restrain himself, he must make himself known to his brethren.
J.T. Quite so, and he put everyone else out.
J.D. If we knew the Lord as a lover of righteousness and hater of lawlessness we would be careful where we invited Him. The testimony of Him in the first chapter of Hebrews indicates these features and He is still marked by them.
J.T. Yes, that enters into what we are speaking of. What the Lord is really working up to is that that very thing should come out in us.
J.D. The reaction of the saints to the ministry concerning Christ is what is in mind here.
J.T. Quite so. The next thing to note is that we are on spiritual lines. There was a meal to be got ready and how long did it take? I suppose there was nothing in the house; it would have been empty when they got there. They had constrained Him, as we are told, and that is one thing, but then the next thing mentioned is what transpired while at table with them. How long a time had elapsed between their arrival and His sitting at table with them? What precious moments those were! How were they occupied? What did the wife do, or the husband? How were these precious moments to be filled up? It suggests the idea of the assembly and those moments are infinitely precious; how are they to be filled up? And now He is at table with them, joining in the meal they had prepared. What moments they were! They would have been very full moments in that house in the Lord's presence.
C.H.H. There is no reproach or complaint while the meal is being prepared.
J.T. That is true, nothing unbecoming is suggested. Young people must behave suitably in assembly. Indeed sometimes even the older ones talk to each other. All these considerations are important in regard of assembly functioning as Luke has it in mind.
{424}
R.R.T. So three times the word 'them' is repeated. How far the Lord would go! He stayed with them, He was at the table with them, and He broke bread and gave it to them. It shows the extent of His love.
J.T. It is important to see the action there, "he ... gave it to them". They had to do something and now He is giving something to them. And so a brother has to do something in preparation for the Supper; he has to get a loaf and cup and put them where they should be. That is a very important thing, though not in itself spiritual, but we are now coming to purely spiritual matters, "Having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to them". The word 'gave' has peculiar force as most of the brethren will know, it is not the article given that is in mind but the idea of *giving*. It suggests something handed to them, and to us is something the Lord puts into our hands, meaning that it is to be with us, as Joseph said to the butler, "Only bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well with thee". The Lord is putting it into our hands and it remains there; it is not taken away from us.
Ques. Does the thought of 'house-father' bring in the family side?
J.T. It is the family side, an informal family matter.
Rem. Bringing affections into play.
J.T. The meaning of the word 'gave' is worthy of further note; Mr. Darby's note says, 'It has the sense of "giving it into their hands", as a letter ... . He took the house-father's place, and blessed and gave it to them'. The peculiar force of the verb is to be noted because it is something so precious at this time, a critical time in our affections. Are we ready to give something? Because after His giving to them He departs from them. And so it goes on,
{425}
one, two, three: "And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way, and as he opened the scriptures to us? And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem". That is what they did, and it was no small thing to go back to Jerusalem that very day.
Rem. What is the thought in "but their eyes were holden so as not to know him"?
J.T. That is God's action, I think. Here, in verse 31, "their eyes were opened, and they recognised him", but in verse 16 "their eyes were holden". It was not due to state in them; in their case it was an act of God and it happened to facilitate what was proceeding. We can always count on something happening on God's part, as it did when the two men appeared suddenly.
Rem. Perhaps it happened so that we would have this record.
J.T. Yes, the scene was prepared by God; there was state in it, as we know, but that was not the only thing, God was in it besides.
J.W.D. "And rising up the same hour", is that a feature of good assembly state?
J.T. It is a question of sacrifice now. The Lord has worked to one end and now the sacrifice is up to them, involving a long journey. Your staying at home from the meeting because it is raining would be just the opposite of this; sacrifice enters too into assembly giving.
Rem. Giving is more than just saving, it involves the thought of sacrifice.
J.T. These are spiritual matters; they refer to what is from Him because the point here is the house-father, suggesting affections in a certain capacity, not in the assembly but leading up to it.
C.H.H. Is there anything like that in the passing of the bread now?
{426}
J.T. Yes, because the thought of the organism comes into the Lord's supper, "we, being many, are one loaf, one body". I think the passing of the loaf has more in it than the mere physical act; we pass it in the light of the fact that we are an organism spiritually.
J.D. Is there a movement in the passage from lordship to headship? If I go to your house to have a meal with you it would be out of place for me to give thanks, yet here the Lord breaks the bread and takes the place of house-father. Is the idea that we are to be prepared for headship?
J.T. Quite so. He is to have the pre-eminence because He is anointed *above* His companions, and so He is the One to give thanks here.
J.W.D. And thus as passing the loaf and cup is it that there flows into our hearts the general collective element of spirituality and sacrifice?
J.T. That is it; we gather it up here because this is primary experience, but it is leading to one point, the assembly itself.
J.W.D. Are we to expect that?
J.T. I am suggesting it now; I do not know whether I have ever said or thought it before but I see here that that is what happened.
R.R.T. When it says that they recognised Him that was not merely recognising a physical form but recognising the Lord in the position He took in the house.
J.T. Just so, it was an act of God, and we may expect that. The apostle says, "In him we live and move and exist" (@Acts 17: 28), and how much more at such a critical point as this in the recognition of Christ in the assembly. What the assembly is doing is affected by His impulse, and that is as we are near to one another.
L.E.S. It is a question of what God can do at any given moment.
{427}
J.T. So that in coming to the Lord's supper we leave our houses and proceed to the room and sit down. Well now, what are we doing? *We* are going to do something, not only the Lord or the Spirit; merely nominally breaking bread will not do, there must be the divine touch.
J.D. @Hebrews 11: 3 says, "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear".
J.T. Well, there is a reminder that everything is from God. And so the assembly can look for this because the assembly is the most precious thing in the whole universe outside of divine Persons; its development and growth are of great interest to heaven, and heaven is ready to help.
A.D. "And how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread"; at that point in the morning meeting when the Lord comes in we are to move under His influence.
J.T. Something happens -- the opening of their eyes! That is a divine action not an angelic one, so the brethren are under divine action at that time or the assembly would not function.
R.R.T. In applying this in the assembly now how would we look at the disappearing of the Lord? We do not look for His disappearance today.
J.T. This is an imperfect setting; the Lord has gone as far as He can and then He disappears. But what happens to them? They go back to Jerusalem.
C.H.H. Would it apply in the breaking of bread as the Lord would say, "Rise up, let us go hence"?
J.T. That is John's line and there you are dealing with a higher matter beginning with @John 13 and running through to the end of chapter 17.
C.H.H. Would this lead up to it?
J.T. It is concurrent but John is more copious. He has the last days in mind and presents a remarkable
{428}
opening up of things which the other gospels do not touch.
J.W.D. While we have Christ Himself before us we have the sense in our minds of the power of God, and would you refer to God as such at that time?
J.T. Well, God has moved; He gives bodies as it pleaseth Him and that is a very wide thought, but we have to be careful what we bring into the assembly because the assembly functions in limitations of a most remarkable kind. It is in creature limitations as it is presented in Ephesians, and in Corinthians too; we have to become accustomed to the wealth resident in the assembly and to see to it in a priestly way that we do not go beyond those limitations.
J.D. The climax of the Lord's service here is really when they recognise Him.
J.T. That is the point so far; we are not really in the assembly yet but the Lord has graciously come out to show us how things are to be done in order to obtain response in a spiritual way. When we come to the assembly He does not vanish away but we move with Him, as John shows us, to the Father. John says much about the Father and the Lord speaking to the Father; we have to keep before us that he has more to say on this point than any of the others.
J.D. We have the response here to the Lord's ministry as He talked with them on the way; they understood now that they had to judge their course and go back to the assembly.
J.T. We have another point here in that there is no cup, only the bread; the Lord blesses it, breaks it and gives it to them. It is leading up to the full, final thing which is in Ephesians.
J.D. Why is the cup not brought in here?
J.T. The whole matter is just a touch of private instruction to help them and we must not put more
{429}
into it than is here; we must wait for Ephesians to get fulness and measurements.
Rem. The Lord spoke to them on the way to Emmaus of Moses and the prophets but later on when He spoke to the company to which they had returned He included the psalms.
{430}
THE LORD'S COMING TO HIS OWN AS SEEN IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (3)
@Luke 24: 33 - 53; @Acts 1: 1 - 5
J.T. It seems as if we should continue to look at Luke as bearing on our subject, that is, the Lord coming to His own as presented in the four gospels and in the Acts. His coming to them after He arose and before His ascension happened in a corporeal sense; He actually came to them, as Luke says in the Acts, "To whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs" (@Acts 1: 3); so that many infallible proofs marked all the activities of the Lord in the forty days. Luke is singular in that in his gospel he makes no allusion to the forty days, but he does so in the Acts; the other gospels say nothing as to the actual time involved before His ascension after He arose though they all indicate that some time elapsed. Matthew does not mention the ascension at all, so that we have to keep in mind that according to Matthew the Lord is here in some sense with us, as He says, "all the days". John does not formally state that He ascended; however, he mentions, without specifying time or circumstances, that the Lord said, "I ascend". Mark and Luke are definitely specific, Luke saying that He was carried up into heaven and Mark that He was taken up.
It is thought that we should see the meaning of Luke's allusion to time in the first day after He arose and before His ascension because it is as if the Spirit would suggest that there was haste in reaching heaven, that actual dispensational operations could not begin until He reached that position, and that everything should issue from heaven so that there should be no delay in reaching that point. Hence this chapter leaves us with the impression that the Lord was very active on the first day, and that He finished and went
{431}
up to heaven to carry on the mediatorial work. All this must have some bearing on assembly service in relation to the Lord's supper, intimating that we should proceed immediately to break bread on the first day of the week, as is stated by Luke in @Acts 20: 7, "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread". That is what we come together for, and what is now before us links with what we had on the past afternoon, the actual breaking of the bread at Emmaus. It was not the Lord's supper because there is no cup mentioned; it was therefore a household matter so far, only preparatory to the assembly position. So that we leave our houses ready for the great occasion in the assembly when the Supper is to be celebrated, for it belongs to the assembly; the Lord's supper cannot be apart from the assembly.
C.H.H. What is the thought in Acts where it speaks of breaking bread household-wise?
J.T. I think that it would be that it was already detached from the idea of the temple. The temple was still owned in Jerusalem as the public centre of divine service, but the Lord's supper was not to come into that setting; it belongs to the christian position and I believe the things that happened at that time would indicate that. It took the character of a household matter at first; they broke bread from house to house, but it was just the house in contrast to a religious building; I think that is how the matter stands. It was a transitional period, showing the compassions of God as lingering over the Jews. The Lord went up from Bethany, which is the remnant position, and the disciples are immediately linked with the temple in the gospel, but in Acts it is not mentioned.
J.W.D. Regarding reaching heaven quickly in Luke, at the breaking of bread there is power for it because in christianity there is power resident in the
{432}
system in view of divine operations commencing without delay.
J.T. You mean that this chapter indicates that the system is already there in that the saints are dwelling together? The two coming from Emmaus were in keeping with the spirit of the new system because they ignored the temple but found the eleven and those with them gathered together. It is a new departure that took place fully at Pentecost as the Spirit came down.
L.E.S. Would @Leviticus 23 help as to the wave-loaves referred to as brought out of their dwellings?
J.T. That helps. It was a question of what there was in the house of the offerer and the house at Emmaus was not far from that idea. It was at least regarded by the Lord as suitable to bring in the thought of the breaking of the bread and thus to show Himself to them; one of them evidently owned that house although he did not stay there. In the Acts you have the word, "And every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house"; it is literally 'house' without the article as showing that it was characteristic, that it was not in the temple. They were still carrying on in the temple but breaking bread in the house.
R.R.T. Do you think that the breaking of bread in @Acts 2 included the cup?
J.T. I think so. There was already a formula for the Lord's supper as recorded by Luke, Mark and Matthew, because in truth the Lord's supper has a dual character; it is a double testimony from Him to us and we could hardly have the full thought without the cup.
J.D. The breaking of bread in Acts before the conversion of Paul was in connection with a transitional position of the remnant; it is taken up in a new way as the Pauline side is developed.
{433}
J.T. That is good. Paul intimates that the breaking of bread should be in assembly, "when ye come together in assembly", @1 Corinthians 11: 18. He is speaking of their not coming together properly but still it was the *place* for the Lord's supper. In subsequent history the Lord's supper was beclouded for a time, indeed until the Reformation; Rome had limitations on the cup; they still do not give both emblems to the laity. Then opposite thoughts were introduced and the laity were allowed to take the cup, but the reformers failed in the truth of it. So that the truth of the Lord's supper has really been lost to the public assembly in its true sense until the later days of the revival. The reformers did not see the idea of it, Calvin had the right thought, and Zwingli too, but I do not know as to Luther. In any event it was allowed to go on as it was until God moved with Mr. Darby, and so we have the Supper as it is understood today. As you say, it was a transitional period from @Acts 2 until Paul took up the matter, then the whole position was strengthened. Paul received it from the Lord by a special word, and though we can recognise an identity with the synoptical gospels where certain limitations are suggested, yet this is a wonderful outgoing of the thought, and so the cup is linked with the memorial.
C.H.H. So that in order to break bread the houses from which we come are to be governed by @1 Corinthians 11 as we come together in assembly.
Rem. The assembly seems to be the sole object that God is working to in His thoughts.
J.T. Clearly; the reference to the truth of the Lord's supper would bear that out. So the completion of the word of God is left to Paul, involving the Lord's supper as set out in 1 Corinthians.
J.W.D. While Paul completes the word of God would you not say that the household, as maintaining the passover, is maintained as divine territory in
{434}
relation to the Lord's supper? I was thinking that it is of the utmost importance in the household setting to be marked by spirituality preceding the Lord's supper.
J.T. Yes. How do you connect the passover with the house?
J.W.D. The passover was primarily a household matter although later linked up with the feasts.
J.T. Yes, the house is stressed in @Exodus 12 as the place where it should be held. As the blood of the passover lamb was on the lintel the house was saved, and Israel's children were to be told that the houses were delivered in this manner. The question is whether the truth is really reached until the coming of Paul, but another thing comes out in that regard, that the passover in Corinthians is considered in the order of the epistle before the Lord's supper. The Lord's supper is really detached from it in a sense because the passover is in chapter 5 and the Lord's supper in chapter 11. So there is a slight clarification of the position from the old system in relation to the passover in that its relation to the Lord's supper is purely moral, whereas the actual inauguration of it by the Lord Himself was an outflow of the passover. The Lord came together with the disciples to eat the passover but while eating it the Supper was instituted; 1 Corinthians does not carry forward that thought.
J.W.D. The Lord's supper is then definitely apart from the passover.
J.T. The passover has its place but only in a typical sense.
Rem. The Lord's supper belongs to the assembly exclusively.
J.T. That is the setting as Paul brings it out; he takes it as set up in the synoptic gospels but makes additions as to what he received from the Lord in heaven, one feature being that the cup is part of the memorial. Formerly the loaf was a memorial just
{435}
by itself, although it is never viewed separately after @Luke 24, so we must always connect the two elements when referring to the Lord's supper.
J.D. The reference to the passover in chapter 5 is connected with a case of discipline. We need to come to the Lord's supper as having dealt with moral things in passover conditions.
J.T. That is good, "Let us celebrate the feast", the apostle says. There is the abstract idea in chapter 5, "according as ye are unleavened", and unless we have the abstract idea we can hardly get on, "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (verses 7, 8). Those are two concrete ideas and you can see how they materialise. Now the bread and the cup in the Lord's supper are material; we must never fail to make them material, so that we start with the bread and the cup.
J.D. The way the apostle brings in, "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" would touch their affections and lead them to deal with the wicked person among them.
J.T. The very feeling that what was going on amongst them caused Christ suffering would touch their affections.
Ques. Is the passover more individual and the Lord's supper in assembly?
J.T. The passover in the New Testament is purely antitypical and is carried forward to the point where the bread is called "unleavened bread of sincerity and truth", @1 Corinthians 5: 8. Those are christian qualities.
Rem. In order to partake of the Lord's supper I must maintain this feast.
J.T. Sincerity and truth should be maintained with us every day in our walk; if they are not with us how can we rightly take up the emblems of the Lord's supper?
{436}
L.E.S. What do you say about the passover being distinct from the Supper in @Luke 22?
J.T. Well, the Lord said there that He would drink no more of the fruit of the vine, meaning that that would be the last passover He would partake of; the scene is clearly the actual passover feast, but that is no longer a matter for the christian although it was allowed to continue in grace and mercy. But it gradually disappeared, the Spirit of God forcing out the idea of it; light forces out judaism.
Rem. In @Luke 22 it says, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer".
J.T. Yes, "this" would refer to that last one, because He Himself was to be the passover, but He instituted something which was to be carried forward into christianity, two so-called sacraments of a material nature. That is, material things are brought down to us in such a simple way that no one can build up a system from them, these being the only two sacraments found in the christian system. The Roman Catholics materialise them to such an extent that they claim they are the actual body and blood of the Lord Jesus, a terrible way of presenting the matter, showing that the devil has a hand in it. But the Lord would have us attentive to Scripture and having our minds governed by it.
J.W.D. The Spirit forces out the idea of connecting such thoughts with the bread and cup.
J.T. The Spirit having His place with us would expunge such ideas. His presence is a cardinal idea amongst us. Not only does Scripture expose these erroneous thoughts but it forces them out. The King James version originally included the apocrypha, for example, and the Roman Catholics canonised it at the Council of Trent, but the Spirit of God emphasised the truth and eventually forced out the error until you hardly get a christian worthy of the name today that recognises the canonising of the apocrypha. So the
{437}
Spirit of God having His place, if only with a few, will rebuke what is not of God; and how can we but call attention to these things? Why should they be ignored?
Ques. If the blood is still in the body, how could you have the thought of both?
J.T. Showing how false the whole thing is -- bringing in the body and blood of Jesus and His deity left out! How terrible it is! But how important it is that we maintain the Supper as given by Paul!
Ques. Is there any significance in the fact that in @1 Corinthians 5 Mr. Darby's translation puts the word 'bread' as if it could be left out?
J.T. Well, the meaning is clear enough, it is what is unleavened, "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (verse 8). The word 'bread' is added to make it intelligible, and I would take it that it is quite right there.
Rem. It is not the material thought that is in mind.
J.T. Quite so; "bread of sincerity and truth" is what is meant; you can see how it applies there.
Ques. Is that the loaf on the table at the Lord's supper?
J.T. It is a question of what you have in your heart and carry with you all the time.
A.B. In the mind of the Lord the occasion in @Luke 22 would be the last one at which the material side of the passover was kept; the material side is now being carried to the Supper.
J.T. That is the idea; so all these thoughts grow out of the consideration of this chapter and the use of only the loaf at Emmaus. As the brethren will note, in verse 35 there is a note to 'bread' which
{438}
says, 'Or "the loaf"; also verse 30', indicating that it was not cut or sliced bread such as is sometimes used in the Lord's supper and which the official element insists on. It is bread, as evidenced from all records, but it is the idea of the whole thing, not part of a loaf; "All the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ", @1 Corinthians 12: 12.
Ques. If the bread is cut, how can we break bread?
J.T. In the systems they cut the bread into small pieces, showing how the devil is active in the matter in some way and emphasising the great urgency with us to hold to the fact of the Spirit being here and to all that He has given for assembly service.
Ques. In verse 33 it says, "And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together". What is meant by "those with them"?
J.T. That would bear out what we were saying yesterday as to the composition of the assembly requiring sisters. We cannot limit the idea of the assembly to brothers only; the Spirit of God would bring before us that sisters are essential to the position.
What is to be in mind now is that the two from Emmaus "returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together". We cannot say how many there were; if we went by @Acts 1 we would say one hundred and twenty, which would probably be the number present when the Spirit came, but the idea of the public assembly is maintained here. We have the actual physical position and what the persons were saying.
Rem. So the Lord is the Lord in the house preparatory to being seen in the assembly.
J.T. That the Lord took the journey to Emmaus is the grace side, and that side is to be always in mind; we are to bear with one another. What He did at Emmaus was to overlook the condition of
{439}
those on the way from Jerusalem and He is saying to us by His action, You may criticise, but still a great deal has come from those two; what I had was not the Lord's supper but I fitted in with their side at the time; much was overlooked but the matter was successful because they went back to where the eleven were gathered together and where the breaking of bread was. So that I think that whereas in the earlier years of the revival much grace had to be shown to the brethren there is a great deal more light today as to assembly truth and the Lord's supper; much grace was shown, for example, as to who was recognised as in fellowship. As to actual facts of history many were breaking bread one hundred and ten or one hundred and fifteen years ago in this country and Ireland and Scotland -- even before Mr. Darby was used of God to bring to light fellowship in a very remarkable way.
C.H.H. Would it be right for two or three to break bread, if spiritual, apart from any other qualifications, such as having elders?
J.T. Well, in Montreal things were carried on for a long time by sisters alone and undoubtedly the Lord was with them in it, they simply sat there and if a brother came along they broke bread, I think that there is nothing the Lord will not do for us.
C.H.H. I quite agree with that. One sometimes hears that in a certain locality they have ceased to break bread because there are no elders and hence no assembly material. I would think that spiritual persons would be assembly material.
J.T. Of course they are. I would not hesitate about it if there was only one brother and several sisters, if they were spiritual, but if they were not it would be only a mere external thing and it would be a question of the wisdom of continuing because the Spirit is necessary.
J.W.D. Is not a spiritual brother an elder?
{440}
J.T. An elder is designated according to Scripture as having certain characteristics. If those features are there, such as care for the saints and the assembly, there would be eldership of course.
R.R.T. Would verse 33 be instructive, "And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together"? Would not sisters support things as "those with them"?
J.T. By all means! I know of a meeting where there were several sisters and one in particular was a godly woman and they actually disciplined the only brother there. God was in that.
R.R.T. We are looking at this from a moral point of view, not as having the Lord physically there but with them in spirit.
J.T. It stresses the importance of spirituality as heaven recognises it, which implies that a person is to be trusted.
J.W.D. @Matthew 18 speaks of two of the assembly; they might be sisters.
J.T. Quite so.
A.B. Is there something in the fact that in @Luke 22 the house and room are stressed in relation to the Supper but in chapter 24 only the city is mentioned, no house or room but the persons, "they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together"?
J.T. I am glad you call attention to that, because it is the idea of "where the disciples were". We were having yesterday as to the mountain in Galilee, that they were there when the Lord arrived and He recognised the place because they were there; He came to *them*, and spoke to *them*. The word 'church' is used to support the conception of human organisations whereas it is not scriptural; 'assembly' is the word, and it does not refer to a building of stone and mortar but to persons. The word 'church' is never used for the saints viewed collectively, the word is 'assembly', referring to persons called out.
{441}
A.B. "We being assembled to break bread", @Acts 20: 7.
J.T. Just so, that was at Troas in the upper room but viewed as 'we', in the first person.
Rem. @Romans 16 speaks as to Prisca and Aquila of "the assembly at their house".
J.T. It was not a building of stone and mortar there.
Rem. As you were saying as to Montreal, the sisters were holding the position and holding the apostles doctrine and if one brother went there conditions were right according to God.
J.T. The conditions were right so that the brother would be at home there.
Ques. Is it a question of the priestly side rather than eldership or gifts?
J.T. Eldership is always based on the qualifications that the Spirit of God finds in a brother. Paul and Silas chose them elders, but that official side is not continued. It is questionable if offices are chosen in relation to what is there; the basic idea is the assembly. Where the breaking of bread is not continued there are no such persons as elders; for the elder, the person who takes care of the assembly, is there because the assembly is there; he is not there first, the assembly is first.
L.E.S. The assembly is referred to in Corinthians but the elders are not referred to until Philippians.
J.T. There is not a word about them in Corinthians, the point there is the assembly of God in Corinth.
L.E.S. It would help perhaps to see the bearing of @Deuteronomy 21 as to the nearest city and the relation of the persons in that respect.
J.T. Yes, it bears on where the saints are and that is basic in view of what we have before us now. These men in the early part of the Acts are those under the Lord's influence and it is a question of the
{442}
persons not the building. In the upper room the Lord's supper was celebrated and they were there in @Acts 1 as being in assembly, not setting aside a room in the temple for the purpose because it was not now recognised as the gathering place.
C.H.H. In @Acts 20 Troas is mentioned, not the building but the city.
J.T. Clearly the city or place is in mind, "every place" as mentioned in @1 Corinthians 1: 2. The words 'city' and 'place' refer to what God would witness to in the midst of this world; the assembly is the candlestick, the light for others.
C.H.H. Then it is quite right to have the breaking of bread in a place that is not necessarily a city?
J.T. It is a question of where the saints are; the Lord comes where they are. Sometimes we have the question of too many in one place and not enough in another place; well, the Lord recognises the brethren wisely extending their place to make room for what is needed, because it is the importance of the saints that is to be kept in mind and where they are; the Lord says, I will be there.
J.D. "And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together". Would there be a moral touch in "gathered together"?
J.T. That thought is carried into @Acts 2: 1, "And when the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, they were all together in one place". And then in the end of that chapter they were all together, they were in relation to one another which is just what 'together' means. Already together in mind they would now be together in body.
J.D. Listen to what they are saying as assembled: "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon".
J.T. They were speaking of the resurrection of Christ and that He had appeared to Simon. The two
{443}
evidences there of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus were that He was exercising grace.
Rem. What they are saying as to the Lord here might have some bearing on us in relation to conversing about the latest ministry.
J.T. The latest news! So there is much profit in assembly words as here, sympathetic words, "The Lord is indeed risen". What a bit of news that was! -- the news that He was exercising grace as risen, not judgment. He Himself had appeared to Simon, His activities were to go after the erring ones and bring them back. We are not told here what He was doing with Simon, yet how much is said amongst us about cases of discipline; much more than about the resurrection! They become table talk, but the real thought is how to get Peter back. The present time is a reign of grace and how are we going to get the erring ones back? The Lord says, I will show you, I went to Emmaus after two; they went out wrong but they came back right.
Rem. The death of the Lord had made possible such a reign of grace; grace and resurrection go together here.
J.T. What we have here is not exactly the basis for the gospel but for recovery amongst the brethren. Persons are going back, and going back without a single grudge; the grudges and animosity are forced out.
R.R.T. The word 'constrain' is not here. The Lord answers the conditions and comes into their midst.
J.T. "And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst". This is not the word 'came' but 'stood', whereas John says He came, referring to the journey itself. The Spirit of God is not calling attention to that here so it says He stood there; there were things being said and He was there and now showed Himself. John presents the
{444}
abstract side but Luke is saying to us, What have you there that I can come to? Are you worthy of my presence? Could I be amongst you happily?
J.D. His appearance was in connection with what the two said as to "how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread".
J.T. Those two were in a better state than the others. The others were talking of his appearing to Simon and would leave the matter there but the Lord comes to them on the grace side and says, "Peace be unto you. But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit". What kind of a state is that? They were not able to analyse current conditions because they were afraid and confused and talking of His being a spirit. They were not able to look things in the face, did not know the Lord but thought of a spirit, so that it was necessary for Him to show them His hands and His feet.
L.E.S. What would the Lord's standing involve? Is it the idea of an adjusting service being needed, whereas the idea of His coming implies higher spiritual ministry?
J.T. His standing presently will be in dealing with what is evil, but still as standing here there would also be an indication of something to be dealt with.
Rem. We read in @Genesis 18 of the Lord standing by Abraham's tent door; is His standing in relation to His taking His place amongst us?
J.T. There is something in that. The word, 'stood' there means that He took up a position and taking up a stationary position would indicate that there was something in mind. So here, "he himself stood in their midst", and note that it is not *the* midst but *their* midst, that is amid the persons.
J.W.D. Do we not bring the Lord with us as coming to the Lord's day morning meeting?
J.T. There is something in that. It would be in the same sense that He was with the two as He
{445}
opened up the Scriptures to them, and you can imagine that He would be with them in spirit as they returned to Jerusalem. As they gathered together in Acts that was the point in their minds and as we do so today in some sense the Lord is there, but as the same time we must not forget that John says that He came. The idea of coming is what is especially in mind in John, not only standing in their midst.
Rem. Would the word 'stood' indicate a spiritual location?
J.T. Well, yes, in the way of grace, carrying forward the priestly thought. The Lord would be standing there in grace, ready to do any service.
J.D. "And behold, *I* am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", (@Matthew 28: 20); would you carry that thought here?
J.T. Well, Matthew has in mind His continuity with the persons.
C.H.H. John uses the word 'manifest', possibly the Lord may be with us and be awaiting an opportunity to manifest Himself.
J.T. Yes, and that depends upon conditions; it would be similar to what has been suggested in the two and how they came back. The Lord covered that seven-mile distance too; He was divine and risen from the dead and going heavenward; there were no limitations on Him at all; He did not have to go back from Emmaus as an ordinary person would, but still there is the idea of distance and He covers that distance. The woman in @Luke 7 anointed His feet as if she had some appreciation of the fact that they carried Him, but here the suggestion is that He is in their midst and shows Himself. These two are properly amongst them and the others are not just right, but if there are two at all alive in the meeting the Lord says, I can go on in part.
{446}
A.B. It says, "He himself stood in their midst" -- but John says, "Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst". John is contemplating part with Him.
J.T. It is *the* midst in @John 20. He sent His message ahead, so to speak, and I suppose the ground is covered as the message is communicated, and He is there. So @1 Corinthians 1: 1 - 9 contemplates the abstract position, involving what was effected in them from the divine side, but immediately in verse 10 we have the question of their state.
J.W.D. Are we entitled to take up 1 Corinthians morally as connecting with what we get here in Luke?
J.T. Paul immediately proceeds to deal with their state and chapter 5: 11 states the abstract idea of the evil. John deals on the line of the abstract, speaking of "the midst", a fixed position, whereas here it is "their midst", referring to the persons there. These are important facts; the abstract idea is the pattern to deal with the concrete idea.
J.D. There are several abstract thoughts in regard of the assembly at Corinth such as "ye are the temple of God".
J.T. So we have to take John and Luke together to get the full position. Here in Luke it is a concrete state of things because Luke is really dealing with the persons that are there including these two and Peter and the others. We know that Peter was not right; we have to go to John to find him thoroughly restored, and if we go to Mark he would tell us that they were all in a very bad state; and yet the Lord says, There is some way in which I can be there and deal with the matter.
L.E.S. Did the two give the Lord moral ground for the adjustment in relation to the whole?
J.T. The Lord had in mind the whole company and these two would undoubtedly be useful to Him.
{447}
L.E.S. Did the house of Chloe give moral ground to the apostle in Corinth?
J.T. As we consider the thought of moral ground we look around in the auditorium where we are now and our feelings would be, Is the Spirit of God really exposing the contents of my heart?
Rem. The distance from Jerusalem to Emmaus is the same as from Emmaus to Jerusalem.
J.T. That would be so, but the outgoing journey is so hard!
R.R.T. Is the concrete thought seen in the Lord's words, "Handle me and see"?
J.T. That is just it. The Lord is dealing with the physical side of the matter and He asks them, "Have ye anything here to eat?". And they had something, showing that there was some substance there, something that the Lord could appeal to.
Rem. The two that came back were in the good of recovery in some measure; it is a great thing to find ourselves amongst His own.
J.T. And the Lord is looking with complacency on them.
J.W.D. At the Lord's supper you would take spiritual account of what He can approve.
J.T. So you think of the brethren, I know a dear brother who loves to sit down before the morning meeting and see the brethren come in. I think it is right because it is a question of the persons, not of the Lord yet but of the persons; He comes to the persons, and He says to them, "Have ye anything here to eat?". They had broiled fish and honeycomb which they gave Him, indicating that there was something the Lord could approve of; these are practical matters.
Rem. Paul says in @1 Corinthians 15: 5 "that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve". Luke speaks of two and eleven but Paul of twelve.
{448}
J.T. Paul has a much wider thought, as you would expect, and the prophetic word starts the account in the previous chapter. Then he separates the account of these appearings by the word 'then'; he first says that He appeared to Cephas; that agrees with what we have here (the Aramaic word means the same as Peter), suggesting the real man, the church man, having some value; he is valued particularly as an assembly man. The second appearing is to the twelve, meaning that He is recognising the administrative side, and then thirdly, "he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once", that is the order of the proceeding. That third appearing was a big matter! The Lord came to that number of brethren, not to only two or three: "Then he appeared to James". Who was he? He was a care meeting man, a man who dealt with things; "then to all the apostles", it does not say twelve but all of them, meaning that the idea of apostleship is stressed, persons representative of the Lord; this account takes care of every one of them, and finally He appears to Paul himself, "Last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also". He refers to himself as one born out of due time as if to show the grace that brought him in -- an afterthought! The whole setting is of great value to heaven, bringing out what heaven views as the composition of the assembly.
J.D. Was Peter an assembly man in @John 1? It says of Andrew, "He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ). And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone)".
J.W.D. As the Lord looked at Peter He would have the assembly in mind.
J.T. Peter is hampered with human thoughts which would have to be adjusted in grace but
{449}
abstractly he is already Cephas. The Lord calls him Peter in Matthew which would be the Greek word, whilst the Aramaic is used in John, but they both mean the same; looking on Peter in that way He immediately sees something that can be trusted.
Ques. The Lord leads them out to Bethany; He measures the distance. We have been speaking of moral conditions and the Lord bringing Himself in. Is the distance measured in our spirits?
J.T. Leading them to Bethany is a measured matter. Bethany suggesting a setting on the earth; we are led by the Lord, and He ever leads us on.
{450}
THE LORD'S COMING TO HIS OWN AS SEEN IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (4)
@Mark 16: 1 - 20
J.T. The last chapter of Luke seems to detain us particularly, as bearing on our subject in a special way. The Lord's appearing in the midst of the gathered ones as they were saying certain things, especially as to the breaking of bread, is significant and points to the importance of what engages us and what we say to one another in such circumstances. There is a plain intimation that the state of the brethren as gathered was not right but needed adjustment, first as to their minds and then as to their understandings, all witnessing to unbalanced conditions amongst them. It is important to note the place the Scriptures have in this gospel of Luke, both as to the interpretation of them in the early part of this chapter and then the later treatment of them in verse 44, "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled. Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures, and said to them, Thus it is written". Then attention was called yesterday to the measurements coming into this gospel, Emmaus being "sixty stadia from Jerusalem" as we are told earlier, and then we have Bethany mentioned, of which the distance from Jerusalem is supplied by John, "Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia off" (@John 11: 18); Luke also in alluding to the mount of Olives, not here but in Acts, tells us how far that was from Jerusalem. It was a sabbath-day's journey, meaning, I think, that we apprehend from spiritual experience what a sabbath-day's journey is. It seems as if these facts mentioned in @Luke 24 should receive some further consideration before we proceed to Mark.
{451}
We have noted that there is haste in Luke to get on to what is involved in the great divine system of administration. The right hand of God is not exactly mentioned here; Mark says, "The Lord ... was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God", but here it is that He "was carried up into heaven", as if the great matters implied in the gospel require this in the Lord's service -- His ascension. It is essential to the whole position and is vicarious because the Lord is viewed in a vicarious way right through, even at the right hand of God. It is a mediatorial position too, even in heaven, so that He goes up with uplifted hands in blessing. The point would be that it was urgent that the position in heaven should be occupied by our great Priest, the great Administrator of the new system.
C.H.H. The distance to Bethany is implied in the phrase "as far as".
J.T. Yes, showing that it is a limited position, and there is something beyond it; it may be extended, and indeed will be. I think it is a limitation of grace here with reference to the Jews, indicating that the Jewish position is not given up immediately but comes in for the benefit of the new administration of grace. Ultimately the object of the administration is that the Spirit comes, as it is said here, "And *ye* are witnesses of these things. And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high", and so they began preaching there in Jerusalem.
L.E.S. The position at Jerusalem was consequent upon the position in heaven above.
J.T. I think that is the way the matter stands. Jerusalem still holds its place though it is not called the city of the great King, but "the city", I think it is known in the prophetic mind on the line of grace that the benefit should immediately begin
{452}
there; instead of judgment grace begins. The position at Bethany consequently is "as far as"; they tarried there, as it were, for a purpose.
J.W.D. The vicarious work of Christ went beyond resurrection.
J.T. John tells us that He sanctified Himself that we might be sanctified, and I think it is in the mind of Luke because the Spirit begins to speak in chapter 9 of His going to heaven, and that it would be via Jerusalem -- going out *that* way. And there He is representing us, through the whole dispensation in a peculiar way, I think; our present and ultimate blessing in divine counsels is governed accordingly. Paul went up 'as far as'; he represents the dispensation and he went up as far as the third heaven and into paradise.
J.W.D. We used to sing 'Our title to glory we read in Thy blood'.
J.T. Well, I think it is going too far to say that. The blood of course is basic and foundational and He went in in the power of His own blood; that bears out what we are saying, but our going to heaven is a question of divine counsels, that is, our being raised up together to sit down together in the heavenlies.
J.D. How would you regard the scripture in Hebrews in relation to 'Our title to glory we read in Thy blood'? "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings".
J.T. Well, I suppose it is true that He had to go that way; it refers to Himself, *He* was perfected through sufferings. It has been said that "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer" does not refer to the question of atonement, but to Himself as suffering. And then after His rising Acts says, "after he had suffered",
{453}
as if the idea of the Sufferer goes the whole way. It would be involved in the title "Lamb" in Revelation, and His wife must be brought into agreement with Him in that character so that Paul says, "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly" (@Colossians 1: 24), as if she needed them to be fitted to be the bride of the Sufferer.
J.D. The ground of saints being brought to glory is the counsel of God as seen in @Ephesians 1: 3 - 6, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved".
J.T. When we come to the eternal state we must bring in the counsels of love. @Ephesians 3 says, "Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named", that is, the Father names every family, but Ephesians is dealing with one in particular and that is the assembly. And we are told in relation to that, "because of his great love wherewith he loved us ... has quickened us with Christ", and then, "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", @Ephesians 2: 4 - 6. There it is, we are raised up with one another together, "that he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus". That is all a matter of the requirements or purposes of God and it refers to a certain family, and it is done not simply because they are purchased with blood because the
{454}
blood has the same value in the redemption of the Jews, it is the precious blood of Christ as a Lamb without blemish. You could not say any more, when you speak of its value it is that, and it has the same value in regard of all things for redemption. But as to allocation it is a question of purpose; allocation involves that the ground is cleared so that God can assign the persons in His counsels to their positions. Paul is a representative man in regard of his sufferings, sufferings in which the church needed to be filled out, and they are in regard to the position of elevation. The fact that the elevation is described by the phrase "as far as" would suggest that there are elevations leading into the uncreated conditions. What is said of Christ in @Hebrews 4: 14 is: "Who has passed through the heavens"; in Ephesians it is that He might fill all things, but in Hebrews that He might be a Priest worthy of this dispensation He has gone beyond all heavens and is a Priest for ever. Still, I think we might work out these things as we are encouraged to do so, comparing spiritual things with spiritual and having the Holy Spirit to lead us into an understanding of all. That is what we are to expect, an understanding of things, not inscrutable things but things that are to be understood by the creature.
J.D. Is that why redemption is brought into @Ephesians 1?
J.T. The earlier verses are based on divine counsel, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ", and then further on we get the thought of being taken into favour in the Beloved, and then the reference to redemption.
L.E.S. Would that not help us in service God-ward, in relation to the Father's realm? The Father's realm involves the thought of counsel, not exactly the value of the blood.
{455}
J.T. It is clear enough from Ephesians, because the Spirit of God begins with a high altitude, that of the heavenlies, and then redemption is treated on a lower level in the verse quoted. It is a matter of measurement or limitations for we do not enter into the territory of Deity; the inscrutable territory of Deity is beyond us and therefore we have the idea of measurement. The apostle enlarges upon it; he mentions the families named of the Father and then goes on, "In order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge", @Ephesians 3: 18, 19. These are great measurements, but still they are measurements, that is, they are not infinite but finite. Paul says, "as far as", suggesting creature limitations; infinitude belongs to Deity.
Rem. Is the service of God in the assembly limited to us in that way?
J.T. All this helps the service. You begin on the platform of redemption; the Lord's supper is on that platform; the blood is there, and the new covenant, and it belongs there because it has its own section of the service; and then room is made for what might be called the marital realm, that section of the service in which Christ and the assembly have their place; and then there is the ascension to sons, many sons brought to glory; that is the highest level we can have for it is in relation to the Son of God, companionship with Christ on that level.
C.H.H. In the section quoted breadth, length, depth and height refer to finitude, but the phrase "surpasses knowledge" refers to infinitude.
J.T. We are in it as though in the ocean, we are in it even if we are in only six feet of it, whereas it might be miles deep. In a sense we know a little of it, but the heights of it belong to Deity, so the Lord has gone beyond all the heavens. We can only speak
{456}
in terms of time and place but there is such a thing as what is uncreated and we cannot tell what that is. There is something there that belongs to Deity for God is "dwelling in unapproachable light", @1 Timothy 6: 16.
J.D. That thought would keep us well within bounds, would you say? -- "The King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship; who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom be honour and eternal might. Amen".
J.T. Well, that checks us. We are in the thing in a way because there is the thought, "that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God" (@Ephesians 3: 19), but we must understand the word 'fulness' there because that word is also used in Colossians, "for in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell" (@Colossians 1: 19), and we cannot say we have part in that; I understand it alludes to God in His shining out. So what we have read from Timothy checks us as to Deity by Itself abstractly.
C.H.H. What glory is referred to in @Luke 24: 26, "Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?"
J.T. Well, that brings up a very wide range of things; we are coming to the glories of @John 17. Let us look at verse 4, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it; and now glorify *me*, *thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". There you get something that we can never touch, as far as I see; it is properly the glory of Deity that He had along with the Father before the world was, before creation, (I am only touching all this now to keep the matter within bounds.) Then the prophetic glory that is spoken of in Luke would be glory in relation to the earth, "Ought not the Christ to have suffered
{457}
these things and to enter into his glory?". You might say that His glory is His glory and you cannot alter that, but really it is a contextual matter of prophecy and one which the Old Testament opens up. @John 17 is more than that, where the Lord speaks to His Father touching His glory, the glory of Deity, before the world and before there was any need for prophecy. Then @John 17: 22 says, "And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them". That is the glory of sonship; it is the highest thought for us and would enter into what has been quoted from @Hebrews 2: 10, "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings"; that is the glory that Christ Himself had which He shares with us. And then @John 17: 24 says, "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". He does not say we *share* that but we behold it. That brings out the great thought of lower glories and higher glories and I would say that the glory of @Luke 24 is a prophetic glory, covering glories contemplated in prophecy in regard of the earth, every one of them glorious of course, and each having its own fulness, some capable of being shared by the creature and others not.
Rem. The two going to Emmaus do not refer to Him as Christ at all, the Lord Himself calls their attention to that name.
J.T. He is speaking to two Jews who had in mind the Messiah and the earthly position. In @Psalm 24 we have Him called the King of glory; that is a fine expression and it is in relation to Christ as entering into Jerusalem, the Jews opening the door for Him and others getting in too, "Lift up
{458}
your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in", @Psalm 24: 7. We may call on the gates of heaven to be lifted up at the Messiah's glory as He enters in, others entering too, for "Jehovah of hosts, he is the King of glory".
L.E.S. The Lord says that Abraham rejoiced to see His day, so Israel speaks of His glory.
J.T. This great subject covers an immense range for us, and we understand as being able to touch these things by the Spirit.
A.B. The Lord has this in mind with the seventy in @Luke 10 when they rejoice that the spirits are subjected to them; He leads them to rejoice that their names are written in heaven and then He goes on to speak of the inscrutability of the Son.
J.T. Just so; @Matthew 11 touches the same point, but Luke takes us higher. And thus @Luke 24 leaves us with the impression that the Lord did all these things in one day and then went up to heaven, that position being needed for the full efficacy of His mediatorial service.
J.W.D. The mediatorial service then includes what goes on in heaven.
J.T. Well, let us turn to @Hebrews 9: 23: "It was necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these. For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us, nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own; since he had then been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for the putting away of sin by his sacrifice". So that
{459}
He has gone up there, and whatever part of the heavens needs redemption (I use that word 'part' rightly) He has it for it. And then we have the third heaven to which Paul went, called paradise; will redemption be needed there? We cannot be sure. It is only by careful examination that we can determine to what extent and where redemption is needed, so that we are in the presence of the most wonderful things.
But we are dealing now with the Lord coming to us, not for us but to us, illustrated in the experience of the forty days between His resurrection and ascension, and we have to see how much there is still to go into in the last chapter of Luke. We have already touched on the Lord standing amongst them. He stood in their midst and took account of what was there, involving the adjustment of their minds and understandings and the opening up of the scriptures to cover the position in view of preaching, though not exactly emphasising the preachers because Mark has them in mind. The position mentioned here is witnessing, not by preachers but by a group of witnesses. Preaching is Mark's side: "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation", but here we have the thing to be preached. The Lord outlines it, "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem". And then He goes on, "And *ye* are witnesses of these things. And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high". What is to be preached, and where from, and where they are to begin, and what they are as witnesses -- these are the things we are to carry in our minds as we go on to Mark.
{460}
Rem. Remarkable touch of grace -- the gospel begins at the city which crucified Him!
J.T. That is real grace! The touches of grace in Luke are very peculiar and this is one of them; leading them to Bethany is another. The Lord says, This is the place to stop for the time being, and He goes up from there and they go into the city as He had told them to do, showing that their minds saw behind the words, and our minds are to see behind the words too, to get them in an understanding way.
Ques. What is the meaning of the two places, Bethany and Jerusalem?
J.T. Bethany we have already touched on, and Emmaus, which was a place in the country. Mark says the two were going into the country, that is, going away from the position of the testimony; when people take holidays and go out into the country they are weakening the position of the testimony. And yet grace shows that the Lord is going with them; He finds constraining power in these two and the result is that they go back to where the eleven are gathered together. As we said this morning the distance was sixty stadia out, but the distance back was another matter; it was not nearly so far! As your steps are turned in the right direction you are likely to go more quickly, it is the shortest distance between the two points.
C.H.H. We have the expression in Scripture "another way", in connection with the return home of the wise men (@Matthew 2: 12).
J.T. And the spies in Joshua went back another way.
L.E.S. Does @1 Corinthians 13 shorten the distance in recovery?
J.T. You cannot arrive at @1 Corinthians 13 fully without the brethren; love is one.
R.R.T. Does the word 'return' indicate recovery?
J.T. It is conversion.
{461}
A.D. Is verse 47 of @Luke 24 the basis of the preaching? Paul says in @Acts 20, "testifying to both Jews and Greeks repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ" (verse 21).
J.T. Just so; that is in that wonderful chapter of love, @Acts 20.
J.W.D. Would you say our Lord's day evening meeting was preaching or witnessing?
J.T. A witness is a model. Without the thought of a model, of what value is the preaching? And how much of this do we have in our minds in our meeting rooms in preparing for the preaching? It is clear enough in the Philippian epistle that the state of the hearers affects us because it speaks of fellowship with the gospel. In truth we get very few hearers who require evangelistic service in the true sense, and that may raise a question of difficulty, but still it looks as if these meetings are to go on and the Lord is blessing them; there is encouragement in that. Small indeed though they be, with just a little strength, yet it *is* a little, and the children of the saints who have some light are brought into the truth of christianity, so there is a great purpose in them in that sense.
Rem. The disciples were to go into the whole earth; the gospel is to be preached worldwide.
J.T. As we shall see in Mark the bearing of it is, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation". That is a very wide thought and it is worked out there; it has to do with creation, not with preaching in a room which holds only a hundred or less. We have to see that the creation is there so that it is not simply a matter of preaching to a few persons. There may be a number of children in the room, even babes, but they are held there and, in truth, they belong to the creation.
Ques. In the light of what we are saying has the gospel to do with believers or unbelievers?
{462}
J.T. I would say both. What kind of a gospel would be preached to such a congregation as Peter had in the house of Cornelius? They say, We are all here to hear what God has given you to say. That shows the principle; they were mostly believers in some sense.
Rem. Paul before Agrippa says, "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest", @Acts 26: 27.
J.T. Well, to go back to the actual things we are speaking of, the point here is the preaching rather than the preachers, "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem", @Luke 24: 46. Now this is to be in our minds clearly on our Lord's day evenings, and the question is what is to be presented, what terms are to be used, and what kind of people are speaking it.
J.W.D. It is in the general setting that we fall down? We do not preach from Ephesians.
J.T. It is a question of what a levite will do.
J.W.D. Does not the idea "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name" involve the epistle to the Romans?
J.T. The idea at that time was that those things were in mind. Simeon had said earlier of the Lord, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel", @Luke 2: 32. First He is said to be a light for the revelation of the gentiles, to bring them to the light. They are brought into the light and we can see them; that is the idea; the curtain is drawn aside and we can see them. But what do we see? We have to consider who is before us, the persons whom we are to address. In @Acts 14 it is said that Paul and Barnabas worked together and spoke boldly and their speaking was so good that it
{463}
was heard by and affected a man who was lame from his birth, a type of the gentiles. The Jews had walked but the gentiles had never walked; they had never had the idea of walking before God. But Paul saw that that man had faith. He was not an ordinary man; he was seen to have faith although he did not say a word! There is no mention of what he said but Paul saw that he had faith to be healed and said, "Rise up straight upon thy feet: and he sprang up and walked".
C.H.H. Would that fit in with the thought that at Philippi Paul preached Christ whereas at Damascus he preached Jesus?
J.T. Quite so, very good.
J.W.D. Is not what Paul says in Thessalonica the general bearing of our Lord's day evening preaching, "And according to Paul's custom he went in among them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures, opening and laying down that the Christ must have suffered and risen up from among the dead, and that this is the Christ, Jesus whom *I* announce to you", @Acts 17: 2, 3? There is some sense in which the city is held responsible for the word that is preached in our meeting-rooms.
J.T. That is what we must see. He had journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia; what do we see in that? Part of this Asiatic race was left out and another part was evangelised by Paul, and what does he see? He comes to Thessalonica, part of the gentile world, where he opens up and lays down things for three sabbath days and a great company responds. That shows what was there. Then we are told what goes on at Athens, "I see you given up to demon worship; for, passing through and beholding your shrines, I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God". What a preaching went on from Mars hill that day! He says, "As also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his
{464}
offspring. Being therefore the offspring of God, we ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold or silver ...". It shows what was before him, and so with us now it is a question of what we find here in this town. It is a matter of what we see before us and of dealing with the condition as we find it.
J.D. What you are saying would be borne out by @Galatians 1: 15, "But when God, who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me". It was God's work moving in him as he says, "that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations".
J.T. Just so. And Paul says to those at Corinth of himself and two others, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him", @2 Corinthians 1: 19. That is what actually transpired in the year and six months Sunday night preachings in Corinth, you would say; they dealt with what was before them.
J.D. The great thing then is not exactly what you are going to preach on but the need of soul before you.
Ques. Would Paul's words in @Romans 16 take in more than the preaching, "Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, as to which silence has been kept in the times of the ages, but which has now been made manifest, and by prophetic scriptures, according to commandment of the eternal God, made known for obedience of faith to all the nations" (verses 25, 26)?
J.T. I would say that "my glad tidings" would take in the thought of the Son of God revealed in him. That is the point he would bring out, that Jesus is the Son of God; we ought to be established in the present truth and in our preaching to stress that.
{465}
Now to come to Mark and the way he records the facts relating to our subject, we may look first at the young man in the sepulchre but particularly at the bearing of the eleven in verse 14: "Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven, and reproached them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen". We have been speaking of others and what might be said to them to bring light and to be helpful to them, but now the word is to the servants. What kind of servants are they? This will, prove what they have in their minds; they are lying at table. Are we taken up with our tables instead of our preaching, or with what is on the table? I think it is wonderful that the appearing was as they lay at table, presumably at a meal; had they not had their fill?
Rem. What we witness to, in that way, is more than what we say.
J.T. Quite so. The point now is not what they are saying but what they are doing. They are lying at table and yet commissioned to go out into all the world; they are to be travellers. Paul and Barnabas went out from Antioch and travelled over great distances. The idea was to "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation", that is the way Mark presents it. That is to say, they are not to be afraid of travelling; travellers in this aspect are needed, both men and women. And therefore Mark tells us that the Lord found the eleven lying at table.
Rem. Would lying at table be out of keeping with the resurrection position? The resurrection position requires activity.
J.T. Yes. Here it is said, "Afterwards as they lay at table". Well, you might say, He joined them, but He did not join in with the eleven.
{466}
C.H.H. "Is it time for you that ye should dwell in your wainscoted houses, while this house lieth waste?" @Haggai 1: 4.
J.T. Quite so, it was a time of fasting.
R.R.T. Does the same thought come into Corinthians as applying to the saints coming together for the Lord's supper, "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking"?
J.T. You could bring it in because they were occupied with their stomachs: "whose god is the belly". It is important to note this point of lying at table at this critical time. Where was the Lord? They do not know and yet they are not concerned about it.
Rem. The Lord Himself as the great Servant in Mark shows us the way of urgency and haste.
J.T. Reference to the first chapter would indicate what you say. How quickly the Spirit of God takes us to the Son of God! We talk about service, how quickly it is reached! It comes to light as early as verse 9. How quickly things are done throughout this gospel; it might seem like only one day, all that is necessary being said; we do not hear about the interim. Luke's word is 'suddenly'; Mark's is 'straightway'; things are done in that manner, "Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do with thy might", @Ecclesiastes 9: 10. And so Mark begins, "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God". How quickly he gets to that great fact! Luke has to take some chapters to get to this point, giving considerable detail, but Mark comes to the point immediately, the Son of God.
Rem. Mark made a remarkable recovery; he had failed in his service at the beginning but now writes beautifully of the perfect Servant.
J.T. That is the point; that a man who had broken down but was now thoroughly restored should be the gospel writer. He had been with two great servants,
{467}
Paul and Barnabas, and had been the means of their going different ways, one to Jerusalem and the other on his own way. Mark went back to his mother's house in Jerusalem when he should have been on the road, and there was very warm feeling regarding the matter between Paul and Barnabas.
A.B. Is there something in the fact that in @Mark 16 as they lay at table the Lord reproached them? They had not believed the word of those to whom He had appeared.
J.T. Just so. It is remarkable that the Lord brings in that they had not believed the witnesses. He does not here refer to what He had said to them. In Luke the two men tell the women to remember what the Lord had said but Mark has the service in mind and makes room for the service of the Lord, recognising that He is already serving and telling these eleven men that He is risen, but they do not believe it. The servant is concerned with the impression he makes on the hearers and whether they are listening to the word spoken or are in unbelief.
J.W.D. It is interesting to see what characterises John Mark in that way: "And Barnabas proposed to take with them John also, called Mark; but Paul thought it not well to take with them him who had abandoned them, going back from Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work". In his career he was characteristically a man that went back.
J.T. Quite so; but the point is that he really did not succumb to those natural traits because he is now restored and is a man that God is using, so this book of Mark is a wonderful book. These verses from 9 to 20 are filled with the Lord's service. Here are eleven men, known as His apostles, yet lying at table, and they do not know where the Lord is nor whether He is risen or not. He finds them thus, for He chooses that time to find them in order to expose their state. He knew well enough what they were
{468}
doing, taking their ease, and that is what servants are doing throughout christendom. Take for example the Catholic church and its participants, what does the Lord find when He comes there? He finds that 'Saint Paul' and such titles have a great place in the so-called worship. And here He finds them lying at table. What, you say, is it not right to eat? Certainly, but find out where the Lord is first! These men did not know. They were disciples but they did not believe; these women were reliable women, not ordinary persons, but the eleven did not believe them.
L.E.S. And these were great men too.
J.T. Well, one is not going out of the way in speaking against servants; we are dealing with Scripture. And that situation is to be found at the present time too, but if we are right with God we will see that we are not lying at table when there is work to be done and a long way to go. Paul and Barnabas went on long journeys, and so here the word is, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation", and further, "He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned".
Rem. The magi were different; they were concerned as to where He was.
J.T. You are referring to the wise men from the east looking for Jesus; they went a long way to find Him that was born King of the Jews; they came to worship Him.
Rem. They found Him, too.
J.T. As soon as they left Jerusalem the star went before them again and they found the Lord and worshipped Him.
C.H.H. Would @Acts 14 show how Paul and Barnabas returned to maintain the disciples locally? They were not negligent of local responsibility.
{469}
J.T. Quite so. "And having chosen them elders in each assembly" would show their care of the saints. Elders are to take care of the place, because it is as important to take care of them as it is to find them.
Rem. This thought of the creation in Mark is a precious thought.
J.T. Yes. God's consideration for the creation is implied in Jonah, "And I, should not I have pity on Nineveh, the great city, wherein are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand?" @Jonah 4: 11. The cattle are in mind there too. I think the epistle to the Colossians has the thought of preaching to the creation, as it says "not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings, which ye have heard, which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which is under heaven, of which *I* Paul became minister", @Colossians 1: 23.
A.B. Noah's ark took in all the creation.
Rem. They belonged to God.
J.T. Just so, the whole creation is in mind. God has the cattle too; they are not merely given to us for food; nevertheless the man is not for the beast but the beast for man.
Rem. "For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now", @Romans 8: 22.
J.T. It is waiting for redemption.
J.W.D. Would "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation" involve the special gift of the evangelist, or would it be combined with the ministry of the servants?
J.T. Well, no doubt it is preaching that is in mind, bearing out the word 'witness' in Luke, but now it is a matter of being maintained and the question arises as to how we are to be furnished in our preaching. First, it says, "He that believes and is
{470}
baptised shall be saved". The baptism may be before or after believing, providing the person *is* baptised because baptism must be there; if it has not preceded then it is the first requirement; "and he that disbelieves shall be condemned", there is nothing about baptism in that connection; the condemnation of christendom is in their unbelief, "And these signs shall follow those that have believed, in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well". Now that is a list of things that accompanied the gospel among the nations; God accompanied the gospel with public signs.
J.W.D. That is, something was effected through the apostles and now they were to be witnesses of it.
J.T. That is the gospel, as far as the synoptical gospels go, and it is linked with the beginning of christianity. The testimony of the gospel going into the creation of God is peculiarly seen in Paul and his companions. Barnabas and others, and we come to see in the Acts that it belongs to the way in which the testimony was established in the western world properly. Now it is a question as to whether we have this accompaniment of power, and whether it is necessary, also whether we are now going on with the truth as witnesses according to Luke and proving that the Lord is with us, "The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God. And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it". We are to move on, so to say, in the light of all this; in our preaching this is to be in our minds, indeed we are to have the whole truth in our souls, for that is how John would have us, with ever a love of the truth.
{471}
R.R.T. Is it not significant that Paul finishes in Acts with the preaching of the kingdom of God?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Would the gospel of the glory of the blessed God take in all this?
J.T. The glory of the blessed God is a wide thought. Mark is occupied with power in men. I suppose what he represents suggests the mighty men of David in the christian dispensation. These mighty men as linked with Christ and selected to be with Him, are, like the mighty men of David, marked by exploits. It is a question of the experience there was with them; some exploits mark every one in his service.
Rem. In verse 20 the Lord has gone up on high and they are going forth, but the Lord is working with them, He is not idle there.
J.T. The idea of the right hand of God is characteristic of Mark; from the right hand of God power is put forth in grace to save men. Mark speaks much of the right side; the young man at the sepulchre was on the right and he was a model man. Mark himself was brought in very young; he had been in the service and had failed but is now brought back, so the young man is clothed with a white robe.
C.H.H. The Son "set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high", @Hebrews 1: 3.
J.T. Suggesting the idea of "All power". In Exodus the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt with a high hand; Mark has a like thought of a high-handed matter. The power of God's right hand was worked out in the young man who is said to have been seen sitting on the right of the sepulchre, a representative of the divine idea in Mark.
{472}
THE LORD'S COMING TO HIS OWN AS SEEN IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (5)
@John 20: 16 - 31; @John 21: 1 - 14; @John 14: 15 - 23
J.T. It will be observed that there are three manifestations recorded in chapters 20 and 21 during the period we have been considering, the forty days between the resurrection and the ascension of Christ. And then in chapter 14 we have a manifestation promised after the Holy Spirit should come, so that manifestations are continued. Chapter 14 brings in something that is not in the synoptical gospels and the promise here is to have special place with us at the close of our readings on the present subject. What comes in in the interval of the forty days should enter into the whole dispensation, though now it is not in a corporeal sense but in a spiritual sense, for the Spirit having come is an intimation of these continued promised manifestations. The brethren will notice that women come into this first manifestation and we have already had a considerable amount on that side, that is to say, the place sisters have in this great subject. John speaks very specially of Mary of Magdala by herself and she is seen as a learner, calling the Lord "Rabboni" in verse 16, stressing the idea of teaching, but of teaching by Him, 'My teacher' is the real force of the term, showing how successful the teaching is in the assembly or at least amongst those who are of it, and how all other teachings that are not in accordance with the teaching of Christ are to be excluded from the circle contemplated. John has this in mind, undoubtedly, in view of the last days and the novelties that would be introduced which are now damaging many, such as Christian Science and Faith Healing and many other heretical systems. There is rigid exclusion of the Jews here; that is the way John contemplates
{473}
the setting: "the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews". Incongruous indeed it would be to introduce any other teaching into the circle in which Christ was actually at that time, or into the upper room where were the eleven and the Lord's mother and the brethren and sisters. It would be out of the question to allow any teaching to be introduced save what is of Christ. And His authority was represented in the eleven so that the converts, we are told in @Acts 2, "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles", which would be very exclusive, and "in breaking of bread and prayers". I thought it well to call attention to these things as showing that it would be proper to look for the exclusion of everything else but what is of Christ, as it is said in @Colossians 3: 11, "Christ is everything, and in all".
L.E.S. The way in which Mary addresses the Lord as "Rabboni" would be an evidence that she could be adjusted; she was teachable in spirit.
J.T. Yes, she was very ready to listen to what He said. Notice how John stresses this point, the first two followers Jesus had called Him "Rabbi", which means they had teaching in their minds, and then further on in this gospel it says, "they shall be all taught of God" (chapter 6: 45).
L.E.S. Would the word 'Rabboni' suggest more than the matter being merely in the mind but something really to be viewed formatively?
J.T. It would involve affections too because it is said that the Lord first called her "Woman" in verse 15, and then in the next verse it says, "Jesus says to her, Mary". There is some suggestion in teaching of personal interest and affection involving confidence.
L.E.S. I was thinking of the great distinction between the two words, 'Rabbi' and 'Rabboni'; in the Hebrew the latter suggests that it is *her* matter.
{474}
J.T. There is a link in that way between Paul and this woman in that the Lord spoke to Paul in the Hebrew tongue, indicating His consideration of him as of Mary here. But the message given to her is on a higher level involving the heavenly side of the position, abstractly, of course, but still on the heavenly side.
J.D. In relation to what you are saying as to the exclusive character of the teaching having a bearing on the present moment of the testimony, do you not think there is something in the fact that she turned around? It would apply to many saints who are still in the systems of men, they must turn around.
J.T. Quite so, it requires movement in order for something spiritual to be conveyed. John himself in Patmos had to turn back, he heard a voice behind him and turned to see it.
C.H.H. The fact that John stresses the teaching of the water of life more than any other writer would show that it is particularly applicable as an antidote to the increasing darkness.
J.T. He stresses the love of the truth in his epistles and this would lead to refusal of all that is not of the truth. The fact is to be observed that heresies or sects are generally built up on *one* feature of the truth, whereas in John the Lord says of the Spirit of truth, "He shall guide you into all the truth" (chapter 16: 13). We want that, otherwise we are just another sect and we are not ready to say "Rabboni", for the Lord is the truth; He says, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life", @John 14: 6. John tells us that the Lord says this and also in his epistle he tells us that the Spirit is the truth (@1 John 5: 6), so that we have to keep in our minds, as coming into the circle of christianity, that Christ is the truth objectively and the Spirit is the truth subjectively in us. A love of the truth will introduce a complete preference for all truth and an acknowledgement of all truth. Take
{475}
one idea, that of baptism, it has been used to build up a baptist sect; or take the Epicureans, they have built up epicureanism, and so on. These sects go on and in time they come to be out-and-out apostasy, but in each it is the taking of one idea which is a right one in principle and stressing it at the expense of the rest of the truth; thus it becomes misleading and is sure in time to be linked up with error.
Rem. The teaching here is in connection with the heavenly side of the truth.
J.T. Mary is led on by Christ Himself.
J.W.D. Would what the Lord opened up to Mary in saying, "Touch me not", suggest that He is going through as the last Adam, a quickening spirit?
J.T. I think He would set her up in identification with Himself but not in the relation that she wanted to continue in an earthly setting. He really elevates her as speaking to her by name. "Jesus says to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus says to her, Mary". He called her by name; He had called her "Woman" but now there is evidence of something morally greater linked with her personally. She turns around, touched by that, and says to Him in Hebrew, "Rabboni, which means Teacher". Then "Jesus says to her, Touch me not", as if to convey to her that all links from now on are to be in the light of the new or heavenly position, "for I have not yet ascended to my Father", "Not yet" suggests that He is on His way to heaven, but the point is that heaven states the time. The Lord is going to that position and it implies a great movement and Mary is to be brought into it and to be linked with Christ in that setting. The word 'yet' implies, Wait a while, until the saints are brought into it too. That is, she is not to be linked with Christ by
{476}
herself, but as involving Ephesian teaching: "God ... has raised us up together", @Ephesians 2: 6.
L.E.S. The position in @Ephesians 4 would bear on this: "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (verse 13).
J.T. It would indeed, because the setting there is the point, "Wherefore he says, Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men". And from that position the ministry is proceeding, so we can see in some measure how unpardonable it is to bring in any innovations or anything of man's influence into that circle. Man's ideas and thoughts built into it have resulted in what christendom is today.
A.D. Would there be a link with the antichrist? John's epistle speaks of the appearing of the antichrist already in the world.
J.T. And there we get the word 'unction' which is peculiar to that epistle; it is a word to be noted: "Little children, it is the last hour, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is the last hour. They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us. And *ye* have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things. I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? *He* is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also. As for *you* let that which ye have heard from the beginning
{477}
abide in you, if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father", @1 John 2: 18 - 24. And then it says in verse 27, "And *yourselves*, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you, and ye have not need that any one should teach you; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him". So that we, as christians, are addressed as 'little children' in this particular part of the chapter and are set up in independency of antichrist, and of his teaching which includes all these kinds of things that we have been speaking of. The unction is protection; it guards the spiritual idea of the circle of the saints, and what is in mind is not simply a group of saints but the whole assembly.
Rem. Mary turned around.
J.T. It indicates that something definite is in mind because there is a complete turn from what she had been engaged with. John in Revelation had to turn back, not that he was in a wrong position at all but the state of the assembly required that there should be a turning back, as in Paul's history when he wished to go to be with the Lord but decided to remain on account of the saints.
J.D. What is the thought in the Lord using a sister to carry this wonderful message to the brethren? Why did He not go Himself?
J.T. That is a good question, and requires the close attention of the sisters. How solemn to think that in the new order of things a sister may be so influential with her husband and family and the brethren, and how damaging she may be if not abiding in the truth! Because women are liable to be led into things more easily than men, and I think John has this in mind in writing to "the elect lady and her children, whom *I* love in truth", @2 John 1.
{478}
Ques. "They went out from among us, but they were not of us", @1 John 2: 19. Would it not bring deep assembly exercise when one leaves us?
J.T. Yes, just so. A young christian is not to leave the circle of the saints. The Lord had to do with such persons Himself; John tells us that from a certain time many of His disciples went away and walked no more with Him. The Lord challenges those who remain, saying, "Will ye also go away? Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal", @John 6: 67, 68. That is the position in John, for we are dealing with John's ministry.
C.H.H. Would the unction affect us inwardly and the anointing outwardly?
J.T. 'Unction' is a peculiar word. It is "from the holy one" which alludes to the Spirit undoubtedly, but in a peculiar way; only John uses it. His ministry is the last that we have in mind to look into at this time and he is very strong, by the Spirit of God, as regards the 'isms'. It is definitely in his mind that these 'isms' have to be faced and refused.
Ques. As we work out these abstract thoughts in our localities is our preservation seen in working out the heavenly side of the truth together?
J.T. Quite so. We are indwelt by the Spirit, the unction, and we know all things by Him.
Ques. Referring to the 'isms' do you classify them as antichristian?
J.T. That is the drift of them, though not classified yet, except perhaps paganism and atheism. There is in them the working of antichristian features because they shut out the Spirit. We have that well-known tract entitled, *The Notion of a Clergyman: Dispensationally the sin against the Holy Ghost*, which suggests the idea of the antichrist abstractly, and so it is with me if I have the clerical idea. The Lord says that if a word is spoken against
{479}
the Son of man it will be forgiven but if it is spoken against the Spirit it will not be forgiven in this age nor in the coming one.
Ques. Is the teaching of @James 5 applicable today?
J.T. It is well to notice that it is linked with the assembly: "Is any sick among you? let him call to him the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord". Then the committing of sins is linked with this too, "and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick". It is not anyone's prayers that are spoken of, it is those of the elders, and James links them with the assembly. If we disregard the assembly we are in danger of allowing Christian Science which is downright apostasy. There is some truth in it and what is true is not new because the truth is always the truth, but what is new in it is not true and therein lies the mistake, in mixing what is true and what is not true.
A.B. What is the import of Mary's saying, My Teacher? Does it suggest the principle of taking character from the Teacher? The Lord says in @John 13: 14, "If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet". Mary says, My Teacher, as if taking character from Him, and then she is not characterised by much talk; she does not make herself prominent at all.
J.T. Quite. The first thing she says is that she had seen the Lord: "Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her". She is not simply repeating the message to them but there is moral ground in her, so that it says that she brought word that she had seen the Lord and that He had said these things to *her*; it was a personal communication to her. What greater moral ground could there be than that? So she had authority
{480}
with her and they listened to her. How beautiful! Then verse 19 supports what she had said with a manifestation: "When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace be to you". No doubt the moral significance in the closed doors would be the outcome of Mary's message; what they had was so precious that it must not be contaminated or adulterated, like the pure nard kept by Mary of Bethany free from contamination; in John is not said to be in a box but yet is kept pure and unadulterated; it represents the loving of our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. That is, there is nothing brought in but what is true; what is seven-eighths true and tinged with man's thoughts is not pure; the truth is to be kept in incorruption.
J.D. Would the fear of the Jews be experienced in any measure today?
J.T. The Jew idea is a form of the doctrine of Nicolaitanes which comes down to us in the third church of @Revelation 2. It is properly the same clerical principle as is hated by the Ephesians, and that is what *we* have to do to it too, because it is the idea of forming sects and is greatly supported in christendom in all its ramifications, but it is not far away from Babylon.
J.D. In the address to the Philadelphian church the Lord says, "I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee", @Revelation 3: 9.
J.T. Well, these seem to be the things that the Lord Himself would have John turn back to look over, and the Lord tells him to write in a book about all these matters which He is going to rebuke.
{481}
R.R.T. The Lord says to Mary, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". The assembly is really intimated to Mary in that expression 'my brethren'. She is not told to go to any sister or brother in relation to this matter but to the assembly, "my brethren".
J.T. Bringing them all in.
C.H.H. The climax of John's teaching is the presentation of the truth in manifestations.
J.T. And the first appearing is connected with Mary exclusively, but then the Lord came to where there were closed doors. You might say there was not much there, but there is no condemnation in John, nothing at all is wrong; everything is right in these manifestations from the abstract view. God is entitled to present things abstractly and John seems to be the one selected to deal with the abstract. Then the next one is eight days after; it is to the same persons and they are inside on the same principle, as it says, "And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be to you". He is still in the midst and the whole company is right; Thomas is not right but he does not represent them and the Lord is going to make him right. We have to see not only that we are dealing with christianity in John but that these comings or manifestations are including the light of what is connected with Israel and its recovery. In these closing moments of the Lord's path we have to see what is going on, for what is presented can be used at any time in christianity, even what is represented in Thomas, because it is to rebuke materialism -- a great thing to keep out! It was there at the beginning and in this second appearing it is there and
{482}
Thomas is with them. Where was he at the previous manifestation?
R.R.T. In verse 19 "Jesus came and stood in the midst", and in verse 26 "Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst". What is in view in these two comings?
J.T. The connection is with what we were looking at yesterday, "the midst" suggesting something definite as being in the midst of particular persons, although it is said elsewhere that He was in "their midst". There is such a thing as this and I believe it has the universal position in mind, Jesus standing in relation to that.
Rem. The Lord in His dealings with Thomas would help us in not generalising matters but getting to the detail of what is in mind.
J.T. I think that he is in the Lord's thoughts and the Lord is intimating that He knew of the disturbance in this man's mind, "Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here and see my hands; and bring thy hand and put it into my side". The Lord is showing him that He knew about him and what he had said, and that He would deal with him. He knew about Peter too, but He did not bring up Peter's case in the midst in the way in which He brought up Thomas's. Besides representing the Jewish element, Thomas affords an example of how the Lord would bring up a serious matter to be tried in the midst, not by Himself but in the midst.
J.W.D. Is the first manifestation really a suggestion of His appearing now after the Lord's supper to those in the light of what is both local and universal?
J.T. I think that is right; it is on a higher level, where Christ is appreciated.
J.W.D. His coming is not mythical but actual.
J.T. Just so; as the Lord comes to His own here, if He is there He is there in that sense. And the
{483}
setting merges from the local to the universal position, indeed the eternal position is in mind too.
J.D. Speaking of the results of these manifestations connected with Thomas, is it not remarkable to see, looking at it from a dispensational viewpoint, that the remnant knows only "My Lord and my God"?
J.T. This matter of coming casually among the brethren is a very important consideration. It is remarkable that Thomas does not allude to the message that Mary brought; he is really lowering the ground. He is not at the first manifestation and here he says, "My Lord and my God". The Lord did not tell Mary to speak in that way; the message He sent was, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". But Thomas would materialise the thing; he was very deliberate in this too. Nevertheless the Lord saw to it that he was brought in, though on a lower level. As applied to us now Thomas is the loser, but he also represents another dispensation on a lower level. God will not leave Himself without a witness; He must have this as a result of His work. But the first message to Mary given by the Lord Jesus is most precious and covers our dispensation. Thomas is on individual lines and materialises things, and he is an unbeliever, a most terrible thing! And to think that these things are found amongst those who were so honoured and favoured! The Lord knew, as He came to His disciples, that there was materialism and unbelief and scepticism found in one of the apostles, but He was going to use him as symbolical of another world on a lower level. He missed the first manifestation and there will never be another like that! There are only three manifestations in this section and all are different; he has missed the best one and so he will be a loser for ever in consequence.
{484}
L.E.S. The effort of the enemy is to make us compromise in regard of the position of the testimony at any current moment. He would reduce the position to the lower level.
J.T. He would. When Thomas sees the Lord he is going to say, "My Lord and my God". But what about the Father? The disciples would say, When that message came to us Thomas was not with us. Very well, Thomas, you are on a lower level and a loser, but still true as far as this position is concerned.
J.D. At the first appearing nothing like that was said, but "The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord".
J.T. Showing how thoroughly indeed they had received the message. Thomas does not indicate that he knows anything at all about it.
R.R.T. Thomas missed a great thing, the best thing, for the Lord breathed into them the Holy Spirit.
J.T. And he is out of the commission that is given the others; he is really not in it at all: "And having said this, he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit, whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained".
J.W.D. Would the manifestation and commission have taken place if Thomas's unbelief and materialism had been present?
J.T. The Lord comes in for us so that there may be no such thing amongst us; He would come in to adjust such a state as is represented by Thomas here.
J.W.D. Matters are adjusted that are local as well as universal in the way the Lord definitely links on with us.
J.T. Luke says that the Lord stood there, but this is a higher plane morally and would go on into eternity. It is, I would think, what is to characterise christianity, His being in the midst, and it corresponds
{485}
with @Acts 20, the love chapter of that book. It is a chapter full of Paul and what he represents, a state which goes on into eternity. We are not told where he had been in those three years at Ephesus, but he had become very familiar with the upper level, had indeed come through the upper districts to get there and in this love chapter is proceeding on the line of the universal and heavenly position.
Ques. What is the meaning of verse 23?
J.T. It is the prerogative belonging to the disciples; they are not here formally called the assembly because John does not use that word except in Revelation, but the link is with the disciples as persons who form the assembly. We require spirituality for such matters, as @Galatians 6 says, "Ye who are spiritual restore such a one"; that suggests persons of the assembly. The disciples are not said to be that here, but it is the persons who are in mind in this book; it emphasises personality and those who are trustworthy, and the Lord is trusting them with these things. He says, "Receive the Holy Spirit", and then He commits to them the power to remit sins, not to retain first but to remit first. We have the Spirit of Christ in dealing with matters and when that is in mind we think of the remitting first.
L.E.S. Is the point we have spoken of in relation to Thomas seen in @Zephaniah 3: 17, "Jehovah thy God is in thy midst"?
J.T. That is the thought exactly; you can see what a level we are on. How God would impress us with it! It is open to us. And thus we maintain the outlook we have spoken of in relation to Thomas and to those in the next chapter in their outward move; the result is that one hundred and fifty-three fishes are brought in, referring to the gentiles. We are to note that spirit in relation to the recovery of Israel and then in the bringing in of the nations, the great fishes.
{486}
J.D. Do you think the Lord was rebuking Thomas here? "Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed: blessed they who have not seen and have believed". The Lord had the faith period in mind.
J.T. He had. That is our position; we partake of the blessing attaching to the faith period, whereas the Jews come in in the sight period and their position is not so great; the nations would be represented in the one hundred and fifty-three great fishes. The Lord is seen in each case; there are three distinct appearings in these two chapters, on the down grade from the top to the bottom; that is, from the highest position of the assembly to the position of the nations in the millennial day.
A.B. Thomas was not at the first manifestation and he discredits anything that the disciples tell him in relation to it; when one discredits what the brethren say the Lord has to do with him.
J.T. We cannot but see that it is a most distinct position of unbelief. It is very solemn, and a warning to any one of us that we may become an unbeliever in this sense, because he was a real man, and an apostle. The points to discern in his case are unbelief and materialism, "Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe".
J.W.D. There is great encouragement in the first manifestation and great instruction for us today in the second and third in the idea of the lower levels all flowing from the enjoyment of the higher level.
J.T. These three manifestations are prophetic and are at the same time of great importance to believers in Christ. They take place after He arose and have in view the Spirit as having come; @John 14 opens this up. We learn from these three manifestations in the end of the gospel how to appraise the manifestations
{487}
in @John 14, and so the Lord says there, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you". And then, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". The manifestations of verses 20 and 21 are contingent on the Spirit and properly belong to christianity; hence the importance of keeping our skirts clean and being governed by righteousness and holiness so that He can come to carry out His thought for us, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" -- it does not say how many times or when, it is left with us to know when to look for this manifestation and to know where it might happen, but the fact is that He has promised to come; we are never to be left. The Lord addresses us in a fatherly way in this gospel, and in the other gospels too; twice in this gospel, in chapters 13 and 21, He says "Children". The word 'children' is used by Him not as God the Father would use it but in the sense of having a moral right to each one. Paul and John use the same expression of the brethren; the Lord, however, is a divine Person, but nevertheless employing this term. He answers to the idea of everlasting Father or Father of the age (@Isaiah 9: 6). In the millennium He will in a relative sense look after things in a fatherly way and the same thing applies to His relations with us; He regards us in a fatherly way as to affections and protection. So that is what is in mind in the words in @John 14, "I will not leave you orphans"; we are never to be in that state. I would not say that we are not sometimes so from our viewpoint, but it will never be so from His viewpoint; He never intended that and so He says, "I am coming to you".
{488}
J.D. "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him". Would the Lord assure us of individual divine visitation in a broken day?
J.T. Yes, it is a great encouragement. The individual is assured of the visitation, so that we may take John himself on Patmos as an illustration of how the Lord comes to one. John was keeping his commandments and words and he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day; the Lord's authority was affecting him. He learns that things have changed since the beginning of the church's history, that failure has taken place, and the Lord says, as it were, I know that you are in the Spirit and looking towards heaven, but I want you to see this condition which I am going on with outwardly and will restore in principle, and to be with Me in it. So the Lord calls him from behind, meaning that he had to turn back from where he was, changing his outlook for the moment. Heaven was evidently in his mind and so this called for sacrifice on John's part. He says, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus". The Lord brings him back to view this position of failure, as if He says, I am concerned about the conditions in these assemblies and I want you to be with Me. The Lord would say to any one of us, I can use you. I would like my outlook to be universal in relation to what the Lord is doing. We see what the Lord can do with John as representing that idea in this chapter, and in our day the Lord can take certain men who are keeping His commandments and can tell them of what He is doing. If we are available and useful to the Lord He says, I will use you.
Rem. "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".
J.T. "In that day" contemplates the Spirit's day; it is not the Jewish day, Thomas's day, but our day,
{489}
the day of the Spirit. The great thought that John has in mind is the present dispensation, that of the Spirit, and the Lord would say, You are to know what I am in My Father's affections and what you are in My affections. That refers to persons in the present dispensation, the economy in which are the Father and the Son and the saints. The Father, Son and Spirit all coming to be with us, these are the possibilities of the Spirit's day and the Lord would press them upon us now.
J.W.D. It is not the assembly convened which governs the present manifestations in relation to service.
J.T. This scripture makes it very general, the word 'assembly' is left out and the phrase 'sons of God' is left out too, all to make room for what is at the present time, the conditions in the day of the Spirit, conditions facing any young brother or sister today. These words are used specially because of conditions and divine Persons can manifest themselves in them. Other scriptures teach us certain things in relation to the assembly, but John is not dealing with that.
Ques. Is the quality of love that which warrants these manifestations? "I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".
J.T. He is in the Father's affections and He says, You are in my affections. We are in His affections and He is in our affections, so the realm is there, the place where love abides.
C.H.H. Would "I in you" suggest testimony?
J.T. Yes, it would be seen in us.
Ques. What is meant by the last verse of this chapter, "Rise up, let us go hence"?
J.T. The Lord says that to them. John's gospel is distinct from the other gospels; chapters 13 to 17 are recorded by him alone. How full chapter 17 is!
{490}
At the end of chapter 14 there is a break, "Rise up, let us go hence", the Lord having already said that the ruler of this world comes; that means that something is going to happen; the Lord is moving on now, and then chapter 15 points to the vine, really the earthly dispensation, and chapter 16 brings out the position of the disciples. "These things I have spoken unto you that ye may not be offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues; but the hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God". This is the position of the disciples as having to suffer and to be killed on His account; then chapter 17 is His prayer to the Father. What is in mind in this section from chapter 14 on is evidenced in the present day, the Spirit's day. It is not speaking of what happened during the forty days; it is expressed before that but alludes to the Spirit coming. What happens here after the Spirit comes is the thing we want to get at, so that we might be strengthened.
J.D. Verse 21 says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me". What would those commandments be?
J.T. I would say if I were specifying them that they would take in the epistles to the Corinthians, in fact all the Pauline epistles, because they convey the commandments to us, possibly 1 Corinthians especially so. In connection with prophecy we have in @1 Corinthians 14: 37, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment". That is the way really, and the whole epistle is concerned with this; no one need expect to have visitations who does not obey the commandments.
J.D. The commandments of Christ are not new commandments, they are the commandments Christ gave down here to be carried out as instructed in the epistles.
{491}
J.T. Quite so, that is very important; so you do not force them aside. People cannot rightly say that Paul was not married and so he said things that do not apply now. No one who sets aside one of these commandments gets any manifestations.
R.R.T. "I am coming to you" is not a matter now of His coming and then disappearing.
J.T. No, His attitude is: "I am coming to you".
