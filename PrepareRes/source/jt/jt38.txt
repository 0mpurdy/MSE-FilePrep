LIFE IN THE FACE OF APOSTASY (1)
@Revelation 1: 17 - 20; @Revelation 2: 7, 10; @Revelation 3: 5
J.T. I should like to consider the subject of life in the book of Revelation.
In order that the subject may be clearly before us, I will remark that the first passage which we have read refers to Christ as the Living One; the second speaks of the tree of life in the paradise of God, and then of the crown of life; and the third refers to the book of life.
In view of the apostasy contemplated in Revelation, it is important to consider the subject of life. We shall see in the course of our readings that this subject is found throughout this book.
We begin by considering Christ as the Living One. If we are in the same position as John we shall be within the Lord's reach. He says: "When I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; *I* am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". John says: "He laid his right hand upon me". It is according as the Lord lays His hand upon us, that we shall understand and profit in relation to this vast subject of life. John's ministry must have taken its character very much from the fact that the Lord had laid His hand upon him. And as feeling that blessed hand, he was able to speak of the Lord as being "the first and the last, and the living one".
*Who is the Lord*? That is a question that ought to be before each one of us. The antichrist is about to come, and the saints should be instructed as regards who Christ is Himself. In this book of Revelation, we have names, appellations which denote very clearly the deity of the Lord Jesus.
{2}
We have first of all, in the first chapter, an expression of praise: "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages. Amen" (verses 5 and 6). Then we read in verse 8: "I am the Alpha, and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty". He is there, without contradiction, "the Lord God". Then, at the end of this first chapter, He is "the first and the last, and the living one": He who "became dead" and who is "living to the ages of ages".
Rem. Only in so far as we are under the hand of Him who is living shall we enjoy life.
H.D'A.C. If christianity is not a living order of things, it has no value.
J.T. In view of the tendency towards an antichristian movement, it may well be desired that the living character of christianity should appear.
Th.D. You have drawn attention to what is said in verse 8. The One who is named "the Lord God", is that the Lord Jesus?
J.T. It is the Lord Jesus as God. In the last chapter He says: "I am the Alpha and the Omega" (verse 13), It is emphatic: "*I* am". And there, as in this verse 8 of the first chapter, it relates to the same Person.
O.T. Job had some notion of the Living One: "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and the Last, he shall stand upon the earth", @Job 19: 25.
J.T. Many of Job's observations were confused, but others were very brilliant: "I know that my Redeemer liveth". He desired a mediator (chapters 9: 33 and 16: 21). He said first: "There is not an umpire between us, who should lay his hand upon us both", and later: "Oh that there were arbitration for a man with God". This thought is developed in the book of Revelation where Christ is presented on the side of God first, as being Himself God, and then on the side of man. He can
{3}
"lay his hand upon us both", according to the language of Job, on God and on man. He is God, *in all that the name of God means*, and He is Man, *in all that the name of Man means* (sin apart).
P.N. In the last chapter, where He is called "the Alpha and the Omega", @Revelation 22:13 is He viewed as Man?
J.T. Yes. Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet; He is the beginning of all that has been said and of all that can be said; the Omega is the end of all that can be said with regard to God, and that end is in Christ. There is nothing more to say, and it is in that sense that He is called "the Word".
Rem. It is only in the last chapter that He is called "the beginning and the end" @Revelation 22:13. We have not that appellation in the first chapter.
J.T. That is to bring out, in the last chapter, the side of His manhood.
Rem. In regard to His deity, there can be no question of either beginning or end.
J.T. When it says: "Then the end" (@1 Corinthians 15: 24), that relates to His manhood, not that He ceases to be Man (for He remains a Man); but He is the One who has *completed* all the counsels of God.
Rem. John says: "In the beginning was the Word" @John 1:1.
Rem. The first chapter of John draws our attention to His deity -- "the Word was God".
J.T. He of whom it says: "In the beginning was the Word" existed eternally, for "the Word was God".
Th.D. The Person was there.
J.T. "The Word" is a title that relates to Him as Man, revealing the mind of God.
Rem. It is the title under which He was known down here, He who has expressed the thoughts of God.
Th.D. It is not a title of absolute deity, is it? Before there was a created scene, He was there; but since there was then no creature, was there occasion for God to express Himself?
{4}
J.T. We should understand the deity of Christ in an absolute way, beyond and apart from creation. One Person of the Godhead could not be the Word in relation to the other Persons.
H.D'D.C. That thought ought to be the solution to all our difficulties on this point.
J.T. This title "the Word" only has force from the moment that God addresses Himself to men. *The Person* whom we know as "the Word" was there; but *the position* is only occupied mediatorially.
Rem. It is a question therefore of distinguishing between what the Person is and what He became.
Rem. We have the tendency to think that what He became He always was.
J.T. There is a certain pagan idea which was formerly received with regard to the Word, that is, that He existed separately from the Godhead and was inferior to the Godhead. This thought was current at the beginning of christianity, when the apostles were no longer there. The theologians of that period used to say that it was in that sense that John used that expression in his gospel; now to speak thus is to dishonour the Lord Jesus. The book of the Revelation was probably written by John before his gospel, and in this book John affirms the absolute deity of the Lord Jesus; and in chapter 19, it says that His name is called "the Word of God"; that is His name as Man. John does not give any explanation as to that expression, thinking that it would be understood, and he uses it from the point of view of the Lord's ministry down here. Luke uses the same expression in the first chapter of his gospel; he speaks of eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word.
H.D'D.C. May the Lord be pleased to help us to accept that!
J.T. He will. He has done it already. And it is very important, in view of the coming of the antichrist which is marked by all kinds of falsehood, that the
{5}
saints should receive an impression of the deity of the Lord Jesus. Before becoming Man, being in the form of God, He was in no way inferior to the other Persons of the Godhead.
Rem. And having become Man, He has not ceased to be God in the equality in which He was eternally.
J.T. He never ceases to be God, "the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come". @Hebrews 13:8 But in becoming Man, He has taken a place of relative inferiority. It is thus, as being in that place, that we bear Him say: "The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing: for whatever things *he* does, these things also the Son does in like manner", @John 5: 19.
Ques. How are we to understand that He says in the same chapter: "The Son also quickens whom he will" @John 5:21?
J.T. It is because the Father has given to Him to have life in Himself, which would have no application in absolute deity.
Rem. "I and the Father are one" @John 10:30, He said.
Rem. The Lord retains His equality now that He has become Man.
Rem. He said again: "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father" @John 14:9.
J.T. His equality shines out constantly. And on the other hand we see His subjection. We have always before us that which is beyond us.
Ques. The title "Father" is a title of revelation, as well as the tide "Son", is it not?
J.T. It is love that is manifested in the relation of Father and Son.
Th.D. To go back to the title "the Word", I suppose that only He who is God could be the Word.
J.T. The epistle to the Hebrews begins thus: "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the Person of the Son" @Hebrews 1:1 - 2.
{6}
The prophets were not the Word. It says: "At the end of these days has spoken to us in the Person of the Son" @Hebrews 1:2. You have, in the Person of the Son, Him who is God Himself. It is a Person of the Godhead who speaks. The word "Son" indicates the dignity of the Person; while "the Word" is rather the inherent power to reveal Himself.
Rem. He has the power to reveal Himself, as being the Word, but the epistle to the Hebrews brings out His dignity, "taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they" @Hebrews 1:4.
Rem. The expression "Son" governs the first of Hebrews. It is of the Son that it says: "Thy throne, O God, is to the age of the age" @Hebrews 1:8.
J.T. The knowledge of the Lord Jesus, from the point of view of the epistle to the Hebrews, would free us from thoughts that are current in the religious world. Theology as such does not give to the expressions used in their full spiritual meaning; it is only by the Spirit that we use the exact scriptural term.
Rem. It is the Spirit alone who leads us into the truth, and into all the truth.
Rem. To discern all these things, John had to turn back.
J.T. He says: "I turned back". We must all turn back, that is to say take up a certain position which is needful to understand an aspect of the truth. He had heard the voice ("I heard behind me a great voice"); but he turned back to see, to understand, for in order to understand well one must see. Hearing and sight are two senses which are very important to the intelligence of the believer; then comes touch: the Lord lays His hand upon us.
Rem. The right hand would be the hand of His power.
J.T. It is the touch of Him who died and rose again, the touch of the Living One.
Rem. The Scriptures speak also of His left hand.
{7}
J.T. "His left hand would be under my head, and his right hand embrace me", @Song of Songs 8: 3. It is so important to be under the Lord's hand! There is a certain number of brethren among us this morning who are specially engaged in the work of the Lord, who have the opportunity and privilege of speaking of the things of the Lord, or of writing His thoughts, and they should give their whole attention to this voice, "the voice which spoke with me", so as only to give out right thoughts. And it says: "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these". "The things that are" refer to the assembly in its public character described in chapters 2 and 3. "The things that are about to be after these" are stated from chapter 4 to the end of the book. We should give ourselves to these things with living power. The Lord would bring us back to what existed at the outset of christianity, to what was marked by life, in order that our ministry should be in the power of life. The creeds were written when the church had become worldly. The first great council was presided over by an unbaptised emperor, as head of the church (who was at the same time priest of the pagan world); those were not spiritually advantageous conditions for considering the deity of Christ.
Rem. It is remarkable that at the beginning and the end of this book the Lord draws attention to Himself. He says: "I".
J.T. In the second chapter, and also in the third, the Lord dictates letters, messages for the assemblies. The overcomer in the first three assemblies is in a different position from the overcomer in the last four. In the last four He speaks of the overcomer before speaking of the voice of the Spirit; that is to say that there must be overcomers in order that the voice of the Spirit might be understood. Do the brethren see that distinction? I believe it is important in the last four churches: in order that room may be given to
{8}
the Holy Spirit to speak, there must be the overcomer. Up to Thyatira, the public body is viewed as allowing the Spirit to speak, but after that the voice of the Spirit is to the overcomer only. And if, at this moment, there were no overcomers in France, we could not have a meeting like this.
Rem. The overcomer gives place to the Spirit.
Rem. In order that others may be available also.
J.T. At the beginning, during some hundreds of years, the church listened to the voice of the Spirit, until Thyatira. But when we reach that epoch of Thyatira which permits the woman Jezebel, it is only the overcomer who lends his ear to the voice of the Spirit; and He desires that others also should hear it.
Rem. You mean that it is not only a question of the overcomer hearing the voice of the Spirit, but of others also paying attention to it.
J.T. The Lord regards the assembly of Ephesus as being outwardly correct, the Spirit addressing Himself to the public body, and He says: "To him that overcomes, I will give to him to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God". We see there the position of Christ according to the divine thought: the tree of life is in the paradise of God. Such was the position of the tree of life at the beginning. Thus, the position of the tree of life relates to Christ dead, raised and exalted at the right hand of God.
Th.D. What is the difference between the position of the tree of life here and its position in chapter 22, where it is "in the midst of its street, and of the river, on this side and on that side"?
J.T. I suppose that in chapter 22 it is accessible; we can thus get the gain of it. It is a question of life in the millennial day, because it speaks of its leaves which are "for healing of the nations".
Ques. Why does it speak of twelve fruits?
J.T. It is to show that the tree produces much fruit.
{9}
The agricultural year formerly included only seven months: from seed-time to harvest there was not a full year of twelve months. We see by that how fertile the tree was. If that existed in our meetings, how precious it would be! What variety there would be!
Rem. In chapter 22, the question has to be raised for some, whether they have right to the tree of life.
J.T. In the garden of Eden the flame of the sword turned every way, "to guard the way to the tree of life" @Genesis 3:24. Now, access is open; it is a question of having right to the tree of life; and having right to the tree of life one goes in by the gates into the city.
Rem. There is another thought in this book: that of washing. "Blessed are they that wash their robes". @Revelation 22:12 In the first chapter it says that Christ has washed us in His blood.
Ques. Is there a difference to bring out?
J.T. In the first chapter the action is in the past ("who ... has washed us"), likewise in chapter 7, "they ... have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb". But in chapter 22 it is in the present: the action is continuous ("they that wash").
Th.D. In the first chapter it is a question of the persons: "Him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood", while in the last chapter attention is drawn to the robes.
J.T. The robes are in view also in chapter 7. Chapters 1 and 7 mention the blood, while chapter 22 does not mention it; it is rather water that is in view. The water that flowed from the Lord's side was for washing. He came by water and blood. Those who go in by the gates into the city are those who do the thing; they wash their robes.
Rem. The beginning of chapter 22 speaks of the fruit and of the leaves of the tree of life; but in chapter 2 the portion is in the tree of life itself.
{10}
J.T. It is the Person Himself: Christ is our life, as Paul says: "When the Christ is manifested who is our life", @Colossians 3: 4.
Ques. This washing is effected by means of the word, is it not?
J.T. John is the expression of it in Revelation.
C.R. You mean that he was set apart, separate.
Rem. He is an overcomer in verse 10 of the first chapter.
J.T. Yes, verses 9 and 10 shew that he is an overcomer.
Rem. And as an overcomer, he can say: "I John".
J.T. It is a question there of a witness qualified to speak. The Lord makes use of the same form of expression: "I Jesus".
{11}
LIFE IN THE FACE OF APOSTASY (2)
@Revelation 4: 6 - 11; @Revelation 5: 6 - 10
J.T. We see in this book a remarkable presentation of the deity and of the manhood of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is very important to keep before us very distinctly the dual thought of His deity and of His manhood, in face of the teaching which leads to the coming of the antichrist.
The deity of the Lord must be viewed in its absolute character, as before and outside of creation. Then we must consider His Person relatively to the creation; and from that point of view we have different names. All the names that we have of the Persons of the Godhead in the Scriptures, are relative to the creation; we cannot regard them as applying before creation, for then they would have no force as connected only with the Persons of the Godhead. For example, the name of God, which appears from the first verse of the Bible, is a relative name. The Hebrew word is Elohim, which means the Supreme Being, the One who is to be worshipped. None of the Persons of the Godhead appears to be supreme with regard to another; none could be worshipped by another. A careful consideration of all these names confirms this fact. The name of God to which we are baptised is that of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit; @Matthew 28: 19. But this order could not be applied in absolute deity. It indicates simply that two of the Persons have taken a relatively inferior position in view of revelation.
H.D'A.C. And we have not the right to reverse the order and say: The Spirit, the Son and the Father.
J.T. It is evident that we could not do that. In the New Testament the Son takes a position of inferiority, for example when He says: "I cannot do anything of myself", @John 5: 30.
{12}
Th.D. He also speaks of Himself as sent, which indicates a subordinate place.
J.T. Although He has taken, in His grace, a place of inferiority in manhood, nevertheless Scripture combines in a marvellous way His deity and His manhood, so that He who sits upon the throne in chapter 4 is the same as He whom we see in chapter 5 as slain. It speaks of Him when He was on earth in these terms: "The Son of man who is in heaven" @John 3:13. We are always in the presence of that which is inscrutable.
We commenced our subject this morning with considering the Living One who became dead and who is living to the ages of ages; we noted that He laid His right hand upon John, an action which gave character to John's ministry. We also noticed with profit that John had to turn back to see the voice which spoke with him. We have to turn back to get the gain of any new aspect which the Lord would present to us of Himself, and John had to change his position several times in the course of this book. In the first verse of chapter 4, it is said to him: "Come up here, and I will shew thee the things which must take place after these things". He says: "Immediately I became in the Spirit". This book presents to us very specially the ability to move so as to take up a suitable standpoint in relation to the situation.
Rem. In chapter 6 of Isaiah the seraphim covered their faces with two of their wings; but here the living creatures are full of eyes to see the things.
J.T. We remarked already this morning that eyes and ears are to be open. John heard the voice and turned to see it. It is one thing to hear; it is another thing to see.
O.T. John is a contemplator; he says: "We have contemplated his glory" @John 1:14.
Rem. That is the end of Job's experience: "I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee" @Job 42:5.
J.T. It is indispensable to hear and to see in order to make progress in the truth.
{13}
Ques. Is there something more than hearing and seeing?
J.T. It is a question of understanding with the heart.
Rem. It says in @Isaiah 6: 10: "... lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and healed".
J.T. And in @Ezekiel 40: 4: "Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for in order that it might be shown unto thee art thou brought hither".
Rem. He can say: "Declare to the house of Israel all that thou seest".
J.T. We also considered "the tree of life which is in the paradise of God" as being the portion of the overcomer in the first assembly. Then, the overcomer in Smyrna will receive the crown of life. The overcomer in Sardis has his name preserved in the book of life. Thus life is prominent with regard to the overcomer.
Now, in chapter 4, we have living creatures. They are four, representing universal features, as the twenty-four elders typify administration. In resuming His ways with the earth God testifies that He is in sympathy with the creation. The fact that the elders are twenty-four in number points to the two dispensations, and shows that they enter intelligently into His thoughts. Headship is suggested in the twenty-four elders, arising from David's ministry: David calls Jehovah Head. The four living creatures would rather represent John's ministry. We must not only have intelligence, but there must be among us living affections and sympathy. We may have an intelligent explanation of the Scriptures; but it is also a question of our having sympathetic affections. Each brother and each sister has part among the living creatures who bring about joy in our meetings. It says: "In the midst of the throne, and around the throne, four living creatures, full of eyes, before and behind". The persons have discernment as well as affection, that is to say they do not receive blindly all that is said.
{14}
The living creatures are "full of eyes, before and behind" (verse 6), and further on (verse 8), "round and within they are full of eyes". Thus the power of discernment is seen within, without, before, behind, all around. When the apostle Paul preached at Berea, the believers searched the Scriptures daily if these things were so. Sometimes we have more light than love, or more love than light. What we have here indicates that love, light and life are in perfect accord. Have you found that in the meetings in your travels, Mr. C?
H.D'A.C. In some measure. May the Lord be pleased to increase it!
J.T. Brethren recall that the question of life was enquired into in 1890. However, christianity consists in what is living. So the epistle of John is not only light, but it is a word of life.
Rem. Light without life will not suffice for a meeting; there must also be love.
Rem. "*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren", @1 John 3: 14. Love is the expression of life.
Ques. Would you say a few words as to the crown of life and the book of life?
J.T. The thought of having a crown ought to be cherished by us. The crown of life means that one cherishes the idea of life. In the ten days of persecution spoken of to Smyrna, there were those who thought to save their life by denying the Lord; but others died for the truth, and the Lord will give them the crown of life. Like the saints of the Old Testament, they awaited a better resurrection. The book of life is brought in with relation to the overcomer in Sardis, which points to a period when there was very little life among professing christians, and the names of many who had the reputation of being christians will not be found in the book of life.
Th.D. Why does it say; "I will not blot ... out", as if they might be blotted out?
{15}
J.T. It is only a matter of what is negative. You cannot base a positive on a negative. In chapter 20, all those whose names were not found in the book of life were cast into the lake of fire. The book of life is a final book; it is the book of the living.
O.T. Abigail said to David: "The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living" @1 Samuel 25:29.
J.T. The question of life finds its solution in the epistle to the Romans, but it is not on such a high level as the heavenly position, of which the epistle to the Ephesians treats: "God ... has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" @Ephesians 2:6, having "blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" @Ephesians 1:3. Many have the forgiveness of their sins without truly enjoying their heavenly portion. The Lord said in Luke, chapter 10: "I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven". In the second chapter of Luke, the angels say "on earth peace"; but in chapter 19 it is "peace in heaven". That points to the present period, the period of the assembly.
I hope we all understand that in chapter 4 of Revelation we have, in the four living creatures, a universal idea of life in view of the administration of the twenty-four elders. John sees Him that was sitting "like in appearance to a stone of jasper and a sardius, and a rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald"; that is to say that God goes back to His covenant with Noah. God is going to take up creation and administer it by means of the twenty-four elders, who have had experience with God. Noah in the ark represented intelligence, and around him were found the beasts of the earth. These two thoughts are found here: the thought of God in headship, and at the same time evidences of life. We have first the thought conveyed by the eyes before, behind, all round and within; then comes praise: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come". It is a remarkable presentation of life in a universal
{16}
way in relation to God. "When the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne, who lives to the ages of ages, the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of ages; and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honour and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy will they were and they have been created". The elders can give account of things. Not only is life expressed, but the elders can say "thou hast created" and "for thy will". Thus, the first epistle of John finishes with these words: "we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life". @1 John 5:20 We can see the evidences of life with the youngest believer, for as soon as we love we are living, and the development of life is seen in understanding. We pray with the spirit and we pray with the understanding; we sing with the spirit and we sing with the understanding.
Th.D. In chapter 4, they say; in chapter 5, they sing.
J.T. Singing is connected with redemption. Chapter 4 presents worship in relation to creation; in chapter 5, it is redemption.
Ques. What are the elders¬ crowns?
J.T. In general, crowns denote what we cherish, that which has already sustained us. The two prayers given in the epistle to the Ephesians would explain these crowns. The first prayer (chapter 1: 15 - 20) has in view that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him; the second (chapter 3: 14 - 19) is that God may give us "to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man" that we may be "fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to
{17}
know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge". There is intelligence according to God. The last verse of chapter 4 of Revelation would help us to understand what the creation is to God: "*thou* hast created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created". In chapter 5 the living creatures and elders are seen together; but the living creatures are mentioned before the elders. That shows in a practical way that, at certain moments, the elder brethren should take the second place; when the service demands special energy young ones are needed: "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one" @1 John 2:14.
Rem. The elders fall, do homage and cast their crowns. What a comely attitude!
J.T. The understanding that is given to us is not in view of our own exaltation, but for the glory of God. All the understanding we have comes from God: "Of him, and through him, and for him are all things".
Rem. "For thy will".
J.T. Yes, that is developed in the epistle to the Ephesians: the good pleasure of His will, the counsel of His will and the mystery of His will. The better we know God, the more ready we are to recognise His will. These two chapters make an appeal to youthfulness among the brethren. It is not merely that the young should hear the things that are said, but that they should discern and prove them, that they may know that it is the truth. Thus the living creatures are first in chapter 5.
Rem. If I have understood aright, the four living creatures would represent the great company marked by life, and the twenty-four elders the intelligence of the company.
J.T. So that in the light of redemption we have here a new song: "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God, by thy blood, out of every tribe,
{18}
and tongue, and people, and nation, and made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall reign over the earth". It is very beautiful, this song which is sung by the living creatures and the elders together.
Ques. Do we find something analogous at the end of the book of Psalms, where there is nothing but praise?
J.T. There is indeed an interesting parallel. The psalms entitled "Instruction" are in view of leading the young into all that relates to the knowledge of God. The first of these psalms is the 32nd; and the results of all that teaching is seen in the last psalms in praise.
Rem. In verse 7 of chapter 4, the four living creatures have each a different character from the others.
J.T. There is first courage: the lion does not flee in conflict. The calf gives the idea of firmness, surefootedness. The face of a man is an allusion to intelligence, with the thought of the representation of God (among the saints, the man does not cover his head: he represents God). The flying eagle indicates that what has to be done is done immediately, whereas things often remain uncompleted. The brethren's care meetings are very useful in connection with what we have to do, what is to be adjusted, and all the Lord's matters.
Rem. The flying eagle would be on the alert to see whether there was something to bring in, or something to set aside which is not according to Christ.
J.T. The care meetings are necessary for the health of the assembly, so that things, instead of dragging on and remaining uncompleted, may be adjusted immediately.
Ques. What is to be understood by "the prayers of the saints"?
J.T. The combination of the harps and the golden bowls is very beautiful: praise and prayer.
Ques. Who are the saints?
{19}
J.T. You know. "The prayers of the saints" is a characteristic expression. In chapter 8 you have the prayers "of all saints" presented at the golden altar by the Lord Himself. "The prayers of the saints" is characteristic: it is a question of those who are saints, a beautiful expression which is applied to the people of God from old time.
Rem. They are in agreement in saying: "Holy, holy, holy".
{20}
LIFE IN THE FACE OF APOSTASY (3)
@Revelation 7: 2, 3, 17; @Revelation 11: 11
J.T. We remarked yesterday that the subject of life is found throughout the book of Revelation. We were occupied first with Christ as being the One who lives to the ages of ages and who lays His right hand upon His servant, that the ministry may be continued in a living way. We also remarked that the overcomers were encouraged, having promises as to life. The overcomer in Ephesus is promised a part in the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God. To the overcomer in Smyrna the crown of life is promised. The promise made to the overcomer in Sardis is that his name shall not be blotted out of the book of life. Overcomers are therefore regarded as appreciating the great thought of life.
Then we saw in chapters 4 and 5 that life, in a universal sense, characterises the operations of God. It speaks of four living creatures in the midst of the throne and around the throne, full of eyes before and behind. There is a beautiful bond between the living creatures and the elders who celebrate the Lamb. They sing a new song. That reminds us that our worship is to be in freshness.
In chapter 6 we see the living creatures in connection with the opening of the seals; the testimony of life is seen in every feature of the divine operations. All this reminds us that the Lord has opened for us a door which none can shut, and our activities are to be marked by spiritual life, instead of being only in outwardly correct forms. Our meetings and our movements are to be in life. As was remarked yesterday, Hezekiah said: "The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I this day: ... and we will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life, in the house of Jehovah", @Isaiah 38: 19, 20.
Another feature relative to life is presented in chapter
{21}
7, where it is a question of the "seal of the living God".
Ques. Who is this angel who ascends from the sunrising?
J.T. You have there a thought of hope, as it says at the end of the Old Testament that the Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings. You will notice that it speaks of "four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree". We are here in the presence of divine sovereignty. Nothing can happen, even adversely, without God. If He calls His elect, He creates corresponding conditions. If an extraordinary situation comes about, at that moment God has an end in view: His elect are to be saved and marked with the seal of the living God.
Ques. Why is God called the living God?
Rem. This name is set over against corruption, is it not?
J.T. The living God is often presented in the Scriptures to the Jewish believers, because the people had fallen into a dead ceremonial, which has happened today to christendom. We have to do with a living order of things; our hope is living; and Christ Himself is the living Stone.
Rem. Peter entered into this thought when he said to the Lord: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". @Matthew 16:16
J.T. The Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Jews were absorbed in an absolutely dead ceremonial; and in the face of that state of things the Lord desired His own to express what they thought of Him: "But *ye*, who do ye say that I am?" to which Peter answers. "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God".
Rem. The Thessalonians had turned from idols to serve the living and true God.
J.T. It is very easy for us to fall into routine. What we are saying would have in view to produce among us
{22}
a living state, answering to our public confession of the Lord Jesus. This thought must accompany that of the "seal of the living God", which refers to the Holy Spirit in us. There are three things which are said of the Holy Spirit in the believer: the believer is anointed, he is sealed and he has received the earnest of the Spirit in his heart; so that we are manifested as belonging to God if we have the seal of God. The anointing is in view of service; it points to dignity. The earnest of the Spirit in our hearts is our portion. We pass through this world to serve God, and belonging to God we cannot belong to any society. When the seal of the living God is spoken of, it is in view of the mark of the beast. They are sealed "upon their foreheads". "Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we shall have sealed the bondmen of our God upon their foreheads". Those who are bondmen are at God's disposal for His service. We cannot righteously belong to another master. In possessing the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts we have the means of constant enjoyment.
Rem. There is a difference between bondmen and servants.
J.T. We belong to God absolutely. He has absolute rights over us. We can well accept the position of bondmen of God, because of the enjoyment that accompanies that position. The Lord Jesus Himself took a bondman's form; if we accept that place we are in accord with Him. Here it is a question of a very exclusive company; there is only a certain number. A hundred and forty-four thousand is a considerable number, but there are only a hundred and forty-four thousand.
Ques. How has the number a hundred and forty-four thousand a present application?
J.T. It is a precious thought that we belong to a numbered company; it is not any company.
Rem. This is a sufficient number in view of administration: twelve times twelve thousand.
J.T. The number twelve lends itself to divisibility;
{23}
it can be divided by itself, by six, by four, by three, by two.
Ques. Can everyone have part in this limited number?
J.T. Evidently, it is a symbolic number that typifies that there are no more. From the standpoint of divine counsel there will not be one more than God has purposed. But in preaching the gospel we use the word 'whosoever', as it says in the last chapter of Revelation: "Let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely" @Revelation 22:17. The last part of this chapter brings out the second aspect of this truth.
It says in verse 9: "After these things I saw, and lo, a great crowd, which no one could number, out of every nation and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palm branches in their hands". In the second part of the chapter, it is not a question of what God does in putting His seal, but of what the persons do. The number is very great; no one could number them on account of their multitude. And it says that they come out of the great tribulation: "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb". It is what they have done themselves.
Ques. Is the numbering in relation to service?
J.T. They are bondmen.
H.D'A.C. The gospel that speaks most of the purpose of God is the one that often says: "Whosoever", or "let him", or again "if any one". The Lord likes us to express ourselves in this way. The Greek word means "each one".
J.T. When the gospel is presented, if anyone has the desire to be saved, he must take advantage of what is at his disposal, namely the blood of the lamb. It is to be noticed that they cry with a loud voice, saying: "Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and
{24}
to the Lamb". They proclaim the praise of God. They are so interesting to heaven that all the angels are there. We are in the presence of myriads of angels. "All the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures". The elders know who these persons are. One of them says to John: "These are they who come out of the great tribulation".
Rem. Does this crowd include the hundred and forty-four thousand of Israel?
J.T. The brethren thoroughly understand that prophetically all this applies to the future; but the principles found here have a present application. What should affect us particularly is, that God will have His number, but on the other hand there will be a multitude which it is not possible to number. In chapter 13 of Luke, someone asked the Lord: "Are such as are to be saved few in number?" @Luke 13:23 And the Lord, as if to tell him that that was not the side that he had to consider for himself, answers: "Strive with earnestness to enter in through the narrow door, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in and will not be able". @Luke 13:24
When one preaches the gospel, it is not only a matter of enlightening others, but it is important to be oneself the presentation of what one preaches. "Look on us", say Peter and John in chapter 3 of the Acts. The Lord had said to the eleven: "Make disciples of all the nations" @Matthew 28:19. I cannot help in making disciples if I am not myself a disciple. And the Lord, when asked: "Who art thou?" could Himself answer: "Altogether that which I also say to you" @John 8:25.
Rem. It is striking to see that Paul could say: "Be my imitators, even as *I* also am of Christ". @1 Corinthians 11:1
J.T. In spite of the great crowd there is abundant provision: "They shall not hunger any more, neither shall they thirst any more, nor shall the sun at, all fall on them, nor any burning heat; because the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them, and shall lead them to fountains of waters of life, and
{25}
God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes". One is touched, in reflecting on the immensity of the number, to see that God takes account of each one in particular, and that He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
A.V. The elder had already been able to say to John: "Weep not".
J.T. This book frequently mentions tears. There is a lack of tears among the brethren. I mean sensibilities with regard to what is taking place. He who will shepherd them is "the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne". He will lead them to fountains of waters of life, where there is abundance and variety; it is *fountains* of *waters* of life.
We see another feature in chapter 11: two witnesses, an adequate testimony. We have the general principle in Scripture that God never remains without witness. Here, the two witnesses suffice.
Ques. Why, when they have completed their testimony, will they be overcome by the beast?
J.T. They suffer martyrdom. These witnesses have the honour of being put to death, "where also their Lord was crucified".
Rem. Without martyrdom they would not have had a heavenly portion.
J.T. We see in chapter 20 that they have their heavenly position. "They went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them". That is an honour that attaches to the testimony, namely that we seal our testimony with our blood. But nothing happens before the appointed time, before they have completed their testimony. All is divinely controlled in the book of Revelation. The divine thought with regard to the witnesses is expressed in verse 3: "I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth". Nothing can happen to them before that time has expired.
{26}
Rem. Each day is counted, one after another, up to a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
J.T. That is a comfort for us, to know that our time of testimony is determined, and that God allows us to complete it.
Rem. It says in verse 11; "The spirit of life from God came into them".
J.T. That shows that if there is martyrdom, we are nevertheless in the hands of God. It is a question of the spirit of life which comes from God. Thus, they stood upon their feet. That shows that witness is given to the power of God in resurrection, before their ascension.
Ques. Why "two olive trees" and "two lamps"? What is this testimony?
J.T. It is an allusion to the prophet @Zechariah 4: 11 - 14. The "sons of oil" are developed according to the Spirit.
Rem. The lamp is in view of giving light.
J.T. So that the triumph is complete. It is a very encouraging passage for those who bear a testimony. "They stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them. And I heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, Come up here; and they went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them".
P.G.B. There are on the one hand those who go up (the witnesses) and on the other hand that which falls (the city).
J.T. The church does not fall; she *comes down* out of the heaven from God. In chapter 9 it speaks of a star which falls out of the heaven to the earth. In chapter 12 there is war in heaven; in verse 9 it says that the dragon was cast out. And in @Luke 10:18 the Lord says: "I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven". Here the witnesses go up; and the holy city comes down; she is in liberty. These verses give us very strikingly the character of the witnesses, first the period of their
{27}
testimony which they complete, then they are put to death; afterwards we have their triumph in resurrection and in correspondence to the Lord: "they went up to the heaven in the cloud". The things that happened to them had happened to the Lord Himself. Nothing is more to be desired on the part of a disciple than that he should correspond in every way to his Master. It is said of Christ that He was "put to death in flesh, but made alive in the Spirit" @1 Peter 3:18. The witnesses are justified in spirit, for the spirit of life came into them from God. And the voice out of the heaven is "a great voice", as if to show that the appreciation of heaven is very different from that of the beast.
Ques. Whose voice is it?
J.T. It is the voice of heaven, making known what is the thought of heaven, in contrast with the thought of the beast. It was also a voice out of heaven that had announced that Jesus was the beloved Son of God.
Rem. In chapter 21 also, it speaks of a loud voice out of the heaven.
J.T. Revelation often speaks of a great voice. We are not left in uncertainty.
Ques. Why does it speak, in verse 13, of seven thousand "names of men"?
J.T. It is a question of persons who are distinguished in the world; the idea of a name is that of a certain distinction. "The remnant were filled with fear".
Rem. All the great ones are part of these seven thousand names of men.
J.T. That is how God proceeds: He takes the beast and the false prophet before dealing with the army. The leaders are taken before the army itself is taken. The army will appear before the great white throne, while the beast and the false prophet are cast alive into the lake of fire and brimstone.
Ques. Does the number of those that fell count for God?
{28}
J.T. The seven thousand names of men are to remind us that it is dangerous to have ideas of greatness in this world. It says, in chapter 19: "Come, gather yourselves to the great supper of God, that ye may cat flesh of kings, and flesh of chiliarchs, and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses and of those that sit upon them, and flesh of all, both free and bond, and small and great".
Rem. In contrast with all those names, one loves to think of the names of the two witnesses and of those whose names are not blotted out of the book of life of the Lamb.
J.T. Their names are written in the heavens; that is enough for us. We do not wish them to be registered in the books of important men of this world. What is striking is the organisation of the great of the earth against God; and if they dethrone kings today, it is because their heart loves glory.
Rem. The two witnesses are the most distinguished of all; the "great voice" summons them to heaven, and they go up in the presence of their enemies.
J.T. Enoch was not found, because God had taken him. All these are, as the Spirit says, "unknown, and well known" @2 Corinthians 6:9. Outwardly, these witnesses were of no account. But what honour for them when the great voice called them to heaven!
Rem. The thrones of this world fall, but the throne of God and of the Lamb abides, and the thrones of the elders abide.
J.T. The lesson which we can draw from all that is that we have to await resurrection, in order to have our reward and our distinction. May we also be encouraged in the thought that all the elect are numbered and that all our days are counted, for all things are in God's hands.
{29}
LIFE IN THE FACE OF APOSTASY (4)
@Revelation 20: 4 - 6; @Revelation 22: 1 - 5, 14, 16, 17
J.T. We closed our meeting this morning with the thought of the victory which was given to the two witnesses, in that "the spirit of life from God came into them". They had been called to go up into heaven, and they went up in the presence of their enemies. It was a public victory. The assembly goes up to heaven secretly; our victory will only be apparent when Christ is manifested in glory: then we shall be manifested with Him. All the families who have part in heavenly glory are seen in the passage we have just read in chapter 20: "They lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years". It will be remarked that the thought of life comes before that of reigning. To live with Christ is greater than to reign with Him.
"I saw thrones; and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them". No allusion is made as to whose these thrones were. But it mentions later "the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God; and those who had not done homage to the beast ...". They all have part in the first resurrection. Those spoken of in the first part of this verse include the assembly, and they are raised before those named in the second part; the latter, who suffered under the beast, are not omitted in the first resurrection. Both the one and the other have part in the first resurrection.
H.D'A.C. Such are blessed and holy. It is more blessed to live with Christ than to reign with Him, did you say?
J.T. Living with Christ comes before reigning with Him. Reigning indicates having a public place of victory. The fact that they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years does not mean that their life will cease after the thousand years. These verses are a
{30}
development of what we have in chapter 11. The two witnesses are called up to heaven; they go up there, but they are not yet seen living and reigning with Christ. To live and reign with Christ a thousand years is the public and victorious manifestation of the saints.
P.G.B. Would you open up a little what it means to live with the Christ?
J.T. Those who love the Lord Jesus attach value to the word 'with'. The demoniac in @Luke 8, once he was healed, desired "to be with him"; but the Lord sent him away and told him to return to his house and bear witness to all that God had done for him. That is our position now. We are to remain where we have dishonoured God, in order to bear witness to Him. Soon, we shall be with the Lord, to live with Him, and reign with Him.
Th.D. How are we to understand: "Judgment was given to them"? It says that all judgment is given to the Son.
J.T. That is the position of the victorious saints. "Do ye not know that we shall judge angels?" @1 Corinthians 6:3 The Lord had said to the apostles, "Ye ... shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" @Matthew 19:28. And others are spoken of who will have to administer five cities or ten cities, according to their faithfulness. The present time, the time of the Lord's absence, is the period of testimony. The millennial dispensation is that of manifestation in public victory, living and reigning with Christ. "Judgment was given to them". All the glorified saints are in the Lord's hand, and He disposes of them. This verse is not the eternal state when God will dwell with men, but rather the period when God will manifest publicly the victory of Christ. Each of us will have his own distinction, and the light in us is reflected at the present time; if we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him.
Rem. Six times it says that the period of the reign is a thousand years.
{31}
Rem. It is the time appointed by God for the manifestation of the glory of Christ, the grand display of the day to come.
J.T. It is like the seventh day of this world's history. "They shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years". Life will be seen in its full fruitfulness and in all its glory. It speaks in @Romans 5 of those who reign in life by One, Jesus Christ. It will be seen then that we all depend on Him for our life. This thought should have the effect of causing us to accept a small place down here, in obscurity and suffering. Peter asked the Lord: "Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee; what then shall happen to us?" The Lord answers: "Every one who has left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit life eternal", @Matthew 19: 27 and 29. We are very slow to accept the fulness of what the Spirit says, when He speaks to us of the glories of the world to come. The period of a thousand years is a fairly long time; it is not eternity, but a fairly long time.
Rem. It is the longest period in contrast with a day.
Ques. Are the priests only for the thousand years?
J.T. It is an official kingdom. The idea of priesthood means that they are qualified to take up the things of God and His interests. They are priests of God and of the Christ.
Ques. Does that support the thought of the worship of God and of Christ?
J.T. The idea is rather that God can have confidence in them. The position of Aaron and his sons was to keep the charge of Jehovah. They were to draw near to God; they attended to the law, and it says that the priest's lips should keep knowledge. The Lord Himself sits as Priest upon His throne, and we shall be thus linked with Him in the millennial reign. It is important to remember that it is a period that surpasses in length
{32}
the life of the oldest man before the flood. It is simply the idea of a time sufficient for what God has in hand. We live in man's day; that will be the day of "our Lord and of his Christ". The devil will be set aside for a thousand years; there will be no obstacle, no hindrance to the manifestation by God of the glory of Christ. It says that Satan will be bound for a thousand years (verse 2). In every previous dispensation Satan has had liberty. But in that dispensation he is bound, and God is free to display during a thousand years the great results of the death of Christ.
H.D'A.C. That will be a wonderful period, for Christ will fill the whole scene with His thoughts and the thoughts of God every day. The nations have been fed for a long time on the thoughts of men; but for a thousand years they will have the thoughts of Christ. Now the thoughts of Christ will not pass away.
J.T. The thoughts of Christ will be disseminated by means of the saints. The epistle to the Ephesians says that the assembly increases "to a holy temple in the Lord" @Ephesians 2:21. Thus the thoughts of Christ will be seen in an intelligible and intelligent way by means of the members of His body. But if I do not lay hold on that now, how shall I be able to display it then?
H.D'A.C. If instead of seeking to have the thoughts of Christ, I read the newspapers for example, I shall be incapable of any administration whatever.
J.T. You view this question very practically, Mr. C. It is a question of understanding the thoughts of God; the elders can explain them. The saints in the millennial day will be used to interpret the thoughts of God to the nations. How sad it would be if someone came to you for an explanation, and you answered: I do not know! There is nothing of that with the elders; they always know. Those named in the first part of verse 4 are qualified to receive judgment. If we understood better what is soon going to be manifested, we should judge ourselves and our whole life would be changed.
{33}
O.T. "They that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse; and they that turn the many to righteousness as the stars, for ever and ever", @Daniel 12: 3. Will that be the portion of the saints at that moment?
J.T. That is a little different from what we have here. It is a question of the wise, a class of which we spoke a little yesterday evening, those who understand the psalms entitled "Instruction", while here it speaks of those who have been "beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God".
Rem. In @Daniel 7, no one is seen sitting upon the thrones. But here it says who they are who are sitting upon them.
J.T. I believe it is high time to prepare for the great display. How shall we shine in that display? Each one of us will be able to consider the Lord Jesus, and say: It is my joy to live in association with Him. Then there is another thing: it speaks of those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and who had not received the mark on their forehead and hand. These things are mentioned as being in their favour.
Rem. Our measure of faithfulness in the present day will be our measure in the glory.
J.T. Just so.
Rem. The Lord will honour His own in the measure in which they honour Him today.
P.G.B. Why does the beast put his mark on their forehead and on their hand?
J.T. The one who has the mark on his forehead shows that he is devoted intelligently to the thing. The mark on the hand indicates that he is going to do all he can in relation to this thing.
H.D'A.C. At the present time, everything in the world is preparing for the coming of the great man of tomorrow, whom everyone is awaiting, except the saints.
Rem. *You* mean the antichrist.
J.T. He will be great according to this world. We
{34}
understand how eager the enemy will be to have those beheaded who do not acknowledge him. But it is remarkable to see how God will set aside all that is opposed to the manifestation of the glory of Christ. Satan will be bound, and the rest of the dead will not live until the thousand years are completed. There will be a great influence that will restrain evil. "They shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years". They will be persons in sympathy with all those who are on earth. In chapter 16: 8, 9, it speaks of a great heat that burns men, but in chapter 20 the priests are sympathetic persons.
Chapter 22 shows, under the symbol of a river, how life will prevail in the day to come (verses 1, 2). Life is continuous, in the river which represents the influence of life. It is very touching to think that we ourselves shall be used in this blessed service. It is very practical. There will be perfect order: there will be a street, only one street. Life will prevail; the influence of the river will extend everywhere. Never defiled, it will be bright as crystal. The effect of all this should be to make us transparent in our relations with one another. We are tested as to the way we behave the one to the other now.
Rem. The river is already flowing now ("out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" @John 7:38).
Rem. The twelve fruits of the tree point to abundance and variety.
J.T. And the leaves of the tree are for healing of the nations: they go to the ends of the earth in the service of God. "And no curse shall be any more; and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him, and they shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads. And night shall not be any more, and no need of a lamp, and light of the sun; for the Lord God shall shine upon them, and they shall reign to the ages of ages". We pass from the millennial reign to the ages of ages.
{35}
Ques. Can it be said that all the holy principles of the millennium enter into eternity?
J.T. The thing is continuous "to the ages of ages". We read in chapter 21: "I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". That is what the assembly is to be eternally, "adorned for her husband". In verse 10, John was carried away in the Spirit and set on a great and high mountain, and he was shown the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God. That is the bride, the Lamb's wife, the wife of the One who suffered (verse 9), while what she is eternally is indicated at the beginning of this chapter 21, "a bride adorned for her husband".
Rem. She is not pointed out as "the Lamb's wife" at the beginning of the chapter.
J.T. The thought of the Lamb's wife is not carried into eternity; it is simply a matter of what is millennial. The expression "for her husband" indicates the eternal relation. In her millennial glory, "the Lamb's wife" is the great vessel of light for all.
Th.D. In the gospel it says that "he will ... make them recline at table, and coming up will serve them" @Luke 12:37. Here "his servants shall serve him".
J.T. It is to indicate the greatness of the vessel of administration, what God will be for the universe. For that, God needs servants. There will be no unfaithfulness in the service: "His servants shall serve him, and they shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads". Verse 17 brings out the beauty of the golden chain that encircles this book: "He that will, let him take the water of life freely". The water of life is at the disposal of all.
Rem. Verses 18 and 19 have a very solemn voice to the modernists. Many things have been added to and taken from what God has written.
{36}
Rem. You extend that to the whole of Scripture, do you not?
J.T. It says in @Proverbs 30, "Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar" @Proverbs 30:6, and all liars have their part without.
{37}
THE SERVICE OF THE SPIRIT AS PRESENTED IN CORINTHIANS (1)
@1 Corinthians 2: 6 - 16; @1 Corinthians 3: 16 - 23
J.T. I thought we might look into the place the Spirit has in the epistle to the Corinthians. It is said of the Lord that He was put to death in flesh, but made alive in the Spirit. It is possible to express many different thoughts; however, the Spirit alone makes these things clear. The Lord said: "When *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth", @John 16: 13. The Spirit demonstrates things. To say is one thing; to *show* is another. Paul says: "It has been *shown* to me concerning you", @1 Corinthians 1: 11. Paul might have been informed, but the thing had been shown (or manifested) to him. When a thing is shown it is clearly established; then the remedy must be found. The physician's diagnosis indicates what the patient is suffering from; then it is a question of knowing what is the appropriate remedy. It says: "The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh", @Galatians 5: 17. If in any one of us the flesh lusts against the Spirit, it is very distressing. The epistle to the Corinthians was written to deal with such a state found collectively.
Ques. Is lusting against the Spirit more than resisting the Spirit?
J.T. To lust is to exalt nature; we see that in Reuben. It is the impetuosity of nature, flesh being given free course, annulling the action of the Spirit. That is what took place at Corinth. Chapter 5 shows that a bad state of things existed. We see in the first chapter that they were divided.
Ques. Was that the result of the activities of the flesh?
J.T. Yes. The Corinthians had written to Paul with regard to many questions, but they had omitted to do so with regard to the most serious question. Chapter
{38}
3: 1 exposes their state; they were in Christ, but only "babes in Christ"; they were carnal. There were there emulation, dissensions, evil works. Paul, in sending this letter, desires to deal with their state. It often happens that a visiting brother is not aware of the elements that are troubling a gathering, those elements remaining hidden. The Corinthians had not written to the apostle about their divisions.
Rem. But Paul knew where they were in that matter.
J.T. Those of the house of Chloe had informed him. Chapter 5 merely relates what was happening, but in chapter 1 the apostle speaks of what he had ascertained.
Rem. If they had been really babes, they would have made progress.
J.T. Scripture speaks of children in two different senses. In one, it refers to normal childhood, to those who are capable of receiving impressions, who are transparent and simple. The Lord placed a little child in the midst of the disciples. Speaking to the Father of His disciples, the Lord said: "That thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes" @Matthew 11:25. In the other sense, it refers to what is abnormal. Being a man it is a shame if I have only the intelligence of a babe. Paul says: "When I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child" @1 Corinthians 13:11.
Ques. Does the renewing of our mind make men of *us*?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Is it the same, if one walks in newness of life and serves in newness of spirit?
J.T. Yes. The Corinthians were depriving themselves of a great blessing, by reason of their divisions. In chapter 2, the Spirit is presented, not because they were marked by the Spirit, but because it was He whom they needed: "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him",
{39}
@1 Corinthians 2: 9. We deprive ourselves of these blessings if we do not make room for the Spirit, that He may reveal them to us. In verse 6 the apostle says: "But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to nought". The Corinthians were not grown men; they were therefore losing the blessing of what the Spirit makes known.
Rem. While having many gifts, they were gaining no profit from them.
J.T. From the divine side they had everything. God had held nothing back from them. In chapter 1: 4 - 9, we have the objective side and that can be said normally of the assembly, but their state did not allow them to enjoy the things. The apostle indeed saw the danger; he knew what the hindrance was; that is why he says: "I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified".
Every city has its own characteristics. A city is a concentration of evil; this takes a different form in each city. God presents His testimony to each city in view of helping it with regard to its particular character of evil. Corinth was renowned: it was a Greek city marked by Greek wisdom and also by great slackness. It was also an architectural city whose fame comes down to our day. God had all that in view when Paul ministered at Corinth. He says: "My word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in God's power". The apostle had worked for months in that city, and that was the attitude he took, but in spite of his faithfulness the same thing as to which he warned them took place after his departure; there were parties; one claimed to be of Apollos, another of Cephas, another of Paul. The Greeks were always marked by that spirit; they wanted great leaders. We see in chapter 5 that all that was accompanied by another thing, fornication. How
{40}
could he have unfolded to them the great thoughts that he had in his mind if they were in that state?
We must be perfect -- developed -- to have the mind of grown men. If we are not guided by the Spirit, we shall go from bad to worse, even to fornication, which is a terrible state.
Rem. Their state was worse than that of the nations.
J.T. Paul says: "I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able; for ye are yet carnal. For whereas there are among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man? For when one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are ye not men?" That was the state of things existing at Corinth. They were excluding what is of the Spirit of God; they were not grown men; so that Paul could not speak to them of the "hidden wisdom". That hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory, operates in relation to God's world where there are men fully developed. The world which surrounds us today is the result of the development of man according to flesh. Its princes are supposed to be wise men, but they know nothing of the hidden wisdom, for it is found in the Lord Jesus, whom they crucified. Nothing brought the foolishness of this world into evidence so much as the crucifixion of Christ.
Ques. Is wisdom presented in @Proverbs 8 as an attribute of God?
J.T. It is inherent in God.
Rem. We read: "Jehovah possessed me" @Proverbs 8:22 and "I was brought forth" verses 24,25.
J.T. The expression "brought forth" in verse 25 implies pain; it is evident that such a thought could not apply to a Person in absolute deity. It is an allusion to an attribute of God which was brought into evidence at the beginning of His operations. When it speaks of wisdom in Proverbs, it is in relation to the earth. When the Lord was here, He was the expression of the wisdom
{41}
of God. He Himself said: "Wisdom has been justified of all her children" @Luke 7:35.
Rem. I thought that could only apply to the Lord in the sphere of revelation.
J.T. That is right as regards @Proverbs 8. Verse 12 is very important: "I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find the knowledge which cometh of reflection". Prudence is also regarded as a person. The opposite to wisdom is the foolish woman. We must have an open mind to understand the Scriptures. One can then grasp better the force of the Spirit's service at Corinth, "for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God". It may be that "the depths of God" include @Proverbs 8, but the Spirit of God searches the depths. In contrast to that, it speaks in @Revelation 2 of the "depths of Satan" @Revelation 2:24; we must keep away from them (spiritism or wicked things of that sort). And it is blessed to know that we have within us Him who knows the things of God (verse 11). Scripture contains a general outline of what God desires that we should know, and there are depths in it which the Spirit of God alone can search.
Rem. The Lord said of the Spirit: "He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" @John 16:14.
J.T. The Spirit knows all things, and He presents what is necessary according to the moment, as it says in Revelation: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies" @Revelation 2:7. If we do not accept what He says, we are opposing Him. What He is saying now He had not said hitherto, and we have to keep it. Scripture is the touchstone for all that is said. In verse 12, the emphasis is on the word "we": we have received by spiritual means.
Ques. "Whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak", @John 16: 13. What has He heard?
J.T. That shows what a place of humble dependence the Holy Spirit has taken, corresponding to that which the Son has taken. Both the Son and the Spirit have taken an inferior position, in connection with the
{42}
dispensation of grace. There is one God, the Father; the Son and the Spirit have taken inferior positions, in order to make God known. "The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing". @John 5:19 That does not mean that the Son is inferior to the Father (He is not), but that He has *taken* in manhood an inferior place, in order to make Him known. The Spirit takes a corresponding place; He does not speak from Himself, but says what He hears. All conies from God, but communicated by the Spirit. No creature is great enough for that.
Rem. The Father has been revealed in the Son.
J.T. Time fails us, otherwise we might have been able to consider the temple in chapter 3, and the body in chapter 12, and see the place that the Spirit occupies in them.
Ques. Can it be said that the Son has taken an inferior position in order to carry out the will of God?
J.T. Yes. The declaration of Scripture is very strong: He "emptied himself, taking a bondman's form" @Philippians 2:7.
{43}
THE SERVICE OF THE SPIRIT AS PRESENTED IN CORINTHIANS (2)
@1 Corinthians 12: 1 - 31
J.T. This morning we were occupied with the Spirit in relation to the general state of the Corinthians.
The Corinthians were depriving themselves of the communications of the Spirit and the apostle says that he had to speak to them as to babes in Christ. He describes the state of babes in chapter 3: 3. There was envy among them and they were keeping the precious communications of the Spirit away; it is the same in every meeting where there is a division; the Spirit is grieved, or quenched.
Rem. To quench the Spirit is a graver matter than to grieve Him.
J.T. If the Spirit is quenched, there cannot be any direct communication, and even if there is a certain liberty of the Spirit, there cannot be any growth. The epistle should have the effect of leading the saints to judge themselves; that is why the apostle says: "Our heart is expanded. Ye are not straitened in us"; he earnestly desired that their heart might also expand itself, for an answering recompense to him.
Chapter 3 speaks of the Spirit in relation to the temple (verse 16). If we recognise that the saints have the character of the temple of God, we enquire there and are enlightened; we learn how difficulties must be faced and everything becomes clear to us. We said this morning that the Spirit shows us things. On the day of Pentecost, He brought demonstration as to sin and as to judgment. The question was between Christ and the Jews; they disputed that He was the Messiah. He was the Messiah, the Christ; the Jews denied Him and put Him to death; @John 16: 8 - 10. The presence down here of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven showed who He was. The disciples received the Spirit; thus
{44}
we enquire in the temple and all becomes clear. It says in this epistle: "There exist divisions among you ... . For there must also be sects among you, that the approved may become manifest among you" @1 Corinthians 11:19. Then, the fruit of the Spirit will be manifested; so that in local difficulties, the divine means consist in enquiring in the temple, as the apostle says: "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you"? (chapter 3 . 16).
Rem. It is not necessary to ask a brother what is to be done, if we have the Spirit to teach us.
J.T. That remark is important. If anyone has the gift of wisdom, it is evident we should go to that one. Government in the house of God is a gift, as we see in chapter 12: 28. The gifts are set in the assembly, not in a local but a general way, so that they are exercised for all the saints, wherever they are. One can approach those who have these gifts. Nevertheless, what our brother says is very important; the assembly is, in character, the temple of God and it is there that one can enquire. You will find nothing in the temple to discredit the saints. The psalmist speaks of one who enquires, who goes into the sanctuaries of God and who then understands things; @Psalm 73: 17.
Ques. Simeon "came in the Spirit into the temple" @Luke 2:27. Is that an example of one who goes into the temple to enquire?
J.T. Yes, and then the little Child was brought in.
Rem. In the temple we find the light of the thoughts of God.
Rem. Simeon expressed the thoughts of God in a wonderful way when he took the little Child into his arms.
J.T. In @1 Corinthians 6, it is a question of the Spirit of God in relation to purification, another important side of the truth. Purification and sanctification are the service of the Spirit of God; then, in the same chapter, it speaks of the body of the believer as being "the temple
{45}
of the Holy Spirit"@1 Corinthians 6:19. The chapter brings out how our bodies are to be kept in view of such an honour.
Then in chapter 7, the Spirit is presented in connection with the important subject of marriage. Paul says in the last verse: "But she is happier if she so remain, according to my judgment; but I think that I also have God's Spirit" @1 Corinthians 7:40. This verse shows clearly the difference we are to make between the judgment of an experienced and spiritual brother, and the direct commandment of the Lord. There are things as to which the Lord has not given us a definite commandment; they are of a kind to test our spirituality. Paul gives his own judgment, but he declares distinctly that it is not the commandment of the Lord. There are other things that the Lord *orders*. Do the brethren follow my thought?
Ques. Do you mean that the Lord commands certain things, but there are others as to which Paul, as being spiritual, gives his opinion?
J.T. The Lord leaves certain things indefinite, as to which we arrive at the truth by experience and spirituality. Paul says: "But concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord"@1 Corinthians 7:25; however, he gives his own judgment. I think we should specially note this part of the truth.
Ques. Is it not remarkable that although the judgment was Paul's, and not a direct command from the Lord, it is nevertheless mentioned in the Scriptures?
J.T. Yes, it is recorded in Scripture, but as being Paul's judgment; it is not a commandment of the Lord; however, it should have great weight with us. A spiritual brother can discern things, although there is perhaps no passage of Scripture concerning them; the young should recognise that. Marriage is a subject that is always and everywhere difficult. Many questions arise with regard to it, as to which the Spirit says nothing. What we do shows where we are in our souls. It may be that a brother in fellowship marries a christian who is not in fellowship, or vice versa; we could not say
{46}
that that is "in the Lord". The choice should be made "in the Lord", which involves the fellowship. It says of a sister, that she is free to be married to whom she will, "*only* in the Lord". As to choice, a certain latitude is given; but in every case it is to be "in the Lord"; the fellowship must be recognised. Fellowship gives the idea of association. If a person in fellowship is married to a person who is not, that is not "in the Lord". Is that clear to the brethren?
Ques. All kinds of questions and various cases come up with regard to marriage; what should we do as to it?
J.T. Whatever one does, one will show what one is spiritually. We can therefore recognise the force of Paul's remark: "But I think that I also have God's Spirit" @1 Corinthians 7:40. It is only with regard to difficult problems of that kind that the apostle uses such expressions as to himself. It brings out the importance of the judgment of spiritual men and women. It is certain they would say nothing that is contrary to the Holy Spirit.
Chapter 12 speaks more than any other of the service of the Holy Spirit. It begins with an allusion to ministry in the assembly, how a man speaks to the saints. It is possible for us to test whether he is speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, or otherwise. The allusion brings us back to the time when the believers came out of paganism. It may be that some were not believers, and the saints, in that case, had been exposed to their misdeeds; so the apostle says: "I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in the power of the Spirit of God, says, Curse on Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit". It is certainly important to be able to discern whether or not someone is speaking by the Spirit. It says: "If any speak -- as oracles of God" @1 Peter 4:11. The one who speaks by the Spirit has a certain authority and does it with power.
Rem. The hearers, if they are spiritual, will be in a position to judge if someone speaks in the power of the Spirit.
{47}
J.T. We hardly expect, in our day, to find someone having an evil spirit and speaking in the assembly, but it may be that someone gets up of his own will, so that the others will be able to discern that he is not speaking by the Spirit.
Rem. Although it may not be an evil spirit, it might be in the activity of the flesh. That is also to be feared.
J.T. Chapter 14 shows that the gift of prophecy is very important. A prophetic ministry judges things among the saints. A brother may not be eloquent in his way of expressing himself, but perhaps he will edify the saints; therefore he is not to be despised. Ministry which edifies is of value and should not be despised; it is God's provision, and it grieves the Lord to despise it. We see the effect of prophetic ministry in chapter 14: 24, 25. The assembly is the temple of God. In chapter 3, in the original, the word temple is not preceded by the article (temple, not the temple); it is characteristic. The apostle could not present the thought of the house at Corinth, because the state of the believers was too bad. The house of God is a place where joy is tasted, and when the state of a local company is bad, the thought of the house is not understood; there is no rejoicing. In the house there is music and dancing; but that is impossible where the saints are not together in affection. The house is an attractive place for young christians. In @Matthew 13, the Lord leaves one house to go into another, indicating that He was leaving the Jewish state of things to enter into a sphere where, in the liberty of the Spirit, we find music and dancing. The houses of the saints should bear that character. We should speak "to ourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs" @Ephesians 5:19; we should be filled with the Spirit.
Rem. In the house there is affection, and in the temple praises.
J.T. There is also light and intelligence; wherefore we read; "One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will
{48}
I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire of him in his temple", @Psalm 27: 4. One enquires in view of being enlightened and having intelligence, but that all depends on the presence of the Spirit in the assembly.
In chapter 12 the three divine Persons are in view, and the Spirit is mentioned first. The Spirit had been excluded at Corinth, so that after having said that it is "the same God who operates all things in all", the apostle comes back to the subject of the Spirit, in verse 7. Attention is drawn to His sovereign activities. Then we read: "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ". The expression "*the Christ*" is an allusion to the assembly. It is a general, not a local, thought. The local assembly should bear that character, that of the Anointed. The anointing gives the saints a certain dignity. When the state is bad, there will probably be less dignity in our relations one with the other.
"For also in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body". What a touching appeal to our hearts! All have been baptised; this dignity belongs to every child of God, to those who have the Spirit. Here the baptism is an act of the Spirit. It says in the gospel of John that the Lord baptises with the Spirit. That suggests that each one is placed in the assembly, each keeping his individuality, but all being put together into one assembly, and not constrained to go in, for all have been given to drink of one Spirit. Each one is to drink thus; drinking is a figure of satisfaction; that means that I enjoy my position and my part in the body of Christ.
Ques. Does that correspond to the rivers of living water?
J.T. Yes, but the emphasis here is on the word 'one'; there is "one Spirit", which produces unity and gives
{49}
satisfaction. Having drunk of that Spirit, one would not wish to be in any other place, for in the assembly one finds life, and joy, and satisfaction.
The last part of this chapter develops the thought of the body. Christianity is not a clerical system; it was never supposed to be such a thing, nor was the local assembly ever formed to be led by one man. Each one is to have his part, for it is "one body". The figure of the body serves to show how entirely dependent we are upon one another. The human body depends upon all its members. Difficulty arises when the foot begins to speak of itself (verse 15); that is a member that isolates itself. What is suggested is, that a brother might think that because he has not been called upon to act in an official way, he has no right to be there. The danger is in brethren isolating themselves in their mind. If I take that attitude, I am abandoning the place which God has assigned to me in the body.
Rem. It is important to remain in the place where the Lord has set us.
J.T. The apostle says: "If the whole body were an eye, where the hearing?" I am not in the body as seems good to me, but as it has pleased God (verse 18).
Then in verse 21, we have a different individual. "The eye cannot say to the hand, I have not need of thee". If I speak like that, if I act as if I had no need of such and such a brother, I call in question the whole body of Christ.
Rem. And also the sovereignty of God.
Rem. It is remarkable that it should be said that God has placed each member in the body.
J.T. If we do not take account of the disposition God has made in the body, we rebel against the sovereignty of God. That is like cutting off one's hand. Modern surgery declares that certain members of the human body are not necessary. We may be assured that God did not create them for nothing; they have their function, though we may not know what it is.
{50}
It is the same as regards a brother or a sister. They may both appear useless to us, but the Lord knows what He wishes them to do. It is serious to say: "I have not need of thee".
The Spirit proceeds to show us what parts of the body are necessary, those which we esteem the less (verse 23); that shows that if love were active among us we should esteem the weak. The disciples might have said that a young ass was not a suitable animal for the Lord to use, but they put their garments on it; they adorned it and made it suitable, so that the Lord could ride thereon; we ought likewise to cover the less honourable members. If a brother is lacking in the way of expressing himself, for example, why not help him?
What God has set in the assembly is the final thought. We should distinguish, in verse 28, between the body and the assembly. Gifts are set in the assembly. There is one thought attaching to the gift -- that it is universal, that is to say, for the whole assembly.
The chapter finishes with the suggestion that we should earnestly desire the greater gifts. "And yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence", the way of love. Chapter 13 describes what love is and we read that it *never* fails.
{51}
LIFE AMONG THE SAINTS
@Romans 6: 4; @Romans 8: 1 - 10; @Romans 12: 1
I wish to speak of life. The idea of life is found in Genesis chapter 1; it is at first vegetable life, which is brought in on the third day of creation. It says that "the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in them, after their kind" @Genesis 1:12. Life is indicated in the seed which is found in the fruit of the tree. The Lord uses this feature of life (vegetable life), to speak of Himself, under the figure of a grain of wheat: "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit", @John 12: 24. After having brought in vegetable life, God made the lights, on the fourth day: "the great light to rule the day" @Genesis 1:16, placed by God in the expanse of the heavens, is a figure of Christ in glory. Then, on the fifth day, we have animal life. These two features of life -- vegetable life and animal life -- are applied to believers.
The highest thought relating to life is life in man. Man obtained life in a different way from the lower creation: "Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul".
In the epistle to the Romans, we find exactly this feature of life. In the first passage we read, it speaks of walking in newness of life; this follows from the raising of Christ from among the dead by the glory of the Father. What a wonderful truth is presented to us in the resurrection of Christ! "... in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so *we* also should walk in newness of life". In Christ, the believer has life, and his practical life results from the fact that He has been raised. The expression "in newness of life" indicates that until then there had been nothing like it; it is some
{52}
thing new, the first feature of life that can be considered in the believer: "We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life". It appeared in Jesus; we have the life of Jesus, but it is a life altogether new. When this epistle was read in the assembly at Rome, the believers must have understood that this new life differed from every other kind of life in Rome, and they must have wondered how they could realise this newness of life; each one could reflect that in all that he did, his deportment ought to be different from what it had been up till then. Thus the christian takes on an absolutely new character. It will not be a life without interest; the believer will be happy in that life. He will not be able to think that to be different from the world is a loss of joy; on the contrary, he will enjoy true happiness, and will enjoy it in newness of life, so that at Rome there will be a testimony for God, in persons who are different from others.
In chapter 8, the apostle speaks of "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus", not the spirit of life at Rome; the idea is that the life is in a Person, "in Christ Jesus". "The Spirit of life" is something inward, something which one enjoys; it is only intelligible to those who have it, but it has a powerful effect: "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death". It is "the Spirit of life"; but in verse 10 it says "the Spirit life". It is necessary to distinguish between these two thoughts. "The Spirit life on account of righteousness" is a power in the soul to practise righteousness; so that a christian does not practise righteousness in a legal way, but in a spiritual way. There is with the believer something that corresponds to God, in the practice of righteousness: "If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him", @1 John 2: 29. The Spirit being life is a constant power to make us
{53}
practise righteousness. And righteousness is now practised in power where the body had been in bondage to sin. God is thus glorified where He had been dishonoured. That is an important characteristic in relation to a local assembly. The persons of a local assembly belong to their locality: the Corinthians belonged to Corinth, the Thessalonians to Thessalonica. In a local assembly the persons glorify God where they had dishonoured Him; they manifest in that way that there is in them the evidence of life. They walk "in newness of life" (chapter 6: 4), their mind being governed by a law, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" (chapter 8: 2), and the Spirit in them leads them to practise righteousness (chapter 8: 10). Thus believers are practically in testimony.
The epistle to the Corinthians is the counterpart of the epistle to the Romans. The epistle to the Romans places believers in justification of life: the boards of the tabernacle are set up on the bases of silver; the teaching of the epistle to the Romans constitutes believers as these boards, so that they are viewed as standing together erect in the testimony. The epistle to the Romans does not unfold, in a general way, the truth of the assembly; it is true that chapter 12 alludes to the body, but the whole truth of the assembly is not developed there, while the epistle to the Corinthians views the same persons as placed in the assembly; that is the collective side: the boards are in place and the tabernacle is set up. The saints at Corinth are called "the assembly of God which is in Corinth" @1 Corinthians 1:2; @2 Corinthians 2:1. And the principles of which we have spoken are put into practice by the saints collectively, by the assembly of God at Corinth. The epistle to the Romans develops a living state of things among the saints, even as regards sacrifice, of which the thought is presented in chapter 12 -- a living sacrifice. The Lord had said: "He that follows me ... shall have the light of life", @John 8: 12. He who follows Jesus reaches the sphere of life; he has
{54}
"the light of life". When down here, the Lord Jesus was the light of men, because in Him was life. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" @John 1:4. He is now in heaven; the Holy Spirit has come down: and life can be seen to develop with the believer. Life is in evidence: "*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren", @1 John 3: 14. If a soul follows the Lord Jesus, it will be led into this sphere of life, and it will not be satisfied until it has reached it. If there is a living state of things in a meeting, it may be small, others will be attracted; sitting down alongside those who are living, they will breathe a living atmosphere and will get the gain of a living service. The apostle attaches no value to religious practices; the very bodies of the saints are living.
Along with the subject of life and righteousness, the epistle to the Romans teaches us priesthood, not as it is understood in religious circles, for all believers are priests. The apostle Peter speaks of "a holy priesthood" and of "a kingly priesthood" @1 Peter 2:5,9 that does not belong only to a certain category of christians, but to all, so that there is a living state of things: we serve "in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter" (@Romans 7: 6), and at the end of this same chapter the thought of the law is again presented: "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law" (verse 25). Every brother or sister assumes that responsibility. You see how the idea of priesthood is found again in these passages, priesthood being carried out in the service of God in a living and spiritual way. So we are not bound by customs; it is evident that there must be order, and the apostle insists, in the epistle to the Corinthians, on suitable order in the assembly, which is of great importance, since the assembly is the expression of divine order, for God is a God of order; but we must be marked by life, each one acting in a living way and with intelligence: "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law".
We are therefore exhorted in chapter 12 to present
{55}
our bodies as a living sacrifice. Each believer learns individually to act with the others, so as to be together in the service of God. Besides, each one of us has something to offer: each one of us has a body. All are presented, as it says, "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service". Intelligent service is priestly service: "The priest's lips should keep knowledge", @Malachi 2: 7. The tenth chapter of the epistle to the Corinthians is addressed to intelligent persons; we gather in assembly as intelligent persons. The epistle to the Romans shows the responsibility of each brother, and lays the basis for the collective action outlined in the epistle to the Corinthians: in chapter 11 the saints are gathered in assembly; being gathered intelligently, they exercise each one their function in the assembly; it is a collective action. God is worshipped in spirit and in truth. Thus, dear brethren, we are formed into a living organism. The twelfth chapter of Romans speaks of "one body in Christ"; that is what gives it its dignity; it is not a human organisation, but one body in Christ: "As in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office; thus we, being many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other". According to the epistle to the Corinthians, we have all been baptised in the power of one Spirit into one body.
The service of God is carried on therefore in a living and intelligent way. That is what I had in mind, that there should be among the saints a living state of things, that God may be worshipped in spirit and in truth.

DEFECTION AND RESTORATION OF A LEADER
@John 21:1 - 19; @Matthew 28: 16 - 20
The passage we have read in John shows that the Lord is always supreme. Although His own may have departed from Him, He remains the Master; and the defection of the saints provides Him with a fresh opportunity to manifest Himself. It is to be noted that the thought of a manifestation is mentioned before the defection had taken place; so it says in the first verse that "Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples", and in verse 14: "This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples". At the beginning of this chapter, the manner in which Jesus manifested Himself is indicated; it says, "he manifested himself thus", and the manifestation took the form of correcting His own; while in verse 14 the manifestation is mentioned to stress the fact that it was the third time that Jesus had been manifested to His own, and the failures of the people of God become the occasion for the service of the divine Persons. The fact is also to be noted that when there has been failure, adjustment must always follow before service can be resumed.
It says in Matthew that "some doubted", and although their number was incomplete (eleven instead of twelve), the Lord did not stop to adjust that defect, but continued, saying: "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth". In these last days the Lord would teach us that we must go forward in all circumstances; if some are missing, we must pursue and go on, for the Lord is going on, whatever happens. That is what has characterised God from the beginning. The failure of Adam and Eve only served to bring out new features. God has gone on.
To return to @John 21, it is to be noted that the
{57}
defection was with the principal servants. Simon Peter and Thomas are seen together. Those who fail have the tendency to be together until they are restored. We often see persons who have turned aside get together when there is an attack to be made on the testimony. Another very sad feature comes to light: that is that the chief in service becomes the leader in error. Peter leads the disciples into a false path. He says: "I go to fish". And the others answer: "We also come with thee". It is quite true that we ought to follow our leaders, to obey them, to be subject to them, and considering the issue of their conversation, to imitate their faith. But in the passage which says that, it is also added: "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come", @Hebrews 13: 8. It is He alone whom we can follow with absolute confidence.
What comes to light here is that the Lord did not allow them to have success in their failure. It is a great mercy, if we fail, that we are not allowed to achieve our end, and that we are ready to receive correction. Judas was able to succeed in his path of departure, and alas! many others since then. In our days there are many who have turned aside in their own path, and they have not been recovered. It is very solemn when God allows us to attain our end in following a path of error. How striking it is that David was allowed to number Israel! But the avenues to the conscience are near to those who are to be restored: David had a prophet, Gad. It was a mercy from God who, by means of Gad, reached David's conscience.
So here, the Lord quickly found a way of reaching the conscience and heart of His disciples. It says, "And early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore"; but it adds that "the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus". The circumstances bring out how easily one disciple may displace another in leadership. Generally the apostle John occupies the second place with relation to Peter; but here John reaches the
{58}
first place, which shows that the one who excels in love has always the advantage. He had not made excessive profession of love for Christ; but everything shows that he had more love for Christ than Peter.
The Lord said to them: "Children, have ye anything to eat?" That word 'children' shows that the Lord was not regarding them as erring disciples. He said: "Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find". Then they cast it. The Lord addresses us as 'children', not as erring disciples, which establishes confidence and renews the link of affection. Many of our brethren are easier to recover through the affections than the conscience; the conscience must be reached before final adjustment, but the affections are more ready to receive appeals.
"That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord". John has the first place and Peter is content to take the second. John says: "It is the Lord". The one who has discernment enough to see that it was the Lord is the one who has the first place. The position of a servant is never final; one such who leads well today might not do so tomorrow. John said: "It is the Lord". That was precisely the light that was wanting at that moment. If we can discern the Lord, the whole scene will be immediately clarified for us.
Simon Peter, having heard that it was the Lord, does not take the place of obedience to a leader, but occupies afresh the first place. It says: "Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it was the Lord, girded his overcoat on him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea". He did not wait for the boat. John himself got into the boat. It says in verse 8, that "the other disciples came in the small boat"; it was an auxiliary boat, no doubt. Peter did not wait for the boat, and he became leader once more. Leadership among us is the result of moral qualities, not of what is official.
The Lord can bring out that which really existed in
{59}
them, but which was obscured for the moment. He says: "Cast the net at the right side of the ship". In these circumstances the Lord gives us every advantage. The right side is always an advantage. When Peter had to do with the Lord in other circumstances similar to these (@Luke 5), he reasoned a moment. The Lord had said to him: "Draw out into the deep water and let down your nets for a haul". At the word of the Lord he let down the net, which broke on account of the great quantity of fishes. But here he did not reason; he did not call the Lord's word in question. Together they realised the power that belonged to Him, and the power of the net, for "though there were so many, the net was not rent". So when the Lord would bring us back into the right path, He knows how to use the latent power which is in us. It is a great encouragement for an erring disciple, to see that there is in him a power which will enable him to resist that which is not according to the Lord, and to recover himself.
I desire now to draw your attention to the position of the Lord in these circumstances. "Early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore". He is on well-known ground. When one is on the water, one does not always know what is the depth of the lake or sea, the bottom, it may be, being at various depths, while the shore is characteristically a known ground, a solid place. In spite of our failures, the Lord is going to treat us with dignity. That is another feature of recovery, a feature that the Lord gives us to understand. We may, for the moment, become the servants of sin; but we do not cease to be sons. "When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread". The hand of One who was thinking of them had been active. Who thought of us? We were busy fishing all night, without taking anything; but Someone has been occupied about us. They saw that, it says, but only when they went out on the land. In order to see, we must take up a certain position.
{60}
John saw the Lord from the ship (he had recognised Him); but it was not from the ship that he saw the fire of coals. To see all the Lord's goodness we must leave the position into which our faithlessness had led us.
Then the Lord says to them: "Come and dine". He would not merely give them something to eat. It is true that they were erring disciples; but they were also dignified persons. The reception that was going to be given them was according to their dignity; although they had gone astray, they were going to be placed in all the dignity of the counsels of God. And, as if to set them at ease, the Lord says to them: "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken" -- fresh fish, not of that which they might have had from their previous efforts, but of that which they had just taken. It is as if the Lord would say to them: 'Since I began to recover you, you have had results, and I can change all those results into a feast for you'. Simon Peter becomes the leader again in verse 11, and it says that he "drew the net to the land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three". The results are not negligible; they are very great. The Lord assures our hearts that, in spite of the defection which has taken place, we are with Him on a dignified ground.
Then it tells us that no one dared inquire of Him, Who art Thou? knowing that it was the Lord. The Lord has no interest in forms of prayer. They knew that it was the Lord, and they did not ask Him. Not only had the Lord provided the fire of coals, but He had Himself prepared the meal. He never ceases to serve us.
The Holy Spirit adds that "this is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among the dead". This last chapter really forms part of the gospel; this third manifestation was necessary to complete the subject.
Having spoken of the affections, I wish to say a few words about the conscience, for Peter must be restored
{61}
into the full position of leader. This chapter shows us in a mysterious way how the Lord has made provision of the truth for the whole time of His absence. He challenges Peter as to his profession, for the Lord never forgets what we have professed to be. Jehovah recalled to Jacob the vows he had made twenty years earlier. The Lord recalls to Peter the affection he had professed to have for Him. This passage is very familiar to us. Perhaps we have not noticed that the last allusion made by Peter to the Lord's knowledge is objective, while at the beginning it was a matter of conscious knowledge: "Thou *knowest* that I am attached to thee". The third time, Peter changes his language: "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee". An erring brother can say: Thou knowest my heart. But is there in me anything that others can see as to my love? The Lord knows it, of course; but others should know it. They can only know it by that which is seen in me. If a brother speaks of his affection for the Lord he ought to bear witness to it. That is a very important point to notice, and it shows how Peter made progress in the knowledge of the Lord. He discerned that if he spoke of his affection for the Lord he was testifying of something which he could manifest. Then the Lord can speak to Peter of the perfect way in which he would finish his course down here, and for that He uses the familiar expression: "Verily, verily, I say to thee".
I believe, dear brethren, that the Lord would give us to understand that transparency in our conduct is the proof that we shall continue to the end. Peter is now established as the one who will feed the lambs and shepherd the sheep, the one who will die gloriously as a martyr. It will be the same with John. Nothing is said of the others. Peter and John, in their ministry, are characteristically to continue to the end.
Matthew teaches us that we should persevere in all circumstances. Although they were only eleven and
{62}
some doubted, the Lord says to them: "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth. Go therefore ..." -- they are to continue and make disciples, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. And He says to them: "And behold, I am with you *all the days*, until the completion of the age". It should touch us that He says "call the days". There are bright days and dark days; but He is with us all the days, until the completion of the age. Everything is fixed: the Lord has all authority in heaven and upon earth. He is with us every day; yes, from daybreak. He anticipated our needs, even before we presented them to Him, and that will continue until the completion of the age. And in that day, the Lord will not fail us.
May God bless His word!

AQUILA AND PRISCILLA
@1 Corinthians 11: 11, 12; @Acts 18: 1 - 3, 18 - 28; @Romans 16: 3, 4
The need of a helpmate for Adam was God's thought. It was on the sixth day of creation that the Creator was occupied with man. The animals of the creation were brought to the man, to see what he would call them; but among them there was not found one that could be a helpmate suitable for Adam. Adam's deep sleep took place that day, for it is said that God created them both on the same day; and when the woman was brought to the man, it is the man who gave her her name. Adam's intelligence shines in the names he gave to the lower creatures. But in naming Eve, his intelligence shines out very particularly; he discerns that God has had recourse to a special procedure. The man was in a deep sleep when the extraction of one of his ribs took place, nevertheless he can say: "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man", @Genesis 2: 23.
So the position is very clear, in view of the generations following, and specially in view of what God desired to carry out in the assembly. It says in 1 Corinthians: "neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman". The position is defined very clearly, and confirms what we have in @Genesis 2, having the assembly distinctly in view. The declaration made in @Genesis 2 is to have its full answer in the assembly at the present time. The result is seen in brothers and sisters in the gathering, and it is elevated to the level of the relations of Christ and the assembly.
So in the public assembly, as at Corinth, sisters are as essential as brothers, which Luke confirms in his account of the Acts of the apostles. And in chapter 8
{64}
of his gospel he speaks of the man, and the woman, and the child, as if to show the parts that compose the assembly.
The man in @Luke 8 was a demoniac; the scene unfolds at Decapolis, a name that is not without significance, representing a place of ten towns, for the assembly was to be developed, historically and publicly, principally in towns. The towns of this world, which have turned away from God, represent a concentration of evil; in a place marked by distance from God, we can be sure that evil will prevail. Luke tells us that the man came out of the city; now, he was in a shameful condition. Demons had taken possession of him, a 'legion' of demons. At the commandment of the Lord, the demons went out of the man. Then it says that the citizens of that place came out to see what had happened, and they found the man "sitting, clothed and sensible, at the feet of Jesus" @Luke 8:35. There is one of the component parts of the assembly. The man desired to be with the Lord; but, sending him away, He said to him: "Return to thine house and relate how great things God has done for thee". Thus the man was left by the Lord in perhaps the most wicked country of that time, for the people were so far from God that they begged the Lord Jesus to leave the country. But it was as if the Lord had said to them: If you ask Me to leave the country personally, I will stay there representatively. Such is the assembly's position. The Lord has been rejected; and in speaking to Saul of Tarsus of the assembly, He names it "me" ("why dost thou persecute me?" @Acts 9:4). The man was left at Decapolis; "And he went away through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done for him". What power was needed for him to be able to hold his ground during the absence of Christ! But the man was qualified for that, being seated, clothed and sensible, a suitable vessel for the reception of the Spirit, which he no doubt received after the ascension of Jesus to heaven.
{65}
Man cannot be sufficient alone: "It is not good that Man should be alone" @Genesis 2:18. This thought applies to brothers in a locality, as much as to the Lord as Head of His body, the assembly. Thus, after the account of the demoniac in @Luke 8, we have the account of the woman healed by the Lord. She would like to have hidden the fact of her healing, but she would never have been a sister suitable for the assembly if she had hidden such a thing. And the Lord insists before all, that someone had touched Him. Then she falls at His feet and confesses all the truth. Sisters who say all the truth are very useful; but those who are in the habit of hiding something are not useful. So the woman in @Luke 8 falls down before all and declares the whole truth. Seeing her act thus the Lord can call her "daughter". He can recognise in her kindred features. She will form part of the material for the assembly. She will not aim at displacing the man; but having formed a link with Christ, she will recognise the headship of the man.
Then, in the same chapter, it speaks also of a young girl of twelve years. There is no doubt that she forms the third part constituting the assembly. The age of twelve is regarded by the Lord Himself as indicating the age of responsibility. At that age He was found Himself hearing and asking questions. Young ones who are in the assembly hearing and asking questions will make soul progress. I do not mean that young sisters should ask questions in public in the assembly, but that they have to learn. This young person was dying, and her father was very distressed about her. He comes to ask the Lord to come in for her. She died, and when He arrived at Jairus's house He turned everyone out, merely taking with Him Peter, John, James, and the father and mother of the young girl. It is in that atmosphere that the young girl came back to life. What a good beginning she had when she rose up! There is no doubt that she will never forget that moment when, her spirit returning to her, she began
{66}
to breathe the spiritual atmosphere that surrounded her. Thus the assembly is to be characterised, not only by intelligence in the man, but also by transparency with the woman, and by a spiritual atmosphere as regards the child. Six persons were near that young girl: the Lord, Peter, John, James, the father and the mother. The young girl having received life, that house comprised seven living persons. All this helps us to understand the constitution of the assembly in its public aspect: the man, the woman and the child are to appear in it.
My attention is specially upon this verse that we read in the first epistle to the Corinthians. We shall see how the principle enunciated there is developed in a striking way in Aquila and Priscilla. This man and this woman are named six times, always together -- *always together*; three times Aquila is named first, and three times Priscilla is named first. In the first place we see that Aquila is able to maintain the position; but Priscilla was herself at the height of the position. According to this passage, "so also is the man by the woman, but all things of God". That is to say, that in every way the position is according to God, whether Aquila is mentioned first or Priscilla.
The first time they are spoken of is in chapter 18 of the Acts. It says that a certain Jew named Aquila, of Pontus by race, had recently come from Italy. It speaks of his origin and religion, and says that he had just come from Italy, all that before mentioning Priscilla, which shows that God had from the outset given Aquila his own distinction. One might say that Aquila was a traveller. Persons who travel simply for the purpose of visiting sites do not help the assembly; but those who have the assembly in view are very useful. It says in the prophet Daniel: "Many shall run to and fro" @Daniel 12:4. And there is not a period in the history of the world when there has been more running to and fro than now; but, blessed be God! there are some among His own
{67}
who travel under His hand, and He encourages them. I speak of that, because Aquila originated from Pontus, very much east of Corinth, and on the other hand it says that he had quite recently come from Italy, very much to the west of Corinth. He was a man qualified under the hand of God to have a universal outlook. Priscilla, his wife, was with him. It does not say to what race she belonged, because the woman is identified with the man, as it says in @1 Corinthians 11, "the woman is of the man". There is something else that is said of them; that is that they were tent-makers by trade. They were both engaged in pursuing a single object. Apparently the wife did not leave her husband to earn their living alone; she worked with him. We have therefore here, in the man and his wife, a remarkable combination suitable to the assembly; and the Spirit of God tells us that Paul found them there, at Corinth; he abode with them and wrought with them. They are thus together in very simple circumstances, for when we are put together as christians, it is not with a view to our advancing our social position. They worked in a humble way in the town of Corinth.
After Paul had laboured there for eighteen months, an assembly was formed, and Paul "took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila"; and then it says that "he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there". It is very remarkable to see that these two were the beginning of the assembly at Ephesus, occupying the ground for the Lord; and shortly after, Apollos arrived at Ephesus. They heard him speak. We can understand that one likes to hear a visiting brother who desires to speak. Now Apollos was "an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures". But an important element was there in the assembly -- a man and a woman having discernment as to what is of God and serving in ministry. "And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly".
{68}
It does not say that Aquila or Priscilla had a gift. They represent the element that God can use in all circumstances. So they are ready to show this servant the way of God more exactly. In other words, instead of being diverted by Apollos¬ eloquence, they desire things to be as they should be among the servants of God. They are thinking of the Lord and what is suitable in the assembly. Apollos is much helped by them and by the way in which they instruct him. "When he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace".
The passage in @Romans 16 shows us the place these two occupied in Paul's affections -- blessed reflex of the place they had in the thoughts of Christ. We have often noticed the wonderful knowledge Paul had of the persons in the assembly at Rome before he went there. He sends some twenty-seven salutations to the assembly at Rome. After mentioning "Phoebe, our sister, who is minister of the assembly", his first salutation is to Prisca and Aquila: "Salute Prisca and Aquila, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus, (who for my life staked their own neck ... )". We see that these two, in fulfilling their function in the assembly, acquired a very great place in the thoughts of Paul, and not only of Paul, but of the Lord Himself. Then the apostle adds: "and the assembly at their house". Twice it says of them that the assembly met in their house, first at Rome, then at Ephesus; @1 Corinthians 16: 19.
There would be yet many things to say about them, but time fails. In the public assembly the man and the woman have their public relations in regard of each other; and I believe the sisters do not always function in the assembly according to the divine thoughts. I do not say this to complain of them; but I fear that if there is weakness and smallness in many localities, that is due to lack of energy on the part of the sisters. The
{69}
fact of having in her house a room at the disposal of the assembly represents much energy on the part of a sister. We can see in the case of Aquila and Priscilla how they were agreed in devoting themselves to the Lord's interests.
{70}
THE BOARDS OF THE TABERNACLE
@Exodus 26: 15 - 25; @Acts 3: 1 - 11; @Acts 14: 8 - 10
I wish to speak of the boards of the tabernacle. I suppose we all understand that the various parts of the tabernacle represent typically what the New Testament presents to us. We shall see, with the Lord's help, that the epistle to the Romans develops the thought of the boards of the tabernacle.
In order to answer to the type, every believer must come to himself: it says of the prodigal son that he came to himself; @Luke 15: 17. So, in chapter 7 of Romans we read: "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of this body of death? I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law". As being delivered, he can say "*myself*", so that the believer has arrived at his own individuality, as a delivered man; and having arrived at his own individuality, he serves, with the mind, God's law. He becomes available to the will of God; God takes possession of him and can use him in relation with other believers.
It will be noticed that, in the passage we read in Exodus, the boards were to be placed upright, that is to say that the persons whom they typify stand upon their own feet. The believer can stand upright, spiritually, by himself. In christianity there is no need for human support. The christian stands upright.
Let us also remark that the wood used for the boards was shittim wood, that is, acacia. It is a wood of extraordinary strength, as if to convey to us that God uses christians to carry burdens. And it is proved that the boards of the tabernacle came from a tree of considerable height. "Ten cubits the length of the board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of one board". The believer understands that that applies to him.
{71}
It is also said that each board was to have two tenons. We must specially observe each of these features in order to correspond to the type in an intelligent and spiritual way.
I do not wish to enlarge on the number of the boards; there were twenty on the south side and twenty on the north side, and on the west six boards, then "two boards ... for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear". Now the two tenons of each board were to be in the bases of silver; that is to say, that we stand upright in this world on the ground of redemption. There is no other ground on which we can be for God in this world, than the ground of the death of our Lord Jesus. There were also bars for the boards of the tabernacle. The believer is to understand that, as enjoying redemption, he is linked with all believers; he is not to be independent. He is linked with all other believers in relation to the testimony of God in this world. Another thing that is to be noticed is, that the precious things with which the believer is to be occupied were already there, before the boards were made and set up: that is the ark which the cherubim shadowed, the table, the candlestick, the curtains; all these existed before the boards of the tabernacle. That means that the believer, as represented by a board of the tabernacle, is not to understand that he is the primary thought of God. The great primary thought of God is Christ as Man, and every believer is to recognise that he is the servant of Christ in the christian system. So when the great servant John the baptist was speaking of himself, he said that Jesus took place before him, for He was before him. It is necessary for each believer to recognise that he comes after Jesus, and after many others. Thus he could take his place in the service, submitting his will to the will of God. That service is not grievous; it is a joyful service.
In order to show the typical meaning of all that, I have read in the third chapter of the Acts. The Spirit
{72}
of God speaks of a man lame from his birth. He was begging, and expected to receive aims from Peter and John: he was entirely dependent on the charity of others. One who does not believe is in that same position. He depends entirely on what the world can furnish. Then it says that "Peter, looking stedfastly upon him with John, said, Look on us". In other words these two men represented what was of God. They are no ordinary men; they had already been under the skilful hand of the Lord Jesus. They represent the quality of the material of the divine system. Peter and John say: "Look on us". Peter does not merely say: "Look on me", but "Look on us". The plural indicates that two parts of the tabernacle were bound together, and power is found in that. Power characterises the assembly. It says of Peter that "having taken hold of him by the right hand he raised him up". The power was in Peter; but Peter gives this man every possible advantage, for he takes hold of him by the right hand. That man was going to become a board of the tabernacle, and he discovers that he has power. Peter taking him by the right hand gives him every advantage possible. "And immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong. And leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God".
The Spirit of God presents these things to us so that we may have before us an example of what the boards of the tabernacle are. What will this healed man do? Will he go away, in a spirit of independence, to do his own will? We are told that he entered with Peter and John into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. He has found men of his kind. He belongs to the boards of the tabernacle. He is with them. He stands upright, not only by redemption; but in the power of the Spirit of God, he is linked with Peter and John. The boards were to be perfectly joined together by the bars and the rings. There is no doubt that the
{73}
ring typifies love which the Holy Spirit produces in us. We have found the company to which we belong, happy with those who compose it, walking with them, leaping with them and entering with them into the temple praising God.
But one might wonder if that state of soul is not in danger of soon coming to an end. It is sometimes said that young believers quickly weaken and go back to the world. If there is any case of that kind, it is an exception. It says here that "all the people saw him walking and praising God", and that "as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico which is called Solomon's, greatly wondering". We have now a young believer holding his fellow-believers by the hand. He is maintained in his new position; he is walking, leaping and praising God; and the effect produced on others was that they ran together to Peter and John. And in order to show still further how he corresponds to the boards of the tabernacle, the Spirit says that he stands with them in sufferings: later on the authorities see this man with Peter and John, and they could do nothing against them. It is as persevering in the way that we prove our quality represented by the durability of the shittim wood. The shittim wood, viewed typically, refers to the humanity of Christ. We are of Him, of His order; we correspond to Him. So the apostle says: "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" @1 Corinthians 3:11. And the whole building is to be of the same material. That in no wise implies that we have part in His Deity, which is impossible. But as being the workmanship of God, we are of the same kind of humanity as Christ as Man.
There is another feature, in chapter 14 of the Acts, where we see a man impotent in his feet, who sat, who, being lame from his mother's womb, had never walked. It says of him that he heard Paul speaking. That might appear to be only a small incident. But he who
{74}
was speaking was no less than Paul. We should give attention to the one who speaks; here, account is taken of the person who was speaking. That does not only mean that Paul was the one who could best express himself (although that is included); but he was the one who could say the greatest things. A man might be eloquent without saying anything great. When one speaks according to God, one expresses great things, and it is important to be attentive to them. The Lord opened Lydia's heart "to attend to the things spoken by Paul" @Acts 16:14. The final thoughts which God had to express to men have been spoken by His great servant. And the man impotent in his feet heard Paul speak; he heard him truly, which brings out what was in him. "This man heard Paul speaking, who, fixing his eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed, said with a loud voice, Rise up straight upon thy feet". We see the quality of the boards of the tabernacle. Peter did not bring out this character of the boards; it needed Paul's ministry for that: one is not in the tabernacle intelligently if one does not understand what Paul says. God's dispensation, which the tabernacle suggests, is in faith: it is on that principle that we enter into the tabernacle.
Paul said to him with a loud voice: "Rise up straight upon thy feet". What a word for the ears of faith! It was the voice of Paul, in all its strength. That is an important thing, to stand up straight upon his feet! The boards of the tabernacle are not to lean to one side or the other. One sees believers who lean sometimes to one side, sometimes to the other. To be able to occupy the place that belongs to us in the tabernacle, we must be upright upon our feet. It is not in vain that the Spirit uses certain words; He does not repeat things for nothing. The tenons of the boards are an allusion to the feet and hands. It is a matter of being upright and laying hold of a support. In chapter 3, Peter held the man by the hand, and he leaped and
{75}
walked. In chapter 14, we have a further thought -- intelligence: he "heard Paul speaking" and "had faith to be healed".
I am sure the brethren will understand what is the force of what I have said, how necessary the boards of the tabernacle are, locally and universally. We began with the thought of coming to ourselves; then we are taken up to be united to others. There is today much independence of mind among believers, so that the thoughts of God are obstructed; but if we are bound together, we can support the great features of the general testimony.
May God bless His word!

WILL YOUR LAMP BE PUT OUT?
@Proverbs 20: 27; @Proverbs 24: 20; @Proverbs 31: 18; @Luke 8: 16
Each of these passages speaks of a lamp. The first passage speaks of man's spirit being the lamp of Jehovah. We each have a spirit, and we received it from God. We do not receive our spirits from our parents; we receive our spirits from God. God Himself is called the Father of spirits, and in truth He is Himself a Spirit. As having breathed into Adam's nostrils Adam received a spirit; by this means God had an avenue to approach Adam and speak to him as it says in this scripture: "Man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah". By it God searches man's inner parts. Animals do not possess that element; God did not breathe into the animals, and He does not speak to animals in the sense that He speaks to men. When God walked in the garden, it is not said that the animals heard His voice. Adam and Eve heard it and were afraid. Why were they afraid? Because they had disobeyed God's word, but God had a means of speaking to them, and God can in that way speak to every person who is found here, regarding Christ. God does not address Himself to the beasts of the field; He addresses Himself to men. Men possess within them that which corresponds to God. Each of them has a spirit, and that spirit is the lamp of Jehovah. He would make use of that lamp today to enlighten each one of us, by speaking to us of the Lord Jesus Christ. The gospel relates to Christ. It is called "God's glad tidings ... concerning his Son ... Jesus Christ our Lord" @Romans 1:1, 3 - 4. Thus God would manifest Christ and His work to each of our hearts. He desires that the light of the gospel should penetrate into our most secret parts. When He was down here, the Lord Jesus said: Repent and believe in the glad tidings. Now the light is that it is possible for man to repent. When man sinned, God might have allowed him to continue in his course
{77}
and that would have been eternal alienation from God; but God has opened the door of repentance. Thus the Lord Jesus addresses men, and says: Repent; the time is fulfilled; believe in the glad tidings.
We see in many instances which the gospels give us, that God addressed men by means of their spirit, and how they were enlightened and believed! At the very moment of the crucifixion of our Lord, the dying robber was enlightened in his spirit as to the One who was nailed to the cross, and he could say: "Remember me, Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom" @Luke 23:42.
I wonder if there is any one here who has addressed the Lord Jesus in those terms. He is waiting for you to speak to Him. According as the light enters into your soul, He desires to hear you speak to Him. And the Lord answered the robber: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise" @Luke 23:43. If there is someone here who is convicted of his lost state and who addresses himself to the Lord, he will be answered immediately. On another occasion, a woman of the city went to find the Lord in a Pharisee's house. She went in there because Jesus was there. She stood behind at His feet, weeping and washing His feet with her tears. What did those tears mean? That the love of God had penetrated into her inward parts. She had discovered that she was a sinner, and that a Saviour was in the Pharisee's house, the only Saviour, for there is no other name than the name of Jesus, which has been given among men, whereby we must be saved. This woman recognised Him as such, in an attitude of repentance. She washed His feet; she wiped them, and she anointed them. All that she did witnessed to what was in her heart; all was the fruit of the light that was in her spirit, "the lamp of Jehovah". And the Lord said to her: "Thy faith has saved thee" @Luke 7:50. He would say the same words to anyone who repents, to anyone who turns to Him this evening: "Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace".
{78}
It might be that someone has come here with a troubled conscience. We who serve the Lord are always glad when we learn that someone is troubled in conscience, for man has not only a spirit but also a conscience. He did not receive a conscience and a spirit at the same time. His spirit was given him when God breathed into his nostrils; but he had a conscience when he ate of the forbidden fruit. He discovered then the difference between good and evil. Every person has a conscience, as well as a spirit. The spirit is the divine element by which God addresses Himself to man. He spoke to him before he sinned; but as soon as man had sinned God spoke to him through his conscience, and the conscience judges sin. In proportion as divine light enters into the inward parts, conscience begins to be in exercise and one becomes troubled. We bless God when conscience troubles you. When you are anxious about your sins you are ready to receive the gospel. The man who went up to the temple to pray had a troubled conscience; he was so concerned as to his sin that he would not lift up his eyes to heaven. The lamp of Jehovah was lighting up his inner being; and he said: "O God, have compassion on me, the sinner" @Luke 18:13. Such is the effect of the light penetrating. It is not only that I am a sinner, but *the* sinner. He said "on me, the sinner". And the Lord says of that man that he "went down to his house justified". How could he go away justified? Because Another was going to bear his sins; the Saviour was about to die for him, and on account of His death and resurrection, he was justified, and the gospel announces that God justifies him that believes in Jesus. "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for the showing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; for the showing forth of his righteousness in the present time,
{79}
so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus" @Romans 3:24 - 26. No one can lay a charge against someone who is justified. "It is God who justifies: who is he that condemns?" @Romans 8:33 - 24 How glorious the gospel is! Is there anyone here who could refuse it? Those who refuse the gospel will be punished with an eternal destruction from the Lord. Most of us are christians, and have proved the truth of these things, the enjoyment of forgiveness, that God regards us as righteous, having poured out His Spirit into our hearts.
To show how solemn it is to refuse the gospel, it says that "the lamp of the wicked shall be put out". In the book of Job (chapter 18: 5, 6), we read a similar passage: "The light of the wicked shall be put out, and the flame of his fire shall not shine. The light shall become dark in his tent, and his lamp over him shall be put out". These scriptures allude to persons who have light. Every person who takes the place of a christian has a certain light; but how terrible this word is! "The lamp of the wicked shall be put out". A time will come when every light will have disappeared from your soul. God will send men a working of error, that they should believe what is false. Falsehood is not light; it is darkness. Satan is the father of falsehood, and those who believe in falsehood are in darkness. They will be banished far from the presence of the Lord, in an eternal destruction.
In the third passage it says of a certain person that her lamp goeth not out. That is a woman of worth, a virtuous woman, a symbolic person who represents a believer, or a certain number of real believers. God finds no pleasure in persons who are not real, who lean to the right or the left, like reeds whose heads bend to one side or the other. There are thousands of persons in that state, in the church or chapel and elsewhere. If there is anyone here who leans like that, first to one side, then to the other, I give them a warning: God does not find pleasure in the way you are going on.
{80}
God looks at the heart. You may observe every religious rite; there is no value in them if there is not reality. Is there anyone here this evening who is only outwardly religious, without having ever shed tears like the woman in the seventh chapter of Luke? Are there any who have never gone into their rooms to kneel before God in the confession of their sins? God calls you to renounce all that is not real, to be real before Him.
The virtuous woman is the opposite of what you are, if you are not a true christian. She is real. She had judged herself for all her sins. Now, her lamp goeth not out by night. And your lamp will not go out if you humble yourself and believe in the Lord Jesus, from this evening. The salvation that we preach this evening is an eternal salvation. The Lord Jesus said that he that believes on the Son has life eternal.
In the fourth passage we read the Lord's own words. They refer to a true believer. He is to be a light in the world. How wonderful it is to be able to be a light in this world of darkness. So the Lord says: "No one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch". It may be that someone speaks like this: Now that I have believed in Christ, I can launch out into business and think of my own comfort and pleasures. The Lord Jesus reproves such language. He says: Your whole body is to be full of light. You are not going to put that lamp under a couch. That lamp is to shine, as the stars shine in the heaven. He calls each star by name. Think of the millions of stars: God has given each one of them a name. He needs them all. Those who love righteousness will shine like the stars for ever and ever. How necessary it is then that christians should be in their place to shine in this world of darkness, so that where they have lived in sin, they should now be light-bearers! The apostle said to the Philippians. "That ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in the
{81}
world ..." @Philippians 2:15. With your sins, you have darkened this scene; henceforth you are to illuminate it, for God who commanded light to shine out of darkness is He "who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" @2 Corinthians 4:6. That is what the Lord Jesus means in the passage we read in the eighth of Luke: "No one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they who enter in may see the light".
May God bless His word to us all!
{82}
"LEAD ME IN THE WAY EVERLASTING"
@Mark 10: 17 - 22; @Mark 46 - 52
I wish to speak this afternoon of God's way. It is spoken of in the Scriptures as the "way everlasting" (@Psalm 139: 24); it is the oldest and the longest: beginning in the garden of Eden, it will finish in an eternity of blessings for men.
Many roads are famous, even in this country. The Roman ways, constructed two thousand years ago, are famous throughout the world; but how much more ancient is the divine way; it alone can be called "everlasting". It passes to Gethsemane and Calvary's cross.
The general statement in the epistle to the Romans says: "All have gone out of the way" @Romans 3:12. Very early men left the divine way; they left it to take the way of Cain. Now the way of Cain is nearly as old as the way of God and it still continues; many are walking in it today; perhaps there are some even among those who are listening to me who are following it. The man in verse 17 was of that number. He would embark on the divine way; he ran up to it, but in verse 22 it says: "But he, sad at the word, went away grieved". Like many others, he left God's way. It is a word of warning addressed to each one of us; for the most part, we are in God's way; with His help we desire to remain there, and our thought is to bring you into it, if you are not yet there.
Wishing to speak, for a moment, of the way that Cain took, I will recall @Genesis 3 and 4. Cain not only left God's way, but he made a way for himself (that is how Jude speaks of it). Even at his birth he was connected with the divine way, being born after the sin of his parents -- the sin on account of which they were driven out of Paradise; before that, God had opened His way, having clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skin, and when Cain was born those skins doubtless still existed. Can we think that Adam and Eve did not speak to their
{83}
children of those coats of skin? They had accepted them, showing that they accepted God's way. So Cain's parents were already in the way when he was born, and we can understand how Adam and Eve must have spoken to their children of what God had done for them. They must have said: That we might be clothed, some animals have had to be put to death.
Many of us have been thus led into the way of God. Our parents have read passages from the Bible to us; they have spoken to us of God and of the death of Jesus; they have told us that they have been clothed with the robe of righteousness by the death of Jesus, "who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification" @Romans 4:25, so that "having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ" @Romans 5:1.
What have you done with this light as to God's way? Have you appropriated for yourself that which your parents have taken for themselves? Or else, have you, like Cain, brought to God something out of your personal resources? Cain intended, by his own efforts, to make himself of value in the eyes of God. Might there be someone here on such a way? In that case you are not in the way of God, but in the way of Cain, and you will not be accepted by God.
When the great white throne is set up (@Revelation 20), if your name is not found in the book of life, you will be judged according to your works. Cain will be there; he will be asked what his works have been. Alas! It will be brought into evidence that he despised the light of the provisions of God in mercy -- provisions that were there before his birth. And he will be cast into the lake of fire.
If there is a young man here, or a young woman, born into the household of faith, but found in the way of Cain, may this word be a warning to such! The way of Cain means more than the cultivation of the ground, for he killed his brother. But, you will say, I have not
{84}
killed anyone. Perhaps you have no interest in the people of God; perhaps you despise them; perhaps you even hate them. Yes, you prefer the company of the world to that of the people of God. The Scriptures say that he that hates his brother is a murderer. I speak thus because being born in the flesh we are capable of the worst things, and if we enter upon the way of Cain we may go as far as Cain himself: he killed his brother and went out from the presence of God, having on him the mark of the murderer.
Abel also was born in connection with the divine way and he remained in it. How? On the principle of faith. Faith does not allow the works of the flesh; this is how we are saved, "not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit", @Titus 3: 5. That involves the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Abel brought a more excellent offering than that of Cain, in that, in figure, he presented the Lord Jesus by whose death and resurrection we have access to God. Abel being born in connection with God's way, remained in it and proved the blessing of such a way. If you have not yet entered upon that way, come into it now by faith. Faith is attributed to Abel: "By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained testimony of being righteous", @Hebrews 11: 4. God reckons us righteous through the appropriation by faith of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. It says of Abraham that he believed God, and that was reckoned to him as righteousness.
In verse 46, we see how another man enters into the way and remains there -- a blind man sitting by the wayside begging. He was blind and he knew it. Many are blind and do not know it; while blind, they say "we see": their sin remains. This blind man was sitting "by the wayside", not exactly on the way, but "by the
{85}
wayside", which would indicate perhaps the position of several here this afternoon. The way is pointed out in the preaching, and by the Spirit, God announces the way. Your very presence at this meeting proves that you are "by the wayside". Our hope is that some of you will not be content to remain "by the wayside", but will decide to follow Jesus "in the way". The Lord said to him: "Go, thy faith has healed thee". You see, dear friends, that it is a question of faith. You have come to the wayside this afternoon, perhaps because a friend has invited you, or perhaps out of curiosity. In any case the way is open to you, and it is for you to do as this man did: he followed Jesus "*in the way*", on the principle of faith.
Now, notice the details: he heard that it was Jesus the Nazaraean, but he does not appeal to Him as such; he says: "O Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me".
Many speak of the Lord Jesus without reverence. This country is nominally christian; the name of Jesus is often named even by those who do not know Him, but they do not name it with reverence. Do you utter His name in vain? The manner in which the holy name of the Lord Jesus is used in the world is terrible; it is used in profane language. There is no name in the universe like this one. In @Isaiah 9: 6, we read: "His name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of eternity, Prince of Peace". Are you not afraid to use this holy and exalted name in a profane manner? It is a proof of the work of God in a soul when it begins to speak of Jesus with reverence. This blind man, begging at Jericho, does not say "Jesus the Nazaraean", but "Son of David, Jesus". Doubtless, when this man knew the Lord Jesus better, he said: He is the Son of God. That is not to say that the Spirit does not use the title "Jesus the Nazaraean", for He was so; He was brought up at Nazareth, and the Scriptures say: "He shall be called a Nazaraean", @Matthew 2: 23. And Peter commanded the lame man at Jerusalem to
{86}
rise up and walk "in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean" @Acts 3:6.
But those in whose heart the Spirit of God has operated do not address Him as "Jesus the Nazaraean"; they speak of Him with reverence: "Son of David, Jesus" that is all the light that the blind beggar possessed. We have more light today; we speak of Him as our exalted Saviour in heaven, the Lord. The more one knows Him, the more one reveres Him. The crowd told this man to be silent, but he cried so much the more. Perhaps you have ceased confessing Him because you have been rebuked by someone. Are you ashamed of Him? Will you cease to confess His name? The Scriptures say: "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart ... thou shalt be saved" @Romans 10:9. Satan knows this, and he will try to hinder your confession. It may be you have an unbelieving father or mother, or a brother, or a friend who hinders you from confessing Jesus as your Saviour. Satan uses all sorts of means to deprive you of salvation. It says of this man that "he began to cry out"; then he cried so much the more as the others rebuked him. God was working in his soul, and the more he was rebuked, the more he cried. Jesus had the greatest interest in this man. "And Jesus, standing still, desired him to be called". If, among those who are listening to me there is the least desire to be saved, the Lord knows it. Perhaps you whisper: I should like to be saved. If you have such a desire, the Lord is not far from you. Think of the Lord of glory, standing still at the voice of a poor blind beggar; He is no respecter of persons. So they say to him: "Be of good courage, rise up, he calls thee".
"And, throwing away his garment, he started up and came to Jesus". The garment of a beggar is not of great value. What need have we of old garments if we are going to receive "the best robe" made by God? All our righteousnesses are as a filthy garment. The garment
{87}
has a great spiritual meaning. Many believers do not forsake theirs; they do not realise that "the best robe" is worth more than every human garment, and they try to retain their own reputation.
This man's movements were energetic. How good it is to see a soul in whom the work of God is made evident by energy! This man came to Jesus. That is what is essential.
Then the Lord says to him: "What wilt thou that I shall do to thee?" The Lord Jesus knew what he needed. He knows all our needs before we express them to Him, But He would have us present them to Him. What is your spiritual need today? We do not ask you to tell it to us, but tell it to Jesus. The man answered: "Rabboni, that I may see". He knew what he needed, and he told the Lord exactly what it was. That is a very important point, in order to enjoy blessing in his soul. This man had faith; the Lord knew it. And we invite you to do what this man did, to follow Jesus in the way. All who enter it enter a way of blessing.
May God give you to leave the way of Cain and enter upon the way of God, where you will be able to follow Jesus by faith!
{88}
LIGHT SHINING OUT OF DARKNESS
@Matthew 27: 19; @Luke 23: 39 - 43; @Matthew 27: 54
With the Lord's help, I desire to show from these few passages how light shines out of the midst of darkness. In the second epistle to the Corinthians (chapter 4: 6), the apostle recalls that "it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", in order that there should now be a light down here.
When the Lord Jesus left Nazareth and went to live at Capernaum, a great light shone in that dark city, as it is said in the prophets: "The people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in the country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up", @Matthew 4: 13 - 16.
Thus it is with each one of us, it will be found that at the moment of the greatest darkness, light has shone. We must therefore not be discouraged; the very darkness shows that the light is going to shine: the darkest hour is that which precedes the dawn.
In the period before the Reformation there was intense darkness; but it was not long before the light shone, a light from which we all benefit now. And is it not the same in the history of certain meetings with which we are in fellowship? Some have very dark periods, and the enemy seeks to discourage the saints, so that they may, give everything up. And again it is the same in the history of our souls. The darkness is evidently the devil's work, but God makes light to shine out of the midst of that darkness.
The night in which Israel was delivered out of Egypt was outwardly a night of profound darkness, but the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
When David numbered Israel, it was a dark period, but God spoke to David through Gad. What God desires
{89}
is to bring in light. Each has his different way of seeing. Now David had Gad as a prophet; @2 Samuel 24.
It may be that, through our own will, darkness has entered into our souls, but if we truly belong to the Lord He has means of reaching our consciences; David was convicted and light shone into his soul.
Now I wish to present to you three persons for whom light shone out of darkness. How sad, in the history of this world, was the moment when the Lord Jesus, who had walked and shone down here, stood before Pilate to be judged and crucified! And darker than any other was the hour of the cross. The world then did its best to extinguish the greatest possible light that has ever shone; it could not succeed. Jesus was put to death; but He was raised, to shine more wonderfully than ever. The fact of trying to extinguish the light by putting Jesus to death was as absurd an act as if men agreed together to try and suppress the sun. The Lord was brought before Pilate and condemned to death. Indeed a very dark moment, but one in which the light shone. The heart of man was in profound darkness: "This is your hour and the power of darkness" @Luke 22:53; but Jesus shone before Pilate. At such a moment God spoke, and the first person to attract our attention is Pilate's wife (now Pilate had authority to put our Lord to death). She had a dream, and God spoke to her soul while she slept. He had already done that previously. God sometimes uses dreams to speak to men and women. "In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men", then He speaks to them. "For God speaketh once, and twice -- and man perceiveth it not", @Job 33: 14, 15. But there are cases where He gets a response. He had one that night from Pilate's wife, and in the dream she suffered much. It is important to notice that she suffered: "I have suffered today many things in a dream because of him". Among those who obtain light from God and are counted as christians, there is a great number who are very superficial, because
{90}
they did not suffer at their conversion. Perhaps many among us have not suffered because of Jesus; but Pilate's wife suffered much.
He was Himself going to suffer on account of her; she suffered on account of Him. Her sufferings were feeble in comparison with the Lord's sufferings, which were infinite. Nevertheless, she "suffered many things". One would like to ask: What did she suffer? We can be assured she did not sleep in peace that night, and it was because God had the blessing of her soul in view. If God works in us, there will be suffering because of Jesus, so that we might be able to appreciate what He suffered for us. Perhaps no one suffered more than Paul, and he often speaks of the sufferings of Christ, in which he had a great part. Pilate's wife does not say that the Lord suffered for her, but that she suffered because of Him. One cannot doubt that she was converted and that she knew that He suffered for her.
She could not enjoy the blessing before she knew that Christ suffered for her; His sufferings for her saved her. "Himself bore our sins" -- her sins -- "in his body on the tree", @1 Peter 2: 24. We present to you the same Saviour.
I should also like you to notice that she calls the Lord Jesus "that righteous man". Nearly everyone in Jerusalem was saying that He was unrighteous and ought to be put to death as a malefactor; but she says to her husband, who was about to send Him to the cross: "Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man". What a testimony to Pilate! He should have listened to his wife, since she said she had suffered because of Jesus. Without doubt he desired to grant her request, in setting Jesus free if he had been able. But he represents a man to whom the testimony is presented and who refuses it. Instead of accepting the testimony with regard to Jesus, he refuses it and has Him put to death.
That is what I had to say as to Pilate's wife. She called Jesus "that righteous man"; she suffered because
{91}
of Him; she was ready to send a message to her husband who was already on the judgment-seat. When Pilate is brought before the great white throne, he will remember that, and will not be able to deny it. The same applies to you: if you reject Christ now, you will have to appear before the throne of God; @Revelation 20. Many meetings at which you have been present will then come to your memory. Are you, like Pilate, going to continue to reject the testimony? God presents to you Christ as Saviour and whosoever believes on Him has life eternal; he has passed from death unto life. It is a solemn thing if there is anyone here who has not confessed the Lord. This meeting will stand out against you at the day of judgment. As to Pilate's wife, she shone distinctly in that hour of deep darkness.
In @Luke 23, another light shone, and only a few hours after the events of which we have spoken. The two malefactors were hanging on the cross on either side of Jesus. What a dark picture outwardly! Three men, nailed on the cross, were enduring the most atrocious sufferings; and One of them was "just".
The fact that He was there makes the scene still darker. And then one of the malefactors spoke insultingly to Jesus, which adds still more to the sadness of the moment. The other evangelists tell us that both the malefactors insulted Him, which shows how quickly the work of God can be done in a soul. Shortly after, one of the two calls Him "Lord". Pilate's wife had confessed Him as "that righteous man", and the malefactor calls Him "Lord" shortly after having insulted Him. His mind was quite changed. Who made him do that? The Spirit of God. Do not think it needs long years to be converted; it is a thing that comes to pass instantaneously. It was so with the malefactor; a ray of light shone into his soul while he was hanging by the side of Jesus. What joy that must have brought to the heart of the Lord! I am sure that the moment that this
{92}
passage that we have read depicts, was an important moment for heaven and earth.
While Jesus, the perfect Man, was ranked with malefactors, and during three hours there was darkness over the whole land, the conversion of a sinner had been noted in heaven and there had been joy before the angels of God.
I would beseech you this evening to confess the Lord Jesus; in that you will give much joy to His heart and to the heart of each one of us. The malefactor made a request to the Lord: "Remember me, Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom". He answered him that He would do something for him that very day: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise". He was going to leave that body of suffering, to enter into paradise, into the company of His Saviour.
What a gospel! Jesus did not die a natural death; He expired full of power; He cried with a loud voice and delivered up His spirit. His death preceded that of the malefactor. It is possible for a crucified man to live several days, for nothing vital is affected; but Jesus did not remain long in life on the cross; He remained there the necessary time to make propitiation. He cried with a loud voice: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" @Matthew 27:46 Then He delivered up His spirit, according as He had said, speaking of His life: "I lay it down of myself" @John 10:18. He did not die the same death as the malefactors. When Pilate sent the soldiers, they were astonished to find Jesus already dead. The malefactors were not dead; that is why the soldiers broke their legs; but of the bones of Jesus, not one was broken. Thus Jesus entered paradise before the malefactor.
The third person of whom I wish to speak is the centurion, a Roman officer who, with some soldiers whom he commanded, kept guard over Jesus. He represented the authority of Rome. Is it possible for such a man to be converted? Yes, God can convert a
{93}
man in military uniform. If He can convert and take a malefactor to heaven, He can also convert a centurion, who was only maintaining order and keeping watch. The soldiers with him were also all affected; they feared greatly; @Matthew 27: 54. Do you think you would have been able to stand near the cross and witness all that took place there, without fearing? And now, do you not fear to miss the opportunity which is presented? Do you not fear the consequences? The centurion had had to do with the death of the Son of God. He was only doing his duty, but he feared. I have no doubt he had seen men put to death without thinking much of their sufferings, but this time they "feared greatly, saying, Truly this man was Son of God".
Notice that they confessed the Son of God, and the Son of God alone could produce such a result. We see Jesus confessed as "righteous", as "Lord" and as "Son of God".
Every believer should confess Him in these three aspects. The gospel is presented to you, that you may confess Him thus; then joy will enter into your soul and will be with you for ever.

ROYALTY SEEN IN DAVID
@2 Samuel 5: 4 - 10; @2 Samuel 6: 12 - 19; @2 Samuel 22: 51; @2 Samuel 23: 1 - 4
J.T. The New Testament scripture that directly connects with our subject -- that of royalty as set out in David -- is in @2 Timothy 2: "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him" (verse 12), reminding us that suffering now qualifies us for reigning, and moreover builds up a royal character in the people of God. In order that the subject may be clear, it may be remarked that in looking at David we must bear in mind that he is not always a type of Christ, even as marked by what is spiritual; he is sometimes a type of the saints as partaking of what is spiritual. This applies in measure to all the types. Sometimes David rises to a full type of Christ personally; but he is perhaps as often a type of the saints as the subjects of the work of God, and this includes the character of royalty; for royalty is attached to the saints. It is, of course, seen in Christ supremely, but it is also seen in His people; as it is said, "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father" (@Revelation 1: 6), and a "royal priesthood", @1 Peter 2: 9. It is from this latter point of view that I have thought of this subject; that we might partake of royalty in character, as partaking of suffering, with a view to functioning by and by in rule. Another thing to be observed in relation to this subject is that in the early section we have Jehovah as supreme in view, and the ark, and then David himself. Later we shall see that sonship comes into view, but we have to bear all these features in mind to understand the place royalty has in this section, as seen in David.
W.L. How do you connect royalty with such as we?
J.T. We shall see that as we proceed, but, as already remarked, it is said of christians that they are
{95}
a royal priesthood, and also in the Revelation that we are made kings and priests. But we have to understand what that means; and it will be seen as we proceed in David's history, that the first book of Samuel presents him not as reigning, but in the character of a *sufferer*. I suggested reading @2 Samuel 22: 51 because it speaks of David as God's king. That is characteristic; God's king must bear the royal feature, not only officially but personally. That is also seen in @Psalm 2:6: "Yet have I set *my* king upon my holy hill of Zion". Before he is installed, he is king in *character*, he is royal.
P.L. Does Paul bring forward his sufferings as the divine credentials of royalty, as set over against the false reigning as kings at Corinth?
J.T. Yes. The early chapters of 1 Corinthians help as to this subject. Paul shows that his outward circumstances were most despicable in man's eye, but still they were truly royal; whereas the Corinthian leaders were reigning as kings. They were respectable; they were honoured; they were great in this world; whereas Paul was as the filth and offscouring of the world, as he says, until the day on which he wrote, chapter 4: 13. But he was showing true royalty, for it is in suffering it is seen now.
P.L. The psalmist says, "They shall praise ... the strength of the king that loveth justice", @Psalm 99: 3, 4. Was that a peculiar feature with Paul in 1 Corinthians -- righteousness and other moral features?
J.T. Quite so. That is what David describes here: "The ruler among men shall be just, ruling in the fear of God".
A.H.G. Why do you specially connect royalty with suffering?
J.T. I cited the passage in @2 Timothy 2: 12: "If we suffer, we shall also reign". @Romans 8 also says, "if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together", verse 17. It is as if the one is the sequence of the other. The altar was covered with a purple cloth,
{96}
denoting royalty; it is indeed imperial. The Lord was clothed derisively with purple, and crowned with a crown of thorns, as He was about to be crucified, as if that were proper to a king -- but He was suffering then.
E.B. Would you say a word on the bearing of the anointing on what you have before you? I was thinking of what we get in 1 Corinthians, and how it brings in the anointing in the second epistle: "Now he that ... has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts", chapter 1:21,22.
J.T. The anointing in David's history extends back to @1 Samuel 16. David as yet was unknown, save to God. He was known in a way to his parents and his family, but evidently they saw no kingly qualities there. So, as he enters the circle where Samuel was, Jehovah says, "this is he". Samuel was not entrusted to find the king. In sending him to Bethlehem, God said that He would tell him whom to anoint; He did not leave it with Samuel to select the person to be anointed from Jesse's family. He told him to go there and He would tell him, as if to intimate that He alone knew. It is a potential matter, but God knows the end from the beginning, and acts accordingly. Samuel would have anointed Eliab; he said, "Surely the Lord's anointed is before him". @1 Samuel 16:6 But it was not surely, it was the very opposite. Even Samuel mistook what was natural for true kingly qualities. Now, when David comes in, the word is, "this is he", and what is noted is not his kingly qualities, but his personal beauty, which is a point of importance, showing that beauty according to God belongs to those who are in His mind for royalty. If I am to have power with the brethren -- for that is the idea of royalty, that I have power with God and with men -- I must be attractive to them, for spiritual and moral beauty is of great importance. I am not to be personally repulsive or objectionable, or I shall never excel amongst them. I may be able to speak well and
{97}
be intelligent in the things of God, but if I am not personally attractive I do not find a way in which to move among the brethren. It is said of Asher that "he shall yield royal dainties", @Genesis 49: 20. That must come out in a man who is personally attractive; and what is stressed with David at the outset, is that "he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to" @1 Samuel 16:12, and then we get his name for the first time (@Ruth 4: 17 - 22 would be written after David was anointed), the name meaning "beloved", verse 13. One has to be beloved if he is to excel among the brethren in service.
P.L. So the first word in @Psalm 45 is, "Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever".
J.T. That is, the full thought of the Spirit of God is given, in the writer taking account of Him thus. Applying it to Christ, what we see is heaven's intense delight in Him; He is delightful to heaven. "Thou art my beloved Son" @Luke 3:22, is said, and also, "This is my beloved Son" @Luke 9:35. Applying this to ourselves, I am given to understand by heaven that I am attractive personally, and then others are given to understand it. I believe this matter of personal attractiveness is an essential element in service; if I am to be a power and influence among the brethren I must be attractive to them -- that is, in the sense in which Christ was attractive.
Ques. Does Isaiah deal with that when he says, "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him" @Isaiah 42: l?
J.T. Exactly. The voice from heaven refers to Christ as a Man here, heaven watching Him for thirty years before making the announcement. What you find with David is that this feature of personal attractiveness goes through. Even as facing Goliath on the field, the Spirit of God tells us that he was "ruddy, and besides of a beautiful countenance" @1 Samuel 17:42. You would hardly expect
{98}
it in such circumstances, but it is to bring out what Christ was personally; even before the cross, in Gethsemane, and before the high priest -- all those circumstances did not efface the beauty that was there.
W.H.W. Do you get the same thought in the Song of Songs, when the bride says, "My beloved is white and ruddy", @Song of Songs 5: 10?
J.T. Quite so; but that is only one item. She gives you a full life-sized picture, beginning with the head. She represents the work of God in us, bringing us to an appreciation of the beauty of Christ, but it was all there before. God saw it before.
Ques. It was said of Saul, "behold, he is praying", @Acts 9: 11. Would that support what you are saying?
J.T. That is one of the traits marking a man who does not depend on himself in his service. It came out with the Lord -- as He was baptised He came up out of the water and was praying.
Ques. Is personal beauty connected with the way in which moral qualities are seen?
J.T. Beauty in the sight of God lies in what is moral. David's ruddiness, for instance, denotes the energy of life in Christ. "When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him", @Isaiah 53: 2; that is, the unregenerate eye sees nothing in Christ, but faith sees everything -- every feature of moral beauty is there.
G.H.M. Was that what Moses¬ mother appreciated in Moses at the beginning of his life?
J.T. Yes. They saw the child was beautiful, or fair to God, that is, they saw what was there potentially. So, in after years, it was said of Moses that "he was king in Jeshurun" @Deuteronomy 33:5, that is, a righteous people regarded him as king, and obeyed him.
W.L. Have you in mind that these features are suggested in the opening verses of @2 Samuel 23?
J.T. Those verses give you David's last words. It says, "David the son of Jesse saith ..." That word
{99}
"saith" introduces something oracularly, not an ordinary saying, but a word commanding special attention. In this case, only a man like David could utter it, for he was the king. He represented the idea, and so he says, "the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel saith, The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, and his word was on my tongue. The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, The ruler among men shall be just, ruling in the fear of God; and he shall be as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, a morning without clouds; when from the sunshine, after rain, the green grass springeth from the earth". These are his last words, and they are full of meaning as to kingship. It is a question of results in the earth, the springing up of grass from the earth as by clear shining after rain. This is all to be built up in us; royalty being built up through suffering. As having the Spirit through redemption, believers are capable of these things. The main thought in the first part of David's history is his beauty, his attractiveness, and then the sufferings coming upon him throughout the whole of the book of Samuel; for from chapter 16 and onward you get that feature of suffering. Then we have the anointing again by the people. It is said in @2 Samuel 5: 1 - 3, "Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel. And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel". What God saw at the outset, is now seen by the people after all the suffering; that is, they see royalty now; it is there. So it is, I believe, in all cases where service is to be accepted and carried on, we must look
{100}
for the brethren's anointing as well as God's; and this will depend on whether there is that attractiveness maintained and that royalty that characterises every effective service.
A.H.G. Why does it say in chapter 23, "The anointed of the God of Jacob"?
J.T. David links on with Jacob in view of the house. In proposing to build the house he speaks of a "habitation for the mighty God of Jacob". What you might call the great burden of David's life and service was the house, and so it should be with every one who serves. It is a question of God having a dwelling here. The thought of the house came out in Jacob, not in Abraham. The kingdom subserves the house; the royal activity here in the anointing, is to provide material that there should be a habitation for God; the anointing in chapter 5 alludes to this. We are told how old he was, which is another point of importance, and then that he goes to Zion. Then he brings the ark up, and then he has it in his heart to build the house. That is the order in these chapters, inclusive of chapter 7.
David's age here denotes *full* manhood. Manhood in Numbers was reckoned at twenty years for the ordinary Israelite, but for the Levite it was thirty, and here we are expressly told that "David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years. In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah". That is, he is content with the smaller kingdom. God did not anoint him primarily to reign over Judah only; He anointed him to be king over Israel, but he has to wait for seven and a half years after he began to reign, for the greater part of his dominion. I believe the point is whether at that age -- full manhood -- I can be content with less than I think I should have, or less than God intended I should have, because we are apt to be discontented and think we ought to have more influence than we have.
{101}
But David has to be content for seven and a half years with one tribe. That is a test for a servant.
W.W.S.F. Is that what John refers to when he speaks of the kingdom and patience of Jesus; @Revelation 1: 9?
J.T. That is it. Paul says, "The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance", @2 Corinthians 12: 12. We do not get all at once what we may think God intended for us; we have to be tried to see how we get along with a little: "He that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much", @Luke 16: 10.
G.H.M. We are coming now to speak of what is administrative -- does moral qualification precede that?
J.T. That is what I thought. The sufferings depicted in 1 Samuel prepare for the second book, so that the tribute here is "Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel". Even while Saul was king, David served in a royal way. That is a great test to patience, for it is very irksome to do the work of another when he is adverse to you. For instance, if a brother in the meeting is older, and has a place by age, and lets everybody know that he has it, others who are more spiritual, it may be, have to do the work. Well, that is very irksome service, but God sees that patience exists, and that one can be subject and wait on Him. David refused to lift a finger to remove Saul; he said that God would do it.
Ques. Would that spirit be seen in Paul when he said, "Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved", @2 Corinthians 12: 15?
J.T. Yes. Is that not a great test, to be serving where the brethren do not think much of you?
G.H.M. So in chapter 23 it mentions the "sweet psalmist of Israel" before the "ruler among men".
J.T. That is good. He had his power of psalmody by experience, for the idea of a psalm is experience with God.
{102}
Ques. What are we to learn from the leading out and bringing in of Israel?
J.T. It refers to what is personal; he came in and went out amongst them; he was personally attractive and did the work; he served in a kingly way before he sat on the throne. The Pope remains in the Vatican and only very few see him; if he travelled about the world people would think less of him, but he adds to his dignity in their eyes by seclusion; there is nothing to show morally. Whereas it was said of Elijah, after his great experience at the brook and at the Jordan and then at Sidon, "Go, *shew thyself* to Ahab", @1 Kings 18: 1. The suggestion is that Elijah has made great spiritual progress. It is a question of what the man was himself, and so, in the scripture alluded to in @1 Samuel 18, it is said, "he went out and came in before the people. And David prospered in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him. And Saul saw that he prospered well, and he stood in awe of him. But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them" @1 Samuel 18:13 - 16. First it says that Jonathan loved him, and then the women sang his praises, saying that he slew his ten thousands, and then it says that "all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them". That is what he was personally; there was personal attraction with him.
Ques. Would that be seen when they put their arms about the apostle's neck and kissed him; @Acts 20: 37?
J.T. "That they would no more see his face", showing what a place he had in their hearts. That is one of the greatest things amongst those who serve, to be attractive personally. So the first thing is that David went in and out amongst them, and they all loved him. And then we have here, "thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel". We may lead them out and not bring them back. Leading Israel out involves new features of the truth, new conflicts it may
{103}
be, and some may go astray. We have to watch that they are all brought back. So, when the ark moved, Moses said, "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thy face" @Numbers 10:35; but when it returned he said, "Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel" @Numbers 10:36 they are all there, not a man is lost. The point is to bring the people in again, and that is what David did, and under very difficult circumstances, for the influence of Saul was always against him.
Ques. Was it not seen in the recovery of everything after the captivity? All the various instruments were brought back.
J.T. That is right. Those Cyrus returned were "counted". And Ezra with great care brought other vessels back to Jerusalem. Not only by number were all restored, but by *weight* also; that is, recovered brethren have moral value.
Rem. The Lord says in @John 17, of the men that the Father had given Him, that He had lost none.
J.T. That is an excellent example for us. It is a sorrowful thing to lose any of the brethren. David led them out and brought them in.
Now, the first thing he does as anointed over all Israel, is that he goes to Jerusalem. "And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; and they spoke to David, saying, Thou shalt not come in hither, but the blind and the lame will drive thee back; as much as to say, David will not come in hither. But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David. And David said on that day, Whoever smites the Jebusites and gets up to the watercourse, and the lame and the blind hated of David's soul ... ! Therefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David", @2 Samuel 5: 6 - 9. He takes the stronghold of Zion, and then calls it the city of David; this is,
{104}
typically, Christ securing a place in our hearts. That is what is meant by the stronghold of Zion; it is the saints viewed by God as taken up sovereignly; thus their hearts are to be invaded and occupied. So "David dwelt in the stronghold".
Ques. What is the spiritual meaning of the lame and the blind which are hated of David's soul?
J.T. It is the state of people in those circumstances. David overcomes in spite of those conditions.
Ques. Is it what may characterise men spiritually, that they are lame and blind?
J.T. It is what characterises christendom now; Christ dwells in the hearts of His own, nevertheless.
P.L. Would lameness go with unrighteousness, and blindness with unholiness? "Holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord", @Hebrews 12:14.
J.T. Very good. They were hated of David's soul. These elements are repugnant to the Lord; but David took the stronghold of Zion, and then the passage says, "So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from the Millo and inward. And David became continually greater".
W.A.W. What is the significance of Joab going up first? He represented things that were directly opposite to the spiritual or moral beauties seen in David.
J.T. It does not say *here* that he went up. There is an ellipsis in verse 8 to remind us that his part is not put in. It is very interesting that in this setting what Joab represents has no place. Joab represents ministry on the principle of gift; he was a man of ability. In the corresponding passage in Chronicles, he takes the stronghold and repairs the rest of the city. That is, Joab has to do with the external side of things. It is most important in its place; but there are times in the assembly when gift is out of place; when there may be no need for a word, but it is a matter of what the Lord Himself says or does. So *David* takes the
{105}
stronghold here. It is to call attention to that side; that there are times when it is not instrumentality but the Lord Himself that would impress us. Sometimes in assembly a brother may get up and give a discourse, as if it were a question of gift or ministry, but I think the ellipsis here means that it should be left out, that under these circumstances it is left out for a purpose, and we have to understand why it is left out. The New Translation gives you the ellipsis, and you have to go to Chronicles for the account of Joab's part in the taking of Zion. Here it is a question of what is spiritual, of what Christ is Himself in His royal traits, and that He lays hold of the hearts of the people and indwells them in spite of the conditions spoken of. The watercourse is alluded to, suggesting the Holy Spirit in the hearts of the people of God.
H.A. Following the ellipsis, the passage says, "Therefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house". Could you help us on that?
J.T. That is a *saying*; such sayings are spiritual truisms. How abhorrent lameness and blindness are in the house -- every spiritual brother or sister knows that; and one has to judge oneself so that one is not marked by those features.
J.McK. Is the city taken in @Matthew 21 in the power of the Lord's personal attractiveness, and are the blind and the lame made immediately available for service? "And blind and lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them", @Matthew 21:14.
J.T. Quite so, the lameness and blindness ceased; that is the point. It is when it does not cease, notwithstanding that the power for healing is present, that it is hateful.
Ques. Is there anything at the present moment that would answer to taking the stronghold and dwelling in Zion?
J.T. It is what is going on at the present time. Zion represents the sovereign selection of God for His
{106}
dwelling: "here will I dwell, for I have desired it", @Psalm 132: 14. David understood what was in the mind of God; and what is meant is a dwelling in the hearts of God's people -- that is where He dwells. "He that abides in love abides in God, and God in him", @1 John 4: 16. The assembly is the full thought of it, where God loves and delights to dwell. David understood it, and that was the great thought of his life, to provide a dwelling-place for the mighty God of Jacob. "But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David". And then he gives it a name; he calls it "the city of David".
E. G. It says in both @2 Samuel 5 and @1 Chronicles 11 that David became continually greater.
J.T. That is an important point. And in taking the stronghold of Zion David rises to a type of Christ. Notice how his fame became extended; indeed, it is said of Hiram that he was "ever a lover of David", (@1 Kings 5: 1), and here it says, "And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house". Christ dwells in believer's hearts now; @Ephesians 3: 17. Then the battle against the Philistines in the end of this chapter is to set aside the big religious man that stands in the way of all this.
The next thing is to bring the ark to Zion. The ark represents the power and glory of God. 2 Corinthians brings that in: "that the surpassingness of the power may be of God" (@2 Corinthians 4: 7); it is not man's power but *God's* power. Whilst David has all these characteristics of beauty and royalty, we come back to another view, that Christ is the power of God, and the glory of God, that the excellency of the power is not to be of man but of God. I believe that is what is meant in chapter 6, that royalty, great as it is, recognised the ark as the great thought of the power of God in those lowly circumstances. So that David danced before it: "And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of Jehovah
{107}
had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatted beast. And David danced before Jehovah".
P.L. Do you see that principle in Philippians, Paul referring to the stoop in love of Christ Jesus in chapter 2, and then using all the authority and influence he has to lead the Philippians in joy: "Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice", @Philippians 4: 4. Would that be like David dancing before the ark?
J.T. There is a link there. I do not think we have perhaps clearly distinguished in our minds the difference between David, and the ark, and then sonship later on. These are all features of Christ, but then they are also in a sense types of the saints. In chapter 6 there is the idea of royalty giving way; it is seen in David dancing before the symbol of divine power -- Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
W.A.W. So David says in @2 Samuel 22: 51: "It is he who giveth great deliverances to his king".
J.T. Yes. He was dependent on God, even as king; and he is recognising here with the greatest spiritual intelligence, that this lowly vessel, the ark, was the power of God. No adverse power can stand before it.
Ques. Why have we the detail that David "was girded with a linen ephod"?
J.T. It is to bring out the sobriety that belongs to these circumstances. Linen is a fabric that has great power for absorption of moisture as over against wool, which promotes heat. It is intended to represent sobriety, self-control, in the things of God, for whilst David was so active and energetic, he was sober. As Paul said, "I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness", @Acts 26: 25.
H.H-s. Had you any thought in regard to the fact that David brought up the ark? It is not only called David's city, but he wants the ark there.
J.T. It is to bring out what was the great thought of his life. It is the city of David; that is a fixed matter;
{108}
now it is to be devoted to the ark; it is to be the area for the presence of God in the excellency of His power. That is what he has in mind; and it seems to me that should be in every one of our minds in our service that in us the power of God is known. Of Simon Magus¬ exploits it was said, "This is the power of God which is called great" @Acts 8:10, but it was but the effect of "magic arts". And Antichrist will come "in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish", "whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood"@2 Thessalonians 2:9,10.
R.A. You have referred to three distinctions David the king, the ark, and sonship. You have given the connection as to the first two; what is the relationship of sonship with the thought of royalty?
J.T. That comes out in chapter 7. After all this display of reverence before the ark, David had in his mind that he should build a house for Jehovah. He dwelt in a house of cedar, but the ark was under curtains. It was a right exercise, and he spoke to Nathan about it, who said, "Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee" @2 Samuel 7:3. But Jehovah spoke to Nathan that night to tell David he was not to build the house, but that his seed would build the house -- not his son, but his seed. And Jehovah said, "I will be his father, and he shall be my son" @2 Samuel 7:14. That is, it is one no less than God's son that is to build the house. That is the third feature; and 1 Chronicles develops this great thought of sonship, that it is the son that is to build the house. It is Christ viewed in another light; it is not the military man, but a son; the house is to be built with a view to affection.
Ques. What is the thought in "when they that bore the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatted beast"?
J.T. Well, it is spiritually the last step. David had the finish in his mind. There was an end to be reached, which is an important matter in our service: shall I reach the end? The oxen had already stumbled and
{109}
Uzzah was slain. All that is most serious. Is it to be repeated? Such things have happened in the history of the saints, and it is for me to see that in my case it is not to be repeated; the exercise is to go on to the finish. So he sacrifices "an ox and a fatted beast". It means Christ apprehended in His sure-footedness and steady walk; He does not stumble. And God is able to keep us from stumbling, and present us faultless before His glory. The apostle says, "So that I finish my course", @Acts 20:24. I suppose the "fatted beast" would mean that in such an exercise, I am prosperous spiritually.
G.H.M. Do you think royalty is a means to an end? Does it lead on to priesthood?
J.T. Yes; it refers to what is morally great here, in the administrative service of God.
W.A.W. What is the particular element set out in that which despises the deportment of the king? It is said that Michal "despised him in her heart".
J.T. That is common with all of us. Michal is not characterised as being against David; it is said that she loved him; many love Christ today, connecting Him with what is respectable in the world, but when He is seen in reproach they despise Him. This comes out in the way His own who accept the reproach of Christ are regarded. Even the person nearest to you in the flesh may despise you. She is not ready to go the whole way; she looks through a window, that is, she retains her dignity, while he is outside expressing his worshipful regard for God in the ark.
Ques. Is that why she is spoken of as the daughter of Saul and not the wife of David?
J.T. Quite so; it is to show that that element was there unjudged.
W.S.F. In @Acts 3 the lame man as healed goes in leaping and praising God. As lame he could not enter the temple, but when healed he not only went in, but was leaping and praising God.
{110}
J.T. Peter said to him: "In the name of Jesus Christ the *Nazaraean* rise up and walk" @Acts 3:6, that is, the Man in *reproach*. And moreover, Peter says, "Look on us". Well, who were they? They were Galileans having no religious status. But in spite of all that the healing comes, and the man walks and leaps and praises God. I think the connection there with what is before us is good.
{111}
HEADSHIP SEEN IN DAVID
@Psalm 89: 19 - 27; @1 Chronicles 23: 1 - 6; @1 Chronicles 29: 10, 11, 23 - 25
J.T. It may be remarked that we considered royalty in David yesterday, so that it seems as if *headship* in David would be a fitting subject to follow.
In considering the subject of royalty we proceeded as far as David dancing before the ark as it approached mount Zion. Whilst David rises at times to a type of Christ personally, he also represents the *royal* feature in the saints, for it is only in the saints we should look for dancing before the ark, which is a type of Christ personally, as the power of God and the glory of God. That is, in occupation administratively with the things of God, we are to serve royally, but we come to recognise that the excellency of the power is of God and not of us. Then it was pointed out that there is an additional feature immediately, namely, sonship as seen in the passage in @2 Samuel 7. Sonship is introduced without Solomon being named, although he is alluded to as the seed of David.
The subject of sonship stands allied with what is before us today, for it is a son who is head. If we are to reach headship, we have to follow this line; that is, we come to sonship, and then we enter on an experience of displacement; Solomon the son is in mind as displacing David, but the displacement really implies merging, as this psalm shows. It shows that David was regarded as a son, for it is said in verse 26: "*He* shall call unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation", and then Jehovah says, "And as to me, I will make him firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth". So that we have to bear in mind that David is the great governing idea -- David viewed as a type of Christ -- and as we progress to sonship we must not lose sight of him; David tells us himself in @1 Chronicles 28, that he was made "king over Israel *for ever*", @1 Chronicles 28:4.
{112}
So that it is David's throne, but whilst it is the throne of David on which Solomon sits, it is also the throne of Jehovah -- which is to be noted in the last chapter: "And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father". We are now definitely in the presence of sonship installed on the throne of Jehovah, and it is in this connection that the thought of headship appears formally; David refers to Jehovah as "Head above all". So that, bearing these things in mind, by the Lord's help, we may consider David as accepting the substitution of the son for himself in @1 Chronicles 17. Solomon is spoken of before he was born, in chapter 17 and in @2 Samuel 7, but as he is born our attention is called to him: David calls him Solomon, and then he is prophetically called Jedidiah; that is, he is *peace* to David, but he is *beloved* of Jehovah. He is prophetically indicated as one whom Jehovah loves. The prophetic word is what brings the thing home to us in its initial stage; that is, Nathan announces him as Jedidiah, and so we are to understand that the one who sat on the throne of Jehovah, is loved of Jehovah.
S.H. If the thought of rule is connected with what is kingly, would you say what is connected with headship?
J.T. Headship is in wisdom, in allocating responsibility to all the saints and in the ordering of their service: disclosing the wisdom of God. Christ is said to be "made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption", @1 Corinthians 1: 30. He is made that on God's part, and in due course He comes to be apprehended as allocating responsibility, and then as ordering the various services of the kingdom and the house. So David in chapter 23 installs Solomon his son on the throne with himself. The features represented respectively in David and Solomon run on together; and then you have immediately the number of the Levites, thirty-eight thousand, and their responsibility; twenty-four thousand of them to preside over the work
{113}
of the house, six thousand for officers and judges, four thousand for doorkeepers, and four thousand singers. That is, the son is on the throne -- David yet on it, too -- and you have the great general thought of the distribution of responsibility to the Levites; so that headship in Christ becomes apprehended in this way. Romans, for instance, brings Him in as Lord, that is, He is in the place of authority, and then He begins to be personally great to us; "much more" is repeatedly said of Him, so that He becomes increasingly great to us morally. In Corinthians, He is "made to us wisdom" @1 Corinthians 1:30, and in that epistle it is said that His head is God: "the Christ's head God", chapter 11: 3. But then in Colossians He is Head to us on personal grounds; He is formally called the Son of the Father's love, into whose kingdom we are introduced, and He is said to be "head of the body, the assembly", chapter 1: 18 that is the full statement; so that the believer learns to look to Him for guidance; we hold the Head. That is to say, we have to do with matters that have never been considered before; well, He comes in in that way, and it is not a question of what is commanded, but of what you will get from Christ at the particular time. As we acquire knowledge of Him as Head, we are never baffled, we get wisdom from Him. Then in Ephesians, He is said to be "head over all things to the assembly" (chapter 1: 22); that is, you see the full bearing of His headship.
Ques. Do you connect vision with headship? I was thinking of the expression, "Where there is no vision the people cast off restraint", @Proverbs 29: 18.
J.T. A vision is very special -- something additional to headship. We have commandments which are the test to us, as set out in Romans and 1 Corinthians in the main; but then Colossians is headship; Christ is the Head of the body, and as we reach that ground, we learn to look for fresh living impulses affording
{114}
light, guidance and general resourcefulness resulting in increase with the increase of God.
P.L. Would the test case at the beginning of Solomon's reign in regard to the two women suggest that line of things?
J.T. That is a good illustration of what we are saying. In 1 Chronicles sonship is passive, as you might say; it is Solomon coming into view and being recognised. But in 1 Kings it is active; the case of the mothers of the children coming in after David died, is a test case. It is a question of bringing out headship, the wisdom we can rely on in Christ. Such cases come up constantly. There are commandments, that is, great general principles and precedents, but then, there are difficulties not hitherto encountered, and these require fresh light from the Lord.
P.L. Yes, questions that involve light. Headship involves the solution of such questions, and therefore requires spiritual instincts in us as much as light and intelligence.
J.T. Quite so. You find that Solomon spoke of life in all its features; I mean, life in its lower grades, animal life and vegetable life; so that as Head, the Lord deals with various movements and phases of life. Difficulties arising, there are great general principles to go by, but we need something which the Lord alone can give, and hence we go to Him as Head. Thus all becomes plain and there is general edification and increase.
P.L. So that the varied forms of evil in satanic opposition are divinely allowed to lead us to draw upon the wealth of our Head in resurrection?
J.T. That is the thought. So those two mothers bringing the child may be viewed as applicable to any assembly trouble. Through headship there is discernment as to who is the mother of the child; that is to say, maternal exercises and affections are manifestly a guide. Those that are concerned about the saints can
{115}
count on this; and they will desire that none should be lost, nor suffer damage.
J.C.M.W. With regard to David in @2 Samuel 7, would you say a word as to Nathan's message, and why he is brought in?
J.T. Nathan is the prophetic side. We have already alluded to him as indicating Jehovah's love for Solomon. But now he concurs with David as to his exercise, evidently without seeking the mind of God. David thought he would build a house for Jehovah, and Nathan said, "Go, do all that is in thy heart, for Jehovah is with thee" @1 Chronicles 17:2. But apparently Nathan was below his office; he was simply concurring in what the king suggested, whereas his office was to furnish the mind of God. However excellent our exercises may seem to be, we must have the mind of God; and so the word of the Lord came to Nathan that night. Adjustment was needed, and so he tells David that he is *not* to build the house: his seed -- who should withal be Jehovah's son -- would build the house. Therefore, the thought is impressed upon us prophetically; it is a way that God has of impressing us. Beyond the mere statement of a thing, a prophet impresses you with it as the mind of God. David accepts it at once, and in the light of the prophetic announcement by Nathan he goes in and sits before Jehovah. He is not resentful, on the contrary he accepts the mind of God thankfully; he moves in the light of sonship, for in truth it applies to himself, according to @Psalm 89. So he went in and sat before Jehovah; he has liberty not only to go in, but to sit before Jehovah.
W.T. I was wondering whether Proverbs would give us the details of what you are saying, where a son receives counsel, that he might know instruction and wisdom. Then, in the Song of Songs we have Solomon's communications in love, and the outcome in both books is that there might be a counterpart for Christ.
{116}
J.T. just so; in truth the whole book of Proverbs enters into our enquiry today; for, as Colossians says, the Father has "translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love" @Colossians 1:13, and it is in that setting you get headship. The epistle goes on to tell us that "he is the head of the body, the assembly" @Colossians 1:18. The book of Proverbs leads on to headship, opening up wisdom as applicable to various conditions with which we have to do.
W.F. Would the prayer in @Colossians 1 be in line with what you are saying? -- "That ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding", verse 9.
J.T. Yes. We have to come to it, to get as it were beyond commandments, and yet not beyond them, for principles always stand. It is more important really to retain the principles than the persons with whom we are linked. John would stress persons; and they are all great persons -- a hundred and fifty-three *great* fishes. But without minimising the value of the saints, the principles come first morally, and if we put the persons before the principles, we shall probably lose both. We may keep the persons, but we will keep them to their loss and ours too. The levitical family of Gershon had to do with the curtains of the tabernacle and such features, which would mean the principles governing us; whereas Merari had to do with the boards and the pillars and such things, which refer to persons.
A.N. Would you say that the only way in which persons can be preserved is by being true to the principles?
J.T. That is right. We may preserve them literally by putting them before the principles, submerging the principles to keep them, but in truth we do not preserve people in this way: they can be kept according to God only by maintaining divine principles in relation to them. Faith would maintain the principles at all costs.
A.N. In connection with Levi in @Exodus 32, when it was a question of principles they used the sword,
{117}
but ultimately it became the preservation of the people.
J.T. Yes. The use of the sword there, as you say, was to maintain principles. They slew the persons, but in maintaining the principles they maintained the whole position for God.
W.S.S. In connection with the thought of headship, I would like to ask as to the way in which it is reached. In the case of David, he had been through the conflict and was victorious before the thought of headship came into view.
J.T. Already you have Solomon in a small way. First, you have him announced prophetically in chapter 17 of this book and chapter 7 of 2 Samuel, but in chapter 12 of 2 Samuel he is born, that is, he is there is a *small* way. He has come upon the scene after great suffering on David's part. What will David call him? He called him what fitted in with his own state at the time; he called him by a name signifying *peaceful*. But the prophetic announcement comes, that he is "beloved of Jehovah". Those are two elements in the soul that lead on to headship.
W.S.S. I was thinking that the principles that have been spoken of had been settled in the conflict of David prior to this time.
J.T. Well, they had been settled to a point, but much in this respect transpired after sonship was announced in @2 Samuel 7. David immediately has to enter on fresh wars, and before the birth of Solomon there is his own great crime, which he fully owns. Then, after the birth of Solomon, you have the terrible sword of Jehovah in David's own house: the sword should never depart from his house. He had to learn that, and go through the awful experience involved in Absalom's rebellion, bringing out very great principles. So that you have the thought of sonship in a *small* way, and prophetically, and then it is gradually developed; and what is really in view in 1 Chronicles is to bring us on to the *fulness* of it. First he is on the throne alongside
{118}
of David; David is still on the throne in chapter 23, but in the end of the book David dies. But for the full type we have to regard the death of David rather as sonship in him, *merging* in Solomon, that is, from the standpoint of @Psalm 89; thus we have come on to the full thought of headship in Christ; that is, He is on the Father's throne, but He is there as the Son.
A.H.G. In speaking of Solomon introduced in a small way, were you linking that up in your mind with the apprehension of Christ as Head in Romans?
J.T. I was. He comes in there informally, but nevertheless forcefully. It is the "much more" of chapter 5; it begins to grow with you. Romans begins with sonship; it is the gospel of God's Son, and in the early part of chapter 5 we have received the reconciliation through the death of God's Son. He is there in that way, but it is the "much more", I believe, that begins to dawn on you, that this Person who is your Saviour, is the One you can turn to in everything; hence in chapter 7 we are to be to Another, who has been raised from among the dead.
W.F. Would it be in line, that in the latter part of chapter 5 the new Head comes in in contrast to Adam?
J.T. Yes. It is the "much more"; you can reckon on all that is needed being found in Him.
W.S.S. So the "much more" would link on with the last chapter of 1 Chronicles. You have Adam to begin the book, and Christ in type as Son at the end.
J.T. That is it. In the end of the book you see how the line runs on; it is the son on the throne, and not now the throne of David, but of Jehovah. I think it is the first time you have the expression, "the throne of Jehovah".
J.McK. Why is it on the throne of Jehovah that royal majesty is vested in Solomon? Is that the thought of the merging you spoke of?
J.T. Yes. It is to stress the full thought of sonship. Solomon being still young, it is not a question of
{119}
maturity, but the carrying forward of sonship. From the time of its introduction in this book the idea of sonship is growing in your mind, until you come to its fulness, and you have such majesty as had not been before; later on in Solomon's reign you see it even more fully. It shines in the building of the house and the setting up of the service of God there.
J.McK. Would you say a word as to the difference between royalty and majesty?
J.T. They are very nearly alike. The word for royalty is simply that it is kingly, and the idea of a king is a man who is able and can do things. So we begin to see it in Christ, how He did things, with what dignity He did them, the unselfish dignified power that marked Him in doing them -- you have all that allied with majesty. Peter says, "having been eye-witnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom *I* have found my delight; and this voice *we* heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain", @2 Peter 1: 16 - 18.
G.M. Do you get this thought reflected in "the princes, and the mighty men" here?
J.T. Just so.
Rem. They submitted themselves to Solomon.
J.T. "And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king". All such princely power is seen submitting to this supreme power. It is not merely official, it is *superior*. Anyone who saw the Lord Jesus on the mount would perceive this superiority in Him owned as Son. Peter expresses this in the passage just quoted.
Ques. Do I understand that in headship we have all the resources of wisdom and that in what is prophetic we have the mind of God for any given moment?
{120}
J.T. Yes. Nathan represents this side of prophecy; he brings in the mind of God at any given time. You do get "the book of Nathan" mentioned, but it is not extant; his was *current* prophetic ministry, the mind of God for his time. So when David sinned, Nathan spoke his parable and said to David, "Thou *art* the man". It is the present moment with Nathan. Then, when Solomon is born, it is said that God "sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah" @2 Samuel 12:25; that is a present thing. It is a great matter to have a prophetic ministry of this kind. It means that the truth for the moment is driven home as from God; there is *power* in the ministry of prophecy, compare @1 Corinthians 14.
Ques. Would you say that it was kingship when Jesus spoke to Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus, and headship when he sent Ananias to speak to him?
J.T. Just so, although I think we might really include the thought of headship in the word to Saul: "*I* am Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest" @Acts 9:5. His *body* was implied, but then the situation in Damascus was complicated, and it fits in, as you suggest. But the Lord's authority is evident in each case. Today constant difficulties arise involving complications which are the result of local conditions among the brethren, so that there is always something to adjust. The Lord says to Saul, "enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do" @Acts 9:6. But then, what is in the city? If we have to do with any meeting, what is in the meeting? Here is a matter to be settled -- is there a priest there? Was Ananias a priest? Could a convert be entrusted to him -- an "elect vessel" indeed, in his early stages? No, and yet the Lord says, "enter into the *city*". He did not say, Go to Ananias. He had something in the city; the Lord will see to that, He controls it, and if any meeting has to deal with a complicated matter He will qualify the brethren, as they are subject, to deal with it. So He goes before and speaks to Ananias; He calls
{121}
him by name and he hearkens -- meaning that the Lord knows the saints by name in the meeting. He tells him about Saul and says, "go into the street which is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas one by name Saul, he is of Tarsus: for behold, he is praying" @Acts 9:11. What a subject that is for a priest! A new convert, and he is praying, and the Lord is sending him to him. But Ananias did not move as a priest. He said, This man is so and so; he went back to earlier history, but earlier history is nothing, it is what the man's state is *now*. And the Lord says, "Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me" @Acts 9:15. He adjusted Ananias, and Ananias went and acted as a priest. So, as you take up things locally, the idea of wisdom or resource comes in there, in the way the Lord prepares us for serving others.
A.N. If a local difficulty is prolonged, would that indicate any defect on our side, as to our condition? The resources are there in the Lord as Head, but evidently we are unable to get the benefit of it. Why is that?
J.T. That leads us to what we are seeking to understand. If we have come to the idea of Solomon in a small way in our souls, even in the small way of @2 Samuel 12 as a babe, he suggests *peace* to us. That is one great feature leading up to the good of headship. Are there sons of peace? The Lord stresses the thought of "sons of peace". You can have no assembly features aside from "sons of peace". That is what David meant in naming the child Solomon; he saw peace in the child. But then alongside of that, he is "beloved of Jehovah", and that is another element. If I have these in my soul, they will help me to make room for the Head. I am a son of peace and I apprehend love. The Father loves the Son, and He loves all that are related to Him as sons; for as we have often remarked in regard to "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight": it does not say "all my delight"; there is room left for all the saints, and we come into that.
{122}
The more we come into those two thoughts, the more room is made for Christ as Head: the thought grows on us. David went in and sat before Jehovah in the liberty of sonship. Any of us can do that, and so he moves on until -- according to @1 Chronicles 29 -- the son is on the throne in absolute dominion; and we may be sure that if the Lord has right of way, every matter will be settled. It is because He does not get His way that matters locally are prolonged and not settled. Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah, which means absolute dominion for sonship.
W.S.S. David, we may say, faced every difficulty, and the result of that was that in 1 Chronicles the truth of sonship came to light.
J.T. Just so; he is a man that is effective in that way; but then, these elements come into our souls, the element of peace and of being beloved of the Father. Jehovah said of David, "I will make him firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth", @Psalm 89: 27. That is the idea; sonship applied to David and is now, as merged in Solomon, seen absolutely dominant in the end of chapter 29 -- every power is subject.
A.H.G. You referred to headship in Corinthians -- I was wondering whether you linked that up in your mind with what you were saying as to difficulties.
J.T. That epistle shows how difficulties are met; they are met in *wisdom*; wisdom is introduced at the outset in that epistle.
J.C.M.W. Would chapter 23 show that the gathering of the princes, priests, and Levites is essential for the gain of headship?
J.T. That is what we ought to seek to get clear. Chapters 23 to 27 are set directly in relation to Solomon as on the throne with David. That is, David is still there, but Solomon is also on the throne, and the first thing you get is the numbering of the Levites and their work allocated, and then, speaking in a general way, you get the number *twenty-four*. I believe that number
{123}
has to be understood if we are to understand headship. It is, as it were, double what you had before. The first twelve would be Moses, as I understand it; that is, applying the thought to the New Testament, the first twelve is Romans and Corinthians. The thought of headship was *suggested* in Moses, but in general, it is in the second twelve that I *apprehend* headship. I believe the second twelve is not understood. We can understand the commandment, but to have something beyond that, something additional that is always available, is what we do not understand, and that is what runs right through all these chapters from 23 to 27. You have the priests divided under that number, and the singers, and the doorkeepers and the military; they are all under that number. That is, everything is not only dominated by commandment, but by the additional thought of wisdom. You have wisdom in sonship now on the throne in Solomon alongside of David -- that is the additional thing. Both had existed in David, but now they are merging in Solomon, who represents fully the thought of sonship.
N.K.M. Why are we so lacking in the understanding of headship?
J.T. I think we do not keep near enough to the Lord; we are not enough in personal touch in making known our requests and holding converse with Him about matters. It begins in a small way, as I said before, but it grows until He is absolutely dominant. David dies, and Solomon is on the throne of Jehovah.
N.K.M. Would you see it set forth initially in Mary of Bethany sitting at His feet, and then anointing His head?
J.T. Yes, she embodies the thought. On the mount of transfiguration, @Luke 9, the word was, "Hear him", and Mary is the example of that in chapter 10; she is listening to what He is saying.
W.S.S. Is it also a question of the sanctuary? Would the second twelve be learnt there?
{124}
J.T. That is what David had in mind. As soon as Nathan's word comes to him about sonship, he goes into the sanctuary and sits there.
W.S.S. I was thinking of the psalm read. In the third book of Psalms, where they are mostly by Asaph, the sanctuary is prominent. In the first psalm of the book the writer goes into the sanctuary.
J.T. This @Psalm 89 is by one of the four wise men, Ethan the Ezrahite. It is an important psalm in that way. Ethan is eclipsed by Solomon, who is said to be wiser than he, @1 Kings 4: 31; but he is not resentful of this. He is speaking about David, and his supremacy. He would fully recognise the superiority of Solomon's wisdom.
P.L. Have we that in Colossians? "Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching ..." @Colossians 3:16 -- would that be the place that Solomon has? And then, "... admonishing one another, in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God" -- is that the language of Ethan, who has been eclipsed by Solomon, but as still rejoicing in him?
J.T. Just so. The wisest submit to Solomon; he is superior, no one can compare with him, and I think, as was remarked just now, it is a question of going inside, as in the third book of Psalms. The commandments are written down; we must stand on them immovably in maintaining for God, but then, there is the additional twelve, and I believe that is what David meant. When Nathan announced sonship, David went in and sat before the Lord. We do not follow that example sufficiently.
P.L. Are we amongst the additional twelve in the Colossian epistle? Paul and Epaphras of the sanctuary in their *prayers*, and Tychicus and Onesimus the *beloved* brothers, and then Luke the *beloved* physician. All these would be in the acknowledgment of headship?
J.T. Yes. It implies liberty of approach, so that
{125}
we may be near the Lord, so that His mind is conveyed to us. David went inside and sat there. It is not exactly a priestly position, for the priest *stands* in the house, as serving; @Psalm 134. But the son *sits*, and in sitting he speaks beautifully; he is pleasing to God. Headship involves Colossians and Ephesians. We are to be "filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding" (@Colossians 1: 9); and the first prayer in Ephesians is that we might have the "spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him" (@Ephesians 1: 17); and then, that we might be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man", @Ephesians 3: 16. These are conditions in us that enable us to be inside to gather up divine thoughts; and you make them effective as in the assembly. David tarried there. What impressions would come into David's soul as sitting before God! Referring back to chapters 23 to 27, one would like the brethren -- as they have opportunity to look into them, because they bring out what headship implies, how all the brethren, old and young, are considered. In the instructions as to the Levites, for instance, you will find the young are specially provided for, as at the end of chapter 24, "These likewise cast lots just as their brethren the sons of Aaron before David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief fathers of the priests and Levites, -- the chief fathers just as the youngest of their brethren" @1 Chronicles 24:31. Then again, in the next chapter, "they cast lots with one another over the charges, the small as well as the great, the teacher with the scholar" @1 Chronicles 25:8. That is to say, headship does not restrict itself to what there may be manifestly in the meeting. You may have brethren of age and experience, and it is manifest that they have been approved; but then there are potential elements in the meeting, there are young people who have not proved themselves -- but headship will provide for them. We need them, for if there are no young the testimony will die out.
{126}
C.W.D. Is it right to assume that ability for headship is in germ in the young?
J.T. Certainly, it is there potentially as soon as one receives Christ.
P.L. "Give this one the *living* child" @1 Kings 3:27 -- is that wisdom taking account of the potentialities for God?
J.T. That is right; potentiality is a great feature in the things of God. It is confirmed in the measure of the manna, an omer for every person in the house, old and young the same measure. Full-grown persons would eat more than the young children, but in the mind of God, the young children were to be of that measure, and as the meal was finished there was none over.
W.L. How are these potentialities to be fostered and developed in our local companies?
J.T. These chapters provide first of all for them. It is a great step in advance when young brothers and sisters are given to understand that they are not mere members of a congregation with no responsibility, but are actually covered by this number twenty-four. It is wisdom's ordering, for it follows the statement that David "made Solomon his son king over Israel". A young person ought to see that it gives him dignity in responsibility. It is the order of wisdom, and if we are in our places in it, we shall see how perfectly it works out.
We may notice that after the idea of the number twenty-four is fully set out, "David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the princes of the divisions that ministered to the king, and the captains over thousands, and the captains over hundreds, and the comptrollers of all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the chamberlains, and the mighty men, and all the men of valour, unto Jerusalem. And king David stood up upon his feet ..." Throughout these two chapters David speaks in great power and wisdom. The great thought
{127}
of headship is in his mind; he speaks of God as Head, and Solomon the son is seen on the throne of Jehovah. It is now in the Son and is dominant: it is, in type, Christ glorified embodying and establishing all that came out in Him in suffering here on earth.
Ques. Why do we get the number twenty-four in the Revelation?
J.T. The allusion is to this section. The position is that John is called up into heaven. God is about to resume His relations with the earth, and the throne is marked by the rainbow, and so forth. The allusion is to @Genesis 9; it is God's relations with creation. But then, if that throne had been introduced in @Genesis 9, you would have had no twenty-four elders. God was there, but the twenty-four elders were not there. The allusion is to this section; the twenty-four elders allude to the knowledge or experience acquired with God in the course of His testimony; In @Revelation 4 He has the full result of His testimony around His throne. The elders *know what to do and what to say*; they can give an account of things not otherwise understood.
Ques. Is that the great idea of headship, that you know what to do?
J.T. That is it. The twenty-four elders represent it as having had experience with God in the course of His testimony, of nearness to Him so as to have acquired a knowledge of His mind.
J.McK. In chapter 28, David committed to Solomon the particulars and design of the house and the porch, including the mercy-seat.
J.T. I am thankful you mention that. The time has come for it now, and it is all handed over to Solomon. You get no such unfolding as this anywhere else in the types. It is not like Moses; things were shown him on the mount. David had this by *the Spirit*, verse 12. Then, added to that, the dedicated things in chapter 26; every dedicated thing, whether of Samuel, or Saul, Abner, or Joab -- every dedicated thing is there; they
{128}
are held by the store-keepers. There are the doorkeepers and the treasury-keepers, those that look after the dedicated things, so that nothing is lost, everything dedicated is available for service.
Ques. Does the blessing of Asher in @Deuteronomy 33 show how what we have been speaking of may be maintained? "Asher shall be blessed with sons; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. Iron and brass shall be thy bolts; and thy rest as thy days". @Deuteronomy 33:24 - 25
J.T. He is blessed with sons. And if you connect that with his blessing in @Genesis 49, it is remarkable how it refers to both subjects -- royalty and sonship. He is said to yield royal dainties, and now he has sons.
P.L. Does the thought of the Lord's Person on which the Spirit of God has shed such light of late, link up with all this that had been in reserve coming to light when Solomon gets his supreme place? The light of His Person as revived and stressed at the end throws peculiar lustre upon every feature of the truth.
J.T. Hence the great need of being subject to Him so that we get the full bearing of what He is bringing before us. Every one is subject to Solomon here; there is no adverse thought at all, and if that state of things can be maintained amongst us, the Lord will do great things for us. If sonship is dominant there is great scope for the unfolding of the mind of God.
Ques. Is that what was in the apostle's mind in pressing in Hebrews the greatness of Christ as the Son, in contrast to everything else?
J.T. The sonship of Christ is the great distinctive feature of Hebrews. In the first chapter His greatness is filled out from the Old Testament, showing how God honours the Old Testament.
{129}
THE MAN OF OPENED EYE
@Mark 8: 22 - 26; @Numbers 24: 1 - 9
I wish to speak, dear brethren, about *eyesight*. This section of Mark is characterised by intense feelings on the part of Christ, in regard of conditions which He found in men whom He sought to serve. In John we have a corresponding section of intensified feelings on the part of the Lord, that is, chapters 11 and 12, feelings mainly occasioned by pressure upon the family of God; but Mark has men as such in mind, and the Lord here as serving them and feeling the state in them occasioned by sin. In chapter 7 we have a man who could not speak right and could not hear: the Lord sighed in regard of him. Then, in this chapter 8, the Pharisees asked for a sign and He sighed again. Then we have this blind man -- presenting a different condition to that in chapter 7.
I read the passage so as to link it on with @Numbers 24, as calculated to amplify what we find in @Mark 8. The subject is of the deepest importance; for we have to do today with peculiarly darkening influences, such as perhaps have not existed before; and hence the greater need for eyesight, a clear vision. If the visibility is bad, there is all the more need for power of vision; and the horizon today is terribly darkened, the darkness being intensified, so that it may be felt, and is felt, by those who are with God. Throughout Scripture you find allusions to the danger of poor sight. Peter speaks of some with whom certain features are not found, and says, "he that lacketh these things is blind" @2 Peter 1:9. They are nominal christians, perhaps real christians, but they are "blind, and cannot see afar off", and have forgotten that they are purged from their former sins, a most distressing state for any nominal christian to be in. Peter shows that it is because of their not having certain features in their faith, such as virtue, knowledge, and
{130}
so forth. They are persons who "cannot see afar off", and that raises the question as to the extent of our horizon.
In our meetings for prayer, for instance, do we include the whole field? It is said that the Lord bought the field, because of what was in it, and He is operating in it and looks for co-operation from us, and in no way can we co-operate more effectually than in prayer, and for this we must learn to include the whole field to enlarge our perspective. Then, another thing which is suggested in not seeing afar off, is the want of occupation anticipatively with the future.
You will remember the distinction made in @1 Samuel 9: 9 between a "seer" and a "prophet". Those who at that time were called prophets, were in earlier days called seers, that is, persons who saw. Not persons who went about the world to see the scenery; the Spirit of God attaches no importance to that whatever. The men of faith were not occupied with such things; they looked at spiritual things. We are told that they saw the promises afar off and embraced them (@Hebrews 11: 13); they looked for a city too, we are told, and the Lord Jesus said of one of them that he "rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad" (@John 8: 56); he saw it afar off. So that the idea of *seeing* laid hold of men, and men who saw things were subsequently called prophets.
These remarks will lead you to see what is in my mind, and also, I hope, will lead to an enquiry as to our practical eyesight; how we look at things, and even if our horizon be limited, whether we see the limited sphere clearly; even if it be a local matter to be settled or adjusted. That we may see and feel the difficulty is one thing, but to see *all* the circumstances attaching to it is another matter. The Lord would have us to see "all things clearly".
I want to point out from this scripture in Mark, how concerned the Lord was as to this matter; for Mark is building up circumstances that enhance the testimony,
{131}
that is the preaching and the teaching; and he presents the Lord as intensely concerned as to these cases of hearing and speaking in chapter 7, and of seeing in chapter 8. He takes the blind man outside of the town. If I have my eyes opened in the town I am apt to be influenced by what I see. Things are extremely irregular in the town; in the country things are ordered generally as coming from the hand of God. The creation of God is perfect in itself, and would never stumble or mislead anyone. A city will; a city is calculated to entangle; it is a formation that the devil has had to do with. The first city was built by Cain, and you may be sure Satan had a hand in that. When a murderer is occupied in building a city Satan makes some suggestions as to it, which would mean fall-traps for men. The cities are full of those things, and if one gets his *first* view in the city he will get a wrong one. It is no such view as God intended for a man. He never intended modern cities as proper places for believers; they present the very opposite.
So the Lord took the man outside of the town, and He put His hands upon him. I wish you to notice how important this particular case is. The details are remarkable, and they point surely to far more than the mere opening of the eyes of one man in the far-off village of Bethsaida in Galilee. They have a worldwide meaning. The details refer to what the Lord is doing now, and what He has been doing for centuries, that is, laying hold of persons, of men and women for Himself. "He laid his hands upon him", not His hand only, but His hands; it is His complete committal to that person. He secured the person, and secured him as useful, not to be a stumbling block, nor as a blind man who leads the blind so that both fall into the ditch. The Lord intends to secure this man as one that sees, and can go straight ahead according to God, so that others may follow; for that is the thought in one seeing. So He lays both His hands on him, and
{132}
spits upon his eyes -- a remarkable thing as entering into the importance of this miracle of the Lord's. Then He asks the man if he sees anything; a very good question, a question which one should always ask oneself, and a wholesome question to ask the brethren too. What do you see? Do you see anything? The man answers and says, "I see men". Well, that is good, to see men is better than seeing the town they built; the town will be destroyed, the cities of the nations are to fall, but men are to be secured for God. He says "I see men", but then, is that all? No; he says, "I see men as trees, walking". Well, that shows a defective vision; that is poor sight. It is not that the men were actually like trees, but they were *seen* "as trees". It is not the normal visibility that is in question, but the power of vision.
We have to see to this matter, dear brethren; and in speaking thus, one is led to say that there are things constantly coming up among the people of God that require clear vision, and in nothing is it more necessary than in conflict. One could cite instances in conflict where men thought they saw just a shadow when it was an army, as in the case of Abimelech; @Judges 9: 36. Well, it is a very serious matter to think an army of opposition is just a shadow. How defective such sight is! how disastrous it must prove! Then, too, in looking into matters, how important that we should be able to see round a thing. This man says, "I see men". It is good so far to see men, but how do you see them? One of them is, perhaps, your father: he is much bigger in your eyes than in those of others; but you think he should have the leading place in the meeting. Or perhaps you would claim this for your brother or husband. You think the brethren are belittling, but the truth is that you are thinking your husband's gift is more than it is. Others do not see him as you do; you see him out of proportion to his real stature. On the other hand, others might see him as a dwarf -- their eyesight
{133}
is poor, too; but you see him out of proportion to what he is. So, in many, what is needed is a sense of due proportion. We all are essential to the testimony, but if our sight is not good, we shall err in judgment and may also mislead other people.
Hence the Lord touched this man again; He "put his hands again upon his eyes". He will not leave any of us in this half-blind state; He needs us too much. The Lord is very urgent about this matter. Here He puts His hands upon him again, and now the man says he sees distinctly. It is the *second* touch that most of us need. Most of us are content with the first touch. There is often what is spoken of as a second conversion; sometimes a third is needed, but the second is usually confirmatory. As Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The thing is established", @Genesis 41: 32. The second touch establishes you: you want to be clear, and to see whether that brother, or husband, or father is as big as he seems. If you do not you will be a hindrance, especially in matters that require careful attention.
So the Lord put His hands upon this man a second time, and "he saw distinctly" as it should read and "... saw all things clearly" not only men but *things*. Take any case causing anxiety to the saints: Am I able to gauge all its phases, and come to a true judgment of them as before God? I can have no useful part in the care meeting, no part in the government of the assembly, unless I see all things clearly. A judge on the bench is bound to look at a case all round, and weigh things and see what is wrong and put a name to it. This man "saw all things clearly", and the Lord says, Do not go into "the town" again, the idea being that the town confuses and distorts; things are not right in the town; truth is called error, and error is called truth. The newspapers and other such mediums distort the truth, and lies are propagated. So the man is not to go into the town, he is to go into his house; that is the place to go to first, to get everything regulated; seeing all things
{134}
distinctly, you do not see your relatives out of proportion, but just as they are. You know they are not like trees, and you would not assume that they are such in the assembly.
Well, I want to show you how Balaam's history illustrates all this. This is the third blessing or prophecy of Balaam; there are four of them. Some of you perhaps may not know his history, but it is well known to most of us, and I only wish to touch on what bears out what I have been saying. In @Numbers 23 you have his two first pronouncements, and you will discern that in making them he was governed by double motives. He was there for the "reward of unrighteousness", @2 Peter 2: 15. He was hired by Balak to curse Israel, and the reward of unrighteousness was in his mind, and what he would like to do was to curse Israel. As is often the case in matters that we have to deal with, we pre-judge them and we would like that judgment to go through.
I am only speaking of Balaam as an illustration. He was a wicked man; but for the moment, he is under God's hand in a remarkable way. He left his place in Syria as a hireling, pretending that he would not say anything that God did not wish him to say. How often it is so with us! We say that we would not think or say a word that God does not wish us to say, and yet we pre-judge a matter, and we wish the thing to go according to our pre-judgment. But God is standing in the way, and He will not let it go that way. So what you find with Balaam is that God met him. You cannot overcome God. As you pre-judge a matter, He is standing athwart your judgment, and hence it cannot prevail. And Balaam's did not. Instead of cursing he is obliged to bless Israel.
The second time he also goes to seek enchantments, because he wanted his own judgment to carry and earn the reward of unrighteousness; but Jehovah met him and put a word in his mouth, and he has to bless
{135}
again. That is, God is forcing him to do what he did not wish to do. We are not stronger than God; my judgment is not going to be carried, something else is, and that leads me to this chapter. It says, "when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel". What a fine day that was! The thing is clear now; his pre-judgment is simply to be cast to the winds. God has another mind altogether, and God is stronger than we and He carried His thoughts through. It may take time, but we may as well make up our minds that He will have His way. Balaam saw that, and seeing it he did not seek enchantments any more. Thoughts that led to my pre-judgment of the matter have to be given up. Now it says, "he set his face toward the wilderness". That is a sure sign under those circumstances. That is a spiritual touch; I do not say that Balaam was a spiritual man. He was not; the New Testament tells us he was a wicked man, and so does the Old, but for the moment he is held under God so that he actually comes to God's way of thinking. Such is God, and how encouraging it is to pray to God. If He can turn round a wicked man like Balaam, imbued with the greed of reward, He can turn anyone -- surely He can turn a christian, and He is doing it in many instances.
When Balaam saw that it was God's mind to bless Israel, he did not seek enchantments any more; he turned his face to the wilderness. There is nothing there to allure the flesh, there is no reward of unrighteousness there. What is there? What a view was in the wilderness! The only view worth seeing in the whole world today is what is seen in the wilderness, and that is the people of God dwelling "according to their tribes". You will understand I am not speaking locally, I am speaking of the true meaning of the terms, and there is nothing at all in this world worth going to see but the people of God dwelling according to their tribes. What does that mean? It means the saints dwelling assembly-wise; it means the saints dwelling
{136}
in *love*. There is no greater sight in heaven or on earth than that, and it is to be seen today, thank God! Balaam saw it, and he stresses the fact that he saw it. It is for me to see it, it is for you to see it; it is for me to have eyes opened to see and appreciate it, to go to the highest point and see it. Balaam did so: "he set his face toward the wilderness. And Balaam, lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him". This is the first time you have this about Balaam. God can so bring a man round to His thoughts that the Holy Spirit Himself acts upon him. It is wonderful victory! It brings in the power of God, by which we can overcome the greatest difficulties in assembly matters.
Now we see that God is not only bent on blessing His people, but we see the people are so beautiful, so attractive, so lovable, that God Himself blesses them. Is it not right, beloved, to think of God loving what is lovable? Surely it is; and Balaam is led in the power of the Spirit of God to see what is lovable. God has those in the wilderness today, amid the general apostasy and darkness that there is, in a simple but true way, what answers to Israel abiding "according to his tribes". There are twelve of them; which implies that in our meetings, as we dwell together in love, we embrace all the saints. It is a Colossian thought. We love *all* the saints; we are not unduly local, we are universal in our view. I embrace in my affection every saint on earth every gathering certainly -- but everyone who seeks to walk in the commandments of the Lord, as loving Him. That is the idea. Those truly of the assembly are dwelling in that way, not simply so many christians living in a certain place, but dwelling "according to their tribes".
Then Balaam begins to say things authoritatively. "He took up his parable and said, Balaam, the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: he hath said ..." Those three expressions "hath
{137}
said" are authoritative, as you will notice in the better translation. The point is, not that he *had* said those things, but he *is* saying them. Instead of "hath said" we should read "saith", as in the New Translation. It is the first time he uses this word, evidently it is because the Holy Spirit is upon him; if I have the Holy Spirit upon me I can speak authoritatively. Balaam uses it three times over. He is speaking all the time about the saints. Sometimes speaking about the saints is criticised. Heaven is occupied with the saints. As God looked down from heaven in a former time to see if there were any good, so He looks down today, and what does He see? He sees, as it were, "Israel in tents dwelling according to his tribes". It is delightful to God. Were you to hear the conversation in heaven, you would hear much about the saints. There would be no doubt much about Jesus, for He is worshipped and honoured as God there: He "who is over all. God blessed for ever"! @Romans 9:5. But there is a great deal of conversation in heaven about the saints. One repenting sinner causes joy in heaven; how much more joy is there as you have a hundred or a thousand saints sitting together in love! There is nothing to excel it in the whole universe. I am speaking now of creatures, of the saints dwelling together in love, that is, abiding according to their tribes.
Balaam, goes on to say, "the man whose eyes are open". Notice how he mentions this. I believe the idea is he had had his eyes shut to the beauty of Israel, but now they are open; that his eyes were shut would mean that his will worked. He would wish to curse the people; but now his eyes are open, and he accepts God's purpose to bless, and the Spirit comes upon him as he accepts it. So it is that as we abandon our pre-judgments and our own thoughts and leave ourselves open to God's thoughts about His people, we see all things clearly and are in a position to make authoritative pronouncements. We do not traduce the Lord's people, we speak well of
{138}
them, and that is what happened here. So the speaker goes on to say, "which heard the words of God". The words of God are entering his ear. He heard them, and moreover, he says, "who falleth down", that is, he is eclipsed as to himself. He has renounced all his own pre-judgments and thoughts, and he is now in the presence of God. What a change! How God would speak! And so it is as to all matters with which we have to do, when we get into God's presence, and get the "vision of the Almighty", "from the top of the rocks".
Then he goes on to say, "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel! As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters". Look at that beautiful description! One would dwell upon it; heaven dwells upon it. It is the Spirit of God speaking through a changed man. That is the point, to get changed, to get a right view, to get alongside of God to see things from His point of view, to speak authoritatively, and then beautifully of the people of God, according to the divine view of them. "As the valleys are they spread forth", he says, giving the suggestion of fertility in rich soil in which God sows and reaps. "As gardens by the river's side": there you have a more restricted thought than the valleys. That is to say, the saints as a whole are *spread out* by God. Concentration is good in a way, but spreading out is better. The meaning of the name "Japheth" is "spreading out", and I believe he is the great yielding ground for the assembly, if you understand me. So it is that the saints are spread forth. The more meetings there are, the better; these convey the great idea of a spreading out; a rich valley is where God can operate, can sow and reap. And then "gardens" are special, they are more limited places, where the waters flow and where you get richness of growth. Then, "as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees
{139}
beside the waters". These lign aloes allude no doubt to the cone-shaped tents of Israel spread out in their regularity under the vision of the prophet here; but I believe they allude also to the saints in their distinction, and as co-related to one another; they hold themselves in regard of one another. But then, there is personal greatness also which marks God's people; they are "as cedar trees beside the waters". The cedars denote, as their use in the temple indicates, the dignity of men in Christ. The man at Bethsaida saw men as trees walking, but here what is in view is the dignity of the trees, as drawing their supplies from the waters.
Well, all this is the result, as I said, of the renouncement of pre-judgments, and seeing that God's judgment must go through. That is what Balaam arrived at, and hence these wonderful statements. So he goes on to say, "He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted". There is now what Israel does, what the saints may do as things are adjusted according to God. As they are seen, and as they move, and are set together according to God, they have buckets of their own, and they can supply water to others; they have drawn from the rivers and now they have water for others. And "his seed shall be in many waters", meaning a great enlargement or spreading out of this wonderful seed, for in truth it is to fill the earth. What is of God is to fill the world; all else has to go. So he goes on to say, "his kingdom shall be exalted. God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows. He couched, he lay down as a lion, ... : who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee".
You see thus, dear brethren, how the matter stands with clearness of vision from God. I see His people as
{140}
He sees them, I see them in their beauty, in their love, in their order, and then I see them spreading out until they fill the face of the world, for that is the great view here. Israel is to overwhelm every other nation and to fill the world. What a great prospect! How important to get a right view! for by and by in the heavenly city we shall love to look down on the renewed earth, with the nations subservient to Israel, all under Christ, in perfect order in life. We shall look down and see it as heaven looks down now. It will be our part in the heavenly city to see these wonderful results of the death of Jesus on the earthly side. God would help us to perfect our vision, to learn to see things afar off as well as what is near, and to see all things clearly. That is to say, in matters of judgment we must judge righteous judgment, so that we come under the blessing, and there is no one that can curse us. There are those who attempt to, but God gives commandment to bless -- Yea, "and he hath blessed", and none can reverse it. May God bless the word.
{141}
THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANTS (1)
@Genesis 9: 8 - 17; @Revelation 4: 2 - 3; @Revelation 10: 1 - 4
J.T. The thought is to consider the signs of the covenants in Scripture. The one which refers directly to ourselves now is the Lord's supper. These signs of covenants in the Old Testament convey much spiritual instruction for us. The first is the rainbow in @Genesis 9; the second is circumcision, in chapter 17, the sign of the covenant with Abraham. In chapter 21 -- the sign of the covenant between Abraham and Abimelech, the king of the Philistines. Then we have a sign of a covenant between Laban and Jacob; and the sign of the covenant between God and Israel, namely, the Sabbath. Finally, although it is not formally called such, the sign in the Lord's supper; the cup is said by the Lord to be *the new covenant* -- "This cup is the new covenant in my blood", @Luke 22: 20.
It may be remarked that one great idea in the thought of covenant in the scripture is confirmation of faith. We have in @Genesis 8 the statement by Jehovah to Noah, that on the ground of sacrifice, "While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease" @Genesis 8:22. The covenant here is obviously based on sacrifice, and the sign is not only for us but for God; He would assure our hearts that He will not forget; not that He ever does forget, in that sense, but it is *to assure us* that He will not forget. "I will look upon it", He says in verse 16. It has a wide bearing. In the Psalms the earth is used symbolically of that which is immovable, which is founded for ever, and the bearing of the covenant here would be to establish faith by the continuance of conditions that are favourable. Conditions were favourable -- "seedtime and harvest, and cold and
{142}
heat, and summer and winter, and day and night" there would be immunity from the curse. God's word, "I will not again curse the ground" @Genesis 8:21, has a bearing on what is universal, the whole human race, the lower cattle, all livings things, as well as the earth itself.
H.B. In the thought of the covenant being a confirmation of faith, do you refer to Noah's faith in the movement he had taken in the sacrifice?
J.T. Yes, blessing is evidently based on that. Following on the altar and the offerings upon it in chapter 8: 20, it says, "And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour. And Jehovah said in his heart, I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man, for the thought of Man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will no more smite every living thing, as I have done. Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease. And God blessed Noah and his sons". That is an order of things that is very favourable, and I think, in chapter 9, the covenant is to confirm faith as to it. In the New Testament, it is taken up in regard of the throne that stood in the heaven, and Him that sat upon it. The rainbow in @Revelation 4 is specially mentioned, and what it was like -- "A rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald", pointing doubtless to the colour, the freshness of it, that it has lost nothing of its freshness; there is no change with God, the covenant stands as much today as when it was made.
The prodigal in @Luke 15 had disregarded it, he had sinned against heaven -- but God does not transgress the covenant -- Adam did, and we are prone to do it. The emerald, I think, would point to the unchangeableness of God in His patience to assure our hearts. Then in @Revelation 10 where the Lord is seen coming, there is a rainbow upon His head; it is Christ coming in to take possession, not in an arbitrary or peremptory way, but as taking up what belongs to Him. It is no
{143}
arbitrary action, as of a conqueror, it is with intelligence -- the rainbow is on the head -- as to the engagements and rights of God with His creation. So that, whilst the covenant is wide and refers to the creation, it is nevertheless to be taken up by faith, because God is to be known by us creatorially. He is a "faithful Creator" @1 Peter 4:19 and He is "the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe" @1 Timothy 4:10; so it is a confirmation of christian experience, of our faith in God.
W.G. Would the bow in the cloud refer to the judgment of evil? The rainbow is on His head.
J.T. I think so. Putting His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the earth, He cried with a loud voice; @Revelation 10. There is power there, but He is not doing things arbitrarily, He is doing things according to covenant.
Ques. In Genesis the blessing follows the offering by Noah, which is the height of his service, but in referring to the rainbow, the covenant sign, God speaks of clouds coming in, verses 13 - 14, shutting out the brightness. In these conditions, faith is strengthened by this bow in the cloud. Is that the thought?
J.T. Yes. Any sorrowful thing happening amongst us enters into this; things that tend to shut out God, and as questions arise in the heart, the bow is to assure us that all is well; what God may mean may not always be clear, but it is all well.
Ques. Do you suggest that the cloud may mean discipline?
J.T. It undoubtedly does. It is what God says in His heart: chapter 8: 21, we should not have known anything about it if He had not told us. What He may be saying in His heart, we have to wait for; it is good, and the general position is fixed, it is not judgment but blessing. With many clouds the meaning may not be apparent, but the bow means it is good. God says, "I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting
{144}
covenant". That is, *He* would not forget it, but would assure our hearts.
Ques. Referring to Adam calling his wife's name Eve, the mother of all living, and God making the coats of skins -- are the coats of skins a sign of covenant?
J.T. Yes. There was something there worth covering, where there was such a word as that, "The mother of all living" @Genesis 3:20.
Rem. It is the cloud that brings out the bow, you will not get the rainbow without the cloud. "Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?" @Job 37: 16. The rainbow is in the cloud in Genesis, but round the throne in @Revelation 4; and upon His head in @Revelation 10.
J.T. That is to say, the rainbow is produced by the contact of light with the cloud, so that the light takes that form. "God is light" @1 John 1:5 -- it is what God is shining over against what seems to be contrary to us.
Ques. Would the prayer in @Acts 4 have any bearing on this? They say, "Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them" @Acts 4:24. They appeal to God as Creator.
J.T. Yes, it is remarkable how much the creatorial side is seen throughout Scripture. At the outset God provided a vocabulary by means of which He could address His creatures, so that they would understand, that His communications should be intelligible to them. There is no cloud spoken of before this, nor is there any rain spoken of before the flood. After the flood, we have the allusion to the clouds, and as God brings them over the earth, He would assure us that whatever He may do, it will be for good. He would not again bring a flood, but would henceforth act in accord with Himself. Though He would bring the clouds Himself, the light of what God is Himself as made known in Christ, coming into contact with these clouds, brings out the sign -- the rainbow.
{145}
Ques. Would that be like, "All things work together for good to them that love God"? @Romans 8: 28.
J.T. That is what is meant. The epistle to the Romans instructs us so that we should understand these signs, and learn that what God is lies behind them.
Rem. The clouds are brought in as necessary to bring about the fruitfulness spoken of at the end of the previous chapter.
J.T. Just so. They would be needed for the harvest, and the earth needed to be moistened. It is a question of what comes down now, instead of a mist rising up out of it, as in @Genesis 2: 6.
Ques. Would you make any distinction between the clouds and the cloud?
J.T. The latter is used specifically in relation to the bow, but the clouds would be general. Our brother referred to the balancings of the clouds of which Elihu spoke. They might seem as if they were quite loose and lawless in their movements and at the mercy of the winds -- but they are balanced, nothing is haphazard with God, and though the cloud is there the bow is in it.
Ques. Although God brings in the cloud, we should move according to His mind, as Noah did in preparing the ark for the saving of his house.
J.T. The sign is for faith. It is to faith that God speaks, and He loves to confirm our faith.
Ques. Is the savour of rest spoken of in the previous chapter, the ground on which God makes known all these blessed things for us?
J.T. I think that is the basis of what we are speaking of -- what God smelled, and what He said in His heart. It is very precious to think of God smelling, and then saying things in His heart. How much He says in His heart all the time! It is to assure us of how thoughtful He is; though He does not say things audibly, He is saying things in His heart for our good.
Ques. Is the thought similar to that in Ezekiel l?
{146}
The throne is surrounded by the brightness "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud", @Ezekiel 1:28.
J.T. Quite so; above the brightness was the likeness of a throne, and "the appearance of a man above upon it", assuring us of sympathy in all the circumstances.
Rem. It is round the clouds that the bow is set, in relation to the circumstances that arise amongst us.
J.T. Yes. It is for faith in those concerned, and in all of us, to discern God in the circumstances; God is in the circumstances; He puts the bow there not only for us, but for Himself. Romans brings out God's attitude towards us. He commends His love, the principle of His relations with us is love; it is on the ground of righteousness, but the active principle is love, and He shows us He never forgets that.
Rem. In @Genesis 6 God repented that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him in His heart.
J.T. Yes, showing how thoroughly He was affected, speaking to us as though He were a man -- coming down to our level; and this in @Genesis 8 is the same thing, He "said in his heart".
Ques. In answer to our brother's question, does not this assure us that all these things are under His hand and nothing happens without Him?
J.T. Just so, but the bow means even more; that He has entered into an engagement with us. What happens to us is out of love, He causes it. "When I bring clouds over the earth" -- He does it, and it is for discipline obviously. The clouds will be balanced, they will not become too large or overwhelming, and the bow will be there. It is what we are taught in Romans, to know what God is to us, and the principle of the relations into which He has entered with us. He has commended Himself to us, and He is commending His love too.
Ques. Would the service of the Lord at such times be to direct our hearts into the love of God?
J.T. Yes, that is the principle of His relations with
{147}
us. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us", @Romans 5: 8. There can be no change in that; when we were yet sinners, He entered into that sort of relation; what may happen subsequently does not alter that.
Rem. In connection with discipline, it is said in @Romans 8 that "All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose". Our faith would gain strength in that; you said the bow was confirmatory of faith.
J.T. Yes, Romans enables us to understand @Genesis 9, it is what God is in His engagements. Faith grasps that. So the Shunammite (@2 Kings 4: 22), says to her husband, when the boy died, "Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God". "It shall be well", she says. She says the same thing to Elisha, "It is well", verse 26. I think she had the apprehension that all would be well.
Rem. So the clouds are full of water, even though of discipline.
J.T. Yes, they are not clouds without water, or there would be no bow. Romans is the great book for young christians to be grounded in; by it we become accustomed to God.
Rem. The windows of heaven had been opened, in @Genesis 7, which is a fearful thing; "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven" @Romans 1:18, but the bow would suggest that heaven is favourable.
J.T. That is good. So the opening of the windows of heaven subsequently is for good; @2 Kings 7. The man on whose hand the king leaned did not understand that; to him it was an impossibility, but God is ready to open the heavens, and those who understand the bow, understand that.
H.B. Had you in mind that each reappearance of this sign would enhance to us the covenant and the love of God that is behind it, whether it be the bow, or the cup?
{148}
J.T. Yes, I thought the Spirit of God would use these scriptures to impress us with what God is. There is a fixed state of things in @Genesis 8 which is favourable, and will continue, ending up with the idea of day and night, God acting in that way to indicate the need of experience with us. He worked by the day Himself, and in this favourable state of things experience is being worked out; but these clouds are necessary, and they test our faith.
Ques. Is the cloud in Exodus a different thought from what is here?
J.T. It is really an emphasising of what we have here, a symbol of the divine presence, hence much greater. God has not only set the bow in the cloud to assure our hearts that He is not forgetting anything, but Exodus goes further and would show that He is in the cloud Himself, it is where He dwells. That very cloud may become the means of His dwelling, getting near to us in a way He has never before; indeed that He may come to dwell with us through it.
Ques. Was not the cloud a new departure in the ways of God, so that the bow would be required in that way to give assurance? The earth was watered by mist previously, but the judgment was brought about by the windows of heaven being opened, and we require assurance in that way when God makes a new departure.
J.T. I think that is right. The mist coming up from the earth would allude, I think, to what was good; sin had not yet come in; it would allude to the earth being self-sustained: but sin brought in a curse, and then the kingdom of heaven comes into view after the cloud. It was there before, but now rain and moisture come from heaven, they are needed to fructify the earth, and the clouds, while they may seem to be against us, really result in fruitfulness -- He "sends rain", we are told; @Matthew 5.
Rem. So the Lord, in enunciating the principles of the kingdom, refers to the rain falling on the just and
{149}
on the unjust, and says we are to be like our Father which is in heaven.
J.T. That is what I thought. It is a witness to His provision, causing rain and fruitful seasons; the earth drinks it in, it comes from God. It links on with Romans, which is the basis of all this for the christian. It is the righteousness of God which is the basis -- it is what is right. Apart from my feelings as to things that happen, I know that they are right and I am restful; I may be drinking the bitter waters, but I am restful.
Rem. The rainbow being round the throne, would remind us that the cloud is mixed with mercy.
J.T. Yes, and that there is no violation of God's engagement. In the adjusting of things on the earth, involving it may be judgment of the severest nature, there is no violation of this engagement of @Genesis 9. The everlasting gospel in @Revelation 14:6 is in keeping with this; the allusion is to the creation, the earth is to be brought back to its relations with its Maker. It is a comfort to know that God has reasons for doing this, and yet there is no violation of His engagement with man, with the beast of the field, and with the earth. So that the word is stressed in relation to us, "God is faithful". We still have our part in the creation, and we learn in this covenant the faithfulness of God.
Rem. The great thing for us is to act on it, to move in faith ourselves. Noah moved in faith.
W.C.G. The psalmist says, "Put thou my tears into thy bottle ... this I know; for God is for me", @Psalm 56: 8 - 9. God is known in all His blessed character in the glad tidings.
J.T. Yes, and it is very comforting to know that in the moral order of things He has set up in the gospel, there is no change; whatever may happen amongst the nations, whatever development of sin, there is no change.
Ques. Is there a difference between the 12th and 13th verses of @Genesis 9?
{150}
J.T. The covenant "which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations" (verse 12), gives the thought of what is planned -- "every living soul" -- God has pleasure in what is living. And then the "covenant between me and the earth" (verse 13), would include the earth and all that is in it. The earth would involve all that is living, so it would enter into our prayers; God established a magisterial state of things in this chapter, He had in mind that it should continue. We pray for all these things.
Ques. Does the suggestion of the earth take in what He said to Adam, "Be fruitful and multiply"?
J.T. Yes, I think He has in mind in the expression "earth" not merely the material but the order of it and the government on it; and order of things He would have pleasure in, including government.
Ques. Would the rainbow have a connection with what we get in Malachi? The Sun of righteousness shall "arise with healing in his wings" (@Malachi 4: 2) -- the sun comes out and forms the rainbow.
J.T. Well, in the sense that the rays come from the sun and strike the cloud. There is that beautiful combination, that what seems to be against us becomes the means to reflect the light in such a way that we are confirmed. In the beautiful hues of the rainbow God would show us that He has variety in mind. We have been going on with one line of things and forgotten other things. He intended variety to be developed in us, He assures us that is what He has in mind. He has nothing else but good. Paul says he besought the Lord thrice that the thorn in the flesh might depart from him, and the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me", @2 Corinthians 12: 9. You come into new experience by accepting the thorn, trying as it may be.
{151}
O.G. So this would enter into our sufferings in connection with the testimony and the will of God? "Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator", @1 Peter 4:19.
J.T. "A faithful Creator" -- that is right; it shows how much the Creator is brought in.
Ques. When the woman flees from the dragon in @Revelation 12, it says the earth opened its mouth to receive the waters that the dragon cast out of his mouth. Is the covenant to assure us that God over-rules the circumstances in connection with the testimony so that we are not overwhelmed?
J.T. I think that is good. The earth opened to swallow up the flood -- that ought to encourage us to pray for the order God has established; the order set up in Noah, including capital punishment. We ought to pray in connection with all these things.
W.A. The scripture in @Acts 4 says, "Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is" @Acts 4:24. This shows knowledge of God in the soul in these circumstances.
J.T. Do you not think all that brings out that the covenant as we have it in this chapter was intended to establish a theatre for the display of all subsequent testimonies of God? I believe this covenant holds right up to the end, even to the establishment of the millennium. The introduction of the throne in @Revelation 4 and the Angel, that is, Christ Himself, in chapter 10, is all on this line.
W.C.G. Would the covenant made with Noah typify Christ as the heavenly Man, and the blessing being secured in Him?
J.T. Noah is viewed here as the chief magistrate on the earth; and then the food that is needed to support that position is provided, animal flesh is allowed -- strong meat to support that order of things. I believe God would have His people to be full-grown men in
{152}
relation to all the current events of this world, for they all bear on the testimony. This is an order of things God says must go on, but Satan has come in to hinder, and the throne, in @Revelation 4, and the Lord Himself, in chapter 10, are to deal with the evil that has come in, so that this state of things may subsist, and the rainbow, I think, means that.
H.B. Do you mean that we anticipate the judgment of the throne in relation to the events on the earth?
J.T. We do. We are grieved and oppressed by the things that have arisen, for Satan has a place in the heavens and affects this order of things; yet it goes on. In God's ways the establishment of the gentile monarchy is to maintain things, that the magisterial conditions might subsist, and in spite of all that Satan has done; it is to make a way for all earthly testimonies of God. And I believe this far-flung Empire in which we are is just for this purpose. It is no question of any one thinking himself great because he belongs to it; it is all a question of holding things for a purpose, that the earth should be the theatre for the display of God's power and His testimony.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the curse in the world before the flood? It says of Noah, "he called his name Noah, saying, This name shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed". There was a change now after the flood.
J.T. Yes. You can understand how distasteful it was to God to have to do with a scene marked by curse. It was very distasteful to Him, and hence the name "Noah" was a guarantee of that order being reversed, and it is reversed, but in the One whom Noah typified in Christ. "Jehovah smelled the sweet odour. And Jehovah said in his heart, I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man". There is to be henceforth a fixed order of things for the development of God's testimony.
{153}
Ques. Would you say that Jacob did not apprehend the rainbow when he said, "All these things are against me"? @Genesis 42:36
J.T. Yes, but he came to it afterwards, when he went out of Canaan into Egypt; things looked dark, but he offered sacrifices to the God of Isaac -- that is, Christ risen -- all the promises of God are fulfilled in Him.
Rem. As in the good of the knowledge of the God presented to us in Romans, we can be at case in relation to all things.
J.T. Yes, Romans establishes a christian in righteousness and love, and then we have three chapters 9, 10 and 11 -- to assure us of His faithfulness, and to establish us on that principle. Romans is the great book for every young christian to understand; he will be able to read the bow in the cloud as soon as he understands Romans.
Rem. It is striking that as the clouds were coming in, in early church history, we have in the 9th chapter of the Acts the light above the brightness of the sun, when the Lord spoke to Saul of Tarsus. What a revival it was to the assembly in that period!
Ques. With regard to this magisterial system that has been set up, does @Romans 13 set out our position, and is it not a very important word for us today -- "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers"? @Romans 13:1 We should take that to heart.
J.T. Yes. Then the facilities afforded by government to the saints in moving about are important; Romans brings that in too. Paul's salutations to the saints at Rome imply that there had been much movement hither and thither. Different ones had moved to Rome; Phoebe, for instance, took the long journey from Cenchrea to Rome. She could not have done it without ordered government; and I think that enters into the present time, the exigencies of the testimony today
{154}
involve immense journeyings for those who would serve the Lord; and these cannot be undertaken, with any hope of success, aside from government; hence the importance of government and that it should continue, so that these facilities may be continued for us. @Revelation 4 is full of the greatest encouragement in regard to the throne, in the bringing to light of the four and twenty elders; the government assures the continuance of that. What David inaugurated implied headship and the working of love, and that is all worked out and reappears in @Revelation 4 in the elders with crowns and thrones, and they are in full recognition of the throne and Him who sits upon it. Then the creation in its entirety is all sympathetic, a living state of things is brought in sympathetically, and the elders recognising the Creator in worship, fall down and worship Him who sits on the throne, saying, "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created". Then in chapter 10, I think the Lord is seen symbolically in the Angel with the little opened book in His hands, meaning, I apprehend, that it is *open* history.
To understand the history of the four great empires, from Babylon down to modern Europe, we do not need to read volumes, it is all told simply, it is just a "little opened book", a small matter; just a repetition of what man is according to the measure of ability and scope that God gives him. On the other hand, we see what God is in relation to all that, and how He is holding things. That is how the facts stand.
Ques. Do the four living creatures in chapter 4 represent the heavenly saints?
J.T. I think they represent the principle of *life*, they are not quite on the level of the four and twenty elders; the elders know what to do and what to say. They are mentioned before the four and twenty elders in chapter 5 because, under such conditions, energy is needed, and life is the principle of energy; but in chapter 4 it is the great general presentation of divine
{155}
thoughts as to government, and the elders are prominent, they have the first and last words.
Ques. The four living creatures then are an evidence that life is being maintained in the faithfulness of God?
J.T. Yes, I think so, and life working out sympathetically with God; they have eyes all round and inside as well -- there is the inner thought; nothing happens that they do not discern, but then they have an inner way of thinking too, and seeing -- eyes within, and "they rest not day and night" -- it is the carrying on of the service of God in relation to creation.
Ques. Why is the rainbow seen upon the head of the mighty angel in chapter 10?
J.T. To assure us that the Lord does nothing arbitrarily. Yet we see that He has power -- the seven thunders uttering their voices would mean this I suppose, the overwhelming power God has to carry out His thoughts. The rainbow would call attention to the faithfulness of God in this movement, and being on the head, I think, also shows intelligence. This movement is marked by intelligence, which of course you never could get in the four monarchies, they were not much marked by faithfulness and intelligence; whereas when the Lord comes in, these features mark Him.
Rem. All the activities of God will be apprehended and experienced as we are in accord with Himself.
J.T. That is right, so the little open book is in the hands of such an One. If we regard things from the standpoint of Christ, the story of the history of the world is quickly told: events, of course, might take volumes, but morally the story is quickly told. When the prophet eats the book, it is serious, for the carrying out of it involves great suffering for his people. But the Lord makes short work of the history of the world from this time until His coming. @Matthew 24, @Mark 13, and @Luke 21, are just one discourse that is quickly told, but the consequences for His people are very extensive.
{156}
The prophet, I think, is what we should take notice of especially, the appropriation of this little book and how it causes sorrow, how it affects you, first in your mouth, and then in your belly -- the consequences of it, the bitterness of it.
Rem. The apostle, at the end of @Romans 11, had in his mind the thought of the rainbow being connected with the head -- "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out". @Romans 11:33
J.T. Yes, quite so.
Ques. Do the four and twenty elders include all the Old Testament worthies as well as the New -- all the fruitfulness?
J.T. I think so. They represent the experience with God of two dispensations. Taken up from David's appointment, the spiritual meaning is that we have Moses, that is authority, and David representing headship. Applying that to ourselves, I think it is 1 Corinthians, for instance, and Ephesians, which would embody the twenty-four. Moses is to regulate by authority; David by intelligence, he says to God "thou art exalted as head above all" @1 Chronicles 29:11. God was Head, in his mind, and it is reflected in himself; and I believe that is Ephesians, but we cannot come into the second unless we first come under authority.
Ques. In connection with the little open book, would we get the principle in @Luke 4, where the Lord unrolled the book and "found the place where it was written ..."? @Luke 4:17
J.T. Yes, it was a closed book in @Revelation 5, but the Lamb slain has to open that, unfolding certain things that were hidden; but this is not hidden, it is just public history told in a few words, so to speak.
{157}
THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANTS (2)
@Genesis 17: 1 - 13; @Genesis 21: 22 - 34
J.T. We have considered the covenant made with Noah, the sign of which is the rainbow, visible to all universally. Now we have to consider the sign of circumcision, the sign of the covenant made with Abraham and his seed. It is not a universal sign, and it is *in the persons* in respect of whom the covenant is made; for this sign we have to get the persons. It is obvious that we are on narrower ground, and the relation contemplated is much more intimate, for it is one man in whom God proposes to work out His thoughts who takes it up. Before this transaction with Abraham, there had been much in the way of intercourse with God, but now, after an effort on Abraham's part which proved utterly futile to accomplish the thoughts of God, there is a new movement with Jehovah, involving His almightiness, and in this movement, "the excellency of the power" @2 Corinthians 4:7 is to be of God. That is the great general truth which runs through the Scriptures involving the resurrection of Christ, and all is to be according to that.
The communications of Jehovah are very formal and personal; He says, "I am the Almighty God"; then, "I will set my covenant between me and thee"; and again, "God talked with him, saying, It is I" -- as if God is speaking to him on friendly terms -- "behold, my covenant is with thee"; and then, "I will establish my covenant between me and thee". The relations are to be intimate, God coming down to Abraham and acknowledging what he had been according to his name Abram -- "high father"; that there had been moral elevation in him hitherto, since God called him. Then his name is to be changed to "Abraham", which implies power, not only moral elevation but actual power -- the father of a multitude. The sign is to be
{158}
in the persons, as the apostle Paul says, "we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh", @Philippians 3: 3.
F.I. Could this sign only be entered into by Abraham as stepping out into a path of separation? The bow in the cloud was general, but this is more particular, as you were saying.
J.T. Yes; and the first covenant has a universal bearing, men get the benefit of it aside from their actual condition or state; the sun and the rain come on the unjust and the just; the just give thanks, but the others get the same rain, the same sunshine. Now we have a man taken up on the principle of separation -- "Go out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house", @Genesis 12:1. He is proved for some time and acquires a character in keeping with his name, that is, he is morally elevated, as the word "Abram" would signify.
Ques. Does the 6th verse where God speaks of making him "exceedingly fruitful", take in all that have faith, that living throng? This is the fruitfulness you were speaking of? "Inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham", @Luke 19:9 is that conveyed in this expression?
J.T. Yes, certainly. You have to find the people to see the covenant of circumcision, it is on much narrower ground. The gospel of Luke brings out those instances -- the daughter of Abraham (@Luke 13:16), and the son of Abraham (@Luke 19:9) -- they had moral qualities. John the baptist said, "God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham", @Luke 3: 8.
Ques. You have pressed the thought of the persons in order to have the sign; would you open that up a little?
J.T. Well, it is said in Romans that Abraham "received the sign of circumcision as seal of the righteousness
{159}
of faith which he had" (@Romans 4: 11) -- it is a seal. Then in Colossians, we have it in "the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ", @Colossians 2: 11. Well, how is that to be maintained? How can there be a sign of that kind apart from the Spirit? It is a question of the power of God. The action of the sun -- the light -- causes the rainbow, but there is more than that in circumcision. It is the actual power of God dealing with the flesh, the fleshly element, "Putting off of the body of the flesh" -- the whole thing. It requires the power of God to do that, and that is by the Spirit.
W.C.G. So the true Israel of God are those who are that inwardly, it says, in the heart and in the spirit.
J.T. Yes, you get that in @Romans 2: 29.
Ques. Would you say this is conditional, according to verse 1, "Walk before me, and be thou perfect"?
J.T. Well, that is how Jehovah introduces what is before Him. The sign must be there; the covenant is not effective, there is not really a testimony, unless the sign is there, and for the sign you must have the people. It is no mere theory, it is a question of the persons.
Ques. Would there be anything in the fact that Abraham was eighty-six years of age at the end of chapter 16, and now he is ninety-nine? Ishmael would be about thirteen?
J.T. He had had opportunity to see what Ishmael was. The Lord allows us to see the character of the flesh, that part of history is extended from Sinai to Christ. Ishmael was thirteen years in Abraham's house, proving what that product was; but after you have the thing portrayed in such an extended way, @Romans 7 is to deliver you from it. The product in Abraham's house for these years would prepare him for this chapter -- @Genesis 17. It was the divine education, but he said, "O that Ishmael might live before thee"! @Genesis 17:18 That shows he had not learnt his lesson; it waited for
{160}
chapter 21 to bring out what Ishmael was, typically, a persecutor of Christ. Now Abraham is ninety-nine, that is, he is more amenable to the instruction of this chapter. If faith is operative, the older we become the more amenable we are to divine lessons; your strength is waning, and you are more ready for the lesson of this chapter -- "that the excellency of the power may be of God", @2 Corinthians 4: 7.
Ques. Would this covenant have specially in view fruit for God?
J.T. That is what it says -- "I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee". Nations and kings, against the dark background of those nations that sprang from Seba, and the kings Nimrod represents; @Genesis 10: 6 - 11. These nations and kings run on as of the Nimrod character, whereas God is to have nations of His own, kings according to Himself.
A.E.L. That is confirmed in verse 16 -- in the promise to Sarah.
J.T. Yes, it is a wholly right seed that is in mind, not a mixture. Chapter 16 is a degenerate seed, but God has in mind a wholly right seed.
F.I. Do you connect the Spirit with the sign of the covenant?
J.T. Yes, it can only be by the Spirit. It is a question of the power of God and not the flesh. "*We* are the circumcision", the apostle says, "who worship by the Spirit of God" @Philippians 3:3. The Jews worshipped Him in a fleshly way, and christendom has adopted that way, so it has a very definite bearing today upon the service of God, and how to worship God and carry on His service. Therefore the importance of having the persons with whom the sign is.
H.B-t. You were speaking of "wholly a right seed", @Jeremiah 2: 21. Is that what Malachi refers to when he says, "He sought a seed of God"? chapter 2: 15.
{161}
J.T. Yes, Abraham and Sarah represented that parentage.
H.B-t. Was he looking backward there in Malachi or forward?
J.T. He says, Judah "hath married the daughter of a strange god" @Malachi 2:11; you cannot get a seed of God in that way. God says, "I hate putting away" @Malachi 2:16. They are to consider their spirits, the relations are to be right. Malachi takes up, very briefly, the great results of Israel under the law. It was not that the mind of God was not clear, it was clear, as we see in this chapter, but the material He had to deal with was impossible. Abraham and Sarah represented the parentage, so that much is made of Sarah in the epistle to the Galatians.
Ques. Has Malachi in mind the birth of Christ?
J.T. It would culminate there no doubt. The parentage in @Genesis 16 brought in a mixed seed, and that is what christendom has become -- the father is of God, but the mother not, the Hagar principle marks christendom. That is what this chapter stresses -- parentage.
Rem. You are only really among the people of God as having the sign in your flesh, so that the power of God is available, there is the excellency of the power of God there, @2 Corinthians 4.
J.T. That is right. It works out in the worship of God and in the levitical service too, in the preaching, in the ministry -- the excellency of the power is of God. But it is not a mere theory, you want to see the persons, and to look for the sign in them. It brings out what God has in mind in the great physical state of things, the heavens and the earth; that these being established, God is developing His testimony in one person and in his seed, so that henceforth you get certain persons. Who are they? Who is this Abraham? Who is Isaac? Who is Jacob? Who are the twelve patriarchs? These are the ones God has in mind, so that when you come to Christ, it is a question of the value of persons. In
{162}
regard of Abraham the king of Sodom says, "Give me the persons" @Genesis 14:21. No, Abraham says, I want the persons; you can have the goods. Abraham had entered the conflict to secure the persons. The goods all belong to the great scene indicated in chapter 9 under the blessing of heaven, with all that brings in -- commodities of all kinds which enter into the commerce of the world; but persons are in view according to Abraham's selection. God has selected persons, and when the Lord Jesus came, the thought of persons became accentuated. He left 120 persons, the names are here "the crowd of names" (@Acts 1: 15); there is a crowd, but every person is there distinguished by his name. That is the idea; circumcision is a sign of a people in relation to God, and you must get persons to get a sign of that covenant. Every individual christian, therefore, becomes of great importance, for he has the sign.
Rem. In the beginning of Galatians, the apostle says he conferred not with flesh and blood -- he sought out, as it were, spiritual persons.
J.T. Yes, he went up to Jerusalem to see Peter. He went all that way to see one man, and he says, "I remained with him fifteen days" @Galatians 1:18. What a person Peter was! What a sign of the circumcision would be there!
Ques. Have you in mind that the sign was not to be seen in the Galatians generally?
J.T. Quite so. They were going back to the old thing, the letter which killeth, but the Spirit gave life. Persons who are alive spiritually, who recognise the Spirit of God, and disallow the flesh, these are the persons in whom the sign is; so the testimony becomes very narrow, because such persons are very few.
Ques. Why should the sign be made on the eighth day?
J.T. Eight symbolises a new thing. God takes up
{163}
the seed of Abraham from infancy; it is a new order of man.
Ques. Is Titus a sample in @Galatians 2? Paul takes Titus with him, and it says, "neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised" @Galatians 2:3.
J.T. Yes. Paul virtually said to them at Jerusalem, This is what God is securing from the gentiles. Can you improve on that? To bring in literal circumcision there would be folly, nor did they insist on it, they did not go so far as that. Titus was a beautiful representation of the work of God among the nations.
Ques. Is that the idea of the seed?
J.T. Exactly.
Rem. We can take account today of people who display that in their service to God they attach no importance whatever to the flesh, that marks out the people you suggest?
J.T. Yes, that is the idea. The sign is comparatively private, you have to find it, but it exists. If you can find people who worship God by the Spirit -- that is, they make room for the Spirit in their worship, and in their service, their preaching -- and have no confidence in the flesh, then the "excellency of the power" is of God. So that Paul says, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified" @1 Corinthians 2:2. "That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us". @2 Corinthians 4:7
W.C.G. Paul said, "To write the same things to you, to me is not irksome, and for you safe", @Philippians 3: 1. The difficulties among the people of God arise from the lack of this sign in them; the enemy attacks and gets an advantage; if they had this sign he would not get an advantage -- "for you safe".
J.T. Yes. A year ago we were speaking of the sign set up by unburied bones in the land of Canaan. There is a sign put beside them, and wherever the sign is the saints bury them. I mean, that is laid upon us, according
{164}
to Ezekiel. There is quite an army of buriers in @Ezekiel 39. But this is another sign; this sign of circumcision is the power of God, persons with the sign are marked by that power.
W.C.G. We have to come to it that the purposes of God in their present application can only be worked out in such persons.
J.T. That is it; you may as well come to it. You may have ten thousand instructors, as the apostle says there are those -- but only one father. That is what brings in one like Timotheus.
W.C.G. God said, "I will be their God".
J.T. The God of the heavens and the earth exalted the nations, but think of God seeking out a people that He wishes to be in relationship with -- "I will be their God" -- "Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah", @Psalm 33: 12.
Rem. Every bit of the reproach of Egypt is gone from those people.
J.T. Exactly. That is what comes out in Joshua, the reproach is rolled away. I think this is very practical, for it helps us in finding the people whom God owns practically -- they have a sign. In Timothy we are exhorted to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", @2 Timothy 2: 22. This sign goes with that, they recognise the Spirit.
Ques. Did I understand that this sign is only found practically where separation is maintained?
J.T. It goes with that. Abraham had already testified to the truth of separation. This goes a little further than that, while including it, in that it implies power; things are being done that God approves where this sign is found -- a very great matter.
Ques. Is it the separation that leaves room, for God to carry on His operations with these people?
J.T. Quite so. He has them for Himself. "Walk before me", He says. That means they are not walking
{165}
in the world's ways and fashions, they are not considering what men think of them, they are walking before God.
Ques. Do you mean that, to be in line with the testimony, the power of God is necessary -- that faith alone is not enough?
J.T. No. Faith is light for us, you know what to do, but then you want *power* to do it. You may have light and resort to human resources, as Abraham did. There was the fruit of that in the thirteen-year-old boy who persecuted Christ, typically. The work of God is to be carried on by the power of God.
Rem. It appears there is the possibility of being in the separate position, and yet not possessing the sign.
J.T. That is an important suggestion. Our position may be right and yet we may be without power; the power must be there if there is to be anything done. How important it is to find people through whom things are being done that God approves.
Rem. The Spirit is a seal or sign that the power of God is with the person.
J.T. That is what is meant, it is a question of the Spirit of God. If the flesh is unjudged, we are relying on human methods and means, He is just simply ignored and nothing is being done for God, there will be no results for God. This chapter contemplates results for God; chapter 16 contemplates certain results, but not such as God approved.
Ques. Is it right to say that the power is in the cutting off, and that can only take place under the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Exactly. "Circumcised ... in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ", @Colossians 2: 11.
Ques. Would Abraham failing on his face suggest a state in view of having the power of God?
J.T. It was very comely he should do so. We can see how beautiful the relations contemplated are, in
{166}
Jehovah saying, "It is I". God is beside Abraham -- as it were one person talking to another, God recognising this man according to what he has; now he is to be something more than that, it is to involve great results for God.
Rem. After this, in Abraham's household, if anyone had not been circumcised it would raise a question.
J.T. It would, therefore the end of the chapter tells us there was no uncircumcised person in his house.
Rem. It is important that the sign should be recognised amongst us at the present time in the power and spirit of it.
J.T. Yes. It is a very interesting and profitable thought that we should look out for persons having this sign; there are not many of them we have to admit, and we want to find them all.
Rem. Paul said to some, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" @Acts 19:2 Had they got the sign?
J.T. That is right, Paul raised that question with the twelve men at Ephesus.
What we read in @Genesis 21 confirms all this. It would be profitable to link it with this sign, because of the well that Abraham says the Philistines had taken away. He gave Abimelech cattle, but he set aside seven ewe-lambs. Considering these seven ewe-lambs should help us as to the practical working out of the sign of circumcision; they were to be a sign or witness to Abimelech that Abraham dug that well, he has laid claim to that well. Digging a well is not the same as finding a spring. There are wells you may find. The first wells of water that Israel found at Elim are not said to have been dug. Digging in the wilderness is an advance on that and comes in many years later. It implies that I have the Spirit, and now I am finding out that I can use the Spirit in myself to make a clearance, so that He should be ungrieved.
Ques. Would you open up a little the difference between having the Spirit and making use of the Spirit?
{167}
J.T. Well, what we have been saying implies that I am making use of the Spirit -- we worship by the Spirit of God. I am to live in the Spirit, according to Galatians, and walk in the Spirit, and by the Spirit await the hope of righteousness; the fruit of the Spirit is given under nine different terms in @Galatians 5. In the types, Israel had the Spirit early in their history; the battle of Rephidim was in that connection (@Exodus 17); the rock was smitten and the waters flowed, and immediately Amalek attacks, that is, Satan in the flesh, as if he would set aside the great gain of that water for Israel. So Joshua comes in for the first time as a military leader, and victory comes through intercession on high. The Holy Spirit is there recognised in the history of the believer; but you do not get digging until many years after. Digging alludes to the clearing away in myself of what I have discovered to be a hindrance, and what has caused the Spirit to be grieved, so that He is not free in me.
Ques. You are referring to @Numbers 21?
J.T. Yes, that is the digging. Digging is by the princes, it is a question of spiritual power in the saints that leads to it.
Ques. Does that spiritual power come about by beholding the serpent of brass?
J.T. Yes, that is the objective thing; the contemplation of sin in the flesh in the brazen serpent, is the truth in an objective sense, but the digging is what I do; it is perhaps not much understood, but that is the truth. Abraham says, these "seven ewe-lambs" are to be "a witness to me that I have dug this well". Well, what kind of creatures are those seven ewe-lambs? They are not quarrelsome, they are docile; figuratively, they are people you would love to live with. How did that come about? They are not wild asses, like Ishmael; the product of the flesh is that -- "a wild-ass of a man" (@Genesis 16: 12); he would not be the kind of man you would like to live with, certainly a man like that can
{168}
be of no help in a meeting. But these seven ewe-lambs, how beautiful they are in their spirits, typically. The captain of the Philistines was relying on his army, but these ewe-lambs are not like that, they are the kind of thing a spiritual man puts forward, they are the "witness to me that I have dug this well".
Ques. Does this contemplate @Colossians 3, "Put on therefore as the elect of God ... meekness"? @Colossians 3:12
J.T. Very good; that is the idea.
Rem. "I ... beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ", @2 Corinthians 10: 1.
J.T. Yes, it is the product of the Spirit. That is the thing to bring forward before these big men. We have remarked about Titus, what a man he was! Paul also says to the Corinthians, "I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ", @1 Corinthians 4: 17. That is the idea.
Ques. Are they the results of the digging, and hence the fruit of the Spirit?
J.T. That is the idea, the product of the Spirit.
Rem. "When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him", @Proverbs 16: 7. Abraham was walking before God and his heart was perfect, and nothing could stand against that power.
J.T. They recognised that power was there. "Abimelech, and Phichol the captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest". What a testimony! The king with his military leader beside him, is coming to see that the power of God is better than what he had; and that is the testimony in face of all these big men round us. Get the biggest of them and bring him into a meeting where the Spirit has place, what could he do? He could not do anything; he could outside, but not where the Spirit of God is. So they say to Abraham, We see God is with you and
{169}
He is with you in all you are doing; you are doing things by the power of God.
Rem. The disciples at the beginning of the Acts represented the Lord Jesus.
J.T. Yes, that is amongst themselves; and if anyone came in and saw what they were doing, it would be observed that all was by the Spirit.
Rem. It is a wonderful thing to present these seven ewe-lambs to the Philistines. "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty ...", @2 Corinthians 10: 4.
J.T. Yes. I believe Titus and Timothy were both representative of that Spirit, they were Paul's children in the faith.
Abraham could not raise so many men as Abimelech had, but he had three hundred and eighteen trained servants born in his house, they were his house; that is the kind of military that are in view -- the household of faith.
H.B. Of Timothy Paul says, "See that he may be with you without fear", @1 Corinthians 16: 10. Is that the ewe-lamb character?
J.T. Yes. He would not fight his way, but wait his opportunity.
H.B. I would like a little more help as to the digging. Is it making definite room inwardly for the Holy Spirit, not merely the refusal of the features of the flesh?
J.T. That is what is meant. They dug the well with their staves -- I take it that would allude to experience, that I have tested out the flesh and am resolved not to use it again; experience precedes the digging. Abraham had experience of Ishmael, and his resolve was not to resort to that principle again. Digging is strenuous work, it involves exercise; and the experience that you get in earlier life helps you. You would say, I have tried man's method before and it has been futile, I will not use it again. I got up last night and I was dependent on the Lord and I never had such
{170}
liberty. I did not have much to say, but I had liberty, I had power in what I was saying. At another time I committed a thing to memory and I gave it out, but I did not have power; I will not do that again. Such experience precedes digging.
Ques. What is the thought in the law-giver?
J.T. The law-giver regulates you. The princes dug the well at the direction of the law-giver; @Numbers 21: 18.
Rem. You would not rely on past help, but seek present help.
J.T. That enters into it too. Many struggle on in their service, in their spiritual experience, their worship, and in the part they take in the assembly: they do not see how futile are their efforts. The princes were men of experience.
A.E.L. How do the foes Sihon and Og come in?
J.T. I suppose Og was a big man; that is probably the last thing we get rid of, our own self-importance. Even if I do use the Holy Spirit and have power in my ministry, I may not get rid of Og. I may think that, after all I am a big man, bigger than ever if I have been helped by God. I have to learn that myself and my bigness is Og.
Rem. This well being Abraham's well, would be a source of refreshment to others.
J.T. Yes, that is what is meant spiritually. He approaches the subject at once, it says, "Abimelech ... spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest". And he goes on to say, "swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal deceitfully with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson ... . And Abraham said, I will swear". Then it says, "And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water that Abimelech's servants had violently taken away". That is what he had uppermost in his mind. You can see the link between this passage and chapter 17.
Ques. What do you make of the tree or the grove he planted? Is that the thought of fruitfulness again?
{171}
J.T. "Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God". I think he there formally commits himself, for it is a question of his worship now, the grove alludes to his worship. He is calling on the name of the Eternal God. He can well afford to make a covenant with the support of such a God. Abimelech wanted it to extend to his son, and grandson -- it did not go beyond that. But Abraham would say, I can well afford to make a covenant, for I am calling on the name of the Eternal God -- His are eternal relationships. I think it brings us on to those who worship by the Spirit of God. Abraham began as a worshipper, he began with an altar, now he has this grove and calls on the name of the Eternal God; it is an eternal thing we are brought into.
Rem. There is no way of escape from idolatry but entering on this ground of worship.
J.T. Quite so. Whilst God graciously comes down near to you, as He does here in saying to Abraham. "It is I", yet faith recognises His greatness, He is *the Eternal God*. This is the first reference to the Eternal God. Abraham is in liberty now, not in fear; God would have us to be without fear.
Ques. I would like help in regard to the activities of the Spirit. You have referred to those in whom the Spirit is grieved. Would this include believers who having the Spirit, are not yet separated to the truth that is in the mind of God? I take it it is possible to have the Spirit, and yet not be led by Him.
J.T. That is right. Abraham is making everything of the Spirit. This great man, Abimelech, recognised that God was with him, as men will by-and-by, when ten men "shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you", @Zechariah 8: 23. There will be evidence that God is operating there. Abraham is doing things, and Abimelech says, "God is with thee
{172}
in all that thou doest": then Abraham immediately brings up the question of the well, indicating that the secret of all this is the Spirit. He says, "I have dug this well", that is, I have endeavoured to make room for the Spirit, and you can see that I have done it by this well, but you are trying to baulk me. "Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water that Abimelech's servants had violently taken away". They were frustrating this great principle of operating by the Spirit.
Ques. Was Paul reproving Peter as mentioned in the epistle to the Galatians because the well of water had been taken away?
J.T. That is the thought. So now Abraham gave him cattle, it says, and both of them made a covenant, and Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by them selves. The result is to be seen by itself, it is the product of the Spirit, and is to be seen by itself detached from all else. And Abimelech said, "What mean these seven ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves?" He notices this, and Abraham says, "That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well". Abraham has these seven ewe-lambs prominently in his mind in all this, they represent the great product of the Spirit, and are the witness that he dug the well.
H.B. You spoke of persons. Do these seven ewe-lambs represent such characteristically?
J.T. Quite so. You might say, it is Christ. He says, for instance, to the leper, "Go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them", @Luke 5: 14. They never saw a leper like that, one cleansed by Christ.
Ques. Is that seen in the Israel of God, at the end of Galatians?
J.T. That is the idea.
Ques. Does the last verse of this chapter show that
{173}
it is possible to live in the land of the Philistines, surrounded by them, and yet be free in this way?
J.T. That is what I thought. Abraham is sojourning there without fear and carrying on his worship of the Eternal God.
Rem. In chapter 20 Abraham received cattle from Abimelech, now he is the giver.
J.T. Yes, see how superior he is. It is the Spirit of God that makes us superior to this world -- nothing else.
Ques. Is there a link with Peter and John in @Acts 3 where they say "Look on us"?
J.T. Yes. They were a beautiful sight -- God's best, as you might say -- going up to the temple at the hour of prayer.
A.M. Do we see the seven ewe-lambs in @Acts 11, where Peter draws attention to himself and the six men who went with him? They of the circumcision contended with Peter after being with Cornelius, and he points to the six men who were with him as a proof of the service he had rendered.
J.T. I think that is a good example. "Ye which are spiritual, restore" (@Galatians 6: 1); they are the only trustworthy persons to visit one needing recovery.
Ques. After Abimelech and Phichol return Abraham sets up a grove and calls on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God. The spirit that is seen in them would be out of place in the service of God?
J.T. Those men would have been in the way in the service, but they have these seven ewe-lambs for a testimony to them. One great point in these last days, whatever the results may be, is that God has a testimony, and He will be able to say to them by and by, "Thou knewest all this" @Daniel 5:22. We want the well open, we want that to continue. God is helping us to continue on the line of the Spirit in order to keep things open; the flesh is not to be allowed to baulk the action of the Spirit.
{174}
Rem. In the next chapter we see how these things are tested -- God would test Abraham.
J.T. Yes, and He would bring him into greater things through the test; it is progress all the way through, and the exercise for us today is to keep the well open. We are resolved, by the Lord's help, to keep the flesh out, to allow room for the blessed activities of the Spirit; these meetings are all for this purpose, so that the blessed activities of the Spirit might proceed.
Ques. In regard to the meetings for ministry, which have been revived in these days, would they form an occasion for the power of God to be seen amongst us?
J.T. I think they do. Meetings like this, and all meetings in which the Spirit is free, correspond with this. It is of the greatest importance that we should keep before us that there is to be room for the Spirit. "Grieve not the holy Spirit of God", @Ephesians 4: 30. "Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings" -- @1 Thessalonians 5: 19 - 20 -- make room for the flow of the water.
Ques. Were they keeping the well open in the Acts by ministering to the Lord and fasting?
J.T. Quite so -- they worshipped by the Spirit of God.
Rem. "Whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever", @Ecclesiastes 3: 14. He is the Eternal God -- there is something to rest on.
J.T. Yes, quite so. There is a landmark here, both in Beer-sheba and in the Eternal God: the faithfulness of God and the perpetuity that would enter into eternal relations. It is no matter of time now, we are entering on eternal relations. Moses takes it up later, he speaks to God in this way -- "From eternity to eternity thou art God!" @Psalm 90: 2.
{175}
THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANTS (3)
@Genesis 26: 23 - 33; @Genesis 31: 44 - 55
J.T. Beer-sheba is the thought that I believe the Spirit would emphasise in this first scripture; it stands as witness to the idea of covenant. The intent of the sign given to Abraham is to produce a heavenly order of things, it is Colossian truth as to its concrete application to christians, and prepares the way for our heavenly position. Its place in the book of Joshua shows that it is preparatory to entrance into possession of the land, the reproach of Egypt rolled away, and what follows in @Genesis 18, shows that this is what is in mind in circumcision, it marks a *heavenly* people. The rigid adherence to the sign in chapter 17 in Abraham's house, is the background of the visitation in chapter 18. "God is not ashamed to be called their God" (@Hebrews 11: 16), refers to such as Abraham consequent on the adherence to the command as to circumcision. That brings in the light of Isaac in chapter 18, and the instruction as to the judgment of the world to make room for the heavenly man. That is the setting, I believe, of the chapters. Isaac in chapter 22 is the heavenly man, not simply as born, but as raised from the dead. He is not said to have descended with Abraham or his young men from the mount where, he is offered up. Abraham went to Beer-sheba, but there is nothing said about Isaac going there; he sets forth Christ in heaven, that is the governing principle of these chapters -- Christ in heaven, not only risen and remaining in that setting, not coming down. Rebekah is introduced in chapter 24, and now Isaac in chapter 26 is definitely in the land to stay there, he is not to leave the land, nor does he, and he reaps a hundred-fold from his sowing, and, thus recognised, he comes to Beer-sheba. I think that we may gather from the verses read that the link is with chapter 21 where the place is formally mentioned and
{176}
named. Now it is a city, which is the sign of the heavenly position, and sustained, not simply by a well -- they had been digging -- but they "found water", so that he calls it Shebah; now we are told that the city was called Beer-sheba, verses 32, 33. I think if we dwelt a little on these thoughts the Lord would help as to the heavenly position and the sign of it -- the sign of it as a city; the name of the city comes down "to this day". Beersheba is called a city here; allied with the idea of water, a city implies order and light, sustained alone by the Spirit of God.
W.C.G. The heavenly portion is opened up to persons in whom the sign of circumcision is manifest.
J.T. That is what I thought. Divine visitation makes the thing very concrete. Jehovah came to Abraham; following on that the conversation between God and Abraham is broken off -- "he left off talking with him; and God went up from Abraham", @Genesis 17: 22.
W.C.G. Is that the reason of Paul's conflict in @Colossians 2? Was it that conditions might be found with the saints in which the heavenly portion could be revealed to them? If they did not continue in the faith grounded and settled, they might go back to conditions which were prior to the truth of circumcision.
J.T. That is the side that is stressed immediately in @Colossians 2: 11, he says -- "In whom also ye have been circumcised with circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ". The conversation with Abraham was left off after the covenant was made in @Genesis 17, as if God would leave him and see what he will do. Abraham immediately applies the thought of circumcision in the fullest way to his house and then he is at his tent door, the full position of a heavenly man, and the divine visitation confirms everything. He knows what to do, too, when the men come; if he knows how to behave on earth at the oaks of Mamre, he knows
{177}
how to behave in heaven, he is shown to be fit for heaven by his behaviour.
H.B. Is that seen on the mount?
J.T. It is seen in chapter 18 in the way he entertains the heavenly Visitors, how perfectly he is in accord with the position. They do everything he suggests, they leave it with him and wait there till he finishes what he has in mind; that man is fit for heaven, he would not be out of place there.
H.B. It is possible for us to have conditions like this, where we may prove fit for heaven even now?
J.T. That is what is going on in the assembly -- it is a question of how we behave in the assembly.
J.C. Do you connect the city intimately with the assembly? -- Paul was told to go into the city.
J.T. Yes, it is a thought that runs through the Acts, and is seen fully in Galatians -- "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother", @Galatians 4: 26.
J.McC.R. You were referring to the bow in the cloud, the token of the covenant God had established with Noah, then the token as to circumcision, and then the heap of stones. Is there any moral order?
J.T. The first is a universal covenant, involving the governance of the world, the ordering of it so as to afford a theatre for the development of what God has in His mind eternally; it is just a temporary covenant "while the earth remaineth" @Genesis 8:22. But what we are dealing with in connection with Abraham is eternal, we arrive there at the Eternal God; it is a question of love, of sovereign selection and purpose seen in one man, and the covenant of circumcision is to relieve us of all that hinders through the flesh, and all that dishonours and discredits us, so that all the reproach is rolled away. Jehovah going up from Abraham and leaving him gives opportunity to show how much he has taken it in. Being left to ourselves, as subjects of the work of God, the work of God manifests itself, it is true to itself, and in
{178}
Abraham's case it was manifestly so, because he carried out the thought of God fully at the end of chapter 17. In the beginning of chapter 18 he is sitting at his tent door in the heat of the day, and Jehovah comes to him, three men come to him -- heaven came down in those Persons; it is a question of Persons, and he discerns one of them (without their announcing their names) to be the Lord, and proposes certain things, and they acquiesce in all that he said. There is no direction from them, it is just what Abraham does; he is proving himself to be a heavenly man, which is the point now. In 1 Corinthians we are left with the commandment; Paul says, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14: 37. Recognising that, I qualify for heaven, I am spiritual. The visitation brings this out and Abraham knows what to do. Jehovah says afterwards, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?" @Genesis 18: 17. In chapter 8: 21 God says certain things "in his heart"; that goes on, and God is pleased to disclose what is in His heart. He had come down to destroy Sodom; He would disclose it to Abraham.
Ques. Are the experiences up to the 18th chapter to qualify us to take care of the house of God -- the assembly -- making room afterwards for the Spirit speaking expressly?
J.T. I think that is the way it works out. We are on new ground, Isaac is in view; the heavenly man is seen in Abraham in *character* now, and Isaac is introduced as prospective, as coming in. The new scene is to be filled with Christ, Isaac is to replace everything. Isaac is to be in the house, not only born into it, but as risen from the dead -- that is the position, and I think chapter 26 links on with all that. These signs, the seven ewe-lambs, and the city, are all subsequent to the great thought of circumcision. The city Beer-sheba is the light and order of heaven known here on earth,
{179}
and the assurance that all is secured in a risen Christ, that everything is going through in a risen Christ.
T.G. Would you suggest, that, as behaving ourselves in the house of God, we are in accord with that?
J.T. That is right. While the apostle delayed, Timothy was tested and Paul said, "These things write I unto thee ... that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth" @1 Timothy 3:15. That is the idea -- to know how to behave oneself.
Then, to go on, the sign of the heap of stones called Galeed (chapter 31: 48), is to show how we may drop down from a heavenly level; that is often seen in the history of the assembly itself, and in the history of each of us. A local assembly is liable to drop from a heavenly level to a lower one; a level withal that God recognises, but a very much lower state of things. That is the order of these signs, so we have to be prepared presently for a very humbling consideration; but it is very exhilarating to get on the high level of Abraham and Isaac, and a city sustained by water -- by the Spirit of God.
L.D.M. Would that go as far as Ephesians?
J.T. I think so, that is the level on which christianity is introduced; then we get down lower in Jacob.
Ques. "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit" (@Galatians 5: 25); does that cover it?
J.T. Well, yes. We have to apprehend the Spirit in Ephesians; He is hardly mentioned in Colossians, it is a question of the work of God there, and that must be recognised if we are to go over; that is why Abraham is left to work things out in @Genesis 17. In other instances we are left, we are tested by the commandment, but in Ephesians the Spirit is very prominent, also in Romans and Corinthians, but not in Colossians. Ephesians is the great sphere for the work of the Spirit from the heavenly side, the fulness of the Spirit's operations.
{180}
W.S.S. We must be impressed with the great amount of preparatory work which had to be undertaken before Isaac came into view.
J.T. I think we can see the need of that. If it is not after Christ, that settles it; put everything aside but Christ is what Colossians means. Philosophy and ceremonialism may be very nice and very appealing to the mind, but turn it aside, it is "not after Christ" @Colossians 2:8; that is what these chapters in Genesis mean, they bring in a heavenly Man, One having died and risen.
W.S.S. Suggesting the work that needs to take place in our own souls that we may be able to apprehend this.
J.T. That is right. It is a long protracted process, but necessary, for the flesh is so hard to break away from, so tough.
W.C.G. The material of which the assembly is built comes into full view in Colossians. "Rooted and built up in him" @Colossians 2:7, and "in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him". @Colossians 2:9 - 10
J.T. Yes, circumcision and the cross are the two things that are stressed in @Colossians 2. It is a most drastic setting aside of all that is creditable in this world, whatever it be; whether it is refined philosophy, or refined ceremonialism. It is not the gross side of things, but the refined; they are ruthlessly set aside in the circumcision of Christ, and in the cross of Christ.
L.D.M. So the thought in Colossians is, "Christ in you, the hope of glory" @Colossians 1:27, not exactly the Spirit in you.
J.T. Quite so. We are to set our "mind on the things that are above" @Colossians 3:2. Isaac does not come down from the mount in @Genesis 22, the suggestion is that he remains there; resurrection is just a stepping-stone into heaven.
J.G. Would you say that Peter was tested on the mount of transfiguration in regard to the heavenly position and failed there in his conduct?
J.T. Yes, he was not fit for the place -- that is the
{181}
point. He was specially selected, but he was not equal to the place; he became equal to it later. The thing to see is the greatness of the place; it was not the Christ below that he saw, but the Christ above that was transfigured. It was not by an outward application of anything, but what He was personally, the coming out of something that had been hidden. The truth is expanded for us as we apprehend Christ in heaven. He is in His own domain, and we have to be prepared for it. John says, "it doth not yet appear what we shall be" @1 John 3:2. Although he had been on the mount of transfiguration, though he saw Christ risen too, yet he says, "it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but ... when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is"@1 John 3:2, not as He was, but as He is. That is the greatness of Christ up there, *the great expansion of His own domain*.
H.B. Do we get in the apostle's prayer in @Ephesians 3, the development in us which would answer to that -- being "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man"? @Ephesians 3:16
J.T. Quite so, those two prayers are to fit us for the inner domain; and I think that all enters, in type, into Beer-sheba here -- it is called a city.
G.A.v.S. Do these qualifications and features go to bring in city conditions in accord with the thoughts of God, on earth as they are in heaven?
J.T. That is a good way of putting it -- a reflection of heaven on earth. How great that is for God! -- and it is to enter into every company of His people now as sustained by the well -- that is the point, the servants came and said "We have found water". Abimelech comes with Phichol and his friend, that is, the military man and the social man. The social side is so insidious, it is the danger for those who are heavenly, for there is refinement attaching to it; we make so much of refinement, and the devil uses it to replace what is heavenly; but Isaac is not caught by that -- he sent them away. We do not cultivate or promote any bad feelings with
{182}
people around us; we are heavenly, and we are not doing people any harm. But Isaac sends them away; his great dignity is seen in that.
G.A.v.S. We do not enter into those conditions at all. You can see that if you brought Abimelech and Phichol and his friend into the city, their thoughts would have been entirely different from Isaac's, so he sends them away; they had nothing to do with Beersheba.
J.McC.R. I should like to ask if every believer has the Spirit? -- that is a difficulty with some of us.
J.T. The Scriptures would lead us to think differently from that. They would lead us to connect the Spirit with the sign of circumcision; if a man has not that sign you cannot say he has the Spirit -- he must have the sign. The Holy Spirit is characteristically given to believers, of course, but you cannot say from Scripture that every believer has the Spirit.
W.C.G. Is not the word "believer" used in too general a sense? -- you must enquire what they believe. They may not have believed that which is connected with the gift of the Spirit.
J.T. Yes, and even if they have believed everything, the gift of the Spirit is not automatic; it is a question of giving, and it is a question of the Giver's privilege. Surely it is due to God that we should afford Him that liberty -- what a great gift it is! -- let Him give it when He pleases.
J.W. Could you form part of the assembly if you had not received the Spirit?
J.T. No, you are in the assembly by the Spirit. "In the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body", @1 Corinthians 12: 13. It seems to me, that the saints ought to be conversant with the truth of the Spirit. The Spirit is a gift, and the Lord says, "how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" @Luke 11:13
F.I. What has one without the Spirit?
{183}
J.T. Well, he may have justification and forgiveness of sins -- in fact he must have these, if he is a believer at all.
F.I. Would it be right to say that in every believer there is a work of God by the Spirit, but every believer has not the Spirit as known power in his soul?
J.T. Quite so; and there are many like that, who have not the Spirit.
G.A.v.S. Have we not to consider the gift of the Spirit, as presented in @1 Corinthians 12, to apprehend that the gift of the Spirit is the result of a divine formation in connection with which the people of God are brought into divine incorporation with what is here on earth for God?
J.T. Yes. "In whom ye also trusted ...". "In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed". @Ephesians 1:13 It is the order of one, two, three. "In whom also, having believed" -- a past thought -- "ye have been sealed". One follows the other, but you cannot say it must be automatic, for the action of sealing must be God's -- *He* gives the Spirit. "We have found water". There was water in the assembly at Ephesus, the Spirit was there. The twelve men we read of in @Acts 19 received the gift of the Spirit at one time.
L.D.M. @John 3 gives subjection to Christ, then in @John 4 you get the vessel carrying the water.
J.T. Just so; the Spirit is not given by measure to Him, the Christ.
L.D.M. It is a suggestion of the Son.
J.T. Quite so, it is administration. John saw the Spirit as well as the Son in chapter 3 -- all things are given into the hand of the Son -- the Father loves the Son, and the Spirit is not given by measure to Him. The next chapter shows how the Spirit is administered -- "If thou knowest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" @John 4:10. You must bring in the administrative side, and
{184}
surely it is left with Him as to when He gives it. So that I think the allusion to the Spirit in Ephesus, that they had received Him, is the water, the assembly has it. Paul is a witness to that; these twelve men got it at one time, therefore there is room for development of the great thoughts of God in that assembly.
Rem. We have made it too automatic.
J.T. I think so, and we are on low ground; we ought to see this thought "We have found water", and that enters into the thought of the city. Ephesians is the idea of the city and the heavenly thoughts here.
W.S.S. Would you say that finding the water is a further thought to receiving the Spirit, finding the sphere in which the Spirit is free to move?
J.T. I think that is right. It stands in relation to the city, but the apostle, in speaking to the Ephesians, calls attention to the fact that they had the Spirit -- he is not questioning their having it; the Spirit is there in the assembly.
Rem. That question had been raised and settled.
J.T. That is right. "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" @Acts 19:2 and now brethren are asking, Can we believe without the Holy Spirit?
G.A.v.S. New birth is the work of the Spirit from outside, whereas the reception of the Spirit is God sealing that work which has brought about faith, by giving the Spirit to those who have believed?
J.T. Yes, and you make room for the principle of gift, the Holy Spirit is a gift and may be asked for; we must make room too for the activity of faith, the work of God in us. In America, fifty or sixty years ago, a line of teaching was developed, and I believe has place still, that new birth implies everything; not only the initial work of God in a man's soul, but everything -- and that he gets the Spirit then. That is current, and it corresponds to the low state of things we are approaching in @Genesis 3: 1, where people do not see things clearly. At Ephesus you are on the mountain tops, you see
{185}
everything clearly. The man in @Mark 8 "saw all things clearly", not only all men, but "all things".
H.B. It says they spake with tongues and prophesied, that is having found water.
J.T. That is right.
A.N. Is being born of water and of the Spirit, and having entrance into the kingdom of God, further than new birth?
J.T. Well, it is in @John 3. First it is, "Ye must be born again" @John 3:7; no part of the moral being of the man is excluded from this operation. Then the Lord enlarges on that in replying to Nicodemus by saying, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" @John 3:5. The principle of cleansing would be there, of course, but you have to wait for chapter 4 to get the water. We have the water of cleansing in chapter 3 in the birth, in the operation; but in chapter 4 it is drinking.
Rem. You have to come to the reservoir.
J.T. That is the thought in the persons. Then the idea carried into a city is an immense thought; things are compacted together and held for God.
Now in @Genesis 31 we come to a lower state of things, and, alas, we have to do with such a state; we have to own, I think, that it is descriptive of present conditions. There are dear brethren who are mutually recriminative; there is a want of practical righteousness, there is a want of confidence, a speaking against one another. The chapter begins with Jacob hearing what the sons of Laban were saying about him, This brother has got all the glory at our expense -- that sort of thing. Then another member of the family steals an idol; they would get away from one another secretly. There is the sign of sorrowful separation, the very opposite of what we have been speaking of, for the principle of the heavenly city is unity -- "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" (@Ephesians 2: 6) -- that is the principle of
{186}
unity; we do not want to be separated, we want to be together; not to go by separate ways, there is only one way -- we all must go up together. Here are brothers pulling away from one another.
G.A.v.S. Is that what we get in verse 1 of @Proverbs 18? -- "He that separateth himself seeketh his pleasure, he is vehement against all sound wisdom".
J.T. Yes -- "These be they who separate themselves" ... "having not the Spirit" (@Jude 19); that is the kind of thing.
J.W. Would Abimelech and those with him represent those who want the benefits of the covenant, but are not prepared to walk in a separate path for the pleasure of God? Abimelech went back to his own land.
J.T. That is what we are speaking of, those who have not the Spirit, they can get along without the brethren. Laban can get along without Jacob, and Jacob without Laban -- that is a "heap", very different from a city in beautiful symmetry and order. They have no confidence in one another. If I am afraid a brother is going to hurt me, I have no confidence in him; but the covenant is to promote confidence and love.
Rem. Paul spoke of grievous wolves coming in, and "also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things", @Acts 20: 29 - 30.
J.T. Yes, it is a state of things where separation from one another is accepted; we cannot afford to be separated from one another; it is abhorrent to the spirit of the assembly; unity is the principle, love of our brethren, we must have our brethren.
W.S.S. They quarrelled about a matter that was hidden, it did not come to light -- the teraphim. That is a serious matter that things do not come to light.
J.T. Yes. Well, you can see in reading this chapter and the preceding chapter, in fact from the time Jacob went to Padan-Aram, that it is one continuous struggle; the wages question comes up, and there is the difficulty
{187}
with Rachel, and the differences between the wives, and the thing culminates in this chapter where they want to get away from one another. Then, over against that, is the remarkable fact that God is in all this, that is to encourage us -- (it is like the ugliness of the Cushite wife of Moses) -- in spite of all this, God is with him and helping him, though in a distant sort of way. It is the very opposite to Pentecost, when the barrier of language was broken down, where you get all speaking the same thing, the same language; it is the language of heaven, for that is how the Lord spoke to Paul, the pure language given to the saints so that we understand one another, love understands, it is the language of love.
G.A.v.S. Jacob was told to depart from Padan-Aram. Separation from Padan-Aram is right, but separation from our brother is not right; would that be the distinction?
J.T. That is the thing. What a sorrowful state of things, yet they are brethren; Laban was Rebekah's brother.
E. G. What a contrast this is to @Psalm 133 "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! ... there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".
J.T. Quite so. "With all lowliness and meekness ... endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all", @Ephesians 4: 2 - 6. What a bond of unity! And here are brethren saying, Well, this heap is to be between us. They are agreeing to differ, that is the principle of this heap, an agreement to be separated from one another.
Rem. You might have these features in a gathering, but there is an opportunity for bringing in the features of the heavenly Man, humbleness and meekness and
{188}
gentleness; it is an opportunity for us to work out those things together, even in the face of these characteristics.
J.T. Well, the comforting thing is that God is working in the face of all this in the history of Jacob; God is with him in spite of all the conditions. So that we may take courage in spite of our ugliness, and this bickering and speaking evil of one another, and these hidden things. Jacob says, "And now, come, let us make a covenant" -- there is something in that, that is the proposal in verse 44 -- "Let it be a witness between me and thee". Then it says, "And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar". Now this brother is doing something that is dignified; moral dignity is such a necessity, because we get down so low that we act like men. I believe Jacob is leading in recovery in taking a stone and setting it up as a pillar. He had done that before, at Bethel; there is one idea of Bethel here, setting up a stone pillar. But then he says to his brethren, "Gather stones".
G.A.v.S. You mean he became an example to them in some little way.
J.T. No matter in how little a way a brother or sister acts on the principles of the house of God, let us take note of it, follow on that line. But then they made a heap -- that does not belong to the house of God.
G.A.v.S. Is that what has happened to a large extent in christendom?
J.T. Yes, there is no heavenly thought at all in that; a heap is nothing at all for God, there is nothing in it suggesting heaven.
L.D.M. It says, they "ate there upon the heap".
J.T. Yes, they broke bread. The Lord's supper is nominally gone on with, in all these heaps, but there is nothing dignified about it. One does not mention this to traduce others but to raise the question, Where are we in these low conditions? We do not have far to go to get them. Jacob is the leading man here, and it is
{189}
important to get such a man in these circumstances, one who introduces a dignified thought, such thoughts as have a place in the house of God. The stone pillar is something. I believe there is recovery in Jacob's action, first in verse 45 -- he "took a stone and set it up for a pillar", and then he invites his brethren to gather stones, but he does not tell them what to do with them. There is a sort of independent state of things; they did that, but then they made a heap; still the pillar was there, and we get Laban alluding to it (verse 51), "Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set up between me and thee". The pillar is there, whether it is the one that Jacob built or not, the idea is there.
G.A.v.S. Do you think Laban takes up the thought and gives his own interpretation to it?
J.T. Yes, I think that is how it stands. He associates it with the heap, as if they were on the same level, but I think Jacob had a more exalted thought than the heap, but, under these circumstances, he had no power to carry out the divine thought, which is so humbling. If you get a right thought, wait on God to help you to pursue the line of it, instead of having a heap. Jacob had light, he was going towards the house of God. I stress this section because we have not far to go to find these conditions, and how are we to get out of them? If a brother has any little suggestion of God's house, take notice of that, do not turn it down and do not allow independent action; one brother doing one thing, and another brother doing another, so that you have nothing but a heap. The principle in Jacob's action is to follow a line.
Rem. At Corinth the apostle had to say as to their coming together "it is not to eat the Lord's supper", @1 Corinthians 11: 20.
J.T. Exactly, they were in coteries, and content to be thus -- that is Galeed: it is a heap of witness sure enough, but what to? Division among the saints, and
{190}
it is accepted as though it were a right principle that can be allowed. God hates that.
W.S.S. The issue that was raised by Abraham, and then by Isaac, with the Philistines produced something spiritual in a well. There is no suggestion of what is spiritual being produced by this matter.
J.T. No, nothing at all. There is a suggestion in Jacob's action if they had only followed it. "Gather stones" is good enough, but what will you do with them when you gather them? Stones are symbolically persons; "Yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house" @1 Peter 2:5, says Peter. They are being built up -- living stones builded -- there is regularity and order in them, not a heap.
H.B-t. What are we to understand by the next step, the angels of God meeting him?
J.T. Well, it shows that God is in all this, He does not forsake us because of these conditions, He is leading on to what the pillar ought to have suggested, that is, He is leading on to Bethel. All that follows (chapters 32 - 35), is to consummate in what is in the mind of God, to effectuate His own thoughts in Jacob. The two camps, here in chapter 32: 1, are an adequate testimony to divine care; in spite of this low state of things, God remains God, He is watching over us and doing all possible to steer us clear of all this, and lead us up to Bethel. "I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar" -- it is anointing the pillar now, not simply setting it up.
W.C.G. Jacob was a man of faith but he stopped in Syria for commercial purposes, though he went there to get a wife.
J.T. Yes. It was right enough to go there for a wife -- that is as a type of Christ -- but to remain there for worldly gain, commercial considerations, is another matter -- that shows a low state of things.
H.B. Is verse 54 -- "Jacob offered a sacrifice upon the mountain, and invited his brethren to eat bread:
{191}
and they ate bread and lodged on the mountain" -- is that a more elevated state of things?
J.T. I think that is elevation. Jacob is the leading man -- that is what we ought to notice, and we should look for a Jacob in these circumstances.
G.A.v.S. Is there any significance in, "The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us"; it goes on to say that "Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac".
J.T. I think Jacob is rising here. Isaac is the risen man, so in chapter 46: 1 it also says, "he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac" -- it is the risen man, I think. Jacob is the leading man; God always provides a leading man in these circumstances. I believe the heap suggests independency.
G.A.v.S. The contrast would be for each to have his little niche in relation to the brethren, so that the true Isaac would be expressed.
J.T. Yes. What was in Jacob's mind was right, but he had no power to carry it out; which is often the case because of the independent position taken up by certain persons, in saying this or that. The thing is to follow a lead, however small, and we will reach the end, and God is with Jacob in all this.
R.K.C. Is not the great point for us to see how this is worked out amongst ourselves?
J.T. Certainly, that *is* the point of it for us.
Rem. We sometimes get heaps in our care meetings.
J.T. Well, this applies. We may have care meetings and there are disagreements, but what is worse is, that there should be anything like this when we come together in assembly to carry out a judgment -- that is a most serious matter!
Ques. Should the judgment be formed in the care meeting?
J.T. The care meeting can never be more than tentative; it is in the assembly that things are final.
{192}
Ques. Would you say a little as to offering the sacrifice on the mountain and inviting his brethren?
J.T. Well, as we have been remarking, that is elevation, but conditions did not warrant the opening up of these things. I believe God comes in the next chapter, to meet Jacob and to confirm all this, but all is on the road to Bethel, and for that, you must have a leader. If you get a leader, watch that man, and God will be with you; that is what the two camps of angels mean, I think.
Rem. We should search our own hearts and see whether any of these unsuitable feelings to our brethren exist, that this condition of things may not go on.
J.T. That is the thing.
F.I. If we are not in the good of this, may the Supper become just a heap of stones to us, just a witness of what belongs to us, nothing more?
J.T. Well, Paul said, that such a condition is "not ... the Lord's supper", @1 Corinthians 11: 20.
{193}
THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANTS (4)
@Exodus 31: 12 - 17; @1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 26
J.T. Our subject is signs of covenants spoken of in Scripture. We began with the rainbow, then circumcision as the sign of the covenant made with Abraham, and the seven ewe-lambs given to Abimelech by Abraham witnessing to the fact that he had dug the well. Circumcision is the putting off of "the body of the flesh", but the well is the bringing in of the positive thing, the spirit of Christ, the heavenly Man. Then we considered Isaac and the digging of the well by Abraham. Isaac's servants said, "We have found water", and Isaac calls the well Shebah, connecting it with what Abraham said as to the well of the oath; the well of the oath would imply the means of maintaining the covenant in a heavenly way, it is in the power of the Spirit. We have the word "city" added in Isaac's case, in @Genesis 26, the city was called Beer-sheba unto this day. That is not only the negative thought of "the putting off of the body of the flesh", but the putting on -- the well so prominently mentioned implying the Spirit; and the city, according to Ephesians, implying a sphere where the Spirit is free to develop heavenly thoughts. One of the greatest thoughts of the assembly is that it is heavenly, although here, such a vessel is available to God to develop His thoughts, especially of government and light and order.
Then we had the sign of the covenant between Laban and Jacob, which, as pointed out, was a very humiliating thing; a heap of stones, intended to be a witness between brethren who are separated. Instead of denoting the presence of active love, it denoted the negation of it in brethren being mutually agreed to be absent one from the other, and to be contented in the absence. A humbling side of the truth, but one to be observed, because it is so marked in the history of the assembly, alas,
{194}
certainly it marks its public history, and, as was remarked today, we have not far to go in seeing it, in brethren together, although perhaps on right ground, yet out of keeping with it in their spirits. The mutual recriminations marking Jacob and Laban often mark local meetings, and therefore, it is a sign to be avoided; anything that reminds us of our true state is not to be ignored, but it is most humbling to have such a witness. It was pointed out that there is correspondence with what arose at Corinth after the apostle's departure; brethren divided up into coteries, possibly implying social distinctions, yet carrying on the symbol of the Lord's supper without the love, carrying it on in a partisan way; not yet divided up into separate rooms, but in the same hall apparently, yet divided up into coteries, so the word "Galeed" might be written up over the whole scene, and the apostle says, "this is not to eat the Lord's supper". Although negative, it is important to have this to express the truth, something to warn us that we should keep away from the state it describes.
In Genesis the work of God is allowed to show and prove itself, without formal authority or requirements from God; and alas, the works of the flesh too, show themselves; for there was little to restrain Jacob and Laban in what they were doing, Jacob in amassing wealth and making Laban wealthy too -- it was just a commercial matter. Laban's sons were talking about the glory that Jacob had acquired, their idea of glory was just sheep and oxen and lands -- material things; but what we may reach is the kind of glory that accrues from the covenant of God. The sign of the covenant, of the new covenant, as we have it before us now, is said to be the ministry of the Spirit which "subsists in glory"; and "the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory", and again, "that which abides subsists in glory", @2 Corinthians 3:11. It is glory of an excessive kind; not glory in the wealth or status or education of this world, but what
{195}
accrues from the covenant of God, the new covenant. What may be also remarked, is, that we are now on ministerial ground for the moment -- that is Exodus and Corinthians -- going on to heaven. It is no longer left to us as to what we will do, but everything is carefully prescribed for, a most needful provision. Ministerial ground is the ground of Moses and Aaron, the one maintaining the authority of God here, and the other maintaining the worship and service of God inside -- the minister of the sanctuary.
W.C.G. The scripture read in Exodus is after the directions as to the house of God had been given. Would the connection with what we have had before lie in the fact that Jacob reached Bethel, which is the house of God?
J.T. Yes, he was going on to it. I believe the setting up of the pillar, as was pointed out this morning, was a lead given which God respected and made way for, for he moved on, and finally by the grace of God came to Bethel. Bethel in Genesis is just an abstract thought. It is connected with Jacob very noticeably, but it is an abstract thought; still, the ideas attaching to the house are very clearly set out there. When we come to Exodus, it is not an abstract thought, we have material, and the building; we do not get that in Genesis. It is not now a heap of stones, but material of the very finest quality; everything that is divinely required is supplied and constructed, not as a heap, but according to divine specification. There was not to be one iota of divergence from those specifications, and not only from the specifications, but the pattern *shown*, shown to one man only; so that we are dependent wholly on one man as to this, but that man is a minister, "faithful in all God's house".
W.C.G. For us, a minister of the true tabernacle.
J.T. Yes, that is the idea.
W. S. S. And was the matter of intelligence in putting things together seen in Bezaleel and Aholiab?
{196}
J.T. Yes, that comes in under Moses as having its own significance; but there is to be no divergence as to the quality of the material, it is to be excellent; so that Exodus is the supply secured through redemption.
H.B. How would this sign of the sabbath be seen today?
J.T. Well, it is noticeable that the term is found first in Exodus; the thing is in Genesis, but the term is found first in Exodus. You may have the things, as in the Old Testament, but unnamed. In the New Testament we have names, accurate names.
G.G. Was the sabbath ever kept until the days of Moses when the instruction was given?
J.T. There is no evidence that it was. In Exodus we are on ministerial ground, where there is the sense of obligation to have things right, and that, as having things right, nothing of importance is omitted, things are gathered up and named. Figuratively, it is the coming in of Christ to take up everything; He linked things on with the beginning, He linked certain things on with their primary setting, so that we might know what they meant.
J.C. Would you connect the pattern with the commandment?
J.T. The pattern is more than the commandment; the pattern is the mind of God presented concretely; nobody saw it but Moses, as far as the Scripture shows; he was a man to whom things could be shown. "The form of Jehovah", for instance, "doth he behold", @Numbers 12: 8. That was said of no one else. There is an allusion there to the great Mediator, the One who alone could see these things. It proved the pattern was Christ. Moses saw Him in such a sense, but not like Abraham -- Abraham rejoiced to see His day, the Lord said, "he saw it, and was glad" @John 8:56; he saw it in Isaac, I suppose, when Isaac was born and weaned -- but Moses saw the pattern, as the one who was obligated in regard of it, like an architect. To go back to Proverbs,
{197}
wisdom was God's architect, so to say. We must now be prepared for great accuracy, and no deviation, no such word as 'non-essentials' can be allowed, everything is essential, nothing must be left out that is divinely required.
T.G. Do you suggest it is secured through redemption?
J.T. Yes, God would not bring in a ministerial system without redemption, without the liberty wherewith Christ sets us free; it is a system of liberty founded on redemption.
H.B. Why does the sabbath first come in Exodus in relation to the manna?
J.T. Well, that is a point to be noticed. God says, "Tomorrow" -- it is near by, when you have the manna, the sabbath is near by -- that is the general principle. The principle of restriction is introduced; you are not to gather it on the sabbath, but you can gather twice as much the day before; so that there is the suggestion of increased capacity, capability of enlargement and the power to keep things until the time arrives. Like Mary, she acquired the habit, or power, of keeping things -- "against the day of my burying hath she kept this", the Lord says; @John 12: 7. Only a day to keep the manna, but still it was that principle, to gather twice as much, and keep what was needed for the sabbath with liberty to store it, which is only found in that connection. That is, there is the principle of liberty attaching to the Person of Christ here. When the Lord went through the corn fields, for instance, the disciples went further than He did -- they plucked the corn and rubbed it in their hands, and the Lord defends that; that is, He was inaugurating a system of liberty, He was the Leader in that, the presence of the manna brought about a state of liberty and with all that, the power to keep things. Keeping things under divine principle is right; but keeping back a thing that you should give out at the reading meeting, thinking you
{198}
will get a better opportunity later on, God does not approve of that. If you have a thing to give out, give it out. Then there are things that have to be kept back; you may have to keep things back for the good of the saints -- Paul did that; not because he wanted some fine thought for some special occasion -- that is not the idea at all.
L.M. You mention the reading meeting, would you apply the same thing to the morning meeting; we may keep back something on the Lord's day morning in priestly service thinking to give it on another occasion. Would that be an occasion for the manna to breed worms?
J.T. Quite so. Give it out, if the Lord lays it on your heart.
W.S.S. Is the sign to preserve us during the absence of Christ? I was thinking of the following chapter (@Exodus 32); the people failed during the absence of Moses.
J.T. Quite so. They did not know where he was "as for this Moses ... we wot not what is become of him!" @Exodus 32:1
W.S.S. I thought if they had been in the restfulness which this sign would bring about they would have been preserved.
J.T. Yes, they certainly would not have made the calf.
J.G. What have you in mind as answering to this sign today?
J.T. Well, we propose in this reading, to confine ourselves to the two thoughts, that is, the first covenant, and the second -- to keep the idea of the sign before us. The sign of the first covenant was the sabbath; the second, according to the way the Lord presents it in the gospels, and the apostle in the Corinthians, is the sign of the Lord's supper; that is the cup -- He says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (@1 Corinthians 11: 25): that is, the literal cup that He took into His
{199}
hand. So that our concern is to arrive at an understanding of the cup as a sign of the new covenant; not ignoring the sabbath, because it also has its force today. It is to arrive at a state of spiritual restfulness in the presence of Christ, and that is, I think, where @Exodus 16 is so instructive, showing that the sabbath was there -- "Tomorrow is the ... sabbath" @Exodus 16:23. The sabbath of rest is in the Person of Christ, even as the manna gave rest; where He is, there it is. Why not avail yourself of it? -- this restfulness. If anyone were to look into the Scriptures and compute the actual time required to be spent by Israel in keeping Sabbath, they would find that it covered more than one-fourth of their time. It is a very important matter; it shows what the sabbath is in the mind of God; it is to accustom us to eternity beforehand.
F.I. Does the entering into the truth of these two signs, the sabbath and the covenant, make us available in the service of the Lord, because in @Isaiah 56 it speaks of laying hold of the sabbath and the covenant, so that the people might become available in a priestly way for the service of Jehovah?
J.T. That is how it stands, I think. We have to learn to keep our sabbaths, to lie fallow, and to learn to be inactive in a spiritual way; to do no servile work.
J.B. Would the spirit of the covenant bring in liberty and glory in view of the Supper?
J.T. Well, it does. I think it is significant that the principle of keeping comes in in connection with @Exodus 16 -- they could keep things, and then that the sabbath is so near -- "Tomorrow is the ... sabbath". It is so near as the manna is seen and utilised. I think it is to call attention to what Christ was as here, in lowly circumstances. The manna was a small round thing lying on the face of the ground, a nameless thing -- "What is it?" -- you might ask it always of yourself. As understood, there is a sense of rest in it. The Lord had to say, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are
{200}
burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls", @Matthew 11: 28, 29. I believe that is the way it is arrived at. Well now, in @Exodus 31, the Spirit of God had been unfolding the glories of Christ, not in lowliness as the manna suggests, but the glories of Christ on high; that precedes this passage. And it is as if God were to say, Well surely you can rest in the presence of that! -- there is restfulness and adoration too. Think of the glories that passed before Moses one after another on the mount, what he saw -- and now you have a word added that you do not get in @Genesis 2 -- it is that Jehovah "rested, *and was refreshed*". You can understand it, the unfolding of the glories of Christ brought in refreshment. So that He insists here in these verses, 12 - 17, that the sabbath must be kept. It is called the "holy sabbath" in chapter 16. Jehovah says, it is the sign of the covenant "between me and you".
G.A.v.S. Would you suggest that the covenant of the sabbath involves the maintenance of a spirit of serene contemplation and enjoyment of the things that God has rested in in Christ? -- so that God is refreshed and the people of God enter their rest as they enter into the thoughts of God for them in Christ?
J.T. That is good. David, I think, would say Amen to that! It says, "king David went in and sat before Jehovah" (@1 Chronicles 17: 16); sitting down in the presence of all that! You can understand the refreshment in Exodus, and not in Genesis. While Adam was a figure of Him that was to come, he did not portray the glories that were caused to pass before Moses on the mount. The manna had to come in, a small round thing, which introduced the idea of the sabbath. We do not get the idea of refreshment in chapter 16, that part of Exodus finishes in chapter 24 where the saints, especially Moses and the elders of Israel, are invited to go up, and "they saw the God of Israel; and there
{201}
was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the form of heaven for clearness" @Exodus 24:10 -- there was liberty there. Then chapter 25 introduces the divine thought that He would dwell amongst His people; and Moses is there to receive the divine instructions as to the dwelling, and the pattern is shown him. Christ is brought in there as Man; it is not Christ as in the Deity, but Christ in manhood is anticipated on the mount, and that is what refreshes God, but we are to be brought into that refreshment. The Lord would bring us into it in inviting us to come to Him.
L.D.M. Is there any analogy with Luke's gospel; Mary keeping these things in her heart?
J.T. Well, I think that is good. She kept things in her heart, pondering over them, and they stood her in good stead later. I think she represents the principle of the treasury, the power to keep things with intelligence for the time that was suited to them.
L.D.M. Does she precede morally what is seen in the mount?
J.T. Quite so. It was all involved there in the Babe, and then, as He comes up out of the waters of baptism, heaven announces its delight in Him and henceforth the saints are to be brought into that. Hitherto it was anticipative, for Christ had not come into manhood. So that you have a state of things here upon earth of quietude, of restfulness, in the midst of a scene where all is turmoil: "the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, and whose waters cast up mire and dirt" (@Isaiah 57: 20); there is nothing stable -- it is manifestly so. Whereas in the assembly the divine thought is restfulness; Mary sat at the Lord's feet and heard His word, and that is developed, I believe, in Mary of Bethany; all is restful, not a word is said in that scene at Bethany, as far as the scripture shows. The silence is broken by Judas, the wicked like the troubled sea. But there is a scene of restfulness into which the Lord comes.
{202}
J.McC.R. Is the sabbath to the old covenant what the Supper is to the new covenant?
J.T. That is what I thought. Not that we lose the thought of the sabbath, the sign of the old covenant is not abrogated in that sense, the sabbath still has its meaning and is of great importance; the saints should learn to be quiet spiritually.
W.C.G. Would you say the privilege connected with the keeping of the sabbath and the covenant in it, was founded on the general covenant in chapter 19 they obeyed His voice and kept His covenant. Would that make way for this?
J.T. Just so, it is the same thing, only there is the beautiful suggestion added in chapter 31 of refreshment, pointing to what is seen above. Chapters 19 and 20 are the law given from Sinai to the people, but what is given in the chapters from 24 onwards is what is above -- Christ seen above. The assembly is really developed from Christ seen above, not simply in the forty days after He rose, but from Christ in heaven out of which the assembly comes. The Lord would help us to understand the difference between Christ on earth in flesh and blood, Christ during the forty days, and Christ as He is now.
W.S.S. That is brought to the knowledge of the assembly ministerially, as you have said.
J.T. Yes, the necessity for the ministerial side is because of where we are actually; the flesh is to be kept out, and kept out with authority, there is no option at all.
W.S.S. I was thinking of your remark in regard to refreshment, how important the reception of the ministry must be under these circumstances.
J.T. I think the Lord would call attention to ministry, as He does in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, particularly. It has its application now, for we are living in such radical times, times of non-essentials, as they call them; God is stressing that He is not in that at all,
{203}
that He has not changed His mind at all, and the Holy Spirit is here to maintain ministerial authority -- authority in ministry.
H.B. You spoke of Christ on high in @1 Corinthians 11, is that the light in which the cup is taken?
J.T. There you have it. Why should we get it from heaven? Is it not enough to get it in the gospels? It is the Supper by way of heaven, by way of the Lord glorified; everything is from heaven.
J.W. When Joseph was exalted he was given Asnath.
J.T. That is right; Christ receives the assembly in heaven. Adam and Eve are a figure of union before sin came in; but in all that follows that, the position is heavenly; Isaac is not to go out of the land, it is Christ in heaven, the assembly is brought to Him *there*. This is a most important point to keep clearly before us, that the sign of the covenant we have has come from heaven.
J.G. What would be the difference between taking the Supper in the light of the gospel record, and in the light of the Corinthian presentation?
J.T. Well, the Corinthian presentation brings in the heavenly and the ministerial side, it comes to us from the Lord above -- "I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you". It comes from the Lord, but comes through the minister *par excellence* of christianity; for, although it is "first Peter" as regards Jerusalem, it is Paul, who is the minister of the assembly; and we must pay attention to the ministry and the minister.
G.A.v.S. Is that why Peter gave way to it when he refers to what "our beloved brother Paul" @2 Peter 3:15 had said?
J.T. That is the thought, I am sure. There were things "hard to be understood, which the untaught and ill-established wrest, as also the other scriptures, to their own destruction" (@2 Peter 3: 16), he said, but the ministry was perfect. I think that is very beautiful,
{204}
for it is "our beloved brother Paul" -- there is no Galeed there -- although the Judaising element would separate Peter and Paul. That will not do for Peter; no, "our beloved brother Paul" is not Galeed; it is the bond of love, but there is the recognition in it of something that Paul had; that is what Corinthians and all the Pauline epistles mean, they are distinctive; and the Lord's supper is only rightly apprehended through his ministry.
T.G. So he receives it from the One who had been received up in glory; "the mystery of piety is great", @1 Timothy 3: 16.
J.T. Just so -- "received up in glory". The Lord, I am sure, would direct our attention to that, the glorious state of Christ now, what He is now. The assembly is connected with Christ in what He is now. The Lord's supper has come to us that way, through the great minister of the assembly. In this epistle he stresses the necessity for detail; he praises the saints for any little observance of detail of instruction. He had given them instruction, he was now giving them instruction by letter, and he was going to give them more when he came. There is constant need for instruction as to the Lord's supper.
Ques. Is it because it is heavenly we need so much instruction?
J.T. That is it, it is different. Moses was taken up there, and the glories of Christ were passed before his view; that is what the mount of transfiguration implies too, it is a question of the glory of Christ, He is transfigured before them. That is not anything taken on by external influences, it is Himself, a divine Person in manhood, what He is capable of, beyond anything a man can conceive. You have to wait to see Him before you can understand it fully. Even John does not undertake to say fully what it is, although he had seen Him on the mount, and during the forty days. People speak about 'non-essential things', and 'splitting hairs',
{205}
but I think God is honouring the attention to details in connection with the Lord's supper, the one cup, and the size of the gatherings, and all that line of truth which has been before us.
J.G. You do not then regard as a mere detail an enquiry into the question as to how you remember the Lord, as to whether it is Christ as He now is in glory, or as a dead Christ?
J.T. No, that is important. It is remembering Christ, but I would not stress *as* He now is in that, for it is Remember me: but it is important to stress where He now is, when you come to the building, according to the specifications -- the assembly. What we see around us in christendom is a travesty of this wonderful thing which has come down from heaven, the pattern of which was shown on the mount.
T.G. Do we break bread in the wilderness?
J.T. We do. We have the idea of "the assembly in the wilderness" @Acts 7:38, then we have the idea of the assembly in the land: 1 Corinthians is the idea of the assembly in the wilderness, where men and women are recognised.
J.C. Does the word, "This do in remembrance of me" call attention to the dead Christ, though we do not remember a dead Christ?
J.T. Yes, the blood is separated from the body.
J.P.G. Does not the Lord come before us as One who has been dead?
J.T. Surely, but it is Himself recalled in this most touching way -- that He once lay dead.
Ques. Is it not very important that it is Himself? Sometimes we get occupied with details and things about Him, and we are liable to forget it is Himself we remember, as the One who is now in the place of exaltation and glory, because of where He once was.
J.T. That is constantly said; it is an accepted thing.
G.A.v.S. Do you mean the prominent element in the Supper must necessarily be the Lord Himself, while, at the same time, we get an enlarged view of
{206}
Himself as, we think of how He actually went into death, in order that we should know Him in all the greatness of His love? We may be in danger of remembering a dead Christ; whereas it is the One who *has been* in death we remember.
Rem. I thought the point of His being in death leads to His present place, and it is because He is in His present place, we remember Him.
W.C.G. Does not the life and death of Christ unfold Him to us so that we might affectionately appreciate Him?
J.T. Yes, He became endeared to us in death, and the remembrance of Him seems to centre in Himself, not so much the place He is in, but the place He is not in -- He is not here. In @Luke 24 it is said they were together, speaking about the breaking of bread; two of them said He had been made known to them in the breaking of bread, and "Jesus himself" -- it is Himself -- stood in the midst: but when we come to assembly formation, we have more than that, we have His place -- Christ glorified. So that @Exodus 24 and what follows, gives the principle.
Ques. Does the ordinary meaning we attach to the word "remember" convey the idea? Is it not rather the calling Him to mind?
J.T. Yes, it is the action of the mind -- the calling of Me to mind.
Ques. That is, the One who is absent becomes present to us.
J.T. Present in the assembly -- yes. There is the side of announcing the Lord's death, that is another thing; but we must not get away from what we are speaking of, the thought of what is above, what He is now as in heaven: it is out of Him the assembly is evolved. We have a heavenly thing on earth, not simply something reflecting a risen Christ, but a heavenly Christ. The sheet in @Acts 10 came down and went up, and came down and went up; what is
{207}
presented is indigenous to heaven. As Christ is indigenous to heaven, so the assembly is, it is heavenly. Whether in heaven or on earth, it is Christ: "This do in remembrance of me" -- it is Himself.
J.McC.R. How are we to understand the word of Joseph, "Bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well with thee"? @Genesis 40: 14.
J.T. Well, "when it goes well with thee" -- that is, when you are in the good of the gospel of your salvation and all that goes with it -- think of Him who effected it for you.
G.A.v.S. May we have misunderstood the use of the word "*shew the Lord's death*"?
J.T. I think the sign is involved in that, it is what is visible, it is "this bread" and "this cup"; it is the cup which we bless and the bread which we break. It is as handled, so to say, by those who have the Spirit, that is where the sign is; it is not *any* bread, it is "this bread" -- "this cup". If the one who speaks to the Lord in giving thanks says, "Lord Jesus" by the Spirit, it is a spiritual state of things; attention is called to something in a spiritual way, that is where the sign lies -- "as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come".
F.I. That is not the remembrance side.
J.T. No, it is the public side -- what we are doing that anybody can see.
F.I. The remembrance side is the giving of thanks.
J.T. Yes, the Lord is brought to us, in the giving of thanks and the breaking of the bread, it is a spiritual state of things: the Lord's supper is never intended to be in any other but a spiritual state of things.
J.G. What is the difference between the breaking of bread and the Lord's supper?
J.T. Well, there is not much difference. The breaking of bread is a formula for the Supper, it was a term for the Lord's supper. The term "the Lord's supper" is only found in Corinthians, it belongs to the ministerial
{208}
setting. The Lord has to do with it and the one who represents Him has to do with it. It is delivered to the gentiles in those circumstances, and has to be connected with those circumstances. The cup is in His blood. In Mark the Lord makes more of that than He does of the loaf, because it is the sign that brings God in, that is, it brings the love of God in; it is intended to establish and confirm us in the fixed state of things in the covenant. The cup refers to the life of Jesus, what He was here on earth, the life given up: it is "my blood, that of the new covenant", as He says in Mark; it is in that connection that they go to the mount of Olives, He brings God in.
W.S.S. That would open the way, after the partaking of the elements, for the appreciation Godward of what is in the new covenant.
J.T. It does, it open s up the glory side; so we have in @2 Corinthians 3 the ministry of the Spirit subsisting in glory, the ministry of righteousness abounding in glory. That is, you reach finality in this covenant, you are in the realm of glory, and there is the opportunity for praise to God in relation to that system of glory. It is a wonderful thing to think of being in the realm of glory, and it is an existing thing, a permanent thing. This does not set aside the first covenant for there was glory there too, there must be glory in anything God has to do with; but this is the abounding thing, and it is permanent.
W.S.S. What a wonderful opportunity there is, after the Supper, as in this realm of glory, for praise to God.
J.T. That is, I think, where the thought of ministry is opened up. First, in regard to the Lord's supper, it is a question of authority; then, when the glory comes in, God is there, the idea of authority merges in the Spirit. "The Lord is that Spirit" -- a very remarkable expression! The idea of authority in lordship merges
{209}
in the, Spirit, and he says, "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty", @2 Corinthians 3:17.
W.S.S. What an immense amount of detail there is in regard to that side of things -- all we have in Exodus and Leviticus.
J.T. Quite so. Then we move on from Moses, as you might say, to Aaron, the minister of the sanctuary, where the service is carried on, and I believe, therefore, that a time of waiting after partaking of the cup, is an advantage, because we are changing our ground; there must be the changing over from Moses to Aaron, so to speak; it is a glory scene, if it is rightly understood. It is a scene of abounding glory.
W.S.S. Perhaps we have not left enough time for it.
J.T. Well, I think the Lord would help us. Mark helps us particularly, the evangelists are all confirmatory of Paul's teaching in regard to the Supper and the assembly, and Mark suggests a considerable space of time to consider what the Lord says about the cup.
H.B. Would it suggest the possibility of the Lord giving us a word just after the cup?
J.T. Yes, I think it is very appropriate, sometimes very necessary, something to open up the ministry of glory. The authority is there, it is not lost, but it is merged in liberty, it is the law of liberty.
W.C.G. Does that make the way for the enjoyment of the rest of the sabbath?
J.T. Well, it does. You would like to spend as much time as you can in the anticipation of eternity, restfulness in what God is in Christ.
J.B. It would be refreshment too for God Himself.
J.T. That is the idea; you are now in the presence of God, and He is refreshed, and we are refreshed.
W.S.S. We are come "to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant". @Hebrews 12:24
J.T. Yes.
W.A. He speaks of it in the epistle to the Hebrews
{210}
where we get the ministerial side of things in the blood of the eternal covenant.
J.T. Yes, he does -- "A minister of the sanctuary" in chapter 8, and then the writer proceeds to enlarge on the covenant, and occupies the rest of chapter 8, chapter 9, and chapter 10, till we come to verse 19, enlarging on the covenant. We are so slow to get into it, the realm of love and glory. And then he says, We have access; let us go in, there is liberty to go in.
Ques. Do you mean when we arrive at the covenant then the ministry of glory commences?
J.T. I think so.
J.G. What would be the next point after that?
J.T. The Father.
Ques. What about the Lord in resurrection?
J.T. We are speaking of @Hebrews 8 to 10. @Hebrews 8 is Christ in heaven -- "minister of the sanctuary". The position is heavenly now. The Mosaic position is Corinthians, but we are to take up heavenly ground, and it is so great that with that in view, having spoken of Christ in heaven, the writer returns to the covenant, and occupies chapters 8, 9 and the greater part of chapter 10, enlarging us in the love of God.
Rem. In that connection, in 2 Corinthians, chapter 3, before the glory is enlarged on, you get the idea of "competent as ministers of the new covenant", as if there was a time after the Supper for that. It might help.
J.T. It might help, if the brethren were not afraid of an innovation; yet it is not an innovation, it is something to regulate the saints and bring them into movement.
Ques. Paul says, "I have received of the Lord", and then he says, "the Lord Jesus" -- what is the difference?
J.T. Well, to link that on with what he says in chapter 12 helps; it is an affectionate reference to Christ. "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit". @1 Corinthians 12:3
{211}
THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANTS (5)
@2 Corinthians 3
J.T. It will be well to bear in mind what has been remarked, that the ministerial features under which the covenant appears in Exodus, suggest authority and accuracy, important items in relation to the truth. This chapter stresses the thought, the apostle speaking of competency in himself and others as ministers of the new covenant. The position in Exodus is marked by this feature, the Spirit of God introducing Moses almost immediately; first as a babe, then as a full-grown man, then in the school of God for forty years, then as seeing a manifestation of God. Then we have the genealogy coming down from Levi, Aaron being of the same family, and then we have "this is that Moses and Aaron" (@Exodus 6: 27), so that we are assured as to the ministers -- who they are. Much place is given to Moses, and Jehovah said to him, "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron ... shall be thy prophet" (@Exodus 7: 1), thus the authority is greatly stressed; and throughout his history the Spirit brings forward qualities with regard to himself, such as, that there was no one like him in meekness; @Numbers 12: 3. Then in Deuteronomy he is seen as suffering God's anger on account of the people. In Numbers God is displeased with him on his own account, yet in Deuteronomy it is on account of Israel, so that he rises to the type of the Mediator, even in regard of atonement; he felt the anger of God, he turned it away from Israel: all that is typical of what has come out in Christ, and what is peculiarly seen in Paul's service. So that the ministry comes through such an one as Paul, made of God a competent minister of the new covenant. Things, therefore, have come to us unmarred, they have come to us as from God, through him.
{212}
Ques. Is that what you connect the authority with?
J.T. Well, that is the kind of authority that enters into the effectuation of the covenant; it is not a harsh authority, it is tempered, there is nothing about it to prejudice us, so that what is meant should come to us in its full preciousness; and the thought widens out to all who are in the position of ministers of God, so that the truth is thus exemplified in the one in whom it is presented; it thus gives us impressions, not only by what is said, but by the persons who say it.
Ques. It says, "not of letter, but of spirit" (verse 6): is it that the spirit of the covenant is known and enjoyed by us today before the covenant is actually made? The new covenant will be made with Israel and Judah?
J.T. I think the covenant is already made; it is not like the ten words, it is more the covenant in the spirit of it. In the second giving of the law in @Exodus 34: 27, Jehovah says, "after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel". There is not so much said there, as at the first giving, but we have the word "tenor" which we do not have in the first. The point of the new covenant is that it is *in spirit* not in letter -- the letter kills.
G.A.v.S. Would you say that the covenant, although made, has not yet taken effect in regard of Israel, but is being made good in us through the Mediator?
J.T. Yes, it is really being effectuated now in a greater and fuller way because of what the assembly is to divine Persons. It is not *made* with the assembly, but it is applied to the members of the assembly, and in a fuller and greater way than it will be applied to Israel. The law is written in their hearts and in their minds; instead of that we have the blessed Holy Spirit Himself in us -- "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit", as it says in @Romans 5: 5. That is Romans, that is part of the gospel; it is not called the covenant in Romans, but the thing is there; but the Corinthian epistles stress the ministerial side
{213}
and bring in the covenant both in the first and the second.
Ques. Is your thought that there should be a greater answer to it in the assembly than there will be in Israel?
J.T. Well, there is. Anything that applies to the assembly, or to those who form it, is seen in a greater way there than elsewhere, because of the dignity of the persons.
H.B-t. Would you say the covenant is with men? it is not the same thought as sons.
J.T. It is a question of God; the covenant is made with the house of Israel and Judah; and we have part in that because we have such a place as gives us part in it. Sons do not need that assurance, for they are settled in love. Love settles everything in that respect. We shall have no need of a covenant in heaven, for we are assured in the Father's love, as in family relationship with Him. The covenant is not between the Father and His sons, it is as between God and men.
Ques. Is there a distinction made in @2 Corinthians 6 where it says, "I will be their God" and then, "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty"? @2 Corinthians 6:18
J.T. Well, that agrees with what we are saying, it is with a people, but not as a family. The thought, "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters" is not the full thought of sonship, it is more what He is in the way of care here. There will be no such thought in heaven as sons and *daughters*: it is a figure that might be used in the Old Testament.
Ques. Was the apostle encouraged as he saw appreciation of the Man of God's choice appearing in them? He says, "Such confidence have we".
J.T. "Such confidence have we" -- that is in himself -- "through the Christ towards God: not that we are competent of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our competency is of God; who has also
{214}
made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant", verses 4 - 6. I think it is the kind of competency that lifts us out of ourselves and assures us of the ministry. I think the great thought of the minister has to be borne in mind, it is in this confidence, that what you have is of God -- "our competency is of God; who has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant"; it is the kind of state that is peculiar to ministers.
Ques. The Lord says, in @John 6:63, "the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life". Should all that is said be of a spiritual kind?
J.T. Quite so, and over against the letter, you are possessed of the thing itself. I think this thought of the ministers ought to be observed, because it is so stressed in both the epistles, and the reference in this chapter is to @Exodus 34. The saints get the truth in an appointed way, and that is through ministers.
Ques. Was Paul himself the setting forth of the spirit of it?
J.T. Yes, he was made competent of God, as the minister of the new covenant.
Ques. Is that the way the authority is stressed?
J.T. That is right. Towards the end of the chapter, we see the merging of the Spirit and the Lord, they merge into one. Authority comes to us in that way, the merging of lordship and the Spirit. "The Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty". That promotes liberty, it does not promote bondage.
Ques. How is this competency brought about?
J.T. Well, it lies in the knowledge of God, and of course the knowledge of God is open to every christian, though every christian is not a minister in the sense in which we are speaking of it. The knowledge of God is open to every christian, but the competency of a minister goes beyond that, it is God taking him in hand and fitting him for the ministry.
Ques. Would the sufferings have any part in it?
{215}
J.T. No doubt they would.
Ques. Is it your thought that a minister is what we speak of as a gifted man?
J.T. Well, more than a gifted man, though that is the idea; but gift may be held without the authority which love implies.
Ques. Would it not involve the following chapter? "We have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God". @2 Corinthians 4:2
J.T. That is right; it involves the whole chapter, you might say. We should go back to the first epistle to see how this ministerial subject is developed; and to see how at the present time the truth comes to the saints in the appointed way, through ministry. These saints were called of God, but that includes what comes through ministry and this comes through competent ministers.
Rem. The Corinthians had gift, but they were not competent.
J.T. No, they were partisans; you cannot get competency in a minister who is on partisan or clerical lines. The subject is most important in both epistles, and links on with Exodus; there you get the kind of persons -- "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee", @Exodus 4: 14. That is the kind of thing that underlies competency, God having taken a man in hand. What can be greater in the mind of God in regard of ministry, than competency; that ministry should reach the saints unimpaired. You get the general thought in Exodus, then you see how it works out, and the pains God took with Moses; Aaron, too, was under God's eye; he was eighty-three years of age when God spoke about him. He had been in the school of God -- who says, "I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and when
{216}
he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart" @Exodus 4:14 -- that is the idea. Then we get Moses in Midian for forty years; so that he is eighty years of age before God appears to him.
Rem. The competency of the minister depends on his being in the good of that of which you were speaking yesterday, of which the cup is the sign.
J.T. Exactly. You can see what Paul had to go through. He tells us in Galatians, "I went into Arabia" @Galatians 1:17. That was the place of learning.
Ques. Was that special training for his particular ministry, or is there that which corresponds with it characteristically for all?
J.T. I think he is the ideal minister in the mind of God.
Ques. Do we see his ability in the skilful way he handled the Corinthians, he presents himself as a father and as one who loved them, though he was not loved?
J.T. I think that is right. You could not get a better illustration of competency than in these two epistles; the wonderful skill manifested in these two letters, in the blending of authority with affection. He was so concerned that the balance should be maintained, that he would not go to them then lest he should use the rod; he sent Timothy, his child. Timothy thoroughly understood the apostle's spirit.
A.E.L. What about verse 17 of the previous chapter? does the "we" include Timothy? Do you make it apostolic?
J.T. I think it is apostolic. The thought conveyed is fully expressed in the writer, whoever the others may be. "Who is sufficient for these things?" @2 Corinthians 2:16 is the question that comes up in your mind every time you try to serve the Lord. One thinks of those who minister, what they are, and how they behave. If we undertake to minister, then the mind of God is to come through unimpaired, not only in word, but in spirit; that is to say, I am to
{217}
be the thing myself, in principle, and that is what Paul has so much in mind in these two letters; to bring out what those who minister should be, he himself being the example; he says, "In all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God", @2 Corinthians 6:4.
Ques. Is that why you refer to Moses and Aaron?
J.T. Yes, the two things are seen in two men in Exodus; they are seen in one Man in the gospels; and Paul, I believe, is taken up as a man of like passions with ourselves, our apostle -- to illustrate the thought; so that the thing comes to us, not in word only, but in spirit.
Ques. Alongside what you are saying about, "Who is sufficient for these things?" would you also have in mind, "Such confidence have we through the Christ towards God"?
J.T. I think so; your own exercises with God as you stand up to minister make you feel like an empty vessel, and yet you are confident, and God comes in for you.
Ques. Would the Lord be to us like 'our Moses' in that way? -- the Minister and the Mediator?
J.T. That is the idea, that the thing is brought down to us. The full thought is in Christ: He is "the Apostle and High Priest of our confession" (@Hebrews 3:1), but it is brought down to us in a man like ourselves.
G.A.v.S. How solemn then to have low thoughts of such an one who is qualified and dignified of God to minister.
J.T. The intent is that God's rights are maintained in authority, but in such authority. Moses was said to be "very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth" @Numbers 12:3 and he is said by Jehovah to have been "faithful in all my house". @Numbers 12:7
Rem. The apostle says to Timothy, "in meekness instructing those that oppose". @2 Timothy 2:25
J.T. Yes -- in meekness.
L.M. Would this ability imply experience and
{218}
education with God? Passing through discipline is to fit one for this.
J.T. I think so, that is what Exodus shows. The age of the two ministers before they are taken up is another matter; God had cultured them before He used them; for the great thought is, "I have made thee God to Pharaoh", @Exodus 7:1 not "a God", that would be idolatry; but he was to be representative of God, there is no less thought than that in the minister.
H.B-t. Should it be necessary for this able minister of the new covenant to bring a letter of commendation?
J.T. Apparently they had asked him to. They probably thought more of their local ministers than they did of him. There might be humiliation behind that, they might have intended to bring him down to their own level, whereas God had given him a place and he was in accord with it. He should not need a letter of commendation, they were the fruit of his work.
H.B-t. He could appeal to the spiritual, to the wise, among them in relation to his authority.
J.T. Quite so. The more spiritual brethren are the more they will value what God has formed in that way.
Ques. You spoke of Moses being God, is that extended? It speaks in @Psalm 82 of God judging among the gods, is that the thought that was seen in Moses, extended?
J.T. Quite so. It is the word 'Elohim' there, the same word as in @Genesis 1; it is in the plural, showing it is a question of representation; just as an officer may be representative of the king. It is not idolatry, it is the thought of the representation of God. Moses was God in that sense, for all that God is, was behind him; and how can you have ministry otherwise? It is a question of what God sees in qualified vessels; hence the anointing is to qualify you, to dignify you, as representative of God. "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me" @Luke 4:18, says the Lord, and that was for ministry.
Ques. Is that brought out in Hebrews, where it
{219}
speaks of the Lord having "a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant" (@Hebrews 8: 6)?
J.T. Just so, He was equal to it. The word "glory" is stamped on this chapter right through, that is the idea in the thing we are brought into, hence the need for competent ministers.
Ques. Is there need to go in to God for this? It says, "as for you, ye shall be called priests of Jehovah; it shall be said of you: Ministers of our God", @Isaiah 61:6.
J.T. Very good; that confirms what we are saying.
Now perhaps, after having said all that about ministers, we might say a word or two about the covenant itself. It is "not of letter, but of spirit" (verse 6); then it says, "the Spirit quickens", and after that we have a parenthesis, running on to the end of verse 16, where we are told that "the Lord is the Spirit", but in between those statements there is this wonderful amplification of the subject, in the ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of righteousness, and the ministry that abides, all abounding in glory. It is said that "the Spirit quickens", so that the ministry of the Spirit has the effect of quickening the affections, not only instructing. It is an administrative thought.
Ques. Is it the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of the covenant that is expressed in the Person?
J.T. Yes, I think it is the merging of authority with the Spirit -- "the Lord is the Spirit". The parenthesis enlarges on the thing ministered; it is full of the ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of righteousness, and the ministry that abides. It is expressed in the voice of authority, but it is full of affection, that is what quickens, love quickens, but love in that way -- love brought in authoritatively in the Lord, yet it is the Spirit.
Ques. Is that the thought of, I will give "thee for a covenant of the people"? @Isaiah 42:6.
J.T. That is right, that He is Himself the covenant.
Ques. How does that work out for us?
{220}
J.T. Well, practically, it is what Christ effectuated in dying; His blood is that of the new covenant, it is the testimony of a love that was behind His death. God gave that up, He gave up such a life as that! Never among men had there been such a life as that, yet God gave it up, the blood is the testimony of that, He gave it up for us.
Rem. In Hebrews it says, "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (@Hebrews 8:10); then of the sanctified, it says, "I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them", @Hebrews 10:16.
J.T. Yes, there is a transposing of the words in chapters 8 and 10. The law is written both in regard to your intelligence and affection. Romans introduces the thought of the covenant without naming it, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, it is already there -- it is by the Spirit. Here he takes up this formal word "new covenant"; it is calculated to steady the saints and induce confidence in God, and he brings out here that the Lord is the Spirit of it. What could be greater than that! It is not simply writing in the mind and heart, but Christ is written; it is the full thought, the Person. As written upon we are more passive -- Ye are "manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God", he is really alluding to his own service amongst them in the power of the Spirit. Now, when we come to the end of the chapter, we are not passive, we are active; that is to say, we are "beholding", our minds and our eyes are all brought into this; we are turned away from all else. This is the glory of the Lord in the face of Jesus, the glory as effectuating the covenant; the allusion is to Moses. The glory is brought in to draw us aside from earth and impress us with the magnitude of the thing that is
{221}
brought to us. We are so small in our thoughts and so earthly, so that the truth is presented in this glorious way.
Rem. There is no real unity apart from what we get in the last verse?
J.T. No, it is the unity that abides, and we are all satisfied in it.
Ques. Is the glory of the Lord here the glory of the Person who was great enough to bring in the great thoughts of the love of God in the covenant?
J.T. That is the idea; He has effectuated it.
Ques. Would it be right to say that the law is written or effectuated in the heart in @Romans 5 -- the love of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit given to us -- and in the close of chapter 8 it is written in the mind?
J.T. Just so; and chapter 8 also says, "all things work together for good to them that love God" @Romans 8:28, that is the answer to chapter 6. The apostle has all that in mind in using these terms. We are all sharers in this glory, but not in a passive way, for at the end of the chapter we are active, we are brought into the thing and we have joy in it -- "from glory to glory", is a system of unending glory.
Ques. Is this realised specially at the Supper when the saints are together?
J.T. Exactly, that is where the glory comes in and we are satisfied. We have all been made to drink into one Spirit; the saints are satisfied with this realm of glory. Why should we not be? What could be greater!
Ques. Has it any connection with the Holiest, the ark of the covenant being called the glory? @Psalm 78: 61.
J.T. I think it has a connection but it is not now one man going in once a year, we have access at all times, and what could be more attractive than the face of Jesus at any time? Think of the glory of the Lord, the glories of that face!
Ques. You have spoken of our sitting together at
{222}
the Supper as having drunk into the new covenant. Would that prepare us to consider the glory of the Mediator?
J.T. I think so. It is to set us free -- "Perfect love casts out fear" @1 John 4:18. It is unending glory, ever expanding, glory to glory.
Ques. Would it be appropriate to say something about "the Lord the Spirit"?
J.T. Yes, it is a merging of the Spirit with lordship. Divine Persons are before us, authority is there and the Spirit is there, and the Spirit is merged in the way He effectuates the thing in our hearts. The blood of the covenant is in Christ's death, that is one thing, that is the basis; the second thing is, that He effectuates it in our hearts, that is what is in view in this chapter, and that is what the apostle is aiming at in regard to his own ministry -- what can I do in the hearts of the saints? How am I affecting them? The Lord is effecting things by the ministry and by the Spirit.
H.B. Does putting the law in their inward parts imply formation?
J.T. It does, and how important it is to have the inward parts searched out. It says, "The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts", @Proverbs 20:27. Everything is searched out by the light; it is to make room for this. In Romans it is just by the Spirit, but here you have the added thought of the Lord, for I am constantly rebellious, and His authority helps me in restraining the rebellion, so as to bring in this positive thing by the Spirit, the love of God.
Rem. I am always to be held in subjection that His work may go on.
J.T. That is the idea; he speaks not only authoritatively and correctively, but he brings in love. The "Spirit of the Lord" expresses authority. You may say, 'Not so', but the Lord says, 'It is so, and must be so', and He brings in discipline to make it so. That
{223}
is authority, but all in order that He might bring in the love of God.
J.G. If we follow up this line, it would lead us to say that nothing can separate us from the love of God.
J.T. That is how Romans works it out; Romans underlies this epistle. Chapter 8:38 is a persuasion from experience that nothing can separate us "from the love of God". We have had the love of God in our hearts, but there is also, "The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God", @2 Thessalonians 3:5. Transformed from glory to glory, is a positive change, that is what is meant; it is not an external change but a substantial change "from glory to glory".
Ques. It would be, not only the cloud covering the tabernacle, but the glory filling it.
J.T. That is the idea; filling it so much that even Moses cannot enter, that is, the idea of mediatorial authority ceases there. God is there, and He says, as it were, 'I want all this for Myself'. Authority ceases, not that it is abolished, but it is not necessary, God is there -- "he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him", @1 John 4:16.
Ques. Will you say a word as to, "according to the same image"?
J.T. Well, it is like the Lord, of course; but it is sameness in all of us, it is the great unifying principle, we are like one another for we are all like the Lord. That would dissipate any personal animosities, rivalry or pride. We begin to see what the brethren are; if I say anything against one of them, I say it against myself.
Ques. What is the idea of "image"?
J.T. I think it is representation, the representation of Christ. It all goes with what we are saying. Ministry is the representation of God, but in what you take on of the glory there is the representation of Christ as the One who has effected it.
Ques. I might say, I will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell and get gain.
{224}
If I got before the Lord and beheld His glory, there might be a change brought about.
J.T. I am sure there would be. Laban said, 'Jacob has acquired all this greatness at my expense'. That is what we get to when we take up business to make gain It is all very well to take it up to make a living, but beholding the glory of the Lord eclipses all thought of gain. You need to go to business to make a living to provide things honest before God and men, but not to get gain.
{225}
THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANTS (6)
@Exodus 21:1 - 6; @Exodus 28:1 - 4; @Hebrews 3:1 - 6
J.T. We were remarking that the subject of ministers and ministry has a great place in the Scriptures beginning with Exodus; standing in relation to the covenant of God and to His house. I thought that it might be helpful to look at the attitude and state underlying service, and then at the dignity attaching to it. The attitude of mind is seen in the Hebrew servant, a type of the Lord Himself; the figure is to show how far love would go, precluding any selfish limitations to our services. The figure would show how far love would go in serving; so that any self-imposed restrictions on our part for selfish reasons are ruled out. We have the model in this figure, it is to be before us as serving, that is, before every servant, so that, in the light of the Model, we shall always have to say, We are unprofitable servants; @Luke 17: 10. The attitude of mind in the slave here shows the length to which love will go in service for its objects: on the other hand, we have the dignity of service fully set out in @Exodus 28.
A.W.R. In saying the attitude of mind, have you @Philippians 2 before you? -- the Lord taking on a bondman's form.
J.T. That is right. "Who, subsisting in the form of God", -- the highest place -- "did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form", @Philippians 2:6,7. That does not mean that a bondman is His status, it is self-imposed, He takes it Himself, it can never be imposed upon Him; nor can it always be attributed to Him as covering His service, because the other side of that is the priesthood, the dignity of Christ as serving.
Ques. Does @Philippians 2 correspond with @Exodus 21?
J.T. Yes. It is the mind that is to be in us, that is
{226}
the reason it is brought in -- "which was also in Christ Jesus". It is the attitude of mind, He takes that place and shows the length to which love will go.
Ques. Would it be seen in Paul when he said he had a desire to depart and be with Christ, but to continue in the flesh was more needful for the saints?
J.T. Yes, that is the attitude of mind. You get the "Son" in Hebrews; He is greater than Moses in the measure in which the Creator is greater than the creation. He who built the house, and all things, is God; you cannot get anything greater. So that the slave attitude is to show how far love will go.
A.E.L. Would you say that on the mount of Transfiguration the Lord could have gone out free, but He comes down in voluntary love to go to the cross?
J.T. That is the thought exactly.
H.B. The door-post would involve His death, that love would go as far as that.
J.T. Yes, you can see how lowly is His attitude -- "his master shall bring him before the judges, and shall bring him to the door, or to the door-post". There is no idea of any self-assertion or self-consideration at all, he is entirely at the will of another, and that is all because of love, it is to bring out what love is, the attitude of love.
Rem. On the mount they spake of His decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
J.T. Yes, that was the theme of their conversation those two men that appeared, who, Luke says, were Moses and Elias. They understood that He had to go out that way. Moses would say, All I did in the wilderness would go for nothing otherwise. Elijah would say, All my service is for nothing unless He goes that way. All the service of the Old Testament must go for nothing unless He went to death -- they understood that. It does not say the Lord spake to them, but *they* were speaking to Him, as if to show the liberty they had.
F.G.W. "I love my master, my wife, and my children",
{227}
would suggest the scope of the service on the descending scale.
J.T. Yes. It is first ascending -- the Master; then horizontal -- the wife; -- then descending -- the children: it is the height, the breadth, the length, for "He that descended is the same who has also ascended" @Ephesians 4:10. It is the length to which love would go, what a wide area it is! I think the figure shows that that was really the life of the Lord. You may say it was a lowly humble attitude, but it is what marked Him here below, for love is greater than any circumstance; whether I am serving the saints on earth, or enjoying heaven, it is all love, it is the same thing.
G.A.v.S. What is the import of His being a servant for ever? It is not a question of His having died only, but having died and risen again, He is a servant for ever. Is that the thought here?
J.T. It is not anything imposed upon Him or onerous or distasteful to Him, the point is love; it does not cover the truth as to His Person, such a thought must be excluded from our minds. The status of a slave is well understood, but His personal dignity must always be maintained, it is a figure He takes up to show how far love will go. It shows what love will do, therefore He becomes a Model for the servants. He takes that place with a view to love, that what He does may be intelligible to us. It is all love, it is all a self-imposed service for the sake of love, that God might be known.
H.B. Are you including in your mind, in its reference to us, any form of service?
J.T. Yes. Any service that is to be done -- but I am thinking particularly of ministers, for Scripture distinguishes in that way. 1st and 2nd Corinthians stress the thought of ministers, and I thought it would be well to see what underlies the ministry -- love, and the attitude of mind. The attitude of mind here would absolutely preclude a clerical garb of any kind whatsoever,
{228}
any garb that distinguishes me above men as a minister is precluded by this attitude of mind. It is the attitude of mind, the mind that is in Christ Jesus is to be in us.
H.B-t. We have been afraid of ministerial terms, but to see the expression of love is a different thing.
J.T. Yes. The word "minister" is used -- competent ministers; the Lord said He made Paul a minister; @Acts 26: 16.
G.A.v.S. He did say at the same time that he was to suffer many things. The ministerial attitude is a sacrificial attitude.
J.T. God calls attention to the Lamb of God in @John 1; it is not a diminutive thought there; it suggests maturity, but of a lamb character. He is acting Himself, He is not being led to the slaughter there, He is coming to do something, but He comes sacrificially; and that is the basis of everything sacrificially in our service. He came to John. John was administering baptism, and the Lord came forward, implying that He was ready to sacrifice, to suffer, and that is the position of the servant. Paul was to be shown how much he must suffer -- the Lord saw to that. "*I* will show to him how much he must suffer for my name", @Acts 9: 16.
J.G. You said just now that we cannot serve if we have not love. How do we get it?
J.T. We have that in the covenant. Jehovah speaks of "thousands of them that love me" @Exodus 20:6, @Deuteronomy 5:10, not that *should love Him*, but *that do love Him*. There were those who had already begun to love God; He had not been made known so long a time through Moses, without having some response. If you could ask one of those thousands about loving God, he would answer, I go to Moses and Aaron to learn about that, how they had learnt to love, and who ought to tell us today, about these things if not the ministers? Those who teach the saints should tell them how to love.
Ques. Is it to be noted that this follows immediately
{229}
on the thought of the altar in the previous chapter, the sacrificial thought?
J.T. Yes. We have previously the altar of earth and the altar of stone, and that God would come wherever He recorded His name, and bless them. What a God He was! They had learnt to love Him.
Rem. The victory over death as seen in the Lord Jesus Christ, enters into the calculations of love as seen in @1 Corinthians 15 -- "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord" @1 Corinthians 15:58.
F.I. Does the measure of success in ministry depend upon the sacrifice made?
J.T. Well, I think they go together. You see the extent of the sacrifice here. A man, a slave for so many years might say, 'Well, I am looking forward to my liberation, what a day it will be! the day of liberation, of release from this bondage'. But instead of that, he says, 'No, I do not want that; *my* liberty is within. My slavery is the perfect law of liberty for me' -- "I love my master, my wife, and my children". You cannot have anything better than love and the exercise of it.
Rem. That is what the apostle has in mind in @1 Corinthians 13, before he speaks in chapter 14 of service in the assembly.
J.T. Yes, that is the thing they did not have; he has to speak of it in the abstract.
Rem. There was peculiar evidence of the way in which love would provide a solution of a difficulty in the fact that, if his master has given him his wife and he has children, the wife and children should belong to the master, and he should go out free; he sacrificed his freedom for the sake of the wife and children and for the master: so that love provides a solution for the situation, does it not?
J.T. Suffering is attached to it, but it is love, and love is life; it is not life in its own domain, but it is life.
{230}
F.G.W. Would the sacrificial service the apostle speaks of in @Romans 15 enter into it? -- "that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit" @Romans 15:16. He carried on his ministry as a sacrificial service? Would we take an example, in that way, from the apostle, next to the Lord?
J.T. Well, I should. That chapter is very remarkable in this sense, that no one is to please himself, but to please others. I think the chapter brings out the length to which Christ went to secure the assembly. Of Jacob, it says, he "fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep" (@Hosea 12: 12); that is a side of Christ's service that I think Paul represents.
Rem. In that chapter in Romans he says, "I ... in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ" @Romans 15:19.
J.T. Illyricum would be on the shores of the Adriatic Sea. The territory covered is immense; and if you read chapter 11 of 2 Corinthians you will see what he suffered, only a portion is recorded, but it gives an idea of the volume of suffering he went through in his service. We have some little idea in this attitude of the Hebrew slave of the length to which love will go, stopping at nothing to secure its object. Paul had the spirit of Christ. It is the answer to the love of Christ "the love of Christ constraineth us" @2 Corinthians 5:14.
Rem. In @Luke 10 we see the spirit in which Paul served. The Samaritan was prepared to go where the man was, and with great result.
J.T. Yes -- "A certain Samaritan, as he journeyed" @Luke 10:33 -- that is the idea. Paul says, "In journeyings often", @2 Corinthians 11. The saints do not always think of that, of course; taking a journey by Paul was included in his sufferings. "Journeyings often" were wearisome things to him. The Lord took a journey, and was wearied with it, but love was behind it. Luke in the next chapter pictures a man coming at midnight on a journey.
{231}
Ques. Do you say, in regard to love, that it should be taught by the ministers?
J.T. Every christian is taught of God directly, but God is pleased to operate through ministry, and He qualifies the ministers. They should be able to give an account of love. If anyone asked Moses about those who loved God, he would say, 'Yes, I know them; I am one of them myself' -- and, How do you come to know and love Him? -- you would like to ask him that question. That is the idea, if a minister is asked the question, he must be able to answer it. If I have love, I ought to know something of how I got it, and to be able to teach another how to get it.
Ques. Is the motive of his service love? and would the experience that he has with God on that line, enable him to be an instructor in it?
J.T. That is the idea. The other side of the position of the minister is that he is dignified. The expression "Aaron thy brother", shows how Aaron serves as a figure of the combination of the two thoughts in Christ. It says in @Hebrews 3: 1 - 4 -- "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus, who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house. For *he* has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house. For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things is God". The allusion is, I think, to the universe as God's house, of which the tabernacle is a figure -- a pattern of things in the heavens -- that is the house, a great wide thought; and it brings in, in a most remarkable way, the deity of Christ, that He made everything "he who has built all things is God", and that is the One who is accounted as having more honour than Moses, because He who built the house has more honour than the house. It goes on, "And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house ... but Christ, as Son over his
{232}
house"; -- that is, God's house, the one He built Himself -- "whose house are *we*". The house of God provisionally is the saints, and Christ is minister in it, He is there as Son. We cannot address the Lord as in the position of a slave -- that would be irreverence. So, too, with all His servants, they take a lowly attitude in service, but those who are served should regard them according to the dignity the Lord puts upon them.
Ques. What is the force of, "Whose house are *we*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end"? verse 6.
J.T. That, I think, is in keeping with Hebrews, the position is all tentative; the Lord is pleased to take on a few, relatively speaking, and constitute them His house, I mean the saints; but that must involve their faithfulness, their continuance -- that is in keeping with Hebrews.
G.A.v.S. There is a great need for us to have things balanced in our souls so that, while we love and reverence the Lord who in love took a bondman's form, we can never overlook the fact of who He is in His own Person and glory?
J.T. That is what I think we ought to keep clearly in view. There is no change in Him, in His Person and dignity, there cannot be, but it is to show the extent to which love will go. It is one of the leading features of the epistle to bring out the greatness of His Person, to allure the Hebrews away from the earthly order of things they were lapsing into.
G.A.v.S. Would not that give us a sense of the greatness of the system, which He has set up, for it must be compatible with the dignity of His own Person?
J.T. "Such a high priest became us ..." @Hebrews 7:26 says the writer -- showing how great the persons are in the mind of God that they need such a great Person. If the Spirit of God had not said that, we should be afraid to say it; the saints are so great that they need such a High Priest as this.
{233}
The features are delineated in @Exodus 28. "Thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for ornament". @Exodus 28:2 And, "thou shalt speak with all that are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to hallow him, that he may serve me as priest" @Exodus 28:3 - 4. Now the first mentioned is the breastplate, showing the link between this passage and chapter 21. The breastplate is simply the place the saints have in His heart. The slave has in his heart, his wife and children, but the priest presents the dignified side.
Ques. Would you help us as to the idea of glory and ornament, and what they suggest?
J.T. It is a question of love. Glory is the shining out of what a thing is essentially; the breastplate would be the disclosure of the love that is in the heart of Christ, that He loves us so much; He has us there indelibly. The garments are mentioned separately so that we can take them in. God graciously coming down to our level, so that we can take in the features of Christ. He is inscrutable in His own Person, but as Man He is robed in these features; every one of these garments has a name.
Ques. What about the ephod?
J.T. It is a peculiar kind of garment. The breastplate, the ephod, the cloak, the checkered vest, the turban, the girdle. I think the ephod taken by itself is the mark of priesthood, the state by which God is approached. Even a David, one who is not a priest by tribe at all, can approach God with an ephod.
H.B. It says of Samuel that he "ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod", @1 Samuel 2: 18.
J.T. Yes, that means the young brothers and sisters should be sober, the linen means sobriety. David danced before the ark girded with the same kind of ephod. Here I think the material is properly byssus -- the idea is fineness.
G.A.v.S. Would it also convey the idea of purity?
{234}
J.T. I think it would. The Lord girded Himself with the linen towel. I think the main thought is sobriety, you are not excited. Wool would promote excitement, linen is the opposite to that. Then we have the cloak, the checkered vest, the turban and the girdle. The thought of making here is an abstract idea, to bring out that there is no discrepancy; they are as God ordered them. Exodus is to bring out that side, the whole system is according to God.
Ques. Would there be the tendency to despise Timothy on account of his youth, yet Paul says to him, "be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love in faith, in purity", @1 Timothy 4: 12.
J.T. That serves to illustrate what we are saying as to sobriety, that you overcome your youthfulness by sobriety -- "Let no one despise thy youth" @1 Timothy 4:12. These garments being all named are brought within our range, they are the opposite of inscrutability; they are compassable, they are all called by name, and made. It is not the deity but the humanity of the Person that is in mind, so that I can see these features, and take account of them. These separate items are to bring the thing down to our range, and the principle of their presentation here enters into ministry. "Let the prophets speak two or three", @1 Corinthians 14: 29. You do not present all the garments of Christ in one address, but a part; you get a glory by itself and feast on that, and see how it relates to another glory of Christ, and He becomes glorious in your eyes -- these are garments of glory and beauty.
F.I. The apostle entered into the truth of that in @Hebrews 8 when he said, "We have such an high priest" @Hebrews 8:1, and he goes on to give a description.
Rem. In verse 4, it says, "Aaron ... *and his sons*"; that would not include the breastplate.
J.T. No, they have no breastplates: they are just mentioned there, but the garments are for Aaron. "They shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother,
{235}
and his sons" -- they also have garments, but we are impressed first, with Christ.
Ques. Do we see in David having on an ephod how this ministry goes on without any official character attaching to it?
J.T. That is what comes out in David. I think David brings in another number, he adds twelve to what had already existed, making up the twenty-four. That is the new thing coming out in quality -- he is the priest, but not by appointment. A man is what he is, that is how David came out, and the thing was delightful to God. So that David becomes the priest par excellence because he ordains the service of God under the number twenty-four.
Ques. What are we to understand by the cloak?
J.T. That is a more general covering, it is more extensive. It has not the intrinsic value of the ephod and the breastplate, but is a larger idea, it practically covers the whole person as serving. God is taking account of us in these separate parts. "We know in part, and we prophesy in part", @1 Corinthians 13: 9. No one should attempt to cover everything in an address or a reading, it is one idea at a time -- that is about all we are equal to.
{236}
THE WATER OF PURIFICATION
@John 2:6 - 10; @John 3:3 - 8; @John 9:6,7; @John 13:2 - 15
J.T. We get the thought of the water of purification in this gospel. The subject is somewhat extensive so that we shall need to touch each scripture lightly. *The first*, gives the idea of a vessel (or vessels), empty, but intended to contain the water of purification: *the second*, is the application of the thought on the principle of birth so as to enter the kingdom, and that there should be spiritual movement: *the third*, is the principle applied to us in relation to the position of Christ here in humanity, so that faith has its eyes open to look upon Him in another connection and another world, the clay alluding to the incarnation, to the Lord as He was then; faith should be directed to Him as He is now, in another world as the Son of God: *the fourth*, is entrance into the privilege of having part with Christ, He having come from God, and going to God. The link is very plain, I think, and the subject is progressive. The first calls attention to what is current amongst us and around us; there are many vessels empty that should be useful as containing vessels -- not yet of living water, but of the water of purification. John presents that thought of containing vessels, the water of purification being turned into the wine of joy under the direction of Christ, and the drawing-out process. The application of this passage in chapter 2 is generally to young people; you are perhaps standing, but you are of no practical value, and yet not to be despised because you are there. "There were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews", @John 2: 6.
Ques. Do they suggest vessels that have not yet taken up service?
J.T. Yes; they are of potential value but not of practical use -- they are empty. The fact that they
{237}
are of stone, would mean that the idea is permanent, durable, and they come in serviceably, as the Lord is working; a great transaction is in view here, so that it is well that they are there.
Ques. Why were there six water-pots?
J.T. Well, I think it is the fulness of the thought, a millennial thought.
G.A.v.S. Do you think that, in contrast with chapter 13, what is represented here has to do with potentialities, so that we may be of value down here?
J.T. That is what I thought. They are of potential value; their durability is implied in the material, stone suggesting permanency, only as yet they are not in use. They are convenient, however, for they are there.
W.C.G. Would filling them with the water suggest the import of Christ's death known in power?
J.T. Yes, that is it; the presentation of the death of Christ in testimony. He does not do it Himself, He tells others to do it; the water of purification is necessarily a testimony to the death of Christ.
J.G. We do not contribute to the assembly in its privileges and joys until the import of Christ's death is brought home to us in the power of the Spirit.
F.I. Is this connected with the "washing of water by the word"? @Ephesians 5: 26.
J.T. Well, that is the full thought of it; it is the Lord's own action in Ephesians, you get complete thoughts there. This is done by others at the Lord's direction; that is, the persons represented in the vessels are to understand that others are to fill them. He directs others to *fill* them, not half measure, or quarter, or three-quarters, but completely. That would mean the exclusion of all else, and the mind and affections filled with the thought of the death of Christ, as the water that flowed from His side. John alone gives us that side of the truth -- the water that flowed from the side of Jesus. It is a thought that is very little presented in current gospel preaching; the blood is constantly
{238}
presented, but the water very little; but the person who receives the testimony of the blood of Christ, is also to receive the testimony of the water of purification.
G.A.v.S. This is individual, and Ephesians gives the full result collectively.
J.T. That is the thought. The assembly is presented to Himself. This is more initial as bringing us into suffering.
Ques. The vessels then are those who, as knowing the value of Christ's blood, are able to be filled with the water of purification?
J.T. Yes, I think it contemplates that, for to be a vessel at all, implies that I have faith and that I am standing there. "There were standing there" -- they were conveniently there, so that they were not to be despised, and the Lord could use them on that great occasion.
A.E.L. What then is the thought in converting the water into wine?
J.T. It brings out what the believer is as full of the thought of the purifying effect of the death of Christ, that is evident when you begin to *draw out*. Ask him questions, speak to him, see what comes out, and your heart will be filled with joy. That empty vessel is now full. The wine is what others partake of. The scripture reads -- "when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine ..." -- not *the wine made of water*, the idea of the water is maintained. It is a question of drawing out from the vessel, asking the persons about things, you thought there was nothing there, but there is, and he rejoices you.
Rem. The removal side would be there -- he would be apart from evil.
J.T. Inwardly -- yes.
Ques. Does it connect in any way with the red heifer? @Numbers 19.
J.T. It does. It is the water of purification, but there the stress is on the *ashes* -- ashes and running
{239}
water; the water and the ashes are distinguished there. The testimony to death in @Numbers 19 is the ashes, and the water is applied to the ashes, that is, the Spirit. Here, it is the water pure and simple, the testimony to the death of Christ in the vessel, and the drawing out is a testimony that the change has taken place.
Ques. There can be no joy apart from the water of separation, that is cleansing.
J.T. There cannot be, although we may know forgiveness. Talk to a person who is just trusting in that and has no other thought, perhaps occupied with the world, he will not make you glad. It is a man who is full of the water of separation who makes you glad. That is the good wine kept till the last.
Rem. It is not my personal joy, but joy that is for others.
J.T. That is the thought. The feast-master is a connoisseur of the wine, so to speak, he knows it is the very best they have on the occasion.
Ques. Would this help the silent brothers in the meetings?
J.T. That is what it is for, to wake them up, to see if they have anything. Standing there is not enough; ask them questions, and give the opportunity for things to be drawn out.
F.S. What is the thought of others filling the vessels?
J.T. That is done in the preaching of the gospel and ministry, I suppose; you present the death of Christ from the standpoint of the water, which is very rare in the general preaching, though the standpoint of the blood is presented, and one is thankful for that.
G.A.v.S. The water brings before us the purifying power of the death of Christ which is indispensable ere there can be the dispensing of joy to others.
J.T. That is the thought. Every young brother and sister ought to be an occasion of joy if the Lord came into the midst. The disciples were glad when they
{240}
saw Him, how much more glad when they heard Him speak! We are glad to see the brethren, of course, and one would be very grieved if the brethren were not glad when one comes among them -- but when they ask you questions, what have you to cause them gladness?
J.G. You drew attention to a distinction between sanctification and purity.
J.T. Sanctification is by the Spirit, it is the same idea as the sanctuary, it implies holiness, but what we are speaking of is purity.
G.A.v.S. Sanctification would be the enlargement of this.
J.T. Yes, and it would include this.
Ques. Would the one be more outward?
J.T. Well, you cannot be sanctified in a *mere* external way; separation from evil has that character, but the water of purification here is inward, and sanctification of the Spirit, I think, is inward, it is the work of the Spirit. The Lord prays, "Sanctify them through thy truth", @John 17:17 -- the Father's truth. The water ought to be presented more in the gospel. The Lord Jesus came by those two things; the water is mentioned first in John's epistle, as much as to say, it is the more important in view of what is in mind in that epistle.
In chapter 3 we have another thought: birth is in mind, a remarkable figure. The element of water is introduced here and the Spirit to enable one to enter into something. There is no movement in the stone vessels, they are acted upon; the drawing out even is not their own action, it is all a question of what others do. But when we come to chapter 3 the person is in mind, and he is to move, he is to see. He cannot see without being "born anew", but then he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, unless he is "born of water and of Spirit". It contemplates that there is movement into something, and that is the kingdom of God, he moves into the kingdom of God.
F.I. What distinction do you make between the
{241}
water of purification in chapter 3 and the water here? -- water and Spirit.
J.T. It is the same testimony, I think, it is the death of Christ; there can be no other water of purification than that; but it is used as an element of generation, so that, as we might say, the person so acted upon can see and enter the kingdom of God. The waterpots are passive, there is no action of the will contemplated, and all the service is by others. Mary, the Lord's mother, had already said to the servants, "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do" -- the principle of obedience was there, and they filled them as He directed, and the drawing out is by them too, at the direction of the Lord. The idea is passive in the vessels of stone.
Ques. What distinction do you draw between @John 3 and @1 Peter 1 -- "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the living and abiding word of God"? @1 Peter 1:23
J.T. That is a fuller thought. The Spirit of God does not use such definite language in @John 3, He holds back. It is always important to notice the way in which divine things are presented. If the Spirit of God modifies His statements, He does not wish us to put in the full thought there. In @John 3 the person is born again himself, "again" or "anew" meaning from top to bottom. That is not merely something in him, the *man* is affected from top to bottom, all his moral being is affected. Then the water added in the second remark of the Lord, brings in the cleansing element that is included. If you see the man, he has clean propensities instead of evil propensities; there is not much more to say than that -- without it he cannot enter. The Spirit of God does not go so far as to say he enters, it is the initial thought. We are to accustom ourselves to stopping where the Spirit of God stops in presenting the truth.
Ques. Does the movement of the Spirit in that way bring us into the heavenly circle, or does it really pertain
{242}
to what is carried out here on earth?
J.T. It is the latter. It is the kingdom of God, and that is usually the moral side of the kingdom. It needs this kind of thing in the person, if he is to see it and enter into it. It is really put in a negative way, but you can infer the positive, that there is the thought in the mind of God that there is such a thing as His kingdom here, not only to be seen but to be entered into. There are many who see it and do not enter into it. It is a question of entering into a realm of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. We do not want simply to see that, but to enter into it; this passage is initial, to show how it comes about.
Ques. Would denying ungodliness and worldly lusts indicate the element you are speaking of?
J.T. I think so; such persons would have pure, holy propensities. You may not have much power, but the instinct is there. I think that is the idea.
J.G. What connection has it with the washing of regeneration?
J.T. There is a strong connection, "the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit" (@Titus 3:5) is very like this. The apostle in writing to Titus is presenting the full thought of the gospel, so that the Spirit, he says, is "shed on us abundantly" @Titus 3:6.
F.G.W. How would the water be presented in the gospel?
J.T. @Romans 6 is the water.
Ques. Would not this show the import of the operations of the Spirit in the individual?
J.T. Yes. This does not refer to human instrumentality at all, chapter 2 is what the servants do. Here the Lord goes on to explain -- "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit". It is evidently a sovereign action of God by the Spirit going on all the time, proceeding all the time in relation to the testimony,
{243}
so as to make the testimony effective in souls; without it there could be no result from the preaching. It does not say, 'That which is born of water is water'; the result is spirit, that is, there is a potential spiritual state of things, that is all you can call it, with an element of purity, that is the basis of a heavenly man in John.
Ques. Does the water involve the teaching of the removal of man, the end of all flesh coming before God, that would be announced in the preaching?
J.T. I think so. The water ought to be announced; the Spirit is the witness, it says, both of the testimony of the water and the blood (@1 John 5: 6), and the water should be brought forward. In Revelation you have cleansing by blood by the Lord -- He has "washed us from our sins in his own blood", @Revelation 1:5. In chapter 7 the great multitude have "washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" @Revelation 7:14; but in the last chapter the washing is by water -- "Blessed are they that wash their robes" @Revelation 22:14 -- not that *have* done it, it is a continuous thing, "wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city", @Revelation 22: 14. That is a continuous thing, and that is by water.
Rem. The reference to baptism in @Romans 6 would enforce what you say -- it would ever be in mind.
Ques. Does the man of chapter 9 enter in?
J.T. That is what I thought. The subject is progressive. There is no question of sin there, nor of washing from anything bad -- that cannot be -- it is a question of what the Lord did by His spittle and the clay; it is the transition from what stood connected with Christ in the flesh here, to what He is now, for the Son of God is the culmination of it. He is "declared to be the Son of God with power ... by the resurrection from the dead" @Romans 1:4. He was the Son as in humanity here, but the declaration is the point, how the thing has come to light, and that is by resurrection. If I see Him as the man here did, and worship Him, I come into
{244}
another world. The next chapter contemplates the one flock into which the sheep are put.
Rem. Would you say a word about the wind?
J.T. Ecclesiastes speaks of it whirling about continually, towards the north and the south; @Ecclesiastes 1:6. The wind is a most wonderful thing in nature, and the Spirit of God is likened to it. These elements of nature just serve as a divine vocabulary. It is an inscrutable thing, the wind -- "so is every one that is born of the Spirit". That is, of course, an initial thought, it is included in chapter 9. It is not there a question of sin; the blindness is not because the man had sinned or his parents, "but that the works of God should be manifested in him": that is the next great thing -- "works", not "work" only, but "works", and that in one man. So this is a great transaction, the greatest of all we have been speaking of; it is a transaction by the Creator Himself, for He spits on the ground and turns the clay into mud. A most remarkable thing! Think of divine Persons working for their own pleasure -- "I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day" @John 9:4. This is now a direct transaction of the Lord; He puts the mud on the man's eyes, which would, of course, make him more blind if possible; but this mud is holy, it is not evil, it is made by the Lord's spittle; the clay, the creation of God, that out of which man was made primarily.
G.A.v.S. Do we see here how each individual soul in whom the preceding work of an initial character is carried out comes in a direct way under the divine touch?
J.T. That is just it. The greatest transaction of all; and what is perhaps little understood. Why should what the Lord made need to be washed away? People speak of Jesus and His steps, what He was here, but that is not proper christianity, for He came under the law. Not that there is any change in Him intrinsically as to His own Person, but the condition He took on,
{245}
indicated in the clay, is humanity, and that has to be applied first; there is something in that as applied, there is virtue in it.
Ques. Is it the Lord touching humanity sympathetically?
J.T. It ought to cause deep feeling in us that He should do this. There is virtue in the clay, but there would be no result for this man did he not go to Siloam and wash -- this alludes to the death of Christ. The humanity of Christ, in itself, could not effect salvation, it could not effect the counsels of God, there has to be the application of the water of Siloam (that is Christ's death) which implies obedience -- "Sent". He is the Sent One in John always. Now this man is moved on this principle, he is sent, he is in obedience, in accord with the Lord's position.
F.G.W. Do you suggest that the washing away of the clay is, that humanity on this side of death must go, that He may be known as the Son of God in another sphere?
J.T. Quite so. It *has* gone for God, but it has to go for *us* too, and we see it gone, we see that condition gone -- we see that condition is not the condition belonging to the new order of things, the new world God has in His mind; it is another condition, but believers have to get their eyes opened to that, and this is the way of it.
F.G.W. Why is it the "water and the blood" in the epistle? @1 John 5:8
J.T. The blood is the first thing a man needs. The water comes first in John's epistle, because of what is in view, namely our entering into eternal life. This requires that our state is to be dealt with. The water is, I believe, the important thing today, that people should learn purification *morally*.
Ques. Do you think the deficiency in the preaching hinders the practical moving on of converts?
J.T. I think it does. We have been speaking the last two or three days about the ministers; how the
{246}
thought of the ministers is stressed in 1st and 2nd Corinthians, and their competency in ministry. I believe that the weakness is in failing to present the water in the gospel. If I have come into the thing myself, I certainly ought to be exercised to tell others about it.
A.E.L. Would you say a little more as to presenting the water in the gospel?
J.T. Well, it is the termination of the state of believers as after the flesh; it is what meets our state, not only man's guilt.
G.A.v.S. In the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, is there that which, if apprehended in its effective power, will have a purifying effect, so that we become suitable for the company, as in chapter 10?
J.T. I think that is right. I believe that the weakness amongst the brethren generally -- and the weakness is very great -- is due to the want of the water being ministered, and the lack of the exercises consequent upon it, so that we might be not in the flesh but in the Spirit. One may know his sins forgiven, and yet not have power in the Spirit.
G.A.v.S. The process we have been following in these chapters, including the 9th, is more or less indispensable ere we can come into the conditions implied in the 10th and following chapters.
J.T. I think that is right, for John has in mind a circle of life; and without purification, you cannot be in it.
Ques. Why is the Spirit put before the water and the blood in the epistle?
J.T. "For they that bear witness are three: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one", @1 John 5: 8. That is how it stands. The water and the blood come before the Spirit historically, as we know from this gospel; the blood and the water were there as a witness, and then the Spirit comes in to bear witness; but, that being stated, "they that
{247}
bear witness are three" @1 John 5:7, the Spirit is the first necessity. He is a divine Person, there is no witness without Him.
Ques. And does it mean He would be the One to lead us into the meaning of the water and the blood?
J.T. That is right. There are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and all this to lead us into eternal life.
J.G. Does the case of Naaman help? He wanted cleansing, but he resisted the means for some time.
J.T. Yes, he is like the young man who said, "I will not" go, and yet he went afterwards. It is good if you get that finally; even if people are a bit stubborn; it is a question of patient influence -- they are worth saving!
J.G. "Then went he down". @2 Kings 5:14
J.T. Yes, and he "plunged" not simply washed, but he plunged seven times; he takes it in its fulness. He accepts the testimony.
I would like to open up this 9th chapter. It is really to see Christ in relation to another world *as He is now*; the new company, the new flock, and eternal life, and then in Bethany. Chapter 13 is that the Lord knows things -- "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come" and that "the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God", it says, He "rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel he girded himself: then he pours water into the wash hand basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples". All this is very remarkable; it is to bring the love of Christ in service before us, and what He has in mind in it, that we might have part with Him, a great thought! -- not only to enter the kingdom, not only to see a new world, to see Him in resurrection glory, but to have part with Him. You can see how the climax of the subject is here; to have *part with* Christ; and then, the final thought, He brings in an example to us -- this is the line we are on.
{248}
Ques. What is it to have part with Him?
J.T. It is what He is going on with, in this new world in the assembly. He came from God, and is going to Him, carrying a great service there, and we are to have part with Him in all that He has in that.
Ques. Does it go on to chapter 20?
J.T. Not fully; it is simply that He goes to "God".
G.A.v.S. There is that in which He is engaged in which He is wishing to have His own to have part.
J.T. Yes, I think all the previous things we have spoken of lead up to this; that we not only see Him there and worship Him there, but we have part with Him, and if we do not submit ourselves to this service of His, we do not have part with Him -- "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me", verse 8.
{249}
THE FATHER'S PORTION
@Genesis 41:50 - 52; @Genesis 48
J.T. It is proposed to consider Jacob as representing a father, and Joseph, a son, and Ephraim and Manasseh the saints as secured by Christ as among the gentiles. Stress is laid by Jacob on their having been born in Egypt, before he came there; and Joseph, in keeping with that, says that God had given them to him, as he says, "They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place"; that is, in Egypt. Applying @Genesis 48 to the present time, it contemplates the *outward* weakness that marks our position, as indeed marked the position of the assembly from the outset, but particularly in the last days. Yet, in this weakness, we have the clearest setting out of the divine mind. Jacob speaks in the most definite way as to what was in his mind, and he would not be turned aside from it, although it cut across the human mind. In this attitude Jacob stresses his thought to take on these two sons of Joseph, and give them a status on the very highest plane; he says, "Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon". Then, as Joseph brings them to Jacob, who enquires as to them, Joseph says, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here", but Jacob regards them as his, and blesses them accordingly.
If these thoughts are kept in mind, I believe the Lord will help us to profit by this enquiry and to see how we, who had no place, according to @Ephesians 2, are brought nigh, and are also "builded together" (@Ephesians 2:22); -- the Father takes us on as His. It works out practically, when we are together in assembly; the Lord's supper contemplates Christ as rejected, Joseph was viewed as rejected by his brethren. The Lord's supper as we have it, that is, as committed to us by Paul, contemplates not only the Lord's death, but His rejection by Israel, and what He has among the gentiles,
{250}
and how they are taken on in the assembly. On the one hand, the Lord's supper contemplates the toil and the forgetfulness of Christ as to His earthly relations; but, on the other hand, as in Ephraim, there is fruitfulness, and the Father takes us on saying, they "shall be mine". It works out practically as the position is changed "in assembly"; the Lord takes, as it were, a second place. Jacob is the chief speaker here, indeed all the proposals are his. Leaving out the incident of Joseph's protest, he is generally a type of the Son as subservient to the Father's will; Jacob honouring Joseph and taking on his two sons, although begotten in the land of his sorrow. Then Christ typically is honoured at the end of the chapter in that He has a double portion. I think our position in the assembly is clearly in view (verse 22), although in outward weakness -- for Jacob is said to have been sick.
W.H.M. What distinction do you make between Ephraim and Manasseh?
J.T. Manasseh, as you know, means "forgetting"; Joseph says in naming him, "God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house" @Genesis 41:51. The Spirit, I believe, would instruct us as to how the Lord Jesus, while feeling what He had lost in His rejection, for it was a very real thing to Him, would impress upon us gentiles, what consolation He has in us, and what we are to Him. Manasseh represents this. Then Ephraim is "fruitful", as he says, "God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction". @Genesis 41:52
W.H.M. "Joseph is a fruitful bough ... by a well; his branches shoot over the wall", @Genesis 49: 22. That would bring in Ephraim, would it not?
J.T. Yes. We see in Joseph the Lord's contentment in the new circumstances, for they were new circumstances that He should move out among the gentiles and forget His father's house -- this would be through Paul's ministry. He has something else as a recompense and consolation, and would impress upon us that He
{251}
finds this in us. Jacob takes up the thread in saying, "now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, shall be mine". He makes a point of that, "before I came" that is, when Joseph was alone and apart from his father's house.
Ques. Will you say how "before I came" applies to the present moment?
J.T. The coming of Jacob to Joseph in Egypt (@Genesis 48:5), applies to the *present* time as has been said; and it would also show how God's thoughts in regard to Israel and the millennium come under our notice as treasuring the interests of Christ, for Jacob's sons also came with him. Joseph in Egypt had nothing before him but what he secured there, a wife and family -- he is consoled in that, and these typify what Christ finds among the Gentiles pending the resumption of His relations with Israel, it is what comes about under these circumstances. The Lord would impress us in assembly that He so regards us; He dignifies us.
H.B. The thought of Manasseh would be a negative feature which comes first in history, but takes second place eventually to Ephraim, which is positive.
J.T. Yes, I think that is right. The first thing is Joseph's forgetfulness, whether we are spiritual enough to understand that as applying to Christ, that He can forget -- that is, forget that which would claim Him on lower ground -- He loved Israel. So Jacob immediately introduces the thought of Rachel, the first loved, but last received -- she died; Jacob accentuates that thought in taking up the thread in chapter 48. It is a question of our being able to apply the thought of forgetfulness to Christ. It clearly applies to ourselves, for how much we forget Him, and what need there is of the Supper to remind us of Him -- but it is a question of His forgetting.
Ques. Would it be like, "who for the joy that was
{252}
set before him endured the cross, despising the shame"? @Hebrews 12: 2.
J.T. Yes, quite so, the assembly was undoubtedly in His mind.
A.E.L. Would it be the same as Rebekah and Isaac -- he is comforted after the death of his mother? or is that different?
J.T. That is another view, the assembly in Israel's place, in Sarah's tent; but Asenath is not that, there is no Sarah's tent in Egypt.
Ques. Does the word in @Psalm 45 apply? "Hearken, O daughter, and consider ... forget also thine own people, and thy father's house". @Psalm 45:10
J.T. Yes, as to us, for we so cling to natural and family settings, and natural affections; but the Lord entered into these things, He entered into a system of affections on earth, an ancient system, and it was no small matter for Him to relinquish that. We do not sufficiently sympathise with Him in regard of that, that He has to forget; that is, that in a new system of affections, He has forgotten the old. The forgetting of Christ is a real thing -- it is possible for Him to forget, to lose the thought of one thing in a greater thing. In Egypt there were no family links when Joseph came in, he was alone, he was carried there in rejection, as a slave; now he gets something that consoles him, that satisfies him so completely that he forgets the old. That is a matter to be considered; whether we can apprehend Christ in this way and see what He has found among the gentiles. Joseph is satisfied in Egypt -- not with the place, it is the land of his affliction still, but with the family; he has learnt to forget in the presence of the new thing. That is to make us understand how much we are in the mind of Christ; for Ephraim and Manasseh are just ourselves, from the point of view before us.
Rem. "Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come", @John 2: 4.
{253}
J.T. Yes, that is one expression of it. When the Lord said, "Who is my mother, or my brethren?" (@Mark 3:33), and He looked around -- that is it, only there we have not the territory. Here we have the territory, the gentile position; and the Lord would impress us, as of it, with how much He thinks of it. The Jew was out of sight; though I think properly the place the gentiles have, comes in under Paul's ministry -- "the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and ... they will hear it", @Acts 28: 28.
Ques. Do you think Paul came to it when he could say, "Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before"? @Philippians 3:13.
J.T. Quite so, but you can see in him how hard it was to forget the old system of affections, and if it were so strong in him, how much more in Christ who died for the nation! Yet He comes to a point where He forgets it, and I think it is to impress on us how much the assembly is to Him. Jacob says, 'I want those two' -- they were born to Joseph while he was alone in Egypt.
G.A.v.S. The position in which Jacob is brought before us here in relation to Joseph's sons, brings before us the delight of the Father in bringing into the heavenly inheritance a people who for Him would be linked up with that which His Son had suffered and gone through in rejection?
J.T. That is the thought. The Father takes them on, not only to bless them, but he is taking them on himself -- they "shall be mine". That is something Joseph had not thought of; but Jacob's thought is in keeping with Joseph's thoughts about them in giving them these names.
Ques. What would Reuben and Simeon typify?
J.T. They represent in this passage the counsels of God. We have to look on the tribes as applying to ourselves, they represent those that have a part in divine
{254}
counsels; Ephraim and Manasseh are raised to that level.
W.C.G. Does the line begin in @Matthew 11 where the Lord says, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth"? @Matthew 11:25
J.T. I think that helps. They are there, the Lord regards them as babes, but the Father had already begun with them. "Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes". @Matthew 11:25 The Father had not yet disclosed the truth of the assembly, but He had already begun to reveal things to babes; not yet the truth as to the Son -- that remained for chapter 16, but the Father had already begun to move on the principle of revelation sovereignly.
W.C.G. The Lord is not overwhelmed by His rejection, but rejoices.
J.T. Yes, showing how the Lord is triumphant in moving from one set of circumstances into another; so the Father is appealed to -- "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight". Then, "All things have been delivered to me by my Father" @Matthew 11:27. The babes are really the product of Christ's own ministry, the Father takes them on.
G.A.v.S. Would that be, "Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me"? @Isaiah 8:18
J.T. I think so, although we do not get the territory changed, they are still Israel; the allusion is to @Isaiah 8, as you know. There is something in Israel, and of course what is in Matthew is in Israel, but what we are saying alludes to what is begotten in another land outside of that, when the Lord is alone.
Ques. Is that on the line of "this mystery among the nations"? @Colossians 1:27.
J.T. Just so, it is Colossians -- Christ "among the nations" -- among the gentiles.
{255}
Rem. The Lord takes the place of the true vine, of Israel in that way, and the Father is glorified in the much fruit produced.
J.T. Yes, He does, but there is no Israel in Egypt yet; Israel's place was not, and never had been, properly in Egypt, Joseph was the first to go in in that sense, he was there alone, as a slave. It is to impress us with the value of what is secured *among the nations*.
L.D.M. Does Matthew fit in -- "Out of Egypt have I called my Son" (@Matthew 2:15); and then, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations"? @Matthew 28:19.
J.T. Well yes, there is a certain link, but of course there again you are not out of sight of Israel. He is taken into Egypt as Israel had been, and taken out of it as Israel had been, but that does not contemplate the fruitfulness; He was taken in as a Babe, and taken out of it. But here, you have a person taken into it alone, as a slave, under the greatest reproach. Paul served the saints in this attitude; the lowliest kind of man, with no pretension at all, a tent-maker; not a man who had a link with Israel, a Pharisee of the Pharisees, and the like -- not a man of that kind at all, but a lowly man, a tent-maker in Corinth. Well, what is coming out of all this? The Lord says, "I have much people in this city", @Acts 18: 10. The operation is entirely apart from any previous setting, because he did not go there in relation to Israel, he went there as a tent-maker. Joseph went to Egypt as a slave: then Jacob comes in, not as representing Israel in the land, but suggesting the Father's appropriation and recognition of what the Son had won in another sphere and system of things; not connected with an earthly portion, but a heavenly one.
Rem. Joseph was just a bought slave.
J.T. Anyone can see the position, he had no status whatever -- and yet this is what comes out of it; we have to apprehend Christ in that light.
{256}
Rem. The Father secures sons -- Thy two sons "shall be mine".
J.T. Well, they are the result of Joseph's fruitfulness, but Jacob values them; I think that is the thing to see. Joseph values them, as naming them, they are the expression of his experience, and Jacob values them accordingly. He knew them, yet, when they are brought to him, he says, "Who are these?" and Joseph tells him who they are, saying, "They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place"; he is viewing them in accord with the mind of his father about them. We should understand how Christ visited the nations in Paul, the manner of His visitation among the gentiles is seen in Joseph being in Egypt where these two sons are given to him.
Ques. Why had Joseph to tell him?
J.T. I think it is to bring out the position of Christ in the assembly, that He speaks of us, in keeping with the Father's mind; the Father's mind is in @Genesis 48: 5 -- "now thy two sons ... which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine". Then in verse 8, he says, "Who are these? And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here" -- in this place -- that is in keeping with his father's thought. The Father and the Son are in perfect accord as to the saints; those secured among the nations. The Lord, in assembly, would so to speak, say to the Father, as to us, 'These are the sons I have begotten here, in this strange land' -- the gentile world. Paul speaks of God taking out from among the gentiles a people. We are apt to think a good deal more of ourselves than we are entitled to externally -- we say we are English, or German, or American -- but there is no virtue in that whatsoever. God will never let us off on those lines, we are still gentiles, and, as such, relatively below His earthly people, and that will come out by-and-by. Whatever advantage the gentiles have acquired through christianity,
{257}
it will not give them a place beyond what they have in the mind of God; they are gentiles. But what is stressed here is, that these two sons are different, strictly speaking, they are born in Egypt, but they are taken out of that setting; that is what we do not like and although we do not say so, we are very slow to give up nationality. God has raised us above it; even as Ephraim and Manasseh are given the same status as Reuben and Simeon.
W.H.M. One would like to enter a little into the joy of Joseph's heart as he heard the value Jacob put on those sons; they are "mine" -- "all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them", @John 17:10.
J.T. That is the thing to lay hold of, I am sure, to see how the Father takes us on and elevates us, so that our nationality is left behind. Our status according to God is elevated, and we are brought into a new setting; we belong to the Israel of God, "to the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven", @Hebrews 12:23.
Ques. Would it be correct to say that those two sons are a type of the assembly?
J.T. They represent it from the point of view we are considering; the gentiles, that is, ourselves, as brought into the assembly and regarded by the Father in this way, lifted out of our ordinary settings, lifted up to the highest level.
Ques. Would not the wife Joseph secured in Egypt represent the assembly, and the sons be the product of that?
J.T. Yes.
A.M. Would @John 12 anticipate this? The Greeks desire to see Jesus, but He speaks of the corn of wheat, and the much fruit, and then the Father's name is glorified.
J.T. I think that is good. In the minds of Philip and Andrew the Greeks had a great place in the ancient world. I have no doubt they had in their minds that
{258}
this was a matter of great importance, that even such people should come to see Jesus. The Lord does not attach any importance to that; but indicates that there is to be an entirely new sowing, a new crop, which means we are lifted out of all that, we are to be like Himself. The slave position marked Paul right through -- tent-making, a lowly occupation -- "these hands have ministered to my wants", @Acts 20:34. There is no pretence to any great religious status at all, or assumption of having any link with the people of God, he is just a workman. He spent a large part of his time in prison, and the like, that is the thought; it is the land of Christ's affliction, but wonderfully fruitful. The Father honours the Son in the place He gives us; you are the product of the Son, I am the product of the Son. We have no place outwardly, any more than the Syrophenician woman; she had to come to it that she was a dog; but the Lord had great regard for her "O woman, great is thy faith", @Matthew 15: 28. That was what gave her a status; and the Father is perfectly in accord with that; that comes in just before the assembly is mentioned.
Ques. What is the significance of the crossing of the hands?
J.T. That is the next thing. The point is, I suppose, that these two sons are taken on by the Father, yet their positions are determined according to sovereign wisdom. They are not there on the line of nature, or on the line in which they were brought into the testimony even. For instance, there were many in Christ before Paul, but, in result, Paul has a different setting. It is the sovereignty of God, I suppose, in Jacob crossing his hands.
Ques. Would @Romans 9, 10, and 11 help us to remember who we are and where we have come from?
J.T. Quite so. We ought to bear those chapters in mind as to what we are externally. The western nations have come into great prominence through the light of
{259}
christianity quickening their intelligence, but they are still dogs, that is the position -- how then are we to be elevated? Through faith -- "*thou* standest through faith", @Romans 11:20. The Father determines the position of each, even as Ephraim is set before Manasseh; everything in God's world is according to divine appointment, the appointment of infinite wisdom.
Rem. The Lord said to the woman in @John 4, "salvation is of the Jews", it comes that way to us gentiles.
J.T. Quite so; we have to respect all these things. We may look down on the Jew, and it may be there is ground for it in some respects, but a humble christian will always take a low place outwardly.
Ques. Does the apostle mean that when lie says, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ"? @Galatians 6:14.
J.T. Quite so, that cuts at the root of everything.
G.A.v.S. In speaking of himself as a tent-maker, was Paul practically indicating how he was regarded in Israel? He had been absolutely forgotten and set on one side, but for "the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" (@Philippians 3:8), he had counted all as dung.
J.T. Quite so -- he counted all else as dung. You might have said to Paul, 'Why do you not make use of your education at Corinth? You are a dignified man of great attainment' -- that is what the natural mind would think. But he did not take advantage of that, he was a tent-maker, and lodged with two others *because* they were tent-makers. Out of that you have this wonderful product at Corinth.
G.A.v.S. You referred to the firstborn ones, do you indicate that what you have been speaking of gives that which is indispensable for our education in assembly conditions?
J.T. Yes. So that the Son has brought us forth, as it were, secured us in an alien land, a land of no account
{260}
spiritually, as the land of Joseph's affliction, who came into it as a slave, representative of Paul; he speaks of himself as a bondman in writing to the Philippians, that is how he came into it. Christ has secured, in that setting, an offspring, sons, as it were; they are named because of that, and in the type we see how the Father intimates that He is in accord with the Son's mind, and He is going to take them on as His. That is how I regard these two, they are no longer in a gentile setting -- Jerusalem above is our mother. It is not in heaven but it is elevated, it is high, it is above. There is the principle of lifting-up, the taking out from the old to set us up in new settings; we cling to things that are old so tenaciously.
W.H. In the following chapter he goes over the blessing of the twelve tribes. I wondered if the Father's thoughts as illustrated in Manasseh and Ephraim would refer to the assembly's place?
J.T. I thought so. I think chapter 48 is on a higher plane than chapter 49 where it is the tribes, and they are all blessed. In chapter 48 we have two persons taken out and blessed by themselves, and then Joseph blessed by himself, and he receives a portion above his brethren. I think we have the assembly setting, where Christ is anointed with the oil of joy above His companions; and the blessing is taken out of the hand of the Amorite, with the sword and with the bow. It is a question of what God has secured *Himself*, and handed over to Christ. There is no history at all, so far as I know, of this incident of Jacob taking something from the Amorite with his sword and with his bow. I believe it will be seen that chapter 48 is on a higher plane than chapter 49 which is prophetic of Israel's history, the good and bad; but there is no thought of bad in chapter 48; the two sons are blessed according to eternal counsels -- Joseph is set up above others by something that happened of which we know nothing, beyond what is stated here.
{261}
H.B-t. The blessing of Ephraim speaks of the fulness of the nations: we get in @Romans 11 "until the fulness of the nations be come in" @Romans 11:25 -- do you connect them at all?
J.T. What is contemplated is the fulness of the nations, what God has out of the nations, and it is here linked with Christ's forgetfulness as losing all thought of His earthly relations; and surely we are to be brought on to that too, to that way of thinking, forgetting natural relationships, letting them go -- finding something better.
Ques. Does the change over as in the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh come in as we apprehend our place as sons connected with the Father; the great prominent thought is fruitfulness -- that comes first. Are we not when in assembly sometimes occupied with that which is not in the Lord's mind at the time, that is, His toil and affliction? Is He not occupied more with what is for the Father, and therefore the thought in fruitfulness comes first?
J.T. I think so, and the change over is seen more in the assembly as convened than anywhere. The Lord's supper is a sort of introduction, all that attaches to us here is left -- the thought of forgetting -- and then we have the remembrance. Really, the remembrance in the Supper is of Christ where He is now.
Ques. Do we not perhaps stress too much at the Supper the thought of His affliction?
J.T. I think the thought is to move over, in forgetfulness of all that.
Ques. Is this portion above his brethren at Sychar's well? It was there the Lord said to that weary heart, The Father seeketh worshippers, those that "worship the Father in spirit and in truth", @John 4: 23.
J.T. Yes, I suppose what the woman represents there would fit in. It was a remarkable thing -- He was alone, it was in foreign territory, too, that is, Samaritan territory; the disciples had gone away, that was not an
{262}
accident, it was intended there should be such a scene. He is alone, and He is weary with His journey. What is to come out of this? I believe that helps us. Well, this woman comes, and eventually the disciples come back. The earthly setting did not contribute one iota to what He was dealing with, the disciples had nothing to do with it, and when they came they did not understand -- they "marvelled that he talked with the woman" @John 4:27, they were not in the thing, but He said, "I have meat to eat that ye know not of" @John 4:32. Then He proceeds to say, "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest" @John 4:35. And then the result of the conversation with the woman is testimony as to His being the Saviour of the world. It is a wide thought. "We have heard him ourselves" @John 4:42, they say, and believed on that account. I believe that fits in. We should grasp the idea of a slave in Egypt.
G.A.v.S. Is there a somewhat similar suggestion in @John 11? It says, "Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples". @John 11:54
J.T. I think that is good. Ephraim is the place of fruitfulness; He sojourned there.
Ques. If we considered the great toil of the Lord as recorded in the gospels and His deep affection for His earthly people, it would give us very exalted ideas of the assembly as competent to enable Him to forget that.
J.T. Just so, and that He has found compensation among the gentiles, that is in ourselves. Not that we should be occupied with ourselves personally, but the point is what the gentiles are, what Paul has brought out, both as regards his external position, and his relations here as a tent-maker and a slave, and what he was inwardly -- what he was to God. He said, "whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God" @2 Corinthians 5:13, and he would get us into that line of things: and "Jerusalem which is
{263}
above is free, which is the mother of us all" @Galatians 4:26, that takes us out of all natural and family settings, that is to say, it is "the assembly of the first-born ... registered in heaven" @Hebrews 12:23. The Father has taken us on; we are equal to the highest position according to His counsels. It is sonship. They "are mine", Jacob says, "as Reuben and Simeon".
H.B. I would like to ask about this last verse "I have given to thee one tract of land (or"one portion") above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow".
J.T. I think it must be the heavenly position. It is above any inheritance that Israel will have -- Joseph has that -- his family -- that is these sons come into that. I think it is our heavenly place -- Ephesians opens it up, that He has "raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus", @Ephesians 2:6.
H.B. It speaks in the last chapter of Ephesians of spiritual wickedness in the heavenlies, that would be the Amorite, I suppose?
J.T. Yes. We have to contend, for the moment, being as we are, but that will all be over by-and-by. We have to take this from Jacob's own word, there is no history to confirm it. It is what the Father has done, without any record in history; we do not want confirmation from history for eternal things; history has to do with the earth. Jacob is a dying man -- that is the outward position -- but in spite of that you have these wonderful things. It ought to be very comforting to us, because our position is extremely weak, yet we have these wonderful things; the mind of God is as clear as it can be; and no one could speak more definitely than Jacob did here. It is very comforting.
Ques. You made a remark as to remembering the Lord where He now is?
J.T. Yes, as the absent One He is to be *remembered*.
Ques. We do not *remember* Him as a dead Christ?
J.T. No, I do not think that would be right. The
{264}
Supper, of course, is a symbol of the dead Christ, but He is not the dead Christ now. It is not something historical you remember, it is a *present* Christ: it is Christ we remember, and there is no Christ but the present Christ. It is the Person we remember, it is as such He comes into the assembly -- as He is now.
Ques. Would you say the two sons as together suggest the idea of the assembly in its two aspects; first to the Lord, and then to God?
J.T. Yes, that is right. Joseph valued these sons, they were his firstborn ones, and the father is in entire accord with him.
Ques. Do we get this worked out in @John 17?
J.T. You may bring it in, I think -- "all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them" @John 17:10.
Ques. Is that the idea in @Ephesians 2 -- "Wherefore remember that ye, once nations in the flesh" @Ephesians 2:11?
J.T. That is the idea. He stresses that is what we were, and outwardly we are not different from that.
Rem. Then the inward side -- "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" @Ephesians 2:18.
J.T. That is the thought. Then, at the end of the chapter -- "Ye also (that is the gentiles) are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" @Ephesians 2:22.
{265}
THE END OF THE DISPENSATION TO AGREE WITH THE BEGINNING
@John 1:29 - 37; @John 3:35; @John 12:1 - 3; @John 20:21 - 23
These scriptures are all peculiar to John, and, like others in his gospel, they bear on the last days of our dispensation. His writings indicate, with other prophecies of the New Testament, that there was to be a revival and it has come to pass; it is no longer a matter of prophecy but of fact, of history, past and current; a revival, not only of light and knowledge, but of affections, of the living features of christianity. While John in his gospel thus provides for the last days, he does not deal solely in last day events, but links on these events of the last days with the very first events. No one indeed goes back further than John, no one could; he opens with an allusion to the beginning of the divine operations, telling us that, in that beginning, the Word *was*, Jesus was; so that it is very comprehensive. In going so far back, he presents to us our Saviour in the Deity, personally existent there, but also operative there, whatever was made, was made by Him; and I need not say that John takes us on to the future as far as anyone else does. So that, whilst he bears, as I said, on our times, there is an immensity behind and before, and an immensity present. However he views Christ, whether in his gospel or in the Apocalypse, we are impressed with this One "who is, and who was, and who is to come".
Having these thoughts in one's mind, great as they are, and as feeling them to be great in some little way, I call attention first of all to John the Baptist's testimony of Jesus in these early verses: he uses the word "Behold!" Pilate uses it also, and presents Christ, saying, "Behold the man! @John 19:5" You can understand, dear brethren, how different would be the voice, how wanting in spiritual
{266}
feeling and holy sentiment would be the voice of a Pilate when he said "Behold the man!" He spoke of Him thus as persons in authority may do now; Christ was, as it were, in his custody; and, in one sense, through the failure of the assembly, this is true of some of the authorities in christendom today; and they, in a certain way, call attention to Christ, but their appeal is of little interest to the circumcised ear and heart of the lover of Jesus; he prefers a John the baptist to speak of Jesus. Moreover, Pilate had just scourged Him, the soldiers had plaited a crown of thorns and put it on His head; they had clothed Him with a purple robe, and had buffeted Him. The heart is touched in alluding to these things -- to what befalls the Lord, at the hands of such men as Pilate, notwithstanding that he had no special hatred of the Lord. There are others unfavourable; but we do not wish a presentation of Christ such as Pilate can give; for a Christ scourged and persecuted generally by the one who presents Him, a Christ with a crown of thorns, with a purple robe put upon Him ignominiously, a Christ with the world's clothing -- that is not the Christ that love seeks! Love to the Person seeks Him, but we want Him in His own clothes, not in theirs. How different is the voice of John the Baptist! He sees Jesus coming to him, a significant movement, that the Son of God, as presented in this chapter, should thus come to John. When John saw Him coming to him, he says, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world". How different from Pilate's presentation! and how different is the presentation today by any such as Pilate, whatever the motive, from a presentation of Christ by a lover of Christ! God intends, dear brethren, that the testimony as to Christ shall be presented by those who love Him. So that when John sees Him moving towards him, or if any minister of Christ sees Him moving towards him, well, there is something in mind in the heart of Christ for him. All true ministers of Christ look for this, each
{267}
looks for a movement towards him, otherwise his service cannot be effective. The Lord is pleased to move towards those who serve; and whilst, in moving towards a minister, the minister is necessarily prominent for the moment, he will not be prominent long -- *Jesus* will be prominent. The minister will soon hide behind Him, soon, be as it were, in the shadow of His hand for that is how one should minister, under the shadow of His hand.
John sees Jesus coming -- glorious sight! -- the lowly One coming thus to a servant, to a minister -- volumes enter into that! -- and John stood. This is no less than He who takes away the sin of the world -- none less than that! John draws attention to Jesus; he saw Him coming to him, and, not only so, but he saw the Holy Spirit too. None of the others speak of having seen the Spirit descending from heaven. John the Baptist is let into much. These two divine Persons who would be together in infinite unity in subjection to the supreme will of the Deity -- he saw that! Each minister is to see that, to see Jesus, who is so depicted earlier, coming to him; and then, as He went up out of the waters of baptism, to see the Holy Spirit coming upon Him! Could any view be greater than of the two divine Persons who had come in with a perfect intimate knowledge of the divine will to be carried out here? The baptist sees this, he sees the one -- Jesus -- and he sees the other -- the Spirit -- they merge, as it were. The Spirit comes upon Him, and, using the evangelist, He retires, and speaks of Jesus. The Spirit Himself, in the evangelist, speaks of Jesus, in the testimony of John the baptist -- "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God". For, although the Holy Spirit is seen by John, in perfect seemliness He keeps out of sight, to bring the more into view Him who came into a sacrificial position as the Lamb of God. The Holy Spirit is in perfect keeping with this position, but the Son of God has taken a sacrificial position. How
{268}
important for every minister to see Him thus, and we need the action of the Spirit in relation to Him. No one can serve according to God, save in a sacrificial spirit, and that is what John represents; he appreciates the sacrifice, the sacrificial attitude assumed by the Son, the Lamb of God. The word for Lamb here, is a mature word; the point being not so much His sufferings in themselves, but that He took this sacrificial state to carry out intelligently the divine will; that is what He will do. So it is a mature thought, He knows what He is doing.
Then, to add to this, the baptist on the next day sees Him again, and again he is impressed, as the testimony is here -- with what he saw. That is another touch in regard to ministry, to be impressed. John is impressed with what he saw, going over it doubtless in the night -- and what a night it must have been to that holy man, after the wonderful sight that he describes! The next day he sees Jesus walking, and he says again, "Behold the Lamb of God!" He is standing himself, and who would not stand, beloved brethren, in the presence of such Persons in active service? for the Lord is actually coming to John, and the Holy Spirit, after He is baptised, comes upon Him, "descending", as it says, "from heaven". Great matters are in hand! One would love to get a little record from John the baptist of that night -- of what he went through that night! The following day opens up, as it always does to the workman. What may enter into it! John the baptist is standing; he is not active. The impression has not waned, he is so full of the impression of the previous day, he has gone through his night. It was truly in the morning, one day in the Baptist's history exceeding perhaps all others -- but he is standing. It requires spiritual power sometimes to stand, as it does to act -- he stood in spiritual power, an important matter. It also requires spiritual power to sit at times. But John "stood ... and looking upon Jesus as he
{269}
walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!" That is all he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!" and, as we have often heard, the two disciples follow Jesus. That is the position.
Having arrived thus at the position the Spirit of God intends to convey to us by the baptist's testimony, I would dwell, for a moment, on the perfection presented. God begins with perfection; there is no idea of development in Jesus as presented here, there is no such thought in the testimony presented, it is all perfect there. Who could undertake to add to this scene? -- to that glorious Person who is there, with the Holy Spirit upon Him for ministry. The testimony is that this is "he ... who baptises with the Holy Spirit" -- that is to say, He takes away the sin, the cause of the trouble, He is the taker-away of it, and He is the Introducer of the means of joy for God and man. The scene is perfect! There is no evolutionary thought here at all; that is banished for ever from the mind of the believer as applying to what God presents in christianity; it is a perfect state of things set up by God, one divine Person coming into a place of subservience to the divine will, but retaining His equality in the deity. That is the position. It is therefore, as I said, the mature side of things that the Holy Spirit would imbue our souls with at the outset. As it was in Genesis, so it is in John's gospel; there is a remarkable link between Genesis and John's gospel. In Genesis everything is done in the six days, and all is "very good" -- God's own pronouncement. Adam was not a development from babyhood to manhood, he was made a man -- so too Eve was made a woman. Everything from the hand of the Creator is as it should be, not as it would eventually be, but as it should be; it was there in perfection. It must be so from the hand of God. That answers to what you get here; and the Spirit would fill our souls with the glorious perfection of the position in the Persons presented.
{270}
Well now, in chapter 3 the Spirit would tell us that this Person is not only admirable to John, but "The Father loveth the Son", verse 35. He is admirable to the minister, that is what is in mind in John the Baptist's testimony. It is not a question of christian state so much as the ministry, to find the minister that is pleasing to God as knowing how to speak of Jesus as seeing Him -- that He is "the Son of God"; one who knows how to speak of the Spirit as seeing Him, and who readily retires, saying, "He must increase, but I must decrease". So that the Spirit of God goes on from John's remarks in chapter 1 till he is brought in again in chapter 3, and he says there just what he said in chapter 1, he had not changed his mind about Christ one iota. It is a great matter to maintain or rather to increase in our apprehension of Christ. John introduces a beautiful background for this statement of the Spirit, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand". I apprehend in this, that the administration is in the hand of One who is loved, the Son is loved. As in the case of David, the Holy Spirit came upon him as one who was loved. ("David" means "beloved".) The first mention of David is as the Holy Spirit came upon him, the one who is loved; he is the one who is to do things, he does all the will of God.
Now the Son having all things in His hand, what is He to do? what is going on? That is what John is occupied with, a loved One, the Son loved of the Father, and all things in His hand; the Father "has given all things to be in his hand" -- now what will He do? There is a wonderful work going on, dear brethren, and the Spirit of God would impress upon us that *it is still going on*. So that the next chapter, one of the best known in the book -- chapter 4, gives us an account of the meeting of the situation occasioned by sin, by this Person who is loved and entrusted with everything. What will He do now? Well, what appears is a great administrative service to be rendered to the
{271}
woman. This leads me to remark that, what I have in mind in regard to chapter 20 is, that the Son is now occupied in bringing about *results*. There is no development in Him, but there *is* development in our being brought into accord with Him. That is what is in mind; a state of things here on earth, in these last days, that is in accord with this great position. Could anything be greater, dear brethren, than to have this before us in our service? To bring about a state of things, in any given locality, such as at Bethany, in which divine Persons are thought of, in which They are considered for, so that They can be present with undisturbedness -- that is what is in mind!
In chapter 4 you have the Lord on a journey. We may thank God for the way we may use the great highways of the world so that the saints can move about -- a most needful liberty if the service is to be carried on effectively. Jesus was on a journey, and He was weary with it. What heart that loves Jesus is not touched by the beautiful incidents recorded by this evangelist whom Jesus loved? "Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well" @John 4:6. The word "thus" expresses simply that He was wearied and did not disguise it. Think of the lowliness of this great Person into whose hand everything is given by the Father! He is wearied and does not disguise it; He "sat just as he was" on the well. And then follows the conversation between the great Administrator of all things from the Father, and the poor outcast woman. Is the Lord casual? No, the Lord is never casual; in what He said He had one thing before Him, to carry out the Father's will and to bring about what the Father seeks. That is the great mission of the Son and the Spirit, and that is what is going on, dear brethren. So the conversation moves in a simple way, but unerringly towards the great end in view. The Lord never wasted time. His disciples were not there, they were elsewhere, He is alone; but the time is not wasted,
{272}
and one person is secured through this conversation for the great scheme in mind; a poor woman, an outcast, a self-confessed wicked person, is secured for the great scheme in mind. Let everybody here understand, that if he is converted, if he is secured at all, he is secured for a great divine purpose. Water-carriers are necessary for the great scheme in mind in its present form, and this woman became in herself a water-carrier; she left her literal water-pot and went into the city. So far something is secured, a great principle is established, a most important principle, that is, that believers are to be water-vessels. You may think that is saying too much, but not at all, dear friends; John goes, as you might say, to the limit in speaking of what the saints may be for God; and he pursues the subject here until he shows you this woman moving away and leaving her water-pot behind her; and she goes to the men -- she carries water, as it were, a testimony of Jesus to them, and they move. Now that is the principle of what is going on every day, even today -- it is written for this very purpose that this thing is going on, and the principle is widening and widening, one and another are being secured for the new order of things.
So I ventured to read the verses in chapter 12, because there you get a collective scene, not exactly an assembly scene -- and yet it bears on the assembly. It is a most restful scene ."The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt" (@Isaiah 57:20) -- that is the world, but how great a thing for God to have a scene like this, an untroubled, holy, restful scene! Let us understand, dear brethren, what is being brought about, what is being aimed at, a holy, restful scene, composed of persons; one man risen from the dead, passed from death to life, sitting at the table with Jesus, in principle, they were all that, that is the thought. "The dead man Lazarus", as he is called, was there -- it is the local position -- and yet he is the most living man in the town. It seems paradoxical,
{273}
but it is the effect of testimony, the "dead" man is the most living of all in the town -- he has passed out of view of the clubs, of the social affairs, of all that would give a man distinction in any way in the town, he is dead as to all that; but he is alive, he is quickened together with Christ, as it were. Such is the divine objective today, and all things being in the hands of Christ, is to that end. All is centred on this one thing now, to bring about a state answering to what is presented in chapter 4. That is the thought of the Father the Father's desire.
We were speaking today of what God said in His heart in Genesis; in @John 4 God says, 'I want worshippers'. It is now told out, and it is told out to that woman, He seeks worshippers, and the Son will bring that about. So that, when we come to chapter 12, it is a restful scene, it is a scene out of death. This is a great day for pictures, many people have cameras, but they do not get with the camera any scene expressing what is presented here, it is a scene out of death, that is the idea, it is a resurrection scene. How glorious it is! -- the handiwork of Christ, developed in the most careful way. I beg of you, dear brethren, to consider the carefulness of the Lord's movements prior to this, staying away some days so that a certain condition -- even death -- should arise to suit His purpose. A death happens to suit His purpose, He stays away that it might happen, and it does happen, all this is the result of the most careful operations. Now He comes back, as we may say, to find the result, and He finds it. Martha is changed too. Luke tells us about her, and gives a rather poor picture. Luke tells us about Mary also, but he does not tell us the finish, it is for John to give us the finish. Luke is the evangelical side, the presentation of the gospel at the outset. We want the finish; he does give us the finish from his point of view, but he does not give us the finish in Mary and Martha. We want the finishing touches in
{274}
these women, and we get them here. That is what is going on, dear friends, the finishing touches, and the greatest care is to be used. The Lord shows in the record here the great care with which He reached this end; and I believe it has a voice to us as to the carefulness with which we should move in His service. The Lord is calling attention to accuracy in divine things, even in small details; and these chapters would support that, in the detail with which things are mentioned, even as to the place where Martha met Him; He does not move from it, Mary has to come there. That is to say, the Lord would say to us, the person in the town that you may think least of, is not to be omitted or slighted. Martha meets Him first, and the most spiritual person in the town, who was, I apprehend, Mary, has to come *there*. That is how the Lord does things. He is calling attention to accuracy, to carefulness in dealing with His things if we are to reach perfection, if we are to reach the finishing touches as the subjects of divine grace. So that we get Mary measuring, and Martha serving. The way service is often carried on is distressing to heaven, as Martha's was at the beginning, as Luke presents her; she served, but grumblingly, complainingly, criticisingly. The one who had chosen the good part is here. We want John's finishing touches; John's Martha is to abide, and his Mary too. Luke's Mary began well, and that is the secret of what we get here -- she sat and listened to what Jesus said. But now she has got something herself, that is to say, John's Mary is the great result of the Lord's administrative service, so that she has something; she is found measuring things, all of which is in keeping with what I am saying; she is a woman who can weigh things and select what is needed and so we have this ointment kept by her for this great occasion. It cost her much, but she has it, and she has it at the right time; and in it she provides this fragrance for the One she loves, and all those present share in it --
{275}
"the house was filled with the odour". What can be a greater objective, dear brethren, for any of us than service of this kind? I am speaking of it now, not as accrediting her, but as accrediting Christ into whose hands the Father has given all things.
Then finally, in chapter 20, we have the continuation of this in the sense of confidence -- "The Father loves the Son" -- He has the utmost confidence in Him. There is no reserve in the Father's giving to the Son, it is "all things" without reserve. There is to be correspondence in the ministers with this; that is, there is to be confidence, there is to be that which the Lord can trust, dear brethren; the more there is of it, the more we shall have, for it is "to every one that has shall be given" @Luke 19:26. So that the point in chapter 20 is to bring about correspondence with Christ in the sense of trustworthiness, so that things can be given over without any restraint. I do not know of anything more assuring for servants, than that the Lord hands things over without any restraint, He leaves it with you. How blessed to have the sense of this. 'What you do', He says, 'I will support'. Whoever's sins you remit, I will do it too -- "they are remitted to them", verse 23. I may go about visiting the brethren clumsily, but I have in mind that *sins should be remitted*; the Lord has intimated that what I do, *He* will do. I want to think of how He did that, how He remitted sins. What a great position to be in, to exercise administratively the grace of heaven in regard to one who has sinned; so that we know from the Lord that, if we do it, He will do it. Who can tell what He will do in the meantime, so that there may be the carrying out of His promise -- who can tell what He will do with that sinner in the interval so that he may indeed be worthy of forgiveness? But forgiveness is put first here, in keeping with the great position, for surely remission is the great thought! The end of the dispensation is not to be any less than the beginning of it, and, while Luke says much about forgiveness, he does not
{276}
say anything like this -- he does not put it into the hands of the saints to forgive without any restriction, whereas John does. It is to bring about in the ministers, in those who serve, in those who are responsible in this world, *a state that can be trusted*; so that, "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted" -- the Lord says. Sometimes the Lord has to bear much in carrying out this promise, but He never fails to make good the judgment of His people in regard to these matters.
That is what I had in mind, dear brethren, that the end should be as the beginning. God presents perfection, and He will bring it about, in correspondence with the beginning.
{277}
THE CITY OF THE LIVING GOD
@Ruth 3:15; @Ruth 4:1,2; @Nehemiah 11:1,2; @Zechariah 12:5 - 8
I wish to speak this evening about a city, as I may call it in the language of Scripture -- "the city of the living God" @Hebrews 12:22, and how it is to be apprehended in its setting in the purpose of God, and how it is to be brought down to our apprehension and practice in the present time. Scripture always applies to what may be regarded as the present time in any given period; what may be designated the present time is governed by present truth, and that present truth is supported, the bearing of Scripture is always upon it.
So in regard to this great subject of the city of God, it comes in after man has built his city or cities. The city that Cain built, was called after the name of his son (@Genesis 4:17), that is the first city mentioned, and the second is built by Nimrod. These afford us the features of the cities of this world. They are all in view in the Apocalypse, where we have mention of "the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified", @Revelation 11:8. The cities of the world all bear in that direction. They are to be apprehended *spiritually* in their fulness in the future as seen in the world's city, which is *spiritually* Sodom and Egypt. It is well for young people to bear that in mind, so that they may not be deceived by what the world's city affords. The Lord's supper, which is intended to appeal to our hearts, is in the midst of that city as it were. It was first instituted by the Lord in the city of Jerusalem. From the Lord's own remarks we learn that Jerusalem embodied all the features of wickedness at that time. He was about to be crucified in it, the culmination of all wickedness was the crucifixion of the Lord of glory; and the Lord instituted His supper there, that is, it was at the wickedest time, and *where* the murderous spirit was. This is not to be
{278}
confined in our thoughts to great cities, but in small cities, towns, villages and hamlets, this murderous principle enters into all. So that young people are to be warned by the terrible indictment of the Spirit of God in the Revelation, where the two witnesses of Jesus lay in that city dead for three days and a half, and the character of it is expressed in those words, "spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified" -- *our Lord*. All this is suggested to us as we partake of the Lord's supper and the Lord's supper is the Supper of *our* Lord.
Well now that city begins with Cain and comes down through Nineveh which Nimrod built, and it is worked out today as it has never been worked out before. It is a city period in the history of men, and God by His Spirit is bring an anti-type before us. There has been a great revival in interest in regard to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, we have come to that. It is in the distance literally, but we have come to it in a spiritual sense, "the *heavenly* Jerusalem" @Hebrews 12:22 it is called, as over against "the great city" of which I spoke. And that is the burden of what I have in mind, that we should understand that we are inhabitants of it, that we live in it. The book of Nehemiah shows that it was not much in favour even among returning Israel, the obligations of it were somewhat irksome to many of them; and so it is today.
Now Genesis, whilst affording light to us by example as to the world's city, also introduces the city of God which He had prepared for His people, not that He had promised it, but He prepared it for them -- that is the comment of @Hebrews 11. "And if they had called to mind that from whence they went out, they had had opportunity to have returned; but now they seek a better, that is, a heavenly". That is the comment by the Spirit of God on the faith of that period. We may well emulate this, dear brethren, "now they seek a better [country], that is, a heavenly", @Hebrews 11:16.
{279}
The words "better" and "heavenly" are leading words in Hebrews, they are significant indeed, for a better country is a heavenly country. All the better things, are heavenly things. And so God was not ashamed to be called their God, having prepared for them a city. Genesis brings before us the heavenly side, and then we have examples which we have already noticed in Beer-sheba, the city of "the well of the oath", suggesting that we come to the city where all these great thoughts of God are confirmed to us and realised by us. We do not attach ourselves to any nation on earth. We are all very prone to be national, but it is a deadening thing spiritually. We have to watch it. In some countries it is stronger than in others, but it is innate in all of us. Regard for 'my own native land' is a strong sentiment, but it is leaven. If you apply it to the earthly nation, the land they sought is a heavenly; the Scriptures are full of it, a land which the eye of God is upon from the beginning of the year to the end of it, a land of waterbrooks, hills and valleys, and vineyards and olive yards, "whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass" @Deuteronomy 8:9. The wealth of the land is continually in the mind of the Spirit in Scripture, so as to allure us away from our earthly moorings, that we should be like Abraham, and get out from our country and kindred and father's house, that we may learn to cut the links of nature, and whilst recognising all that is to be recognised according to God, we may live in the heavenly. After all, the links of nature are easily snapped and at best our years are few here. And so Beer-sheba, the well of the oath, is suggestive of the city of God, where things are confirmed to us livingly, in which we are assured of the promises of God and the purposes of God, where Jacob offered up sacrifices. He was leaving the land, under the government of God, the God of his father Isaac, that is Christ risen from the dead, but he went down to Egypt in that light, and that is our position, Christ risen and glorified, "in him
{280}
is the yea, and in him the amen" @2 Corinthians 1:20, everything is Yea and Amen in Him.
Well now, this subject is cumulative, as you will understand, as every subject is in Scripture. You would expect it to appear in Boaz, who is one of the great ancestors of David, who as we know slew the giant, cut off his head and took it to Jerusalem. So Boaz, as Ruth has disclosed to him what is in her mind in a most seemly manner, says to her, "Bring the cloak". This is a challenge to each of us, if we are to be in this city we are to be persons of measure. All the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be persons of measure. So here, Boaz says to Ruth "Bring the cloak that thou hast upon thee, and hold it", @Ruth 3:15. A garment indicates our measure. Properly speaking garments are made to measure, and her measure is detected here. Sometimes we hear of people being invited on privileged occasions to what are called conferences (although the name is hardly applicable, but we understand what is meant). One of the greatest qualifications in such persons is measure, what they can take in, and what they can give out, so that others may get the good that there may be. This is an important feature, beloved brethren, in the things of God. For we are to be, not only receiving vessels, but containing vessels to minister, vessels, with which to pour out; @Exodus 37:16. In the first directions in @Exodus 25:29, there were to be goblets and bowls for pouring out. There could be no pouring out without something contained in the vessels. As in @John 2, the water was drawn out and it was wine, it was water turned into wine by the power of Christ. So that it is important to have measure. The epistle to the Romans, which is an initial epistle, but foundational, requires that *each* is to know his own measure, and to minister according to his measure of faith, God tests us as to this.
Boaz says, "Bring the cloak, that thou hast upon thee, and hold it". That is the test put to you -- indicating your measure, your size, how much you can hold.
{281}
The brethren will test us as to this, if we have been privileged in any way. Suppose we take Paul as an illustration, he was caught up to the third heaven on one occasion, fourteen years before he spoke of it, as far as is recorded. He says, "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows) such a one caught up to the third heaven. And I know such a man ... that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter", @2 Corinthians 12:2 - 4. He kept all that, he contained the impressions so that he could speak of them fourteen years later. That is the thought, dear brethren, the brethren will test us, ask us questions; have we anything to gladden their hearts? It is a question of our measure, whether we are able to take in a little milk or some strong meat to carry back to the brethren.
Now Ruth was required to take the garment upon her and hold it. How large was it? It does not simply say that Boaz filled it up or whether it was small or large, but we are told that he measured into it six measures of barley. It was that size anyway, and she carried it away to her mother-in-law. Now that is a very important suggestion for us all at a meeting like this, it is a question of what I can take in, for myself of course, but for others. Anything I receive from the Lord is for myself, but it is also for others, it is for the assembly, it is to be shared on the principle of mutual feelings and affections. After Boaz did this he laid it on her and she was to carry it to her mother-in-law, and he went into the city. This does not refer to notes. I am not objecting to notes at all, they help the mind, but this is not a thing you carry in notes, the idea is what you bring according to your own capacity spiritually. He laid it on her, it was a burden. That is another matter of importance, christians are to be burden-bearers in love according to their measure, carrying things for ministration to others.
{282}
Now having said this, Boaz, it says, went into the city; chapter 3:15. *He* did it, not Ruth, the pronoun is masculine; that is confirmed by the context. Her going in was not a matter of much consequence, the matter is now in his hands. She carried the portion to her mother-in-law as a matter of simple love and care for a loved one. Boaz had much to do, he was taking on a great matter, and that great matter involved no less than the work of redemption typically. We have to understand, dear brethren, how the Lord Jesus took up matters. If the assembly came into His way as it did, in the love and self-sacrifice of His people for one another, as typically illustrated in Ruth, then He says, I will have that, I want that -- that is the idea, and indicates what the Lord thinks of the fruit of the work of God in His people as shown in Ruth and others like her, in their self-sacrificing love for others. The Lord says, as it were, That is Myself reproduced, I must have that. But as entering into the city he is taking up typically the great work of redemption and there must be no discrepancies at all, everything must be according to the light and order and intelligence that belongs to the city, and the gate of the city, that characterises the elders of the city; it is a question of intelligence. So the work of redemption is carried out in infinite intelligence, but according to this type, as arising out of what Christ found in His people. He found the assembly, the treasure, the pearl, and He gave all for that; and what it was to Him then, it is today. The brethren sitting in this room are equally precious to Christ as the saints were then. And what is precious to Christ reflects Himself. He goes to the utmost limit of sacrifice in perfect intelligence, to secure it and keep it.
Well now, in carrying these thoughts on to Nehemiah, a day of small things, we see in chapter 11 how feebly they were appreciated. Nehemiah was a leader, as Boaz was in this matter, and he says in chapter 2 that the city was the place of his fathers¬ sepulchres, that it
{283}
was lying waste and its gates burned with fire, and it caused the deepest feelings of grief in the heart of Nehemiah. As we may remember, Nehemiah was not an official, formally set up and sent by God, his service is the outcome of his own feelings. He may be taken as a type of any christian that has felt the need and turned to God about it. Do what your hand finds to do and God is with you, that is the principle of Nehemiah. He speaks of it as the city of his fathers¬ sepulchres. It is not that to us, it is "the city of the living God", that is not a city of sepulchres, it is a city of living people. Matthew presents Jerusalem typically as turned from a city of sepulchres into a city of living people. He says "the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many", @Matthew 27:52 - 53. That is what it becomes, and so it represents the city of the living God today, the heavenly Jerusalem.
Well now in the early chapters of Nehemiah he says that the city was large, but few people were in it; chapter 7:4. Does it not appeal to our hearts? -- there are only a few in Jerusalem now, I mean down here. Jerusalem above is for the moment an abstract thought in its bearing, it means the whole assembly, the assembly glorified, we have to grasp that thought. In the meantime there are but few down here, as it was in Nehemiah's day, the city was built in great weakness under great difficulties. But nevertheless the walls were built and completed, the gates were set up, all the outcome of the faithful devotedness of one man. What an incentive for us in our time! The principle in Nehemiah is to feel things before God, then do what you can. God will make use of you. "She hath done what she could". @Mark 14:8 The woman who did that will be spoken of wherever the gospel is preached. So that Nehemiah says sorrowfully, "the city was large and great; but the people in it were few". Nehemiah took
{284}
on much. After the wall was built he gave his brother Hanani with Hananiah charge over Jerusalem. Hanani is commended as a faithful man, he was a man who loved. That is the kind of thing, a faithful man set over the city by his brother. The government of the city is thus provided for in faithfulness, and however few the inhabitants now, it is yet to be fully inhabited. A great thought, dear brethren, it stimulates one to think of it. Even in the days of Hezekiah, when the Assyrians came up to attack the Israelites, and asked how many riders he could put on horses, it was only a few. But however few I cannot afford to be other than an inhabitant of Jerusalem; we cannot afford to be anything less than that, but according to this book the people preferred the country. In chapter 11, verse 1, we read, "And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem; and the rest of the people cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine parts in the cities". This is an appeal as to who will avail himself of the opportunity to dwell in Jerusalem instead of living in the country. I am not intimating, beloved brethren, that those in the suburbs round Belfast or any other city are in view here, but it may be taken as an illustration. The Lord, we are told, after He rose from the dead, went after two persons who were going away from Jerusalem. Jerusalem was indeed the wicked city that I have spoken of, but still God had not given it up -- in the mind of God it was still Jerusalem, and the apostles were enjoined to stay there until they were endued with power from on high. And here were two persons moving away from it. Mark tells us they were going into the country; generally speaking living in the country is not conducive to spirituality. The city is the place of exercise, where God specially sets His testimony, however wicked the city is. It is what we see in Elisha, after all his experiences he comes to Samaria, he goes to Carmel, then to Samaria where the evil was concentrated. That is the principle, that
{285}
is how the assembly is set here. Elders are ordained in cities, we do not read of elders ordained in the country. You will understand I am not speaking literally but in the spirit of it. God would set us where the evil is. He presents His testimony through us where the evil is, that is the principle of God's ways today. Jerusalem in Nehemiah is the city of the Living God in principle; it was built and it was to represent the full thought of God. I apprehend the walls were built on the site of the old walls. It is a city compact together whither the tribes go up. Things are not held lightly, things are taken on by feeling men. It was never intended to have a vast straggling city, things are to be held together, that is what the walls mean. The city was large but the inhabitants, the people that dwelt in it, were few. There is an appeal to the dwellers in the country to become inhabitants of Jerusalem. In the heavenly city in the future, the inhabitants will not vie with one another in their houses and their gardens, there will be one street only in that city. I cannot say, I dwell in the west end of that city; there will only be one street there, which means the saints are all on a level, if we love one another we rejoice in that. "Let the brother of low degree glory in his elevation, and the rich in his humiliation" @James 1:10, not exaltation in this world, according to the principles of it, but spiritually, the level is spiritual and nothing else. And that is what will remain eternally. It implies dignity, not socialism or communism.
Well now in Nehemiah's time, the privileges of Jerusalem were laid hold of, so that it says in this chapter, verse 1, "the rulers of the people dwelt" there. Thank God for that! Surely they shall give a lead, for the leaders amongst the people of God are not merely marked by intelligence and strength, but feeling and affection and appreciation of divine things. Therefore these leaders are to be emulated, they dwell in Jerusalem. Then there is the principle of one in ten dwelling in Jerusalem, the other nine went out into
{286}
other cities. It is evidently recorded here to show the state of things that existed. Are we content to be one of those nine that are willing to stay out of Jerusalem? You can do it by putting your home and family and business first. Whereas the dweller in Jerusalem puts the interests of Christ first, he is at every meeting of the saints possible, he never willingly misses one. Anna would never miss a meeting, she was day and night in the temple, she would not think lightly of staying away from a meeting. One has often pictured the saints at Jerusalem. Peter and six others went off fishing one night. If you had asked Mary Magdalene where Peter and the sons of Zebedee were that day, if she knew she would tell you regretfully, she would feel their absence. Can we afford to come under that opprobrium? To be absent, like Thomas, when such great things are happening? Anna would never be absent. She dwelt in Jerusalem, and not only was she in the temple but she spake of the Lord to all them that looked for redemption in Israel. How Jerusalem would come into her mind, how she would convey that to those to whom she spoke! It is a somewhat wholesome thing to take account of the progress of persons nominally dwelling in Jerusalem. Who are the persons at the prayer meeting? See how many of them are there. Those who are habitually absent are not really inhabitants of Jerusalem, not characteristically such.
Then it goes on to say (verse 2), "And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem". They blessed them. You sometimes hear it said, Miss So and So is never absent, she is always at the meeting. Such persons come into peculiar blessing, they have a unique place in the affections of the saints. "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning", that is, if I forget the brethren, forget the assembly. How many prefer the night school to the meetings -- not that I would make little of one qualifying to earn a living, but "If I forget thee
{287}
O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning", @Psalm 137:5. I may become a great man in this world but of what value is that if I have forgotten Jerusalem? We cannot afford to do that, no one can afford to acquire anything at the expense of Jerusalem. So it says here, "The people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem". I love that blessing, the people *blessed* them.
Now I just want briefly to say a word as to the passage in @Zechariah 12. It was a day of revival as it was in Nehemiah; he and Haggai are prophets of revival, and Zechariah is occupied with that. First he says, "And the leaders of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength through Jehovah of hosts their God". How we should realise that, how the Lord would maintain those who lead, and the saints have a portion of meat in due season. How they value the inhabitants of Jerusalem, they are supported by those persons at Jerusalem.
Then in verse 8 we are told what marked them. "In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David". See what men they become. You take the young men and women that attend the meetings, see what they become. They become as David. Do not we need such persons, who stand upon their feet in a crisis, who defend the truth, standing by the leaders? These are the persons, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, those that dwell in the city, they shall be as David, a great military warrior, without equal in the Old Testament: saints who are characteristically inhabitants of Jerusalem, shall be as David.
The Lord is appealing to us in this way, as to whether we are seeking money or position in this world at the expense of Jerusalem, the holy city, that is, the assembly in the sense in which it is available at the present time. The Lord would appeal to us so that we may be characteristically inhabitants of Jerusalem.

*Pages 288 - 457 - "The Liberty of Sonship". Notes of Meetings held in Bournemouth and London, 1935 (Volume 128)*.
THE LIBERTY OF SONSHIP (1)
@Galatians 1
J.T. The epistle to the Galatians indicates the enemy's tactics as designed to rob the saints of the truth as delivered to the saints; and it is thought that as so much of the most exalted character of truth has been before the saints, the enemy will not fail to seek to rob us of it. The liberty involved in christianity was introduced by way of example, in the Lord's ministry, as also by teaching; but it was introduced by Himself looking on to Pentecost. In going through the cornfields on the sabbath He indicated that there was liberty to do that without the need of explanation. @Mark 2:23 says His disciples "began to walk on, plucking the ears". They thus seized the liberty the Lord introduced; but this liberty of theirs was immediately attacked, and the Lord defended what they did. *His own* action was not attacked, except indirectly, but what the disciples did, in appropriating what was available, was attacked. In the Lord's defence of the position, we have what may pass before us in looking at this epistle, that the defence implies the stabilisation of the position, so that this epistle may be regarded as a charter for us. The understanding of this, and the acceptance of the liberty that is implied, is required to maintain in character what the Spirit gives to us, what we may regard as treasure. The more exalted the ministry, as in the days of David in 1 Chronicles, the more the stress on the receptacles, the treasuries -- not only treasures, but treasuries -- in the house; for the Lord would remind us that each is to be a treasury, holding and carrying through what he has in the power of the Spirit, not *merely* in a doctrinal way -- of course, we are to be right in doctrine -- but
{289}
in the spirit of the truth, for the Spirit is said to be the truth, @1 John 5:6.
In making these remarks one would refer to what the Spirit indicates as to the christians addressed in this epistle, the Galatians. They were evidently of a fickle mind. The Cretans represent a certain feature of the flesh in a national way, and these Galatians represent the fickleness of the flesh. I believe they were of Gallic origin, a race of people that are known to be fickle and shallow, and ready to take in things quickly and to express their feelings, and as ready to give up what they have received, and to change their minds. These traits are not, however, simply racial, but as brought in and stressed in some race, are to call attention to what is in all of us; a certain fickleness and readiness to take in what is presented, as I may say, extravagantly, for the apostle says that they were ready to pluck out their eyes for him, and they received him like an angel of God, which was immoderate. Others came along and influenced them, too, and hence they were exposed to the enemy. It is important to mention that, because we have recently had evidence of this sort of readiness to take on things and to be influenced unduly by what is not of God. That is what I had in mind.
L.D.M. Is it a question then of how things are to be held in spite of influences? The apostle says that his apostleship was "through Jesus Christ, and God the Father" -- is that the secret?
J.T. Yes; you cannot carry these fickle traits into that realm. Things are all established in Christ risen. Then, moreover, there is the stress on apostolic authority in the opening verses, which is perhaps greater than in any other epistle; so that what is ministered is to be held. It says, "Paul, apostle, not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father". Men and man, and all that is implied in the words as regards natural and national traits, are left behind.
{290}
N.K.M. In the other epistles he refers to himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ, but here it is "through Jesus Christ". What is the significance of that?
J.T. It is the instrumentality by which his apostleship was effected, making it all the more imperative that it should be accepted and owned. The Lord had said to Peter, "I will make you ..." @Matthew 4:19 It is what the Lord had made Paul; his apostleship was through that means: "through Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised him from among the dead". It came about in that way, but it was not an apostleship of a subordinate character. Doubtless there were those who were apostles in a lesser degree, but no one's apostleship had more weight than his: "through Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised him from among the dead". The means of Paul's apostleship is striking here: God operated in Christ, in raising Him from the dead, and now He is operating in Paul. The ground is very firm and the authority involved great.
Ques. Would not this cut out the whole clerical system?
J.T. It would; it is ministerial ground; that is, if we go back to the types, it is the book of Exodus. There is to be no disregard of this authority, even as that of Moses and Aaron, whose personal history entered into what God presented in them. It says, "I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam", @Micah 6:4. God made that selection, and sent them before Israel; they were not only God's own selection, but His own formation. "Jesus Christ" here would mean the kind of Man employed. Moses and Aaron and Miriam, as has often been remarked, were very old, as we speak, when they were sent before Israel, and God committed Himself to them in sending them *before* Israel. Not that they went before in a physical sense, but they were in the mind of God, and under the formative hand of God, and under His discipline before.
M.W.B. Do you think that the apostle's object in
{291}
referring to his apostleship and to the resurrection of the Lord was to meet this fickle feature of the Galatians?
J.T. Yes. One is sensible in oneself of this fickle trait which marks the human race and I believe this branch of the Celtic race conveniently represents that, and here God presents His judgment of this feature. It is to remind us that we are all characterised naturally by that; and so strikingly was it the case with the Galatians that the apostle uses the word "wonder", as if to say, Even although I know well enough you are Gauls, and fickle -- even allowing for all that, I am surprised that you change your mind so quickly! Someone comes along with a measure of ability and a striking way of presenting things, and we are carried, not because of the value of the things in themselves, but by the manner of the presentation.
H.M.S. Was not the turning away of the Galatians here more serious than turning away from Paul? We read later that "all who are in Asia ... have turned away from me", @2 Timothy 1:15, but here the turning is "from him that called you in Christ's grace, to a different gospel".
J.T. It was; and in the reception of something additional to what they had received, there was a specious kind of opposition to the recognition of what had already been ministered, yet in a way so as not to be exposed in attacking it. To openly attack what has been received as of God, would discredit us; but assuming to recognise it, yet bringing in what is different; "a different gospel", as it says, is a specious way of overthrowing the truth.
Rem. Paul would even withstand that fickleness when it came out in Peter.
J.T. It is very suggestive that even the great apostle Peter manifested this very thing, and not one of us is immune. Certain came from James, and Peter was affected by that influence.
{292}
L.D.M. Paul has with him in Titus a concrete example of the production of his ministry.
J.T. We shall see that in our next reading, that there is the product of the ministry before them in Jerusalem where it was attacked. That is what Titus represents, and the second chapter is more formal in taking the matter in hand. The apostle went up, it says, "according to revelation", @Galatians 2:2. We may always look for that, that as an attack is made God will definitely take the matter in hand. The first chapter is Paul and his ministry, and his wonderment at these Galatians, the readiness with which they took on something different from what had been received by them as accredited of God.
D.L.H. Was not the whole character of the dispensation at stake just then?
J.T. Quite so. The liberty of christianity, as introduced by Christ, by example and in teaching, and as set out in the apostle's ministry, was being attacked. That is the thing. It was a surreptitious attack, not merely one person having a difficulty, but a regular attack as by an enemy, a warlike attack; so that there were those who entered in to spy out the liberty of christians, to rob christians of their heritage, and of their liberties. Hence the ground taken here is military, as you would expect, and these traits of the Galatians -- christians, of course -- are introduced here. I believe the Lord would help us to look into that, because, unless that is judged, we are exposed to this sort of thing and easily influenced.
H.E.S. Why does the apostle connect "all the brethren" with him?
J.T. It is to give authority, to give more weight to his remarks, and in addition to authority, the brethren would be sympathetic. Brethren are brethren, and if we have to question our brethren it is for their good. I think it is just to bring in the brotherly element. The Edomite element was at work. In defending the liberties
{293}
of His disciples, the Lord reminds the opposers of what David did, that he entered into the house of God -- he took that liberty -- and obtained what he needed from the priest. But then, there was an Edomite there. That was not accidental, it was the enemy's careful plan; Doeg was there and was ready. He spied out what was going on, spied out the liberty that God was encouraging in David, and the terrible consequence was the destruction of the priesthood. It was that Edomite -- and that is what the apostle has in mind here. It is bad, of course, to have the fickle, shallow disposition that marks the human race, but how serious to admit a Doeg! -- one that would creep in surreptitiously to spy out the liberties of the saints. David said, "I knew it" @1 Samuel 22:22. That is a word for us to be on the watch. He did not say anything to Doeg, but he knew what was there; he represents the christian who is alive to things, who has his eyes and ears open, so that the enemy does not get any advantage over him.
Eu.R. Is the "present evil world" here largely religious in character?
J.T. That is what is in mind, deliverance from it is "according to the will of our God and Father; to whom be glory to the ages of ages". The introduction is very fine and very wonderful -- the power of resurrection, and then "the will of our God and Father; to whom be glory to the ages of ages". What a vista rises up before the apostle's soul as to what deliverance into that world -- the Father's world -- really means for us!
Eu.R. The trouble was coming from Jerusalem which had crucified the Lord Jesus.
J.T. Jerusalem, "which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt", @Revelation 11:8. At this stage it is the world's city really.
C.O.B. Why the contrast in the emphasis on Paul's apostleship in this epistle, with the absence of any apostle, but the emphasis on God speaking "in Son", in Hebrews? @Hebrews 1:2
{294}
J.T. There is instruction in the contrast. Of course, the writer with great feeling and intelligence is about to speak of "the Apostle and High Priest of our confession", @Hebrews 3:1 and if it be Paul, as doubtless it was, with characteristic sensibilities he leaves out his own apostleship, as also in his address in the Philippian epistle. Where love prevails there is no need of stressing that, save for the sake of the doctrine. Here it is to give weight to what he is going to say.
Rem. To understand "through Jesus Christ, and God the Father" would set our feet on a rock.
J.T. What has been remarked is true, that it is a question of the kind of humanity viewed in Jesus Christ. There is nothing fickle or unstable about that; so much so that the apostle speaks of it as the foundation he laid at Corinth, "which is Jesus Christ" @1 Corinthians 3:11.
F.C.H. Does the "section of the bush" @Luke 20:37, referred to by Luke, with regard to Moses¬ apostleship, bear on this, in connection with the resurrection of the dead? In our Lord's reference to the section of the bush, it is said that Moses called God "the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob", suggesting that he had apprehended the principle of resurrection.
J.T. The Lord so clothes what is stated in "the section of the bush". There are two sections mentioned by the Lord -- the "section of the bush" and the "section of Abiathar the high priest" @Mark 2:26. The "section of the bush" implies the power of God. "I am the God of thy father", He says; that is, He brings Abraham to mind.
F.C.H. In Luke, Moses responds to God, and calls Him "the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob". Is that the idea that Paul brings in here, bringing the truth of resurrection to bear upon them?
J.T. That all enters into apostleship, because the history of apostleship extends far back. It is not a matter that began yesterday; hence the ages of Moses
{295}
and Aaron are mentioned in Exodus. Miriam is added in the prophet Micah, to bring out the history that precedes leadership, so as to make it what it should be, authoritative and confirmatory. God is in mind in that connection, and then the foundation, "Jesus Christ". It is the kind of Man, that is, what endures and stands the test of opposition, and then, "God the Father who raised him from among the dead". I believe that enters into the "section of the bush" -- the power of God.
E.G. Is there a special appeal to the affections when it says, "who gave himself for our sins"? Later on, he says, "who has loved me and given himself for me".
J.T. It is the great mark of His consideration for us, so that we might be delivered from "the present evil world".
Ques. In people receiving the truth of the gospel, should we consider their national characteristics in dealing with them, before committing ourselves to them?
J.T. It is well to notice the characteristics of the people you minister to, as the Cretans, and the Galatians here, and the Corinthians. Each set had their own characteristics, and the apostle, in going to Corinth, calculated accordingly: what kind of people are these? Titus perhaps did not calculate as Paul would have done, but he reminds him what kind of persons the Cretans were. The apostle knew well enough what the Galatians were, and no doubt he took account of that in his ministry, and, after making due allowance for all that, he says, I am surprised you have turned aside so quickly.
P.L. The virtuous woman *considers* the field and buys it.
J.T. The consideration of the field is with a view to what you are going to sow in it, what use can be made of it.
A.F.M. Are Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus examples of this, suitable in their work at Corinth and no doubt elsewhere?
{296}
J.T. He brings in the other two for that purpose. "The Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus) ..." @2 Corinthians 1:19. He brings them in, a three-fold cord, in accord with what is foundational.
Eu.R. So salvation lies in coming into the appreciation of the unique character of humanity found in Jesus Christ and Him risen?
J.T. That is what stands over against the shallowness and fickleness of the race.
J.J. Do you think the incident in the synagogue in @Mark 3, following the cornfield, would show that these Galatians were in the grip of the legal system, whereas they should have been in liberty?
J.T. That is the way the truth stands in Mark. It is there the Lord alluded to "Abiathar the high priest". I do not know that he is called the high priest elsewhere, and that was an element in the Lord's mind to meet this attack. He knew what was in the synagogue, the man with the withered hand, and the reason of the murderous opposition and hatred of the leaders of Israel, and I believe He designedly alludes to "the high priest". We need that thought. It is the "section of Abiathar the high priest", and he was just a remnant of the priests, but he brought the ephod, that is, the means of getting to God according to His mind; not in the low religious way that is current, going with the fickleness we are speaking of, but getting to God according to His mind, and being there truly as priests.
J.H.L. With regard to the stressing of "God the Father", would that be because the opposition was against the revelation of God in that character?
J.T. The way the Spirit of God runs on in the end of the paragraph: "according to the will of our God and Father; to whom be glory to the ages of ages", is all to lift us up to that glorious platform in our minds, away from this wretched fickleness and shallowness that we are all conscious of, but perhaps sometimes fail
{297}
to judge, for christianity is not in this at all. We may have much attached to us which is not christianity at all.
F.G.W. Would the way the Lord Jesus handled Nicodemus in @John 3, and the woman in @John 4 indicate the conditions?
J.T. They are excellent illustrations. The one was hard soil -- a Pharisee -- and the Lord dealt with him accordingly. The other was hard soil, too, but of another kind -- looseness and depravity, and the Lord skilfully handled both cases, and they were both saved. It took a good while to save Nicodemus; he remained in the world of religion a good while, but he was taken out of it at the end. I think that illustrates the importance of considering our field, as has been remarked. The virtuous woman acquires the field, that is, an area in which to operate with a view to results. The Lord knew how to act in the field.
Ques. How does the principle of cursing come in today?
J.T. Although it enters into the period of christianity, it does not *characterise* it. In the end of Corinthians the apostle puts off the "Anathema" until the coming of the Lord, but here it is not put off. The thing was more serious apparently: "let him be accursed", and he repeats it. It is to deliver us from this shallowness and the light way in which we think of error. How easily it is passed over, making much of the persons and ignoring their doctrine.
Eu.R. There is a tendency with us to call the woman of @John 4 evil, and to think that there is something virtuous about the man of @John 3.
J.T. No doubt; if I am a cultivated man, I am especially apt to lean in that direction, but the Lord is not deceived by any outward appearances. The field is acquired and cultivated according to what may be there. After the opening remarks of the apostle in this chapter he speaks of his own feelings and what marked him in his early days. The types help us to understand
{298}
this, how God prepares His servants according to what they have to do, for He knows the field in which they are to operate. When Elisha was called he was operating in a field, ploughing. Moses and Aaron are intended to convey to us the operations and the time expended by God on His servants before they are sent out, and Paul stresses his own history here in that connection. God had in mind the field and the people he had to deal with, even these very Galatians and Gentiles they represented, so that Paul was thoroughly prepared in the school of God. He goes on to tell us: "But I let you know, brethren, as to the glad tidings which were announced by me, that they are not according to man. For neither did I receive them from man, neither was I taught them, but by revelation of Jesus Christ. For ye have heard what was my conversation formerly in judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it; and advanced in Judaism beyond many my contemporaries in my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my fathers. But when God, who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood, nor went I up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus". That is in brief what is set out in those three servants of God in the Old Testament, those who were sent before Israel, each of them over eighty years of age before they were commissioned. Here, the apostle refers to the fact that he was separated from his mother's womb, and called by God's grace in due course. God was operating in relation to him before, with a view to what He intended him to be.
G.A.v.S. Would you contrast that fixity of purpose resulting from spiritual formation by God, with the fickleness that is characteristic of what is set aside?
J.T. Yes. God took account of Paul from his
{299}
mother's womb. He was in God's mind, as he says, "God, who set me part even from, my mother's womb". Even when persecuting the assembly that was the attitude of God's mind in regard of this vessel. I am stressing this side because of the need of this in those who serve.
M.W.B. Then do you make a distinction between the *formation* of a vessel and the *education* of the servant? Does verse 15 refer more to the vessel? I was thinking the first forty years of Moses was not exactly the education of the servant, but rather the second forty years.
J.T. That is good; the vessel including everything, the physical and mental powers, what the man would be as a creature of God, and then the moral education. The field was in mind, I am sure, from the beginning, and so it is with each of us. A man is born into certain circumstances under the careful supervision of God; there is no accident about it. He says, "from my mother's womb".
P.T.F. In the case of Jeremiah, it was before he came forth from the womb that he was hallowed; @Jeremiah 1:5.
J.T. That is the idea, showing how far back God goes and with what watchfulness He prepares His vessels. John the baptist, as we have sometimes spoken of him, was affected in his mother's womb by the voice of the mother of Jesus. That was of God; he was a marvellous child, most exceptional, but it all indicates with what sobriety and care God is thinking of things, as over against our natural traits, and the fickleness and carelessness of parents in the training of young people.
A.F.M. Are these progressive thoughts, first, that he is set apart from his birth, then, called by God's grace, and then, God pleased to reveal His Son in him, that he might announce Him as glad tidings?
J.T. That is the order in which God operates in us and with us, and then the question arises, what will you do following on that? Paul says, "immediately I
{300}
took not counsel with flesh and blood, nor went I up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus". This is a principle that has been set out in the case of John the baptist. He was "in the deserts", we are told, "until the day of his shewing to Israel" (@Luke 1:80), for it is in view of what God is going to show. Here the apostle follows that principle; he says, "I went to Arabia". There was nothing there, no worldly attractions, as far as one can judge, but desert circumstances. Then it says, "and again returned to Damascus", where he was converted, where he was first seen as a christian by the saints. It is as if he were respectful of his local brethren. I believe all that enters into this. You may be sure that Ananias and the brethren at Damascus would notice the progress he was making, and the apostle's respect for Damascus is to be noted. The Lord had said, "enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do", @Acts 9:6. He had respect for that, and for the local brethren.
J.T.S. Do these suggestions enter into the life of Moses? It is said that "the boy wept" (@Exodus 2:6), and then later, when Moses moves, "he thought that his brethren would understand that God by his hand was giving them deliverance" (@Acts 7:25); but then, later, it says, "him did God send to be a ruler and deliverer", @Acts 7:35.
J.T. That is most interesting. Exodus is the great ministerial book, and in the New Testament we have the truth which is amplified in that book. In Exodus we get the great general thought of God as to ministers. In Genesis it is such as Abraham and Isaac and Jacob His prophets, as He calls them -- moving generally on their own initiative. In Genesis we see how God's work shows itself; but in Exodus how all must be entirely according to God's mind. It is the ministerial side in Exodus; and hence Moses as the great minister is in mind from the beginning; even as a
{301}
babe he wept. That is a very fine trait to carry along, the feeling that is proper to a minister; and then the deliberation with which he flees and sits by the well of Midian, and accepts the circumstances. It says that he "was content to dwell with the man" @Exodus 2:21, as much as to say that the flesh did not like it, but he overcame that. So with Paul when he went into Arabia, allowing no fleshly desires at all, and then he "again returned to Damascus", the place where he was first known as a christian. The brethren normally would say, Paul is getting on; he is not considering for the flesh, nor his business (applying it to ourselves), nor marriage relations, not considering for the flesh at all; he is denying the flesh. That is what I think Arabia means. Then he goes up to Jerusalem, not to see all the apostles or what was of God there generally, but to see Peter, "to make acquaintance with Peter".
G.A.v.S. In Arabia our spiritual exercises result in stability which is tested?
J.T. Yes. What can I stand in these circumstances? There is nothing for the flesh in them. Moses, it says, "was content to dwell with the man". Well, who was this man? He was a Midianitish priest, and his daughters were shepherdesses; Moses had been a prince in Egypt, and had been brought up in affluence and worldly glory, but he "was content to dwell with the man". That meant he was formed according to God, and had power for the disallowance of the flesh. He "was content to dwell with the man" and to keep his sheep all those years. Think of a man like Moses keeping sheep in the wilderness for forty years! But God watched over that, and in due course showed Himself to him, so that Moses is set up on the principle of the school of God, in the power of resurrection the "section of the bush" which the Lord interprets as meaning that God is the God of the living. It is a living state of things.
W.C.G. Would going into Arabia have in view the
{302}
deepening of the work of God in him, so that he might be able to render testimony at Damascus effectually and with spiritual vigour?
J.T. What he records here is for young brothers and for us all -- that he deliberately went into Arabia, where there would be nothing to minister to the flesh in him, and having remained there some time came back to Damascus. Thus the brethren would have opportunity of seeing how he was getting on.
A.J.G. Being alone with God would form him as a treasury for what God had entrusted to him.
J.T. That is good, and the revelation is *in* him This word alludes to what one has, what one can carry through. Did he carry this through in those years in Arabia? Did he carry it through as he came back to Damascus? Did he carry it through in Jerusalem? I believe that is the way to take this up.
G.A.v.S. Why does it say "his Son"?
J.T. It is the point, as we shall see, in this epistle. The liberty of christianity is bound up with the knowledge of the Son of God. It is liberty, but liberty of this kind. The revelation is *in* him, not *to* him, as in Peter's case, which is to bring out what we are saying as to the treasury, what is to be carried through.
C.S.S. Is it a question of persevering as seeing the Invisible so that divine results might come?
J.T. That is good -- holding the thing, God. "was pleased to reveal his Son in me", he says, and then he tells us what his own calculated course was with that precious treasure in his heart -- the revelation of God's Son. He goes into Arabia. Elijah had gone there, too, as we may say, but how different with him! He was cherishing in his heart his own grievance, intending to give up his commission, as if all had failed. Paul deliberately takes this course with such a treasure in his heart; he would prove daily how the flesh would assert itself, but he was giving no occasion to it. Wilderness
{303}
circumstances are a great advantage to the christian in the wearing down of the flesh.
P.L. Is the Lord the great Model for all His servants, for in Mark it says, "And there came a voice out of the heavens: *Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" @Mark 1:11, and then, immediately He is found in the wilderness?
J.T. Quite so; it was God's thought for Him. He does not go into it in that gospel of Himself, you will observe, it is not presented as His own act; it is the "the Spirit drives him out into the wilderness", which is important in view of what you have in mind; that it is God's thought that the minister is to be tested in that way, to bring out what is there. In every instance the Lord is perfect; it only brought out His infinite perfection, but it is not always so with us. It is God's thought for us, and the apostle learned from the Lord's example and from the example of John the baptist, that this is the way to go. So he says, "I went to Arabia".
Ques. Do you link Paul in Arabia with the formation of the vessel or the education of the servant?
J.T. It is the educational part. The formation of the vessel precedes that. It is God's work; we do not make ourselves.
Ques. Men like Moses and John the baptist were from their earliest days in sympathy, but Saul of Tarsus was in opposition, as he says, "ye have heard what was my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it; and advanced in Judaism beyond many my contemporaries in my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my fathers". Was it necessary that this beloved and peculiar servant should go that way?
J.T. Whilst God's work goes on and the vessel has been formed, I must see what I am capable of in spite of the fact that God has watched over one from his mother's womb, and see the lengths to which one may
{304}
go. It is to bring out what the flesh is. It was more reprehensible in the apostle himself than in any one.
E.J.McB. Would not a servant like that greatly appreciate the thought of the Man that was before God in contrast with himself as a man?
J.T. The more you apprehend "Jesus Christ" and then 'God's Son', the more will be your abhorrence of yourself, and to this end I believe God would direct us in our histories to see what one has been. It is not just flesh, but it is the flesh in me. Paul was speaking of what was in himself. It is a very wholesome consideration and helps us all the more to appreciate the grace that has delivered us, not only from the world, but from ourselves, and made us superior to all that now.
G.A.v.S. Would you say that is necessary before I could safely go up to Jerusalem?
J.T. I am sure the school of Arabia is necessary before we go there. Jerusalem is the place of religious influence -- one of the most powerful influences -- in a centralised form. The enemy took that way with John the baptist; the Jews sent certain leading men to him from Jerusalem, but he had been in the deserts before it, so that he was immune from their influence. It was the devil's way in sending distinguished persons from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? Are you the Christ? It was a fine opportunity for the flesh to show itself; Jerusalem was ready to own him, but he was proof against it. He says, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness" @John 1:23; and then, "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me" @John 1:26 - 27 -- very wonderful that. What ability John had acquired, what power over the flesh; he was utterly immune from such a suggestion as: We will make you anything you wish.
G.A.v.S. Would Jerusalem in that way be a test to us now?
J.T. Whatever it may be. Rome is no test to me, nor is Canterbury, but there are things that might
{305}
test me amongst the brethren, in the way of acquiring distinction; there are those who might give me distinction, who might recognise me, and naturally I would love to have that recognition. All that danger has to be taken into account, especially by young brothers.
F.W.W. Would this enter into the education of the servant with a view to local assemblies being established? We need stability in local assemblies.
J.T. Stability in local assemblies is involved here in what he says -- we have already alluded to it -- "but by revelation of Jesus Christ". We have the revelation of God's Son, but "by revelation of Jesus Christ" is the *kind* of Man, what one is amongst the brethren, and then, the revelation of God's Son in me shows the liberty I have. What treasure I have thus that I may convey to the brethren! There is however something beyond, for what I may say is not everything. As the apostle ministered he would convey -- as he did to the Corinthians, for instance -- that what he was saying was not everything, and a spiritual man there would discern that much more was behind what he was saying, although he might confine himself to certain phases of the truth to meet their condition. "Jesus Christ" suggests the kind of Man, and Paul says, I send to you my child Timotheus -- not my son but my child; it is the *kind* of young man that Timothy was. But he would say to them, so to speak, that the revelation of God's Son in me involves another world and all the treasures that enter into that; I can keep that, and the brethren are to understand that I have it, that it is not just what I am saying, but what I have inwardly.
J.T.S. Is that the idea in the word "portrayed" in chapter 3, that is, something more than what he had said?
J.T. Yes, "among you"; he says "crucified among you".
{306}
L.D.M. Arabia is mentioned again in chapter 4; what would be the import of that?
J.T. The allusion in chapter 4 is to the legal system. Chapter 4 has another setting, calling attention to the legal system, as already said, in contrast with the system of liberty into which we are brought, and as represented in Sarah.
P.L. In regard to the suggestion that servants thus educated become effective in localities, is that seen with Paul and Barnabas being at Antioch and teaching for one year? The Antioch brethren being marked by fasting would suggest that the Arabia features had been introduced by Paul into that company.
J.T. That is right; he and Barnabas taught them in the assembly for a year; Christ in character -- especially in Paul -- would be seen there: "Jesus Christ".
J.J. Would the mention of "James the brother of the Lord" with Peter show that also -- what was there?
J.T. Quite so. It is remarkable that he says, "I saw none other of the apostles". How he came to see James we are not told, or why it was he saw him. Were the other apostles absent? The inference is that he did not seek them out; he had just one thought in his mind -- to make acquaintance with Peter. I have no doubt that James coming into his acquaintance would be the Lord adding to that for him, but he did not go up to seek James. To have one thought in mind is a good principle to learn and cultivate, and God may do more than I expect for me.
J.J. Would you say a little as to the expression, "James the brother of the Lord"?
J.T. You can understand what it would be to Paul to meet him; what thoughts would arise in his mind! But I suspect he alludes to it to intimate that he was not there for natural reasons at all, not out of curiosity to see the brothers of Jesus. If he had gone for that he would have sought them out, but he went to make acquaintance with Peter. The other was incidental, but
{307}
we may be sure not accidental; it was God's provision for him.
C.A.C. Would there be any link with the revelation that had been made to Peter, and the revelation of God's Son in Paul?
J.T. Would you tell us further? Your thought is that there are two men together, one making the acquaintance of the other, each of whom had a revelation.
C.A.C. Would there not be a filling out of the thought of what was connected with the Son of God in putting the two together?
J.T. That opens up much. Peter, it will be observed, does not present the Son of God in his ministry, indicating just what we have remarked, that he was a treasury. He represents that side; and what was revealed to him he kept, apparently knowing that the time for that ministry had not arrived. Now there is one here come up to make his acquaintance, in whom the Son is revealed, and who has preached Him. He had preached Him at Damascus, so that one can understand what a fulness there would be in their conversation, in this meeting of those two men, the one the apostle to the Jews, the circumcision, and the other to the Gentiles. Have you that in mind?
C.A.C. Yes.
J.T. I am thankful for the thought. One can see what a meeting it was, fifteen days of intercourse between two such men.
H.D'A.C. Peter must have been greatly affected by such a visit.
J.T. Jerusalem never had such before. The queen of Sheba's visit is not to be compared with this! She came from the end of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, but here is a man in Jerusalem to whom the Father had made a revelation, and who had made his confession accordingly; and now another who himself has a revelation comes up to Jerusalem deliberately to see this man. What men they were!
{308}
G.A.v.S. Would all that tend to stability, and the visit of Paul to Peter be a practical test of the situation during those fifteen days of intercourse?
J.T. Yes; the next chapter will bring out the strength of the links formed between them. For, although there was a ripple in the beautiful communion they must have enjoyed, Peter's last word to us leaves no doubt as to his general thought of Paul. Brethren who are ministering should learn to value one another, to make personal acquaintance with one another, and in that way establish links that bear on the general testimony. This visit, I believe, under God's hand had a long outlook because of the two men involved. A personal link would be established, I am sure, between those two brothers, and was never broken.
D.L.H. Was there not a great point in the revelation of the Son in Paul, that he should be in full enjoyment and power of the liberty wherewith the Son makes free? "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free", @John 8:36. Was not the apostle Paul a peculiar vessel now to set forth that view of divine liberty in sonship?
J.T. That is true. Of course, it may be a little conjecture but I do not believe Peter had ever seen a man like Paul. He had seen the Lord, of course; I am not speaking of Him, but I do not believe he had hitherto seen a man in such holy liberty with God as Paul.
F.S.M. Of Peter, it says, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 16:17, but here, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me".
J.T. Here it is "*in*", and it is *God* who is pleased to reveal and this for a specific purpose: "that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations". The Father does not convey to Peter why He made the revelation to him, but God made it known to Paul why He revealed His Son in him. Peter said, "Thou
{309}
art the Christ, the Son of the living God" @Matthew 16:16, and the Lord says, "thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly" @Matthew 16:18. That was foundational. It was the Father acting, and the Son in consequence designating the foundation. But now you have in Paul, with the revelation of the Son in him, the kind of man that is to adorn the heavenly city, to impart its liberty to it. The names of the twelve are on the foundations, but they are in keeping with Paul, who represents that which shines in the heavenly city when it descends "out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God" @Revelation 21:10 - 11.
G.A.v.S. Is it that God was glorified in Paul as one who was the expression of the Son?
J.T. Through him sonship was unfolded, involving the liberty of the house: "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free" @John 8:36. The liberty which the Son gives is set out in Paul -- true liberty, and that is what the Lord would help us in.
{310}
THE LIBERTY OF SONSHIP (2)
@Galatians 2
J.T. This chapter indicates how God comes in, when conflict for the truth is being waged. The apostle says that he went up to Jerusalem "according to revelation", verse 2. The attack was made at Antioch, but God selected His own battle-ground, which is always important in conflict. Chapter 15 of the Acts shows what led up to this journey to Jerusalem. The Judaisers had begun their work at Antioch, but the settlement must be of a universal character, and so Paul and Barnabas go up to Jerusalem, "to the apostles and elders", it is said. In this being fourteen years after the events of the first chapter, after the previous visit, we have the suggestion that time brings its changes, for good or for ill, amongst us. It was a different Paul that went up this time, a Paul that had now acquired apostolic status with the others; but the principle of conspicuousness had obtained in Jerusalem in the meanwhile, which was not for good. So that there is a suggestion of what time is doing, and the effect it is having; and I think God's intent was to transfer the conflict to Jerusalem, not only in order that there should be a settlement of universal bearing, but that the *qualities* should be compared of what was obtaining at Jerusalem, and what was among the nations. Hence, by the presence of Paul and Barnabas and Titus in Jerusalem, the principle of comparison would come into evidence.
Eu.R. Do you distinguish between the conspicuousness of verse 6 of which Paul says, "for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing", and the conspicuousness in verse 9, where he says, "James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship"?
J.T. The latter allusion is to persons who were
{311}
"conspicuous as being pillars", which, of course, is a right thought; but the word "conspicuous", as entering into this setting, has its own meaning, doubtless bearing on the Judaisers and their arguments; for in advocating Judaism amongst the nations they would not fail to emphasise the qualities of their leaders.
H.E.S. Do you mean that one might be conspicuous according to God, or conspicuous as not according to God?
J.T. One might be conspicuous for reasons not spiritual. Why is a man prominent among us? The mere fact that he is prominent, is not enough.
P.L. Does the statement in the letter written from Jerusalem as referred to in @Acts 15:25: "our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ", suggest that what is conspicuous according to *God* is now in the ascendancy at Jerusalem in the recognition of those beloved brethren? Does that suggest spoil out of the battle that has been won?
J.T. Yes; and it would establish their distinction amongst the nations. The letter would convey that these dear men were owned as rightly worthy of the esteem of the saints: "our *beloved* Barnabas and Paul".
C.S.S. In the days of Nehemiah it is said that the principal men dwelt beside their brethren in Jerusalem; is that the thought?
J.T. They were principal men evidently for good reasons. It was a hardship in those days to dwell in Jerusalem, and it was creditable spiritually to dwell there. But in the days of @Acts 15, dwelling in Jerusalem implied -- at least, in the eyes of the Judaisers -- that a certain distinction accrued. The first allusion in verse 6 gives no reason for the conspicuousness of the persons; the apostle says, "But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat -- whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not
{312}
accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing".
G.A.v.S. Would you say that the conspicuousness in verse 6 was connected with a certain measure of fickleness in departing from, or easily following after something different from, what was proper to christianity as expressed in the first five verses of chapter l?
J.T. Well, I would not go so far as to say there was anything discreditable in their conspicuousness, but there is nothing advanced as to why they were conspicuous; they were not able to communicate anything to Paul. That, of course, is the test as to conspicuousness, whether there is anything to be communicated, what one has got.
Ques. Would that be illustrated by Samuel before the brethren in the house of Jesse? Eliab and the others did not contribute anything, but David came in as the one able to contribute. Samuel had to learn natural conspicuousness would not do.
J.T. Exactly; he was rather taken by the person of Eliab, that is, outward appearance: "Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him" @1 Samuel 16:6, he says. But then, why "surely"?
M.W.B. The appreciation of Jesus Christ as mentioned in chapter 1 would deliver us from recognising mere position.
J.T. That is the only kind of Man that can be distinguished according to God, but I may acquire distinction otherwise than by the graces of Christ and by the gifts that He bestows.
P.L. The thought is seen in the two pillars at the entrance of the house in @1 Kings 7, and also in "a pillar in the temple of my God", @Revelation 3:12.
J.T. I have no doubt that the end of chapter 1 gives us the two pillars. If heaven were to call attention to two men when Paul went up to see Peter I believe these would be the two. We have the pillars mentioned severally in @1 Kings 7, and their combined height in
{313}
@2 Chronicles 3. It is what a brother may be by himself, and what two together may be.
L.D.M. Do you think Stephen's burial in @Acts 8 marks an epoch in the assembly's history? The saints are scattered "except the apostles" @Acts 8:1, and then Saul is introduced. The apostles remaining in Jerusalem would have a bearing on what is before us now, as over against the high level brought in by Paul in ministry.
J.T. Yes; their remaining at Jerusalem implied, as the sequel shows, a stunted state of things. They might have left. The Lord had said that if they were persecuted in one city they should flee to another, which they did not do. No doubt there was a clinging to Jerusalem because of its prestige, and no doubt too they exposed themselves in staying there, but God was with them; He did not forsake them. But the growth at Jerusalem after that period was not what it had been. There was growth, of course, but the soil had lost its richness. God was, as it were, forced to continue there, but the freshness of growth from that point onwards, passes to the Gentile world. I believe Titus represents this. Paul says, "taking Titus also with me"; there were three. Titus was a Greek, and was the representative of Paul's work, so that the conflict is met by the results from work done. What could they bring forth in Jerusalem to compare with Titus? There were conspicuous men there, and there were men that were conspicuous for a good reason, but then, why should the word "conspicuous" be there at all?
P.L. Would this conflict in values be seen in the house of Saul growing weaker and weaker, and the house of David stronger and stronger?
J.T. Just so. There was the thought of going up in the second book of Samuel, and great as was the failure in David at the first attempt to bring up the ark, yet there was growth. There was that in David that could not be matched in the house of Saul. It becomes a question of quality, not merely teaching and
{314}
the truth developed, but the quality of the result of it. The city as it comes out in Revelation, is the expression of excellence of quality.
Rem. What Titus had was not outward in the flesh.
J.T. Not at all. He was not compelled to be circumcised, the Judaising spirit was not so strong as to insist on that. The word "conspicuous" means that outward appearances had a place, and the whole trend of the attack was to have appearances, "to make a fair shew in the flesh" @Galatians 6:12.
Eu.R. Of the overcomer in Philadelphia it says, "him will I *make* a pillar in the temple of my God" @Revelation 3:12. Is that the principle of making of which you were speaking?
J.T. Quite so, what one would value. If you are that now, it indicates that you value the thought of being a pillar, and I think that is the idea in the recompense to the overcomer, that it is what he values.
P.H.H. Is your thought that the bringing up of Titus would show the value of what Paul laid before them privately? Why does it say that he laid these glad tidings before them privately?
J.T. By bringing forward what he had, which was so excellent in the way of teaching, he might have forced a certain feeling, and the enemy might take advantage in a suggestion that there was something better with Paul, and so cause a cleavage. It is an allusion to the skill of love, for a cleavage at this juncture would have been a defeat. That is what the enemy sought, to bring about a cleavage between Jerusalem and what God was doing among the nations, and so the apostle uses great skill. We see that principle with Aquila and Priscilla when they took Apollos "to them"; they did not challenge his statements in public. I have no doubt Titus was selected as a particular product of Paul's ministry, but a comparison of the facts presented in @Acts 15 will show that Paul and Barnabas themselves were wonderful samples of the work of God. A serious
{315}
crisis was on, and they did apparently what they could in Antioch to stem the tide of opposition, but God ordered it that they should go up to Jerusalem. That is in effect how the matter stood, that the battle ground was to be at Jerusalem. No doubt they would have gained the day at Antioch, but the conflict was transferred to Jerusalem; and on the way up, they are not overwhelmed with the battle they would have to wage, though undoubtedly they were quite aware that the opposition would be strong. But it was to be faced in its own sphere; it was ordered that Judaism might have what advantage it might seek. God knew well enough that the materials on the side of the truth were sufficient to be overwhelming; He would make them so; and, hence, the revelation. That is something to be noted; that God, as it were, said, It is not to be here at Antioch, it is to be at Jerusalem. That would mean a great test to Paul, I am sure; it was no simple matter to go up and contend for the truth where the opposers were surrounded by ancient settings to buttress them; but faith depended on God.
F.C.H. Does @Acts 12 throw any light on the condition of things in Jerusalem: they were praying in the house, but were not prepared for the voice of Peter?
J.T. It does. From chapter 7 a stunted condition of things ensued, and that is seen in the house of Mary the mother of John Mark. These three men knew that the conflict would be severe; we may be sure of that, but they go up in buoyancy. It says first of all in @Acts 15:2, "A commotion therefore having taken place" -- commotion, which is only like so much smoke, is the sure result of an attack -- "and no small discussion on the part of Paul and Barnabas against them, they arranged that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others from amongst them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question. They therefore, having been set on their way by the assembly, passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion
{316}
of those of the nations. And they caused great joy to all the brethren", verses 2, 3. You may be sure that this would greatly disconcert the enemy. They were not occupied with the conflict, but with what *God was doing* -- the surest way to victory.
P.L. They would take encouragement in passing through those quarters in the way the Lord had been into them. In the district of Tyre and Sidon the Lord secured a choice bit of material for the assembly, in the Syrophenician woman, and a worshipper for the Father in Samaria. Would that be fruit from the gentiles?
J.T. That is very good -- the quality is your point? "O woman, great is thy faith" @Matthew 15:28, said the Lord to the Syrophenician; it is the quality. And what the Samaritan woman effects shows her quality. So, on their way up, they related the conversion of the nations, and caused great joy among the brethren. That would indicate that they were not oppressed; that they were not unduly occupied with the conflict, but with what God was doing, and it is what God does that triumphs. Whatever may be on the way, the end as regards Israel and Jacob is, "What hath God wrought!" @Numbers 23: 23. That is what we are engaged with. These men go up in this buoyancy, and "being arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, and related all that God had wrought with them". This is all very auspicious because the assembly is in the forefront here; things are never right if it is not. The assembly received them, that is, the love side; assembly conditions indicated the underlying state of things; whatever was going on at Jerusalem, the assembly was there and received these men.
P.L. Is it like David in the midst of battle, distributing the spoil in localities where he had been found? On the way up these men are distributing the spoils of divine victory.
J.T. Carrying into those territories what Christianity
{317}
really is, the positive side of things. I believe that is the salvation of our position, not meeting things merely by doctrine, but bringing forward what God is doing. The assembly was there, and assembly conditions ensure the recognition of what God is doing. Then, the opposers who take part are "some of those who were of the sect of the Pharisees, who believed" @Acts 15:5; it does not say simply that they were Pharisees, but they were of a sect, as if they had never lost that thought, carrying it into the realm of faith outwardly.
H.D'A.C. Was that a sect inside the church -- that they carried through into the assembly what they had been outside?
J.T. Yes, and the Lord had warned the disciples against, the "leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" @Matthew 16:6. Then it says, "And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter. And much discussion having taken place ..." Peter makes his remarks, and when he had finished, "all the multitude kept silence and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders which God had wrought among the nations by them". That is the atmosphere in which the matter is settled. It is a very important matter in conflict, to keep to what God is doing; maintaining right doctrine always, but keeping to what God is doing; the work of God abides. The presence of Titus, a Greek, in Jerusalem at that time, is an outstanding thought. What will they say about this brother? We can understand how Titus would be invited to the houses of the saints. What will they say about him?
D.L.H. Was not Titus a kind of test at Jerusalem, whether the saints there would recognise the work of God amongst the gentiles?
J.T. That was the intent, and there was a certain danger in bringing him there, because the enemy might gain the day in insisting that he should be circumcised; but he was not.
{318}
D.L.H. He was a sort of object lesson, like the little child the Lord put in the midst.
J.T. If you had been there, you would have said, What about this young man Titus? Have we anything like him here? A reasonable brother would say, We may as well face this matter, because there is something going on among the gentiles that is at least equal to what we have here. That is to say, the work of God is the last word.
H.D'A.C. There was a private interview held with the apostles, @Galatians 2:2.
J.T. That was out of consideration for them.
H.D'A.C. And in that private interview Paul indicated to them what they needed to know, the gospel of the glory that he preached. He said that they did not communicate anything to him, but were they not greatly enlightened and helped by the way Paul presented things?
J.T. You would expect that. He says, "I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations, but privately ..." He did not take the attitude of teaching, but of laying out the thing. You can understand how he would unfold the truth; he calls it, "the glad tidings which I preach among the nations". One would love to have heard him!
C.A.C. He would recognise all that was the product of the Lord's personal service, as seen amongst the apostles, and in a sense, was prepared to submit what he had to the choicest tribunal that was available.
J.T. There was, as he says, the laying out of the truth: "I laid before them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations". Then he says, "but neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised" (verse 3); he was evidently the example of the work of God amongst the nations which greatly aided in the matter.
Rem. Peter shows himself to be in line with that
{319}
in what he says, "But we believe that we shall be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they also", @Acts 15:11.
A.S.L. Bringing Titus up uncircumcised brought matters to a crisis. The question would be raised, Is this man to be circumcised or not?
J.T. Paul stresses that he was not compelled to be circumcised. Titus was taken up to Jerusalem specially, but they did not compel him to be circumcised. That was a victory. Titus was intended to be a test. Timothy was circumcised on account of the Jews in a certain place, but he did not do that here. If he were considering for compromise, he might have had him circumcised and brought up. It was evidently a deliberate matter and in keeping with the revelation.
F.J.F. Does that mean that the ministry connected with the heavenly system preceded and set aside that which was connected with the earthly Jerusalem?
J.T. That is what was proceeding. From chapter 7 onwards in the Acts, the gentile is in mind as the field of God's operations. Jerusalem was really losing its richness as a soil, great and glorious as was the work at Pentecost. In fact, the apostles might legitimately have abandoned the place in the end of chapter 7, but they remained in Jerusalem, and the work went on there, and there were results, although their position was precarious. The prayer meeting in Mary's house would indicate that, as has been remarked.
W.C.G. Titus was circumcised in heart and spirit without being circumcised in the flesh.
Ques. Does the uncompromising stand taken by the apostle indicate the importance of what was at stake the whole truth of the glad tidings?
J.T. Yes; it was a pitched battle. It is well to have the conflict in mind; the enemy had already taken the initiative in taking it to Antioch. The result might have been more favourable to the truth at Antioch because of the surroundings, but God says, as it were, Difficult
{320}
as Jerusalem may seem to be, you go there. This is God's matter. It is well to take that into account in any conflict, that at some particular time God takes a definite hand in it, and selects His own battlefield, however difficult it may seem to be. He said in effect to David, when attacking the Philistines the second time, You go behind them and wait for the sound in the mulberry-trees. But what sound? The sound of marching: that is, God is moving now. That is the point in the "revelation" here, that God is moving, and however great the opposition, faith says, If God is moving, there is only one result and that is victory. It was a very great victory to carry Jerusalem with Paul, for that was the result.
Eu.R. In referring to the assembly conditions at Jerusalem, have you in mind that there was a vessel there in which God could operate in that way? Everything was settled in an open and deliberate way, and would carry the confidence of all universally.
J.T. That is right.
E.J.McB. It would remind one of the conflict that Elijah had in @1 Kings 18. He allowed the enemy to choose the conditions, and when their men were gathered together, he showed that the power was with God and not with man.
J.T. Quite so. Bring them *all*, he said in effect to Ahab -- the prophets of Baal and of the Asherah. Well, they all came; but the battlefield was selected by Elijah, that is, mount Carmel.
P.L. Would you say that the revelation answers a little to the captain of the Lord's host appearing to Joshua, and then God chose the field of battle at Jericho?
J.T. Yes, it was straitly shut up. It was a fortified place. God attacked the world at its strongest point. The Lord says, "Now is the judgment of this world" (@John 12: 31) -- it was at Jerusalem.
Ques. Would you say that the issue at stake was
{321}
"our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus", in contrast to the bondage that the Judaisers would again bring these saints into?
J.T. That is what I thought we might see in this inquiry. This epistle is a sort of charter of our liberties. It is God allowing the truth to be attacked, and in the victory we have as it were a charter which stands. The liberty of christianity perhaps had not been so clearly set out hitherto; in this epistle, embodying what happened at Jerusalem, the great thought of the liberty of christianity was established. The false brethren were "brought in", it says, and then they "came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage; to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you". It was the true spirit of a marshal in the conflict; he did not give way at all at any point. The chapter is remarkable in that way; he gives way at no point, one man standing up for the full thought of liberty, the liberty that the Lord Jesus has secured for us, God supporting him. It is a very fine position. Yet he does not underestimate these great persons at Jerusalem; "James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship". I suppose they proved that they were pillars, that they were able to support and stretch out to all that God was doing.
H.E.S. Is not this remarkably like @Numbers 31:49; not a single person was lost in the conflict?
J.T. That is good; as over against the great loss in the wood of Ephraim in the battle against Absalom.
J.J. And yet when Peter came to Antioch, the fickleness and the failure was seen again in him, and Barnabas also was carried away. How do you account for that?
J.T. It is to bring out what we have been remarking as to the decline at Jerusalem, that already things
{322}
were waning. God had secured a great moral effect in meeting this hostile movement, in the transfer of the conflict from Antioch to Jerusalem; He had carried Jerusalem, to a point at least, with what He was doing among the nations, and was maintaining *general* unity, which is a great matter.
H.M.S. Is not the apostle's desire in showing the Galatians that in regard of the attack he speaks of here, he had Jerusalem with him, quite in keeping with the first verse of the epistle: "all the brethren with me", and do we not have a similar case in the book of Joshua when that great altar was built which might have led all that part of Israel away from the faith, and Phinehas comes with the ten princes, and was able to say, "Thus saith the whole assembly of Jehovah" @Joshua 22:16? Here the apostle, in showing the Galatians their folly, reminds them that the brethren were against them.
J.T. Yes; this is history now. When he wrote the epistle he referred back to what happened at Jerusalem. All that he had to say, all he preached in the way of gospel among the nations, and the product of it representatively, were there in Jerusalem. He laid the whole thing out before the apostles there, and there was Titus, with the result that he secured the right hands of fellowship from those three men who were conspicuous as *being* pillars; meaning, I suppose, that they were supporting what God was doing.
E.L.M. Do you see the conflict carried on to Antioch in the latter part of the chapter? If the enemy shifts the ground of the conflict from Jerusalem, and it is carried into Antioch, Paul there maintains the same ground also.
J.T. Yes. The paragraph beginning with verse 11 is a subsequent thing, all pointing to the gradual weakening of things at Jerusalem; but the first part of the chapter shows what God secured, maintaining liberty amongst His people, and in maintaining the truth carrying Jerusalem with it -- a great moral victory.
{323}
But that did not deal with what was wrong at Jerusalem; while we may acquiesce in what is right, the real root of the matter may not be reached, and it was not reached. God did not intend that Paul should set things right at Jerusalem; it was going on to judgment as a matter of fact; but His work was at Jerusalem, His apostles were there, and they give their right hands of fellowship to Paul and Barnabas -- a very great matter. The real difficulty at Jerusalem remained; and that is what the next paragraph shows. It says, "But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned". There is no privacy about this matter. Earlier he had indicated what he preached to Peter and the others privately, but not so now. It is another matter now.
G.A.v.S. Was this, then, a renewal of the attack at the very place where it had begun, in order to stultify what had been come to in Jerusalem?
J.T. Yes. It would have just set aside the effect of what had been reached at Jerusalem, and the great moral victory gained; the victory that God had achieved in transferring the conflict from Antioch to Jerusalem. Is this to be set aside? Peter came to Antioch; it is not now Judaising teachers, but *Peter*.
J.T.S. Does this emphasise the importance of the treasuries you were speaking of, so that the truth that has been afforded should be conserved and carried through?
J.T. That is what you see in Paul. Peter comes to Antioch, and Paul says, "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned: for before that certain came from James, he ate with those of the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision; and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation". Now, after all we have had, we come back to the fickleness that may be found even with the
{324}
most distinguished brethren. Peter, the greatest of the twelve apostles, is capable of being swayed by certain who came from James, James himself not being there, and then the Jews also playing a dissembling part. It was a terrible matter, each playing his part in the dissimulation. It is very humbling that this should appear in the most distinguished of servants.
A.S.L. Paul was the only one that discerned what was involved, because it was not only a question of eating or not eating with gentiles, but a definite departure from the truth of the gospel. So that serious issues may be at stake and not be discerned.
J.T. He had discernment, as you say. It was not that Peter was refusing any doctrine of Paul's, it was Peter's conduct, and shows how one distinguished brother may come under the influence of another. I am sure that Paul would never have said a word about it, were it not necessary to establish the truth he was dealing with among the nations. The Judaisers would make much of Peter, and other great men at Jerusalem; Paul mentions the greatest of them here, and shows how he is capable of being influenced. It was not that he was deliberate about it, because he was eating with the gentiles first. The capability of a great servant being influenced is what we should notice.
H.D'A.C. Downright hypocrisy is the word used in the original.
J.T. It must have been a great sorrow to the apostle Paul, because you may be sure that the love between the two men remained. It was not that Peter premeditated this; the facts show the contrary. He was eating outwardly with the gentile believers, according to the letter from Jerusalem, but it is the influence he came under. Peter represents many things. The Spirit of God brings him forward, even in his failures, for our help, and in this he has to suffer for us. Among them is this susceptibility to influence.
N.K.M. What did the apostle mean in writing to
{325}
the Corinthians, when he says, "All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of any", @1 Corinthians 6: 12? I wondered whether that would fit in with what you are suggesting.
J.T. It is the sort of virtue which Peter himself insists on in his letter: "in your faith have also virtue", @2 Peter 1:5. It is that sort of thing, including that one stands against evil influence. Some men are more influential than others, not because of their spirituality, but their general ability and circumstances. James represents a development at Jerusalem, and hence his influence. Certain came from him, it says; and then we have a party, certain ones each playing his part in the dissimulation -- a most sorrowful thing.
H.D'A.C. It does not look as if Jerusalem had gained much by the conversation, seeing that James now leads on this line.
J.T. Quite so, but the great thing was the moral effect of the letter. Jerusalem committed itself to what was going on among the gentiles, and defeated the devil then. His aim was to divide the saints of God, so that the work of God amongst the gentiles would be separated from Jerusalem. God defeated that effort. It is a great matter to defeat the wicked one; but the root at Jerusalem was not really dealt with.
M.W.B. With regard to this moral victory, do you think there can be that sort of thing repeatedly, even in this day? A victory for the truth, and the truth generally admitted, but yet there may be some who have never judged the root of the trouble, and later one sees them carried away? Is there the possibility of that happening today?
J.T. That is what we may see here. Peter came to Antioch: the effect of that visit ought to have confirmed the letter sent out, and doubtless he intended to confirm it, but he came under influence.
P.L. His loins were not girded. He speaks in his epistle of the loins of the mind being girded; @1 Peter 1:13.
{326}
Thus we would be saved from wrong influence, and the voice from the excellent glory, in the second epistle, would preserve us under right influence.
J.T. Exactly. He leaves us, we may say, with that word -- "the excellent glory" @2 Peter 1:17. But he is not under the influence of it here, he is under the influence of Jerusalem, which, as is said in this epistle, is "in bondage with her children". The second part of the chapter is over against the first part. In the first part the apostle deals privately with Peter and the others, but now he says, "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned". Peter is retrogressing, and hence it is not a question of private conference now, but open rebuke, which is "better than secret love", @Proverbs 27:5.
M.W.B. The truth had been decided on and had become law and statute, so to speak, and he was going back.
J.T. It was like doing violence to the constitution of the country, like a man disregarding the Magna Charta. The letter from Jerusalem was a great landmark consolidating the work of God among the Jews and the gentiles, but now, Peter is doing violence to that; so it is no longer a question of considering for him, but the truth and the liberty of the saints.
J.J. It was a denial of grace.
J.T. That is what the apostle goes on to; he comes back now to the question of himself. He has dealt with Peter, and he goes on to restate the doctrines, and to show that Peter was building again the things he had destroyed. The letter written from Jerusalem set up a principle; it destroyed the thought of circumcision as applied to the gentiles, but now Peter is building that up again. Paul goes on to himself and says, "I am crucified with Christ".
A.S.L. In what way was the "truth of the glad tidings" being compromised by Peter's action?
J.T. It was re-introducing the law which had made a difference between Jew and gentile. The middle wall
{327}
had been broken down, God having reconciled "both in one body to God by the cross", and Peter was doing away with that -- a terrible evil. An ordinary believer might not have seen anything in what happened, but the discerning eye of Paul saw that the whole truth of christianity was involved. The word "truth" is more than doctrine really; it is the thing itself in its full liberating power.
W.C.G. Does the apostle disclose the secret of his spiritual strength in verses 19 and 20?
J.T. Yes: "For I, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God. I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me".
H.M.S. Does it show us that the apostle Peter had not yet thoroughly learned the lesson he thought he had learned in @Acts 10?
J.T. It is rather that he came under influence. I do not think Peter at heart gave up the truth, but he came under influence for the moment. Paul says, "I said to Peter before all". I have no doubt Peter listened. Then he proceeds to show how things were worked out *in himself*, which is another great thing. One might say to Paul: You have been telling us a good deal, giving nice addresses, and have stood on doctrinal lines, you have succeeded in withstanding Peter to the face, but how have things been worked out in your own soul? That is how, as in service, we should challenge ourselves.
H.D'A.C. It was not the first time Peter had acted in this kind of way; the Lord had exposed him before all, in @John 21. He had said he did not know the Man, but he did, and loved Him too, but under the influence of people he acts the hypocrite.
J.T. We see at the end of the chapter what one may accomplish by the power of God in ministry resulting from what has been worked out in one's own soul. He certainly left no ground for Peter to stand on,
{328}
and I have no doubt Peter gained by his remarks. But now, how was this worked out, how had he reached it himself? I do not know anything more effective in a way, than that a preacher can tell how the truth has come about in his own soul. That is what Paul is able to do above all others; he is able to tell us in Romans how things were worked out in his own soul; and so here, he says, "I, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God". No one ever used the law more lawfully and effectively than he, and he used it against *himself*, so that he died by it, which was a very great result. Then he says, "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me". Perhaps there is nothing in Paul's whole ministry that has so much power as that word: "I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me". I believe he grasped it in his soul. The Son of God *as He is*; that is the thought. I am to live by the faith of the Son of God. It implies what He is today.
G.A.v.S. Are those two verses the explanation of how he was able to stand up and face the situation in Antioch?
J.T. Yes, the way he used the law against himself. It is how I am using it against myself, and with what effect, and now I have to grasp the thought of the Son of God where He is. It is the *faith* of Him now; Paul will not say this in heaven; he will be like Him there; but here, it is the "faith of the Son of God".
J.J. Would Mark be another product of the victory in the way he begins his gospel? "Beginning of the glad tidings" @Mark 1:1. He had once deflected, but had come back under Paul's influence, and would be greatly affected by the way he speaks here.
J.T. He wrote his gospel in the light of the Son of God.
{329}
F.J.F. Would these last verses show what he had learned in his sojourn in Arabia?
J.T. Yes, the use he made of the law there, although it cannot be confined to Arabia. No one ever made better use of the law.
C.S.S. Was the final victory seen in that Peter could acknowledge what Paul said as scripture; @2 Peter 3:15?
J.T. Quite so. There is no doubt the affections between the two men remained, and Peter fully owns Paul's doctrine, also calling him "our beloved brother Paul".
{330}
THE LIBERTY OF SONSHIP (3)
@Galatians 3
J.T. In looking at chapter 1, we saw the ground of Paul's apostleship, and the deliberation that marked him subsequent to his call, so as to assure the gain of divine discipline and education in going into Arabia, where, as we noted, the flesh had nothing to feed upon. The principle of *starving* the flesh is very practical, and that was in mind in going to Arabia. There, doubtless, he learned how to use the law, for it has its own use and its own service to render; and the apostle learned how to use it against himself; @Romans 7 helps in this. Then his return to Damascus would be the recognition of his local responsibility; he had been converted, and received into fellowship, in Damascus. Then he went to Jerusalem, not to minister or to make any show of the special grace and knowledge he had, but to make acquaintance with the leading servant there. He knew doubtless by report what Peter was, what his history had been, and the place he had been appointed to by the Lord, so that we have the account of his sojourn for fifteen days with Peter.
In chapter 2 we noted the change that time effects, either for good or ill. Certainly it had wrought wonderfully in Paul; but the facts stated would indicate that the opposite was the case in Jerusalem. Nevertheless, his visit after the fourteen years was not to correct what was in Jerusalem, nor even to minister there. The point in view was the conflict, God shifting the ground for it from Antioch to Jerusalem; not only that the opposition should be met, but that the victory, which was assured in that God had taken on the conflict, should be more complete and far-reaching, indeed universal. Then, there was the sorrowful fact that, although the victory was complete through God's intervention, and through the superior power and grace
{331}
that marked Paul and Barnabas with Titus, the state of things at Jerusalem was not permanently improved. It was not the divine intent in sending Paul, to improve the state at Jerusalem, but rather to show the superiority of what was going on amongst the gentiles, so that full recognition of it might be obtained at Jerusalem. The right hands of fellowship were given to Paul and Barnabas by the leading men, and then the truth was ratified in the letter, in the sending out of which the assembly had part. But the sorrowful fact came out that the general state of Jerusalem was not altered; and that was manifested as Peter visited Antioch. The state at Jerusalem had been painfully evident, even to the extent of influencing the great apostle Peter in taking a false position and thus denying the truth; so that it was no longer a question of treating with him privately or sparing him, but of withstanding him, which Paul did; and, in doing so, he tells us what he said to him. He is not calling attention to the great victory or advantage he had over Peter, for he immediately tells us how he had died to the law, and that he himself no longer lived at all. He was not boasting in his victory. No doubt it was necessary to speak openly to his brother, but he says, "I ... have died to law, that I may live to God". So that the position is made extremely clear through the faithfulness of one man; and he further says that the life that he lived in the flesh, he lived by the faith of the Son of God, who loved him and gave Himself for him. That was how things were worked out in his own soul. There was no thought of vaunting over Peter, far otherwise; it was for the sake of the truth; that the truth of the gospel might remain with the gentiles.
In chapter 3 we have the ground changed again. We are now contemplating Galatia, and what happened there, in the presentation of the truth of the gospel to those people. So that, in considering this chapter, we have to place ourselves in the position of the Galatians,
{332}
and see how the truth has come to us, and what marks its presentation to ourselves; whether there was any model and whether there was in the vessel of the presentation that which was exemplary of what was preached. The strong language used, no doubt, may be fairly taken as applicable to ourselves. The word "senseless" is used twice, a very reproachful word as applied to persons who had the Holy Spirit, showing how very far away from the truth of the Spirit we may get, notwithstanding that we have Him. The word "senseless" is also applied to the unconverted, in the New Testament, but Paul here in this chapter applies the word to persons who had received the Spirit.
Eu.R. Would you say a word as to the Galatians being addressed district-wise, not locally or universally, and as to regions being taken account of, such as Achaia and Macedonia?
J.T. It is to bring out national traits, what may mark a province or a country characteristically, and how God meets it in the testimony He presents. Where a district is addressed, it is not in relation to truth relative to discipline, but more particularly as to doctrine. It will be observed it is not the saints in Galatia, but "the assemblies of Galatia" (chapter 1: 2); that is, the status of each assembly is maintained in the address.
W.C.G. Would you say that verses 19 and 20 of chapter 2 are the setting before us of the true experimental state of christians, possible by the Spirit?
J.T. It is what Paul presents as to himself; but, first, "that I may live to God", and then, "I am crucified with Christ". One no longer lives, but one's institution, so to speak, is held for Christ and He lives there -- a very great fact! It is complete surrender to Christ; and not only so, but the believer in all that he is, is open to Him; Christ lives in the person. Then, the life "that I now live in flesh" is a question of *faith*, that is, one is not occupied with his own things in this life; his life is not made up of seen things, but of unseen
{333}
things; one lives in relation to the Son of God as He is now; lives by the "faith of the Son of God", that is, Christ out of the view of the natural eye, but apprehended by faith; it is really Christ *as He is*.
M.W.B. What is the difference between the general statement in chapter 5: 24: "But they that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh", and this statement in chapter 2: 20?
J.T. There is this difference, that "*I* am crucified with Christ", in verse 20, and "no longer live, I", is what one can say of oneself. The verse in chapter 5 is abstract -- "But they that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts" -- whoever they are. This is what marks them as of the Christ; the flesh is not only mortified, but *crucified*. The judgment is deeper in applying the thought of crucifixion; that is what the thing deserves, that ignominious termination of judgment. It is a great thing when one can speak of himself thus. In chapter 2 it is not only my flesh, but *myself*.
M.W.B. And the other is left in an abstract way to be taken up by those who are such.
J.T. That is the idea. Paul, of course, could say that; he was exceptional, but he was not referring to himself specially in chapter 5. It is "they that are of the Christ", and we want to belong to those. There are such.
M.W.B. And I suppose Paul mentioning his experience becomes the great illustration.
J.T. Exactly. You would like to see him. If you wanted to learn the thing you would like to see how he worked it out, and he tells us this here. It goes further as to deliverance than Romans. It is a judgment on what one is, applying this ruthless and ignominious way to oneself, so that, "no longer live, *I*". It is not that one does not live personally, but that "*I*" -- that big "*I*" -- is not allowed. Living by the faith of the Son of God, I refuse myself in this way.
{334}
E.G. Do you make a distinction between chapter 1: "our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins", and here: "the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me"? It is the Son of God here.
J.T. That is how Paul is viewing Him. The passage implies a precious *personal* link with Christ.
Ques. Is the teaching of crucifixion a deeper thing than death?
J.T. Yes; "Cursed is every one hanged upon a tree". It is that extreme judgment; it is not arbitrary, but what it *deserves*, crucifixion with Christ is the answer to God's judgment at the cross.
R.F. Is that what you have spoken of as maintained in his own soul, the liberty that the Galatians had lost?
J.T. Yes; it is the judgment Paul had reached and executed. God had reached that judgment and executed it in His beloved Son, and Paul reached it in his own soul, so that he says, "I am crucified with Christ". The "I" is no longer in its native position; instead of I, it is Christ; and then, while the person speaking is in an actual condition of flesh and blood, he lives by "the faith of the Son of God". That is, he anticipates the heavenly life; it is in the wilderness, but anticipating the heavenly things in the faith of the Son of God, the apprehension of the Person as He is, in heaven.
A.F.M. Is the thought of "Christ lives in me" the suggestion of spiritual formation?
J.T. It would be. You have made room for Him in crucifixion. The allusion in the early part of chapter 3 is abstract: "crucified among you". We may say that the portrayal must have been in Paul. Doubtless it was, but it is abstract which makes the application fuller. It is first "Jesus Christ ... portrayed", but "crucified among you" is further. The fact being presented abstractly makes room for its extension. It may be in you, or in me; but wherever it is the portrayal becomes evident, concurrent with the ministry of the gospel. It is the portrayal of Christ and His
{335}
crucifixion, and that must be in the ministers. The dispensation should be represented in that way. In so far as it lies in you, you will see that there is seen the portrayal of Christ and His crucifixion. There is no need of a cross of wood if there be that.
A.S.L. Does it mean that he himself was the expression of a crucified man, according to what he says, "I am crucified with Christ"?
J.T. That is a fair conclusion to arrive at, but we do not want to leave it all with him. It is abstract, and therefore may apply at any time, if it exists.
H.F.N. Would you open up a little the scope of chapter 3?
J.T. What we are now dwelling upon is important, as to what is set out in an exemplary way in those who minister; and then, the further fact that there is such a thing as the ministry of the Spirit current; "He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you". At least, it was current in Galatia, and the working of miracles. It does not say who it was that ministered the Spirit, or who worked the miracles, but that there were such things. There were positive things there, and there are positive things now, and nobody can deny them. But on what principle are they ministered? The phrase "on the principle of" instead of the word "by" in the Authorised Version is a good translation of the Greek preposition in this scripture and is, in fact, I believe only found in this New Translation. It is an instructive phrase.
We have now come to the Galatians themselves, in their own country, and what was done there, which they would readily admit; there had been these things, even the working of miracles. The book of the Acts shows that there had been those things. On what principle were they done? This thought of the principle of things runs through the chapter; the things of God ministered in the glad tidings, are on the principle of faith. Then, there are the sons of Abraham, if you wish
{336}
to go back so far, for the epistle deals in periods, years, eras, days. Well, God operated with Abraham on this principle. The law came in for another reason, really to help out this principle; it has its own service. Paul had understood thoroughly how to use it, and it has its own service, which we ought to understand, so as to use it. Then, God puts things on the principle of promise, not on the principle of a covenant through a mediator. It is a question of *promise* in this chapter, and all leading up to the application of sonship to those who have faith. "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus" (verse 26), he says. What I have said may be taken to be a sort of outline.
Ques. In the verse quoted, it is "by faith in Christ Jesus"; is there a difference between that, and "on the principle of faith"?
J.T. "Ye are all God's sons by faith". The "by" there is *instrumentality*.
A.S.L. It is a different preposition, you mean? "By means of", instead of "on the principle of".
H.M.S. Why do we have so much in the chapter of Abraham and hardly anything of Moses, except that he is referred to as the mediator?
J.T. That gives rise to another suggestion that, in the next chapter, Abraham is not the prominent person, but his wife; and therefore the suggestion is important, that the Spirit of God occupies us with Abraham here. He is the progenitor of all who believe, and therefore it is not persons who keep the law. God gave the promise "in grace" to Abraham; the whole position is grace.
A.S.L. What would you say as to the emphatic word, "a mediator is not of one" (verse 20) -- that is clear enough -- but "God is one"? What does that mean exactly?
J.T. God acts of Himself as one, and the only one under obligation; there is no mediator. Verse 15 is in the sense of disposition: "even man's confirmed covenant
{337}
no one sets aside, or adds other dispositions to". God did it Himself, and nothing can be safer than what depends on God only.
H.M.S. There is no other party.
J.T. No other party under obligation. Abraham comes in for the benefit, but the obligation is entirely with God; there is no mediator.
A.S.L. A mediator involves three persons, but "God is one".
J.T. Yes, the two persons making the covenant and the mediator between, but here God refers to none but Himself.
Rem. God is absolute.
J.T. Quite so; He is one. There is nobody who can question Him, which makes the position infinitely solid. The covenant here is in the sense of promise, which God gave unconditionally to Abraham.
A.S.L. There is no question raised about the Galatians having received the Spirit. How did you receive Him? is the question. And yet they were senseless.
J.T. The use of the word "senseless" to persons acknowledged to have the Spirit is very humbling, and how many of us have to accept that reproachful word!
W.A.W. Is the phraseology suited to the national traits always, such as the fickleness of the Galatians? I am thinking, too, of Paul's word to Titus, "Cretans are always liars, evil wild beasts, lazy gluttons", @Titus 1:12.
J.T. That is strong language. The Holy Spirit would not have used those strong words if less severe ones would have done.
Eu.R. In these verses we are moving on towards sonship.
J.T. It is the end in view in the chapter, that is the terminus, and having used these strong expressions, the apostle proceeds to make clear the principle on which the gospel was administered. Before passing on
{338}
to that principle, we ought to notice the fact that there was the ministry of the Spirit to them. They had received the Spirit. "He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, is it on the principle of works of law, or of the report of faith?" He puts it to them. How positive things were in the early days in the ministry, not only ministry of the truth, but the Spirit.
A.S.L. In what sense would that be -- ministering the Spirit?
J.T. It is again abstract, but I think it would mean that God was operating Himself. The minister was used, but, properly speaking, God ministers the Spirit, and it is put in that way. The apostle is not occupied so much with the minister, with himself, but with the fact that such things as these had been there amongst them; and in a certain sense, the thing may be applied now -- what has happened in your own country?
Eu.R. This ministry is in contrast to the demands of law.
E.J.McB. Is the idea that certain things were before their very eyes in the servant ministering, and then the report of faith, and then the ministry of the Spirit? Is that the order?
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of the presentation of the gospel, in connection with which these positive things appear. They accompany the testimony among the Galatians. It is well for every christian to review his own history and see how the truth came to him; whether it was accompanied by any positive things, and on what principle it had come to him, and whether he had moved away from that.
M.W.B. I notice there is also the receiving of the Spirit referred to in the same manner, as on the principle of faith -- there is the ministering of the Spirit and the *receiving* of the Spirit.
J.T. That makes these things very personal. How did one receive the Spirit? One ought to be able to
{339}
give an account of that. The ministry of that was more general. If I say I have the Spirit, then I must have received Him, but on what principle?
W.C.G. And is not the coming into the gain of the Spirit equally on the principle of faith, as receiving the Spirit?
J.T. It is. This word "on the principle of" is good to keep in view, for it is how a man is to be built up as a christian so that he is a man of principle. The Bible is a book of principles, and that is what the apostle is labouring at here, to bring out the great principles on which God had been operating since Abraham's time; and so much so, that the gospel was preached to Abraham; verse 8. Scripture is here said to have preached: "the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations on the principle of faith, announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham".
J.T.S. Have we the two points brought together in the close of @Acts 10? They were hearing the word, and then it is said that "upon the nations also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out" @Acts 10:45 and later Peter says, "Can any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did?" @Acts 10:47.
J.T. What a great example that is of God's administration! Cornelius and his friends were in the house, and Peter went there by divine direction and preached, and, as he preached, the Holy Spirit came on those who heard the word. That is a marvellous thought! Peter did not minister the Spirit there, clearly; he ministered the gospel, he preached the word, but God ministered the Spirit. As a matter of fact, it is the Spirit's own action; it is an energetic action by the Spirit. And Peter proceeds to speak, not the continuation of his gospel address, but basing his remarks on what had happened divinely before his eyes. So that our dispensation began in that way among the Gentiles, by God ministering the Spirit.
{340}
A.S.L. @Acts 10 answers the question fully -- on what principle did you receive the Spirit?
J.J. Would the twelve men at Ephesus in @Acts 19 be another instance of ministering the Spirit?
J.T. There you have another thought. He "came upon them" @Acts 19:6, as Paul laid his hands on them. The minister is recognised there, but Peter's part in @Acts 10 was the preaching.
H.P.W. Do I understand you feel we are in danger of calculating in relation to the greatness of men, and the like; whereas, if divine principles were built into our souls, we should be preserved from this?
J.T. Just so; a man built up on principle is broadened. I suppose the idea of principle enters into the whole physical universe; all must move on principle; and I believe that is what God would do for us, to get us on to this ground. How did I begin? I received the Spirit on the principle of faith; I received the glad tidings on the principle of faith. Why should I alter? I must proceed on that line. In dealing with such a specious attack as the apostle is meeting here, you can see the force of getting the saints on to the ground of faith and principle, a believer should be rational and logical, so to say. Have I proved that what I began with is not a right principle? If not, why should I take on something different?
F.S.M. Is the suggestion of the chapter, that there were persons who had received the Spirit, but needed to be impressed with the principles? Is the implication here that we need to be concerned that these foundational truths should be reiterated among us; we should not take it for granted that, even though persons may have received the Spirit, they are well grounded in these matters, such as faith and grace.
J.T. It raises the whole question as to ministry. God says, I will gather others besides those that are gathered, a very comforting promise; but how are we going to preserve those that *are* gathered? It is by the
{341}
constant reiteration of divine principles, and truths. So Paul says to the Philippians, "to write the same things to you, to me is not irksome, and for you safe", @Philippians 3:1. He had no difficulty in saying the same things to them, not that he meant to lay down an example that we should preach the same sermons. I do not believe he meant that, but to say the same things in needed settings, bringing in other things at the same time. Saints generally need more than one conversion, because of our fickleness, the readiness with which we come under influences and change our outlook. So the Holy Spirit has to keep on and on at us. The most important service I see today is to preserve according to God what there is.
Ques. You mean that some need converting several times?
J.T. I do. The most distinguished man we have spoken of here in Jerusalem needed it. The Lord said, "when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren" (@Luke 22:32), and he needed another one, according to chapter 2. There can be no doubt that he was restored from the evil he fell into. He was a man that through grace could quickly recover himself.
J.T.S. Does he also show the need of this when he writes his second letter? "Wherefore I will be careful to put you always in mind of these things, although knowing them and established in the present truth", @2 Peter 1:12.
J.T. Yes; "always in mind", and he speaks about stirring up "your pure mind" too; @2 Peter 3:1.
Ques. Do you think ministry should be kept in constant flow, and young people should seek to appropriate it as applying to their state and need?
J.T. I think that is very largely what the Lord is doing; the importance of keeping what we have is manifest, not merely that they should be nominally in fellowship, but nourished and maintained in right principles.
{342}
J.J. Is that the point in the addresses to the seven churches, the constant appeal to hear what the Spirit says?
J.T. That is right.
W.W. That would save us from Brethrenism.
J.T. Yes; we get into the habit of using certain terms and they lose their power. Spiritual ministry keeps us fresh and in movement.
P.L. Would these principles result in our being firmly established, so to speak, in the firmament of God? Would the "ordinances of the heavens" be the principles? Then, in the epistle to the Corinthians, "star differs from star in glory" @1 Corinthians 15:41 is brought in after the "commandments of the Lord" have been set forth.
J.T. So that there is a variety of shining. "Among whom ye appear as lights in the world", @Philippians 2:15.
P.L. It is not *competitive* shining as at Corinth, which was really darkness.
N.K.M. In addressing the saints in the first verse, the apostle uses a strong word: "who has bewitched you ... ?" Why should that be?
J.T. It is in keeping with what we are saying. It was for them to look back and see who had influenced them. How distressing that christians should come under such darkening influence as to be so characterised! I have to see what it was that thus appealed to me and affected me. It certainly was not the principle on which I received the gospel and the Spirit.
L.D.M. Is Matthew the great gospel of divine principles? In chapter 18 the Lord speaks of the disciples needing to be converted, following the light of sonship in chapter 17.
J.T. Just so; "Unless ye are converted and become as little children" @Matthew 18:3. He was addressing the disciples.
A.F.M. Does the passage in Malachi bear on what we are saying? "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances", @Malachi 4:4.
{343}
J.T. Quite so, what Moses had given at Horeb, and they were for "all Israel".
W.C. Would the instruction of the father and the law of the mother in Proverbs deliver from senselessness?
J.T. I am sure they would. We shall come into the law of the mother in chapter 4, but the instruction of the father is more what came out in the apostle, what comes out authoritatively -- and alluded to in this chapter.
M.W.B. Would you say that in this chapter things are presented more on the objective line? The sons of Abraham are referred to, and "on the principle of faith" is dwelt upon, so whether it is righteousness, or the inheritance, or sonship, things are all related to the principle of faith.
J.T. All that enters into the paternal side of the truth.
M.W.B. And the next chapter is more Sarah, and implies the subjective line -- the mother?
J.T. Exactly. Abraham is the prominent personage here, and it is to bring out that he is the father of all believers, that as of Christ we are Abraham's seed.
Ques. Would you say another word in regard to knowing how to use the law?
J.T. "By law is knowledge of sin", @Romans 3:20. That is a terse way of stating the value of it as an instrument. "But the commandment having come", says the apostle, "sin revived, but I died", @Romans 7:9. It was intended to be for life, for he that would live was to continue in all things written in the law; if anybody could do so, he would live. But instead of that, the apostle says, "but the commandment having come", that is, having come to me in its spirituality. It is not the commandments there, but commandment, that is, "Thou shalt not covet". That is the thing that kills you. After that, "sin revived", because it only promoted what is innate in me, namely covetousness, and the law condemns that, so that I am helpless: "I died", he says. But then, not only do I die, that is, become
{344}
utterly helpless, but Paul says further, "For I, through law, have died to law", @Galatians 2:19. That is the thing; it has served its purpose. The law was the tutor "up to Christ", but I am no longer under it. This chapter teaches how one emerges in one's soul from the authority of the law, fully recognising its usefulness in its place.
Ques. Do you think @Deuteronomy 5 helps in connection with first principles?
J.T. Yes. Deuteronomy is the reiteration of first principles; not in the sense of direct command, but rather the spirit of what had been commanded, given through a man who loved the people. In general it is what *Moses* says, in Deuteronomy, and that is a good word for those who minister the word; because Deuteronomy shows how a minister can say the same things but in different settings and in freshness. The speaker in Deuteronomy, in finishing his book, says, "My doctrine shall drop as rain, my speech flow down as dew" (@Deuteronomy 32:2), which is very beautiful. You might say the same things, but you say them in such a way that they are fresh ministry.
Rem. The link at the end of chapter 2 with the beginning of chapter 3 is very helpful. The judgment of the servant as to himself in chapter 2: 20, and then the way it is maintained in the minister and the effectual result of the ministry. The Galatians through faith have received the Spirit, and now it is a question of maintenance.
J.T. Yes. In our chapter the apostle opens the great foundational principles of christianity, including sonship.
F.J.F. In connection with local crises it is sometimes very difficult to get a principle that would govern the position at that time. How would such be found?
J.T. Well, no contingency can arise in the history of a christian, but there is a principle to govern it. The principle is there, if you can find it. That is one
{345}
great feature of a believer's education, to learn to look at the Bible as a book of principles; so that when you need them, you know where they are. The accuracy of the Scriptures is wonderful, not only in a verbal sense, but in the settings of the subjects.
E.G. You would not act unless governed by a divine principle.
J.T. No, I should not.
H.F.N. Would that be the importance of 2 Timothy -- the following of principles, and would it not cover what has been referred to? No question can arise but is covered by the four things to be followed in that epistle -- righteousness, faith, love, and peace, as calling on the Lord out of a pure heart. Would they not cover the whole of the principles that really govern our position today?
J.T. Quite so, only there are details, especially in the types and the prophets, that have peculiar force as circumstances arise to which they apply. For instance, we were speaking just now of how the saints are to be kept. Well, a psalm says, "Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron", @Psalm 77:20. That is a very important principle as regards the saints viewed as a whole; they are to be led like a flock; that is, they are to be kept under control. But by what means? By one hand, "the hand of Moses and Aaron". Instead of saying, this brother and that brother, it is a combination.
H.F.N. That is very interesting. Would you mind saying a word why Miriam is brought in in the Minor Prophets?
J.T. @Micah 6:4 says that Moses and Aaron and Miriam were sent before Israel, it is just the leadership of the saints. "The hand of Moses and Aaron" is the unity or beautiful combination seen in those two men, the thought of authority and the mind of God in Moses, and priestly feelings and sympathy in Aaron. It is that one hand keeping the saints under control. For instance,
{346}
when they were about to go back into Egypt, according to @Exodus 16, Moses could not save them; at least, he did not. He was there, and said much, but Aaron spoke to them, and when he spoke to them, they turned their faces toward the wilderness. It was not authority only, it was grace more. And they turned their faces toward the wilderness instead of towards Egypt; and then the glory appeared. Israel was saved by the priestly speaking. Then, you have another thing in the leadership of David, who "fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands", @Psalm 78:72. In David, leadership was with skill and integrity. Then Miriam is introduced by God in the Minor Prophets. God says, "I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam" @Micah 6:4; it is not that they went before them physically. The point is that God had those three persons under His eye and formed them, for a period of eighty years or more, and when the time for leadership arrived they were there; God has them to be sent by Him before Israel. It is a question of what God provides in secret. Miriam is an additional thought, involving the sisters that God may use in leadership, so that the saints are kept as a flock. She is introduced by name, as a prophetess.
J.R.S. Is that element learned in subjection?
J.T. Surely. How could Miriam become a prophetess, save as observing subjection to God?
Ques. Does the combination of Moses and Aaron come out in Paul here in the way he deals with these saints?
J.T. Quite so; "and all the brethren with me", as was referred to yesterday. So, in Corinthians the brother is brought in.
J.J. Is there any book in the Old Testament you would couple with this epistle to bring out the details of the principles that Galatians contains?
J.T. No, I would not venture to link it with any special book. Genesis is the book that is dealt with
{347}
here. Genesis is the root of things, and it is always well to take a soul to Genesis when you do not wish him to be under demand, for Genesis deals with the work of God by itself.
Ques. You spoke just now of Abraham's sons in verse 7; would they stand over against the word "senseless", the way we are brought intelligently into the thoughts of God on the line of principle?
J.T. Yes. Abraham's sons would not be senseless, nor are the sons of God, characteristically; they are wisdom's children, in that sense, which is the very opposite to what came out here.
C.S.S. Do you connect the recognition of these divine principles with spiritual instinct? He says, "having begun in Spirit"; does he contemplate carrying on to completion?
J.T. "Having begun in Spirit, are ye going to be made perfect in flesh?" Why not go on in Spirit? If I do, what will not the Spirit do for me? He is here to open up the treasuries of the Bible, the great highways of God, so to speak, that lead to Zion. The thing is to get on to those roads. "The roads were unused", Deborah says, before her time; @Judges 5:6.
E.L.M. In connection with the thought of treasuries, and Paul and Peter being great vessels, are we carried back to Abraham on the one hand as the great vessel, that the blessing of Abraham can go to the Gentiles; and then, the thought of the blessed Lord, the seed to whom the promises were made, so that the great vessel of all the blessing of God is before us -- the seed of Abraham?
J.T. Beginning with Abraham we have his sons but then there is the Seed, which is one only -- not seeds but seed. That is the one great Person through whom everything is carried out, and that leads up to the paragraph; verses 15 to 20. We have the covenant made by God to Abraham, and then it goes on, "But to Abraham were the promises addressed, and to his
{348}
seed: he does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed; which is Christ". We have now definitely before us Christ as the One to whom the promises refer, and who effectuates them all. This paragraph is to bring out the basis of the gospel, that it is a question of God Himself; it is not even dependent on the believer. It is God, and "God is one". The apostle in Timothy says, "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one", @1 Timothy 2:5. That is not the point here, but that God acts from Himself and is under obligation to no one; that everything He promises depends on Himself.
Ques. Does that come out as principle in the verse following the one you have referred to in @Micah 6? "My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteousness of Jehovah", verse 5.
J.T. That is right. In Exodus, He comes in according to what He was to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, on the ground of promise, to fulfil it. Well, the question is raised, What about the law? It came in by the way; it has nothing to do with the primary thought of God. It came in four hundred and thirty years afterwards, and cannot disannul it.
Ques. The Lord in @John 8 is insistent on Abraham, while the others speak of Moses.
J.T. It was a question of the Lord's own Person there: "Before Abraham was, I am" @John 8:58.
C.O.B. What is the relation between the principle of promise and the principle of faith?
J.T. The promise is effective on that principle. The promise has to be regarded by itself. It is made unconditionally; there are no conditions attached to it. But how am I coming into it? On the principle of faith: Abraham believed God. He is honoured here in a beautiful way: "believing Abraham". He came into the promise and embraced it, although it was not fulfilled
{349}
in his day; it was far off as to its fulfilment, but he saw it afar off, and embraced it on the principle of faith.
F.C.H. Would you say a word as to the connection between the promise to Abraham on the principle of faith, and the promise to his Seed, which is Christ?
J.T. That is to show that a divine Person is in mind who would come in later. The Seed is Christ, who effectuates it; but the promise stands, and Abraham came into it in that far-off day, four hundred and thirty years before the law, on the principle of faith. He is honoured as "believing Abraham", and the father of all believers. So that the point is that these promises are available on the principle of faith.
J.J. And it is in that very connection that James calls him the "Friend of God", @James 2:23.
E.L.M. Do you connect the expression, "God is one", with the line of promise, and make any distinction from the thought of covenant which would involve two parties?
J.T. What we are speaking of here, is called a covenant in verse 17, but not a covenant between two parties making each responsible. The point is, "God is one", and the promise is by one person who is not under obligation to others, and being God, it is absolutely sure to go through.
H.E.S. It was a promise in the form of covenant, God engaging Himself to perform what He said.
J.T. Quite so. In @Genesis 17 it is called a covenant, and a sign is given to it -- the sign of circumcision. A promise given in the form of covenant is to assure the believer -- God binding Himself to it in this well-known form.
{350}
THE LIBERTY OF SONSHIP (4)
@Galatians 4
J.T. It was said this morning that chapter 3 presents the paternal feature of the truth, Abraham being mentioned prominently; and it is said that those that are on the principle of faith are "Abraham's sons" and "are blessed with believing Abraham"; and then again, in the last verse, "then ye are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise". It is therefore the paternal thought; whereas chapter 4 is more the maternal side. The end of chapter 3, which we scarcely touched this morning, asserts the conclusion reached, that "ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", verse 26. It is a matter of faith; not a matter of attainment or state, but of faith, and applicable to all who have faith, who are on that principle in their relations with God.
H.D'A.C. Do you connect the words "by faith" with the thought of God? "Ye are all God's sons by faith". It is not exactly by faith in Christ Jesus that we are God's sons, is it?
J.T. Well, that is how it reads.
H.D'A.C. Do you connect the faith with the first part of the sentence or the latter?
J.T. The way it reads is, "ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus". There is no comma after the word "faith". Do you suggest it may be that, ye are all sons of God in Christ Jesus on the principle of faith?
H.D'A.C. That is what I thought. Is that the meaning?
J.T. I do not understand so. I think the instrumentality by which we come into sonship is faith, and Christ Jesus is the object of this faith. "By faith" is instrumentality. We have in chapter 4 the suggestion of formation under the figure of birth; so that it is the mother that is in mind, that is, "Jerusalem above". In chapter 3, we have the Spirit suggested as received;
{351}
it is assumed that they had received the Spirit. In chapter 4, it is stated, "But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father". There is state, in principle, in both chapters in that way, only that coming to the maternal side of our position, there is the suggestion of formation under the figure of travail in birth; but sonship is clearly stated to be on the principle of faith.
W.C.G. Would you say that verse 28 of chapter 3 is explanatory of the latter part of verse 26: "in Christ Jesus"? "There is no Jew nor Greek".
J.T. Well, the reading is, "For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ. There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus". Verse 28 is position, as I understand: "ye are all one in Christ Jesus". Verse 26 is the means of sonship, that is, "by faith in Christ Jesus". As I see it, according to the context, the faith is in that Person.
Eu.R. Have you in mind in chapter 3, whether as to covenant or promise or sonship, that it comes from God, and has to be received authoritatively, and that that governs our exercises?
J.T. Yes. The way in which the things are entered into, as we had it this morning, is "on the principle of faith", a translation that is very instructive. The position in Abraham is to bring out the paternal side. Of course, "sons of God" is the point; but, "ye are Abraham's seed", and earlier, "Abraham's sons", is a thought to help the Galatians as affected by the Judaisers; that what God had in mind in Abraham is really theirs, but not on the principle of law, but faith. The law came in four hundred and thirty years after the promise, and in no way abrogated or affected the promise; it came in for another reason altogether. The promise to Abraham is reached on the principle of faith, and not on the principle of law.
L.D.M. Is your thought borne out in Luke's gospel
{352}
in regard of the woman who was bowed down with infirmity? The Lord speaks of her as a "daughter of Abraham" @Luke 13:16, and then in chapter 19, Zacchaeus is referred to as a "son of Abraham" @Luke 19:9.
J.T. Luke helps us on this point, referring to the Jew, his being peculiarly the gospel that sets out grace, and makes great allowance for Jewish thought and feeling, and shows that the Lord had Abraham in mind in His teaching. Even in the well-known figure of hades in chapter 16, Abraham is still in mind. It is God graciously getting down to the Jewish way of thinking; the Jew is met in grace. If John the baptist said, according to Luke, that "God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham" @Luke 3:8, yet that is not what He did. He could do that; He could do without the Jews in that sense, but grace could not do without them; grace would make the most of them, so that Luke tells us that the Lord said, "remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high" @Luke 24:49. That is, the gospel is to be presented in Jerusalem in "power from on high"; it is to be presented in that way, but presented there first. In the case of the woman who had been bowed together for eighteen years, the Lord said she was "a daughter of Abraham" -- there were daughters of Abraham -- and then, Zacchaeus, "he is a son of Abraham". Nothing is lost as regards God's promise to Abraham. Grace would meet the Jewish thought and feeling in that way; and so here, these Galatians are affected in regard of the law, but the law was not given to Abraham. The covenant made with Abraham was a disposition of God; God made the promise on the principle of grace to him four hundred and thirty years before the law, and God is not abandoning grace. That was His principle. The principle of God's action was grace, and the principle of the believer's coming into it is faith. God is not abandoning His principle by bringing in something else in the law. He has brought in the law for another purpose, but He has
{353}
not given up what He began with; that is, the Scriptures announced to Abraham the glad tidings that God would bless the nations on the principle of faith. Abraham was one of the believers; he was the great believer and stood on the ground of grace. God approached him thus in making a promise to him. Well, God has not altered His mind in that respect; and so we have sons of Abraham through faith, even from among the gentiles. Then, in chapter 4, the apostle enlarges on this by the question of *time*. The children were kept in the nursery, so to speak, until the time appointed by the father -- the father, of course, being a figure of God. Now that time is given in chapter 3 -- "before faith came" (verse 23), meaning the period in which faith is the principle as over against law. But now, the period fixed of the father has arrived, and the apostle takes up the thread again in the way of God's intervention in His Son: "God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship". The coming of the Son at the period fixed of the Father has the law in mind, to redeem those that were under it.
W.C.G. Did Abraham have to learn in connection with Isaac and Ishmael, that the change of order accompanied the giving of the promise?
J.T. Quite so, the child "born according to Spirit". So that we have come on to another line now; it is a question of birth and formation. But the coming in of the Son is a question of a period of time fixed of the Father, to "redeem those under law". God is still dealing with that, but those under it are to be redeemed, and "receive sonship". We have sonship by faith in chapter 3, but now we receive it; it is something you have taken on knowingly.
P.T.F. Why does it bring in the "principles of the world", in verse 3, instead of the principle of the law?
J.T. "So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the principles of the world". It seems
{354}
to be an allusion to the Jewish system, as on the level of the world.
A.F.M. Is this cry of "Abba, Father" something special or general for believers? It is not an expression that we use frequently.
J.T. It is the action of the Spirit here, bringing out, as we were remarking, the state; it is the basis of state amongst the saints. The Spirit takes the lead in crying, but it is in the believer that He cries. *He* does it, and, in that way, I believe, gives a lead as to state.
A.F.M. Is the true lead given in Mark's gospel, where the Lord thus addresses the Father in Gethsemane?
J.T. Yes, the Lord used the exact expression, "Abba, Father". Now the Holy Spirit says it in the christian, and the order would be therefore for the christian to use it too, by the Spirit of adoption, which is stated in @Romans 8. We learn these things in Christ, by the Spirit operating in ourselves.
H.D'A.C. It does not say of the Lord that He *cried*, "Abba, Father" -- He *said* it.
J.T. I suppose the Spirit crying is urgency; He would bring that about in christians. I do not think it has become very urgent with us, but it does say in @Romans 8, "whereby we cry, Abba, Father". It is only in the power of the Spirit that it can be uttered according to God -- the Spirit of adoption.
A.F.M. Would you mind telling us something about this twofold title, "Abba, Father"?
J.T. It has often been remarked that the first is Aramaic, meaning Father. The other, of course, is Greek. The first is not translated into other languages, it is carried down; and we have the Lord's own word, which is most touching. I should regard it as one of the choicest things in the christian's treasury -- the Lord's exact word in speaking to His Father, and that in the hour of greatest pressure. Only Mark gives us that.
{355}
D.L.H. Does it not refer to two languages, one speaking of the Father as Abba, and the other the language that the Lord Jesus would generally use?
J.T. "Abba" would be the thought of Father in its primary formation in the human mind. It would have been used in the ordinary sense by children to their fathers, and as used by the Lord it seems to be a very precious jewel in the treasury of the saints -- His exact word, carried down, the Spirit taking it up, we may be sure. He cries in keeping with the Lord's use of it, but in the christian.
M.W.B. Do you think that perhaps there is a lack amongst us in not using that expression more, as I might say, artlessly?
J.T. Yes. That is, without special form. God loves what issues from us in the liberty of the relation itself, as known to us.
J.J. Would there be a deeper thought as well in the Hebrew and the Greek being brought together? Would it signify that the Jew and the Greek in the body would be calling on the same God?
J.T. Very likely; a Greek believer would use this form as would a Hebrew believer.
D.L.H. Does not the repetition of the relationship mean that it is emphasised? "Once hath God spoken, twice have I heard this", @Psalm 62:11. Is it that kind of repetition to emphasise the particular thing in mind?
J.T. I suppose repetition itself is testimony. We have Hebrew and Greek and Latin at the cross in the inscription, that is, full testimony to the judgment of man in the known languages. The Latin, although the same as Greek, is evidently not in mind here; it is just "Abba, Father". It is not much used. Sometimes the question is raised as to whether we should ever use the term "Father" by itself. The usual formula in the epistles is "our God and Father", or "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ", but it seems to me
{356}
that this passage, together with @Romans 8, warrants and requires that a christian should say, "Father".
P.T.F. Does @Luke 11 help, where the Lord Jesus teaches us to pray? He says, "Father".
J.T. It does.
W.C. What had you in mind when you said that possibly we never use the term by itself?
J.T. I was only remarking that the question is sometimes raised as to whether we should use the term "Father" by itself, but it is warranted by this passage and by @Romans 8, and by @Luke 11, where the Lord teaches His disciples to pray. He says, "When ye pray, say, Father".
C.C.E. Do you think we should rightly leave out the personal pronoun? We can say "our"; can we say "my"?
J.T. I do not see any objection to it.
C.C.E. The Lord used it, of course.
J.T. He does not often say "My Father", but simply "Father". God has delight in the expression of feelings and affections that belong to that relationship -- as expressed in the words "Abba, Father"! It seems as if in assembly, in speaking to the Lord, the scene resounds with the words "Lord Jesus" by the Spirit -- that is, when it is by the Spirit. The Holy Spirit gets a place in the assembly in relation to the Lord's supper, by the expression "Lord Jesus", for no one can say, Lord Jesus, save by the Holy Spirit. The saying of "Lord Jesus" is an element in the place and indicates a lead; the words resound in the power of the Spirit; the place is filled, so to speak, with that, when it is by the Spirit, and so when the Spirit of adoption cries, "Abba, Father", the place resounds with that. We have a lead given, which should be maintained and not relinquished.
C.C.E. In Matthew, the Lord says, "My Father" @Matthew 26:39, in the garden.
A.F.M. You would suppose the Lord Jesus in His
{357}
pathway as in prayer and communion, would invariably use the words "Abba, Father".
J.T. Of course He used the word "Father" by itself, too, in the beginning of @John 17, and I believe He uses it there as a lead for us. Having said so much, as recorded in the chapters immediately preceding, He lifts up His eyes to heaven, and says, "Father"; and, as has just been remarked, He uses "My Father" in Matthew.
M.W.B. Some of J.N.D.¬s hymns begin with "Father", without the prefixion, "God" such as, "Father, Thy name our souls would bless", and "Blest Father".
J.T. It seems as if it is to resound in the divine domain, as belonging peculiarly to the Father's realm. How delightful it must be to Him to have from our hearts the term of relationship used as the Lord Jesus used it! Obviously, as coming into this world, He was to be Leader in everything. He told us to say, "Father", but how precious to hear Him say, "Father". If one had heard that, one would seek to speak in the same way.
H.F.N. Why is it we are so conscious at times of a lack of liberty in the assembly in speaking directly to the Father?
J.T. I believe it is due somewhat to the covenant not having its full force preliminarily. The covenant makes room for love in the heart; it is perfect love. I apprehend perfect love is God's love; it does not allude to the Father's love. Not that that is not perfect, of course, but "perfect love" is a relative thought and it casts out fear. It is the love that comes into our circumstances, and the love that comes into our hearts; it is the kind of love that overcomes what may have been there against God; it "casts out fear".
C.S.S. Would this be different to @1 John 3, where it speaks of children? Here, it is in connection with sons.
J.T. It is different. Besides, it is the Father there:
{358}
"See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", @1 John 3:1. It is more that Person, but here it is "Father" in the sense that the relationship implied exists, and the Holy Spirit is crying it in sons. It is not children that are saying it, but sons, the Spirit of adoption, crying, in their hearts, "Abba, Father".
D.L.H. Would you say something in regard to what the Lord said, "For the Father himself loveth you", @John 16:27? I think you were connecting love just now with God simply as such. The Lord said, "For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me".
J.T. That is not quite the thought of the love of God in the covenant; it is *because* of something. It is not the Father's love for them as sons, nor is there anything said in John at all of His being our Father, save in chapter 20. It is that Person that loves you. God in grace, I apprehend, is the thought of the Father, in John's gospel. It is not a term of relationship with us. The relation is there with the Son, with Christ, but not with us, until chapter 20.
M.W.B. Since you have alluded to John's usage of the thought of Son, would you say a word as to the distinction between John's presentation of the Lord as Son, and Paul's presentation, which you have brought before us?
J.T. John presents Him as Paul does, but also as a divine Person come into manhood, by Himself, in the testimony. Paul presents Him as expressing the relationship that God intended for man, which we have here. John does not develop that side, but just mentions at the end of his gospel that the Lord said, "my Father and your Father, ... my God and your God". But he does not even say that they are sons, save in the book of Revelation, which need hardly be brought in, because it is not a question of the counsels of God there. John is occupied with God come into the world
{359}
under the name Father; and Christ being here under the name Son. It is a question of the testimony; and if the Father loves us, it is that Person in grace. John expressly says that the Father judges no one (@John 5:22); that is, it is that Person in grace; this enters into the economy, which John presents.
Eu.R. "To us there is one God, the Father", @1 Corinthians 8:6. Does that help?
J.T. It does; it is the Father.
J.J. Why does this thought of "Abba, Father", come into the maternal chapter, and not into the paternal?
J.T. The maternal subject does not begin until verse 12. Chapter 4, until the end of verse 11, is the continuation of what is presented in chapter 3. We come to the full thought in the Spirit crying, "Abba, Father"; we have in principle the state answering to the relationship in the Spirit.
R.F. Does he bring in the highest truth to correct what was deficient, in presenting sonship?
J.T. That is what was in mind. If God is meeting an attack, He carries the conflict on to the full result in mind. This epistle is the great charter of christian liberty; and I think verse 7 is the end reached from the paternal side, showing that christians are sons on the principle of faith as belonging to the time of sonship as believers; and the Holy Spirit has a footing in christians, not to work out the testimony here, but to answer to God; the relationship being formed, and the state being there in principle, answering to the relationship. That is a fixed thing. So that, "thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God"; that is a fixed position. The Holy Spirit is here maintaining that thought. There is a point reached in the epistle, and it is fixed.
Ques. What is the force of the expression, "sent out the Spirit of his Son"?
J.T. I suppose it means that there was distance;
{360}
but it is a definite thing that the Holy Spirit has come out. The Spirit of adoption has been sent out to establish the full position, and now it is to be carried on in these feeling words, "Abba, Father"; they are to continue in power. The question of what the Galatians were going on with, the observing of days and months and times and years, is in the mind of the apostle in what follows. As regards what they were as gentiles, he says, "not knowing God, ye were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods; but now, knowing God, but rather being known by God, how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly principles to which ye desire to be again anew in bondage? Ye observe days and months and times and years". We see, therefore, how christendom today has gone back to the teaching that this epistle refutes, for these are the things that are observed -- days and months and times and years.
C.E.B. Were they beneath their proper dignity in that?
J.T. Surely. God had a right to introduce the idea of time, which is treated of fully in chapter 3 and the beginning of chapter 4, but now He has reached what belongs to eternity; that is, sonship is a relationship that belongs to eternity, and the Galatians had dropped down from that, and resumed the old way of days and months and years -- what had obtained in Judaism and paganism.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the expression, "if son, heir also" -- the connection between sonship and heirship?
J.T. I suppose it is a principle in Scripture that heirship goes with sonship in Christ, and so with us.
H.M.S. Do we have both those in eternity? In @Revelation 21:7 it says, "He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son".
J.T. The thought is linked there with sonship.
{361}
H.E.S. Is the thought in sonship our position, and the thought in heirship a portion?
J.T. The inheritance is like the income by which the dignity of sonship is maintained. Sonship is the dignity, heirship implies the income, whatever it might be called, to sustain us in that dignity.
M.W.B. The inheritance is rather what *we* have, sonship being for God.
J.T. Just so. His inheritance comes in there; He has an inheritance in the saints.
L.D.M. In @Romans 8 you get the same wonderful expression, "Abba, Father", and then it says, "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God. And if children, heirs also", verses 16, 17. Would you say a word as to the difference there?
J.T. There is not much. It is quite a common thought that children come in for what is their father's. You see it with Isaac. "Unto him has he given all that he has", @Genesis 24:36. The son comes into that; being son, he is heir.
Rem. In verse 1 it speaks of the child not being able to enter into what belongs to him as heir.
J.T. The word "child" there means just that he is a minor, in the way we speak. In @Romans 8, the children are not minors; they are the same persons who are sons. The glory of the children of God is spoken of in that chapter, which is sonship; all is to be in the liberty of the glory of the children of God. Sonship goes on into eternity; it is the primary thought of God, whereas children seems to be a term that applies to us here as the objects of care; and the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God, because there is much that may deny it. The Holy Spirit maintains us in the sense that we are children of God, and being children, heirs too, heirs with Christ, a comforting thing, for we are the objects of opposition as children here.
Ques. Why does it say "through God", verse 7?
{362}
J.T. You will notice there is a questionable reading: "of God through Christ", it may be. But it is safe to accept this reading. That is, God has made you that; it is instrumentality. "Heir also through God" is certainly a position that stands; you can never be disinherited; there is no power in the universe to disinherit the christian.
Ques. Is it linked with what was said as to "God is one"?
J.T. Just so; it is the fixity of the thing. "Through God". I can never be disinherited if I am an heir "through God".
H.M.S. J.N.D.¬s translation shows that it is God Himself who has made us heirs.
J.T. Yes, it is instrumentality.
Eu.R. What had you in mind earlier when you said he came down to the thought of formation on the principle of birth?
J.T. It comes out in the next paragraph. He again returns in verse 12 to the thought of changeableness, which he alluded to at the outset, and says, "my temptation, which was in my flesh, ye did not slight nor reject with contempt; but ye received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. What then was your blessedness? for I bear you witness that, if possible, plucking out your own eyes ye would have given them to me. So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you? They are not rightly zealous after you, but desire to shut you out from us, that ye may be zealous after them. But it is right to be zealous at all times in what is right, and not only when I am present with you". And now, he comes to a stop. He is evidently so full of the thing that he is dealing with, that he stops, and says, "my children" -- he is getting nearer to them -- "of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you". The damage done was really, you might say, fundamental; they were so damaged, and that is the state of christians generally today; they are terribly
{363}
damaged, not only by bad doctrine, but bad influences. So he has to take on the maternal exercise. It is no longer a question of telling them the truth in an objective way, but agonising in birth until Christ was formed in them. It is the subjective state he is aiming at now, to deliver them from the terrible damage that had been caused by the Judaisers; and not only the doctrine they taught, but their influence, because they really wanted to keep the apostle from them, to have them as partisans.
J.T.S. Is there any special force in the way that, in the close of verse 14, Paul says, they had received him "as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus"?
J.T. It alludes to the extravagance that is often seen in christians making too much of any servant. Not that the apostle was not deserving of all they could lavish upon him, but it seems as if it was beyond their real spiritual state. It was more than a super-appreciation of the apostle; it was a manifestation that was untrustworthy. When people make much of you, what is their motive? Why is it they are so lavish? Then he says, "if possible, plucking out your own eyes ye would have given them to me". They were thus affected, and yet that does not remain; the next person that comes along affects them also, and, as we have said before, it marks the shallowness and fickleness of the state of the Galatians.
P.L. Would the thought of sonship put the Spirit in superiority, so that the feelings which are described here would be under control?
J.T. Yes, under spiritual control. The Spirit of adoption involves maturity. It is not a minor or childlike condition, but manhood that is implied, and what should go with that is balance, not unduly estimating brethren who are labouring among us, but according to what is right; of course we are to hold them in honour for their work's sake.
J.H.T. Would right estimation be seen in Philippians, "because ye have *me* in your hearts" @Philippians 1:7?
{364}
J.T. Just so. Even that generally spiritual company of believers as they were, needed to revive their thinking of him, but still, there was the balance there. But here was a state that was extravagant, and another comes along and bewitches them; they are capable of being bewitched, as it says, so that they turned away from Paul.
A.J.B. Would this principle help in our localities as to receiving individuals into fellowship? Perhaps we sometimes make too much of them and spoil them.
J.T. Very often, especially if they are persons of note in the world. That has to be watched. Balance is of immense importance in dealing with persons, and I think the Spirit of adoption implies that manhood, which implies balance, is there.
C.A.C. Would you mind saying what is the thought of Christ being formed in them? What is the precise force of it here?
J.T. The reading stops, and then he goes on, "my children, of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you". I should think it is in line with what we have been remarking. Christ formed in the christian, means that Christ is there in all His parts, so to speak; not merely that I believe on Him; He is in me in a fixed way, as in conception and birth there is the formation of the child. It may be in a small way in the christian, but there is fixity in the position Christ has in the believer, in the figure that is used: "until Christ shall have been formed in you". That is how I understand it.
C.A.C. Is it a question of spiritual apprehension?
J.T. I suppose it is. Perhaps you would tell us something about it?
C.A.C. No; I am asking because I should like a more definite thought as to what is implied in Christ being formed in saints, in this particular setting.
J.T. Spiritual apprehension must precede it; but the figure of travail in the apostle would be transferred
{365}
now to you or to me. There is no apostle now to travail, although any of us may be concerned about others; but travail, I apprehend, necessarily is involved in the formation, and is a powerful figure in this connection. It alludes spiritually to what goes on in the believer, especially in his lower affections.
G.A.v.S. Would "formed in you" be collective, seen in the Galatians as a christian company, or would it be individual?
J.T. It must be individual, although it does not say formed in each of you. It is the principle that is in view, the principle of formation, involving fixity.
E.J.McB. Is not the idea in birth that everything is there?
J.T. That is what I was thinking -- Christ in all His features, but there through travail. That is, it is not a light matter: "until Christ shall have been formed in you". The travail was in Paul, in this case, but the implication is that it is necessary in all cases to this result, that Christ should be proportionately in christians.
D.L.H. Would the verse, "no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me" @Galatians 2:20, give an exemplification of Christ being formed?
J.T. The apostle would exemplify the thing in himself. The full result is seen in him. Christ being formed must mean in all His features, so that the full thought of manhood is there, at least potentially.
Ques. Would @Ephesians 4:13 help? "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". It seems to come in there so that the Ephesians might not be carried away like the Galatians.
J.T. The full-grown man is the end in view, but that must begin somehow, and the figure of birth here is very striking. It must accompany this in all cases. The aim of ministry is that very thing, "until we all arrive", only he uses this remarkable figure to show
{366}
how tremendously he was affected about them; and in some sense this travail must always accompany this formation. Christianity in this sense is not a superficial thing. Superficiality marked them, but this formation is not superficial; it is depth and fixity.
M.W.B. Do you mean it must accompany it on the part of the labourer or of those who have Christ formed in them?
J.T. Both; it is a principle in christianity that this depth and fixity amongst us is accompanied by this exercise.
L.D.M. The Lord speaks in @John 16 of a man born into the world; @John 16:21.
C.A.C. Is this the crux of the whole situation?
J.T. It is, and it is the way that superficiality and fickleness are met.
Eu.R. So at the end of the chapter, is the same thought continued? You get "he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit". There is no affinity between the two; you are either one or the other.
J.T. Quite so. I would suggest that perhaps we might stop here. The remaining part of the chapter is very important, and the Lord may give us a clear view of it tomorrow, if He permit.
{367}
THE LIBERTY OF SONSHIP (5)
@Galatians 5
J.T. In the readings before us today we should keep in mind the points that direct upward in the remaining part of the epistle. These really begin with the Spirit as received in chapter 3, and then the Spirit of God's Son in chapter 4, sonship itself being involved, and Christ being formed in the saints. Then particularly "Jerusalem above", the word "above" pointing to the higher levels to which God would lead us. Then, in chapter 6, we have such thoughts as "ye who are spiritual", and "eternal life" and "new creation"; all these points embrace the truth in its higher levels, for it is only thus that the relatively lower features of the truth can be maintained according to God.
We reached yesterday afternoon, in chapter 4, the subject of formation, which, as was remarked, is perhaps the crux of the subject, for without it there can be no building up or elevation; and formation -- Christ being formed in us -- belongs to the phase of the truth that deliverance requires. There can be no stability or maturity, and hence no real foundation for building or entrance into heavenly or exalted thoughts, aside from Christ being formed in us. And what may be further remarked as to this great subject, is that it arises from the apostle's own service to the Galatians, and their relation to him as children. He addresses them thus in verse 19 of chapter 4: "my children". He purposes to speak from a maternal point of view; and the figure would carry with it the desire of a mother that the features of the father should be seen in the children. That is what the apostle aimed at. He had brought forward the paternal side of the truth in his announcing the glad tidings to them, and he had travailed, as he says, in birth, because he had to do it again now; hence, he had already travailed for them, as ministering among
{368}
them. He not only presented the truth in the gospel, but laboured before God in the exercises of a true mother, that the features of the father, so to speak, should be there, that there should be an all-round formation in the children, for the full expression of the father; that is figuratively, the full expression of Christ in Galatia. Therefore the allusion to travail is ministerial. It is a question of what those who minister are to have in mind; not only the presentation of the gospel or the truth, but the travail, the concern that those who are ministered to should be affected, in the sense that the features of Christ should be there, and there in a fixed way, as formed in them. That makes the ministerial side solemn and testing. Preaching or ministering the truth is comparatively easy, although there is the exercise one has in getting things from the Lord; but the watching over the saints who are ministered to, that the effect may be all-round and normal, that there may be no stuntedness or malformation in those ministered to, but a full formation of Christ in His moral features -- this is no easy matter.
A.S.L. Would you say that Christ formed in the saints was the commencement, as it were, and until that was the case there could be no building up?
J.T. Yes; it is really foundational in the saints, as to what God has in mind in the reproduction of Christ in them; just as a mother would wish the father to be reproduced in the family. Evidently the enemy began his work in Galatia immediately after the apostle's work, and alas! the conditions were only too convenient for such work.
A.S.L. Then there is the formation of Christ going on all the time. It is progressive and continuous.
J.T. It is more initial, but then there is growth in it: "until we all arrive ... at the full-grown man", @Ephesians 4: 13.
Ques. Would what you spoke of as the principles in chapter 3 be preparatory to this in an external way?
{369}
J.T. The principle on which the apostle ministered, on which the miracles were performed, the Spirit ministered and the gospel announced, was that of faith; and not only faith possessed by the person who ministered, but faith assumed to be in those ministered to. There can be no bringing in of Christ aside from that, for in truth it is Christ *as He is now*, apprehended by faith.
Eu.R. Did I understand you to speak of a certain relation between what we speak of as deliverance and this thought of Christ formed in you?
J.T. It is deliverance from oneself and the formation that had been there. Of each one born into this world naturally, the parents have some ideal, and the desired formation is according to that, and so it involves displacement.
L.D.M. In verse 19 it says, "of whom I again travail in birth": does that show that something had been done, but the work had been spoilt?
J.T. That is clearly the inference. He has to go over the ground again. He is at a distance now, not there to see what malformation had taken place. Not being actually present when he writes the letter, he says, as it were, I would like to be there and see how you are. But in a general way he assumes that his work is more or less spoilt, and he has to go over the ground again. The letter shows how he did this. What feelings were stirred up in him in view of all this!
L.D.M. Would that bear out the thought of fickleness you have spoken of?
J.T. It shows how fickle they were and how easily turned aside; he uses the word "bewitched", and hence the greater difficulty in the formation of Christ in them.
F.J.F. Would the examples we have in the Acts, of those born in a certain condition and who never had walked, be in contrast to this -- the complete thing being brought to light?
J.T. The man at Lystra who may be alluded to as
{370}
in the district, would convey the thought of formation; he "had never walked", it says; chapter 14: 8. In connection with the man in chapter 3, there is a distinction to be noticed. It says, "a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb" @Acts 3:2. The man in chapter 14, it says, was "impotent in his feet ... lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked" @Acts 14:8. There is a difference in that the gentiles never had walked; God does not take account of them thus. The lame man in chapter 3 may have been able to limp along, which possibly is an allusion to what might have been seen amongst the Jews, but the gentiles are not regarded as ever having walked. So that the lame man at Lystra is a more apt subject for Paul's line, and he is wholly recovered. He has intelligence; it says that he heard Paul speaking, the Spirit noting that. Others heard him, of course, but the Spirit would not pay attention to any hearing that was not effective. This man heard Paul speaking, and the way that Paul is mentioned in chapter 14 would indicate he was a model in the way of speaking. He was the chief speaker there, and this man is noticed as having heard him. Then, on the other hand, Paul saw "that he had faith to be healed", that is, there was a state there for complete deliverance or recovery. Over against the characteristic Galatian, this man was a subject for the work of God in its full thought, both as regards his intelligence and his faith.
Ques. Would Titus be a concrete example of one in whom Christ had been formed as a child of Paul?
J.T. I should think he was. As we have had it already, he was taken up deliberately as a representative of the work of God amongst the nations.
G.J.E. In the gospel of John, in teaching His disciples of the coming of the Spirit, the Lord Jesus brings forth all the wonderful features of Christ in chapters 13 to 16, and then at the end of chapter 16, He says, "ye will be grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy. A woman, when she gives birth to a
{371}
child, has grief because her hour has come; but when the child is born, she no longer remembers the trouble, on account of the joy that a man has been born into the world" @John 16:20. Is that the completion of the formation of Christ in us?
J.T. It is. "A man" would be the fruit in the disciples of their exercises, and the great sorrow they went through, and hence the joy, the answer to Christ. It is not His sorrow that is in mind, but their sorrow, so that it would issue in a man. I believe that was in mind from the outset. Eve is the first human being to use the word "man"; she says, "I have acquired a man with Jehovah" @Genesis 4:1. Evidently she had gone through her sorrow, for that was imposed upon her on account of her sin; she would bring forth in sorrow, but she said she had acquired a man with Jehovah. It was not a babe, but a man, in her mind.
C.S.S. Is the man-child caught up in Revelation, the same thought? Is that the end of it?
J.T. That is Christ personally, but the idea of a man is there; it was a man-child. But I would like to get a little more clear on Mr. E.¬s remarks, because I believe they convey the fulness of what we are dealing with. The disciples had their sorrow, and the Lord encourages them by bringing in the allegory of a woman suffering in childbirth, but the suffering is swallowed up in the joy that a man is born.
F.G.W. Could you help us as to a remark made by J.B.S. as to the necessity for changing your man? How does that fit in with what you are saying?
J.T. Changing your man is what the apostle had in mind in his travail; that the right Man should be in the minds of the Galatians -- that is, Christ.
A.S.L. Was that what was lacking with the Galatians, to use the expression, that they did not understand the change of man?
J.T. That is right, and I think the minister ought to make that clear; that Christ is the kind of Man that
{372}
is to be formed in the saints. At Corinth, the apostle had the full thought: "I have espoused you unto one man", @2 Corinthians 11: 2. There it is more in view of the assembly, but this is for the expression of Christ here in His fulness amongst the saints; as a mother, as I was saying, would desire for her children to have the life and demeanour of her husband; that would be her ideal.
Ques. Do we get a figure of that in the birth of Benjamin? His mother said he was the son of her affliction, but his father called him the son of his right hand, bearing the basic features of the father.
J.T. The exercises of the father and the mother are brought in there.
A.S.L. Do you think that on the personal experimental side, the truth of Christ formed in one is expressed in chapter 2: 20? "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me".
J.T. Yes; that is the fulness of the thought in Paul. So that the minister is an example of what he is agonising for. You are yourself, and you would like the saints to be formed after Christ, and so, I do not wish to be anything different from Christ. If I desire to be a true minister, I should be like Him; because the saints helped through me are pretty sure to take on any characteristics I may have, and if there are any malformations with me, they are apt to be affected by them.
H.D'A.C. If Christ is not formed in the brother who ministers, you would hardly expect the formation of Christ in the convert.
J.T. That is just the point here. He says, "my children". I have to bear in mind that if I am to beget children they will be pretty much like me; and if I am like Christ, they will be like Him.
A.S.L. Is that the point of "Christ ... crucified among you" here?
J.T. First of all, Christ was portrayed there. That is the kind of Man you have seen, not only spoken of
{373}
but portrayed. That is the kind of Man that came under the eye of the Galatians. It was undoubtedly in Paul himself, but may have been in others also. But there it was, and that One crucified.
J.R.S. Does the malefactor crucified with the Lord in @Luke 23 illustrate it at all? On his own part he said, "we indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this man has done nothing amiss" @Luke 23:41.
J.T. The thief would have the foundation in his soul of "this man"; Christ came into his soul; He had done nothing amiss. Affections would be very small in him, of course, but still, that is the idea.
H.E.S. When you speak of formation as such, do you leave room for growth and development?
J.T. Yes. Christ formed in you is somewhat initial, but I should not like to limit it. Development is what the mother is concerned about as soon as the children are born, so to speak; it is her concern, and the apostle has the maternal thought in mind in the figure he uses, that, as soon as the children are born, they should have a right example before them, that the formation should be according to her ideal. The ideal of every minister of Christ is Christ, and not only the ideal, but there is the reflection of Christ in him.
L.D.M. Mark's gospel opens with the full thought of the "Son of God", and brings out the feelings of the Lord Jesus in His service. Is that a pattern for us?
J.T. It is the levitical gospel, and the apostle's remarks here are really ministerial in that way. The minister takes account of his children in a maternal way, agonising or suffering for them under the figure of travail, until Christ shall have been formed in them. There is no cessation of the agonies in the matter until the thing is reached; it goes on, and that makes the position of the servant so solemn; that in having to do with the Lord's people there should be this concern as to the reproduction of Christ in them.
{374}
A.F.M. Would the climax be in @Ephesians 4, in the elements brought in in verse 13? "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man". @Ephesians 4:13 Is not that the end of it?
J.T. Yes. There must be growth, but the mother's anxiety is to get the thing instilled. I think that is what is meant by formation, that Christ as the ideal of faith has a footing so to speak in all His features in the children.
M.W.B. Should this be reached in the soul, in view of the complete thought? That is, it should be definitely reached in soul history by every christian.
J.T. That is right, and there is no cessation of the minister's concern until it has taken place.
H.M.S. How does this exercise of the apostle contrast with the exercise of Moses in Numbers, when he says to God, "Have I conceived all this people, have I brought them forth, that thou sayest to me ... ?" (@Numbers 11:12).
J.T. That was a poor statement on the part of Moses. I have no doubt in his normal exercises he had something of Paul's thought in mind. The people were nursed by God in the desert for forty years, we are told in the Acts (chapter 13: 18), but through whom did He work? I have no doubt it was through Moses and Aaron and Miriam. They were sent before Israel. The formation was in them; the divine ideal was in those three, and their exercises normally would be that the people should come to that. I believe Deuteronomy has that in mind especially.
H.M.S. We do have in Deuteronomy the thought of God being both father and mother to Israel. "Of the Rock that begot thee wast thou unmindful, and thou hast forgotten God who brought thee forth", @Deuteronomy 32:18.
J.T. Quite so. Then we have in the prophet Isaiah: "look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the
{375}
hole of the pit whence ye were digged", @Isaiah 51:1. Abraham and Sarah are in view here. These thoughts run right through.
G.A.v.S. Would you say that the Thessalonian saints had been formed through paternal and maternal exercises, as we read in the first epistle?
J.T. I was thinking of the apostle's remarks as to his service there in his letter to them, as bearing on what we are saying: "as a nurse would cherish her own children" @1 Thessalonians 2:7. There was the skill of the nurse with the feelings and affections of the mother. That was how he laboured amongst the Thessalonians, but notwithstanding, he had grave anxieties lest Satan might get in there, but he did not.
W.C.G. Does the initial work that you have suggested develop under the principle of hope? In verse 5, it says, "For we, by the Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness". Is it the hope of conformity to Christ in glory?
J.T. No doubt, but this agonising is the thing, and the presentation of Christ in yourself before those to whom you minister; and then the agony, the suffering and the travail that it should come about in the saints too.
Ques. It says in relation to the saints at Philippi that Paul had great joy: "A wise son maketh a glad father", @Proverbs 10:1. This epistle speaks of the fickleness and shallowness that marked the Galatians: "A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bore him" (@Proverbs 17:25), bears on that.
Ques. Would this exercise as to formation be seen in Hannah, and the thought of growth in the bringing of the coat from year to year?
J.T. That is a very good reference. She would be aware of the extent of his growth in every coat she made, because she would make it to fit. It would be in her mind all the time, How much has he grown?
Ques. Would you say the children, the young men,
{376}
and the fathers set forth the varying degrees in which Christ is formed in us?
J.T. I suppose so. There are the gradations of the family from John's point of view.
C.A.C. Is there the thought of a pure strain being secured without admixture, that will spiritually correspond with what has been presented ministerially? This freedom from admixture was not seen in Ishmael; there was admixture; and there was not a pure strain secured in the Galatians, notwithstanding what they had received. There was necessity for the production of a pure strain as the result of holy travail, which would correspond with all that had been presented in ministry and was seen in Paul. I was wondering whether this exercise would not have very special bearing upon us in view of the remarkable way in which the truth of sonship has been brought before us in recent years whether there does not need to be the accompaniment of holy travail, that we may be a seed with no admixture which would lead to vacillation and instability.
J.T. So that the desire of old was for "wholly a right seed", @Jeremiah 2: 21.
Ques. The "children of the free woman", is that the idea?
J.T. That is what we are leading on to now. The apostle brings in conveniently an allegory, as he calls it, from Genesis, in the two women, amplifying the maternal side. "Hagar", he says, "is mount Sinai in Arabia", which genders to bondage. "She is in bondage with her children"; she has no right seed, no right ideal; it is not the wholly right seed. The book of Malachi brings in the figure of marriage in youth: "And did not one make them? and the remnant of the Spirit was his. And wherefore the one? He sought a seed of God. Take heed then to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth", @Malachi 2:15. Husbands are to look after their spirits, as if God had
{377}
in mind at the very end of the Old Testament this thought, to have a right seed, not a mixed seed.
M.W.B. So for the right usage of the name Father there would necessarily have to be the formation spoken of here, and the Spirit of adoption operative.
J.T. So if we are to keep on the high level which I believe the Lord would have us to keep in these readings, that is the thing. It is complete deliverance; and not only so, but power to have part in the divine realm.
P.L. Those sleeping in Gethsemane on that occasion had no part in the divine realm, and they did not hear the words, "Abba, Father".
Ques. Would @Psalm 22 fit in with what has been said? After the Lord's great sorrow, it says, "A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born" @Psalm 22:30.
J.T. They will be born and brought up in the light of what is presented in that Psalm.
J.J. Then, would not this verse that stands alone verse 27 -- being a quotation from immediately after @Isaiah 53 (it is the first verse of chapter 54) also show how great was the travail of the Lord that the children of the desolate might be more numerous than those of her that had a husband?
J.T. It is brought in to show that all those who have faith are accredited to Jerusalem, but not through her travail. She is, alas! desolate, but God in grace will in due course accredit all to her. The travail really was the travail of Christ.
H.M.S. To her astonishment she will say, "Who hath borne me these?" (@Isaiah 49:21).
M.W.B. Will you say what part "Jerusalem above" has, as connected with your remarks yesterday, that the lack of power to enter on to the line of privilege conveyed in the relationship of Father is possibly owing to
{378}
our lack of apprehension of the covenant? Is there a link between "Jerusalem above" and the covenant?
J.T. There is. It is not exactly the new covenant that is in mind here. There are two covenants mentioned, but it is the promise to Abraham that is in mind; nevertheless, it is a covenant, it is a disposition of God, and may be rightly connected with the Lord's supper, because it is what God is. "God is one", and the promise was by Himself, and wholly depended upon Himself, and the bearing of it was liberty. Hence "Jerusalem above is free" and she is our mother. She was "the free woman", as she is called here, as formally united to Abraham, in view of a wholly right seed. She was equal morally to her husband, and she is honourably quoted here, "Cast out the maid servant"; her very words are called scripture, showing what a woman she was, and how worthy to be a type of the assembly, looked at in this way -- not Jerusalem in heaven, but "Jerusalem above". The moral elevation is seen in Abraham and Sarah. Her name was changed with his, showing that they were equal in the suggestion of moral elevation; and that, I think, is the point; it is "Jerusalem above".
Eu.R. So deliverance known and enjoyed, must lie at the threshold of our relations one with another assembly-wise all the time.
J.T. You can see how it works out in a gathering of saints in whom Christ is formed. A brother speaking is not in the front of the picture; he does not want that, he wants *Christ* there.
Rem. You are not content to see a few bearing these features; but there are so many who are not bearing them that this travail goes on all the time.
J.T. That is right, and hence if you look abroad on the field and say, Well, this meeting or that meeting is in a poor way, and saints in that district have never got on well -- that is a matter of information only; there is not travail in that. I have to face this matter.
{379}
Why are conditions in that district so weak? And if I begin to suffer about these matters, then something will happen.
Rem. I was thinking in relation to the brethren of Gideon, how their features were so much alike, the one to the other, that they were easily recognisable. It was said, "As thou art, so were they". And he said, "They were my brethren, the sons of my mother", @Judges 8: 18,19.
G.A.v.S. Is the point, "Cast out the maid servant and her son", the securing of that pure strain that was referred to earlier?
J.T. Yes; he "shall not inherit with the son of the free woman". The influence would be most detrimental -- that is what you had in mind? What a detrimental influence such a young man as Ishmael, who may have been thirteen years older than Isaac, would have in the house; and that is exactly what happened in Galatia; Ishmael was brought in. Even Abraham failed in it: "Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!" @Genesis 17:18 He would retain the man born after the flesh. It is an older thing, and developed, and more difficult; hence the word, "Cast out the maid servant and her son". That is, she represents the covenant that genders to bondage, and her son is the product of that.
J.H.T. Would @John 8 suggest that Abraham came into the joy of this at the same time as Sarah made that remark?
J.T. The Lord alludes to that incident in @Genesis 21 in saying, "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced", @John 8:56. Paul might have rejoiced in what had been produced in Galatia, because they were very full in their appreciation of himself; they would even regard him as an angel. It was Christ's day in Galatia, you might say, and so, it is Christ's day wherever He is formed in the saints, and He is made everything of. Isaac was made everything of on that occasion, and, I believe, the Lord
{380}
alluded to that when He said, "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced" @John 8:56; he had been looking forward to God's promise. But then, this other boy in the house marred the situation, and Abraham was not equal to that; but Sarah was, and that is the reason she is honoured here. It is the assembly viewed normally; she is equal to it, and refuses Ishmael. Paul and Barnabas and Titus represented this principle when they went up to Jerusalem together; "Cast out the maid servant and her son"; that is really the effect they had in mind.
Ques. Do you see the wholly right seed in Jabez? It is said, "his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bore him with pain. And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, Oh that thou wouldest richly bless me, and enlarge my border ..." @1 Chronicles 4:9 There is a reference to the "Israel of God" in the last chapter of this epistle.
J.T. That is a helpful reference. He called upon the God of Israel, that he might be blessed and enlarged. I suppose his mother had the God of Israel as her ideal, and she passed it on to her son.
W.C. In that way, would Jabez represent one that was weaned? He does it himself.
J.T. Quite so. Ishmael remained under the direction of his mother, she took a wife for him; but the child of promise -- where there is formation according to God, the full-grown man -- acts in personal liberty.
P.L. The boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah; is that the result of weaning? Does Hannah, too, travail in regard of her day; and then in her song, does she reach Christ's day: "he will give strength unto his king", @1 Samuel 2:10?
J.T. It is a prayer, but really is a song; showing how jubilant and full she was of the thought when she had weaned him. But it is not put that way with Sarah. As regards Isaac, it is that he was weaned; meaning that the principle of weaning was in that household, so
{381}
that the child of promise, born after the Spirit, comes into a developed state and acts for himself. The parents of the man in @John 9 say, "He is of age: ask him" @John 9:21, and he was, although he was only a young convert.
J.J. Is there anything important in the fact that Abraham and Isaac are the only two masculine names from the Old Testament mentioned in this epistle? Would it set forth the thought of the Father and the Son, and emphasise the thought of sonship in this epistle?
J.T. I am sure it does. Someone was speaking lately about his own son who is sixty-three years of age. Well, I do not think that is quite the idea of father and son as presented in Scripture. Abraham and Isaac present the idea of father and son, the son coming up in youthful freshness in his relations with his father.
P.L. And Isaac speaking to Abraham his father said, "My father!" and he said, "Here am I, my son" @Genesis 22:7.
J.T. Is that not beautiful?
P.L. Is that "Abba, Father"?
J.T. I think it is; and the answer is in keeping with it: "Here am I, my son", the beautiful relations and affections in father and son according to God.
Ques. Would it be opportune to say a word about Abraham's reluctance? God has to say to him, "Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid", @Genesis 21:12.
J.T. It represents the danger with the most spiritual of us of coming under influence; not that he came under the influence of any person, but he was influenced naturally. He was the father of the boy, and had affection for him that Sarah could not have naturally, and it is the natural that swayed him. That has to be watched, because you may be sure the natural element is part of the material that Satan has in mind to work on, in these matters.
G.A.v.S. Is natural feeling the one element that hinders the freedom that is spoken of in the next chapter?
{382}
J.T. Yes. It is sometimes found in persons who are mature and spiritual, as, for instance, in Abraham, in Joseph, and in Samuel. The most distinguished men in the Scriptures failed on this point. It is the only point in which Joseph does fail, as far as Scripture shows, and he failed, very seriously too, showing that the most spiritual of us is exposed in this way.
M.W.B. I suppose the thing in itself is not sinful, but may be used to that end.
J.T. It is an element that Satan may use, and hence the instruction is more for those who may be spiritual and distinguished in that way, to watch lest natural influences are allowed.
Eu.R. It is seen in Peter's word to the Lord in @Matthew 16, "God be favourable to thee, Lord; this shall in no wise be unto thee", @Matthew 16:22.
J.T. It was mere natural kindness which Satan would use to turn the Lord aside from the path of obedience.
A.S.L. Is Sarah's word, "Cast out the maid servant and her son", a point for each to reach, and the evidence that Christ formed in one is a reality?
J.T. Just so, and not only what one may say oneself, but to see that the principle is maintained collectively in any gathering. It is characteristic of the assembly; it is "Jerusalem above" which, I believe, is the moral elevation that attaches to any local gathering, or the assembly as a whole, and, if that is to be maintained, Ishmael must have no place.
L.D.M. Is that the thought in "stand fast therefore"?
J.T. Now we come to the hortatory part of the epistle, which is to strengthen us in regard to what we have been having. What am I to do? "Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage". First, standing fast in the liberty, and then the warnings as to the opposite of that -- "fallen from grace", a terrible suggestion. "Fallen from grace" and fallen from first love -- these
{383}
are sorrowful suggestions, because *falling* in the full thought belongs to Satan; whereas moral elevation is the great thing in christianity, holding fast what we have.
A.S.L. It is an interesting distinction you have made between heaven and "above" -- not Jerusalem but "Jerusalem above".
J.T. It ought to be linked on with Abraham, for that is what comes out in God entering into covenant with him; his name had been "High father", and he was true to that. A man that is characteristically elevated is the man to have children, and so his name is changed. He is to have children under another name the amplification of that name, "Father of a multitude" @Genesis 17:4.
J.J. Would you connect @Psalm 87 with the thought of elevation in the end of chapter 4? "All my springs are in thee", @Psalm 87:7.
J.T. Quite so; that expression really alludes to Zion.
C.S.S. In connection with what you have said, do you think we need to know more of the depth of the words, "Holy Father", before we can understand the blessedness of "Abba, Father"?
J.T. That is a wholesome remark, for how can we say, "Father", save with holy lips?
P.L. So it is a separated people to whom God says, "I will be to you for a Father", @2 Corinthians 6:18.
H.M.S. You have it in Peter: "Be ye holy, for I am holy. And if ye invoke as Father him who, without regard of persons ..." (@1 Peter 1:17).
J.T. Yes. I would suggest again that we keep the elevated thoughts in mind, that we might finish up in that way.
{384}
THE LIBERTY OF SONSHIP (6)
@Galatians 6
J.T. The outstanding features leading upward in this chapter are, the allusion to "ye who are spiritual", the thought of "eternal life", the rule of "new creation", and the "Israel of God". The Lord, I believe, would direct our thoughts to these features of the truth, in our closing reading. First of all, it would seem that note should be taken of the responsibility of christians who are ministered to, set out in the hortatory part beginning with chapter 5; that the formation of Christ in us is in connection with the acceptance of obligation, that being put upon us, so that the truth is worked out in a moral way, through a moral process in the soul, in the acceptance of responsibility. Hence, chapter 5 begins with the injunction, "stand fast therefore", Christ having "set us free in freedom", as it reads in this translation; and among other injunctions, we are told to "walk in the Spirit". There is standing fast in the freedom in which we are set, and living in the Spirit, and walking in the Spirit, and by the Spirit awaiting the hope of righteousness, the Spirit viewed as available in the most touching way in a believer's progress; and, finally, there is the fruit of the Spirit as over against the works of the flesh; and then, the service to one another by love. These are the elements of progress put upon us as obligations; hence, the ministers, while setting out the truth in all its parts objectively, are to exhort, which is something perhaps not so much practised, but essential to the formation of the saints and their growth; reproving, rebuking, and exhorting, as it is said elsewhere "with all longsuffering and doctrine", @2 Timothy 4:2. It takes more moral power to reprove, rebuke, and exhort, than it does to set out the truth itself.
P.L. Do you get the idea in Malachi? "Remember
{385}
the law of Moses my servant" (@Malachi 4:4) -- is that the truth set out? And then, "Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet ... And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers" (verses 5, 6) -- is that the exhortation?
J.T. That is a good setting out of the thing. "The law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him ... for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances". Elijah's ministry was one of rebuke and reproof; he was one who had moral authority, coming out without any announcement or word as to his training, but he stands up and says, "there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except by my word" @1 Kings 17:1. He was a man surely possessed of authority, but then, he was a man that prayed. The power to rebuke is very much needed; and one is not speaking of it because one has much ability in it, but one sees the need of moral power in the ministers, so that they may be able to do it. The saints are viewed in this chapter as set up in Christ, and furnished with the power to move in that liberty.
The works of the flesh are given at length; and there is that maturity of service, not in any specific way, but "by love serve one another" @Galatians 5:13. Then the fruit of the Spirit is mentioned, so that the crop for God should be seen, if it be there. If it be present, in those circumstances, the crop for God may easily be discerned. For that is indeed the end of all ministry, what is for God. But the chapter, in the main, has in mind the working out of things in the believer's soul.
A.F.M. Would you tell us why the Holy Spirit is brought in so much in this epistle? Was it because there was a lack of recognising Him amongst the saints in Galatia?
J.T. Manifestly so; they are owned as having received Him, but in turning aside from the truth of the gospel, they necessarily shut out the Spirit, and in recovery, what is shut out or rendered null, has to be asserted. If the means that God has supplied for a
{386}
holy walk here and fruit-bearing is shut out, there is no hope unless room can be made for it; so that it is practically worked out in the two great salient thoughts of the cross and the Spirit -- the acceptance of crucifixion, and making room for the Spirit.
A.S.L. How would you define the liberty that is spoken of? "Christ has set us free in freedom". @Galatians 5:1
J.T. The liberty is something already existent before you are brought into it, so you are set free in it.
A.S.L. The liberty belonging to the children of the free woman.
J.T. One set free is set free in that.
R.F. Would the liberty be seen in the disciples moving in the corn-field? It says that they went on before, as if they had perfect liberty to move.
J.T. Yes. The Lord gives the lead. He was never otherwise than in liberty, and He has inaugurated liberty for us, and we come into it. It is seen in that circumstance in that He moved into the corn-field, and the disciples walked on and did more; they took the corn and ate it. They were set free in freedom; the freedom was there in His movements. The liberty is inaugurated by Christ, and opened up for us, so that we are to stand in that. Those who objected to what the disciples were doing, would put them back under bondage, but the Lord shows from the scriptures that that thought of liberty had already been taken on by David and others. He was taking it now, and the disciples were taking advantage of it and enjoying it. This epistle is very like that, because it is the defence of the liberties we have.
A.F.M. Was the apostle a model of liberty? It is going back a little, but in verse 12 of chapter 4, he says, "Be as *I* am, for *I* also am as *ye*, brethren".
J.T. Exactly; he was free from law, and so are we. That is a very good word to use, in seeking to help our brethren who are in bondage in the human organisations around. Abstractly they are free as we are, that is,
{387}
the liberty established belongs to them, so that the word is, "Be as *I* am". I am in the enjoyment of this, and why not you? Because you are as I am; you have the right to liberty as I have; but I am enjoying it, and you are not.
Eu.R. If they are in the system that genders to bondage, we should seek to set before them the liberty of the divine system which is above.
J.T. It is our business to lead them into the liberty that belongs to them; it is their heritage. They are on the same footing in that sense, but not practically. "Be as *I* am" means, be in the liberty I am in: "*I* also am as *ye*" as regards right.
Eu.R. This is what is proper to the children of the free woman. Chapter 4 ends with the "children of the free woman", and chapter 5 maintains us in that liberty.
W.C.G. The liberty belongs to all, but it is entered upon by those who yield to the Spirit.
J.T. They value this great freedom that is inaugurated in Christ, but they can only stand fast in it by the Spirit.
W.C.G. In that way they become spiritual.
J.T. The next chapter, you may say, is based on that: "ye who are spiritual". It is a comfort that there are some. He does not say, If there are any; evidently there were, and that would be the nucleus of the recovery, that there were some.
J.T.S. Is the law seen in another setting in this chapter, not as slaying me now, but as fulfilled, as in the liberty of the Spirit and the power of life?
J.T. That is right. "The whole law is fulfilled in one word" @Galatians 5:14. If the Galatians wanted the law, this is the thing. The spirit of the law is this, fulfilled in this one word -- love. It is a great triumph that christianity, whilst immune from the law in the letter of it, maintains it in the spirit of it. So that @Romans 8 says, "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh
{388}
but according to Spirit", @Romans 8:4. That is, there is nothing lost, not a jot or a tittle of the law is abrogated, but is carried forward and maintained in christianity.
S.P. Would the thought of "the law of the Christ" suggest the fixed principles you spoke of?
J.T. That is carrying burdens. What marked the Lord all the way through was that He carried the burdens of others; He carried our sorrows, and He carries the lambs in His bosom. The Lord never shirked anything in this respect. "I am in the midst of you as the one that serves", @Luke 22:27. That was the law that governed Him.
L.M. Why is verse 22 in the singular, although a number of things are enumerated? It says, "But the fruit of the Spirit is ..." Does that fit in with the uniform development you spoke of in connection with formation?
J.T. There are nine items, but it is one idea. When the flesh is mentioned, the works are manifest, each one of them exposed; but "the fruit of the Spirit" rather suggests a unified thought. There is regularity in it, and the items appear in relation to one another.
Rem. Under the old economy, if a man had a defect he had to remain with it, he could not offer the bread of his God, but in the power of the Spirit he was not forbidden to receive ministry, he could receive bread. I wondered whether in connection with @Leviticus 21, the Galatians were those who had a defect in their feet, so to say.
J.T. Yes, they were defective in this way: the christian characteristically walks in the Spirit; but what you find in the Lord's service in the gospels is that healings were never partial, but always perfect; and so now, the recovery is to what is perfect.
W.C.G. The father had received him safe and sound, it says.
J.T. That is right.
P.L. So have we the thought of the feet in relation
{389}
to Habakkuk? You have referred to the higher levels is the principle of that seen in "he maketh my feet like hinds¬ feet, and he will make me to walk upon my high places", @Habakkuk 3:19?
J.T. It would be well if we could walk out in those high places! It would enable us to take up our ordinary duties and walk in them according to God.
M.W.B. Would you distinguish between walking in the Spirit and the other expression, "led by the Spirit", in @Romans 8:14? Sonship is connected with the latter expression.
J.T. Walking is emphasised in Scripture. God is the first to whom walking is attributed in the Scriptures. He walked in the garden. That, I believe, is to inaugurate what is in mind. Again, Enoch walked with God, and Noah walked with God. Then he requires of Abraham to "walk before my face, and be perfect" @Genesis 17:1. I believe that walking in the Spirit is like the foot dipped in oil; the movements are gracious and comely; suited to such as are with God. This was perfectly seen in Jesus, of whom it is said on several occasions that He walked. John the baptist saw Him walking. I believe God attaches much to this thought: there is a certain grace in walking that God takes pleasure in.
M.W.B. What about the other expression, "led by the Spirit"?
J.T. There the allusion is to the type in @Numbers 21. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God", @Romans 8:14. Hitherto they had been led by the cloud and the tent, but that was on a different plane. When we begin to walk by the Spirit, we are as Christ is. His movements in the wilderness were by the Spirit; He was on Deuteronomy ground; and so, after the brazen serpent in the types, the saints are viewed as led by the Spirit. It is a leading that has Canaan in mind.
M.W.B. I was wondering if it had that in view,
{390}
leading on to what you have suggested as to the higher line of thought developed here.
J.T. I think so.
A.F.M. They go on to higher ground from the brazen serpent; it seems to be an upward way.
J.T. They move on from one point to another till they reach Pisgah, the high level from which Canaan is in view. Moses saw Canaan from that level.
F.S.M. Would the three Hebrew children serve to illustrate this high level of liberty. They were in the fire loose. Nebuchadnezzar observed they were loose, and said, "Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God", @Daniel 3:25. Is not that the position in which we are found -- in the midst of the fire, but liberated to be in the company of the Son of God, walking?
J.T. That is a fine suggestion. I suppose the fourth gave character to the company.
Now, having touched thus on chapter 5, we have the basis for the allusion to "ye who are spiritual", chapter 6:1. The word is not to the assembly, but implies that the spiritual are in view. The Galatians were scarcely people to whom to give instructions for local assemblies, although they are addressed as assemblies. The instructions are such as would, in the main, work out in the individual believer, indeed, assembly order and privilege are scarcely touched. So that it is "ye who are spiritual", persons of that class are addressed.
A.S.L. There is nothing between spiritual and carnal, so it was great reproach. As christians we should be spiritual. The Corinthians were carnal, walking as men, but the normal state of the christian would be spiritual.
J.T. It would be, and the fact that he singles out certain ones shows that all were not spiritual in Galatia; but there were some. What is stated is: "the spiritual
{391}
discerns all things" (@1 Corinthians 2:15); that is, he is a priest. The priests are addressed really.
H.E.S. Is a spiritual man one who moves in the Spirit in the region of freedom in Christ?
J.T. Yes. It is comforting that in Galatia there were such, notwithstanding the low state of things.
A.S.L. The spiritual would also take to heart the danger of being caught himself: "considering thyself".
J.T. That is each one considering himself.
J.J. Would not this suggestion test them as to whether they had grasped the positive side of what he had ministered in the previous part of the epistle?
J.T. It would. In the mind of the Spirit they would be like Aaron and his sons at the door of the tabernacle under a charge. They are there; and each should know that he belongs to that class. A spiritual man is one who makes full room for the Spirit in himself.
Ques. Is there a distinction between a wilful course and one taken in a fault, and if so, does that affect the question of restoration?
J.T. There would be a very great distinction between them. It is one "taken in some fault" here, not that the fault has overcome him, but he is taken in it, and certain persons might be unusually hard on him because of it. So that the spiritual are called in. It is not a course; it is an isolated fault, but he is taken in it. It does not even say he has come himself and confessed it; he is taken in it.
P.L. Would you get the idea in the two sons of Noah covering their father?
J.T. Quite so; they put the covering on their shoulders, meaning that it was no light matter to deal with; they brought their strength into it, and moved backwards, which requires instinct. That is, your eyes are elsewhere. All that needs a person of faithfulness; a spiritual man is a faithful man, who looks all round and considers what is right. The woman in @John 8, for instance, was taken in a fault.
{392}
H.D'A.C. The word "restore" here is a special one. It supposes the man was out of joint, and he is put in action again, like the setting of a broken bone, putting it in its place. It is like @Ephesians 4:12 "for the perfecting of the saints", each one set in his place in the spiritual system. The man was no use whilst out of joint. A spiritual man is not out of joint.
J.T. The woman spoken of in @John 8 was actually *taken* in the fault; they made a point of that, but they were illogical. Where is the other person in the fault? They left him out. If they were right, they should have brought him too. But the Lord shows how such things are dealt with. He stoops down and writes with His finger on the ground, which is a spiritual movement in such a case. "Considering thyself"; not that the Lord needed that, but He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
A.S.L. That would remove any hardness, the thought that one might be caught at any time oneself.
J.T. Indeed, and you are not carrying a high hand; not saying, I am holier than thou; you are stooping down. That is a sort of indication of a lead by the Lord. Of course, there is much more in what He did; but anyway it is a movement that is spiritual, under such circumstances. In this case the Lord *stooped down* and wrote on the ground, with the result that the accusers went out. The light forced them out. If I am right with God in my own soul, and I have to accuse a brother or sister, I do not need to go out; but if I have a personal motive in it, then I shall have to go out; the light exposes me. They all went out, and the woman was left alone with the Lord -- she and the Lord -- a remarkable instance in John; the other like it being in chapter 4. So that the Lord says, "Neither do I condemn thee" @John 8:11. That might be regarded as antinomianism, or looseness, but the Lord does not leave it at that. He says, "go, and sin no more".
L.D.M. Then what follows, "Every one that practises
{393}
sin is the bondman of sin", @John 8:34. So that what follows going out, is the practice of sin?
J.T. Just so, and the Lord saying solemnly, "unless ye shall believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins" @John 8:24; that is the situation. In Peter's case, the Lord looked on Him, as was said; He turned and looked on him. Luke is the only one that tells us that: "And the Lord, turning round, looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice". "While he was yet speaking, the cock crew" @Luke 22:60,61; that is, at the right time. All that was spiritual. The spiritual know what to do in those cases; the priest knew what to do when he looked on the leper.
J.H.L. "For each shall bear his own burden" -- what is that?
J.T., It is what everyone should do, he should not expect others to bear his burdens in the work. The apostle says earlier, "Bear one another's burdens", referring to the working out of love one to another; it is on the principle of love; not that I put it on others to do it; if I do I am apt to hinder the activity of their love.
H.F.N. Might we have a little in regard to the thought of eternal life, and new creation, and the "Israel of God"?
J.T. They are remarkable thoughts, but they are not expanded at all, not even mentioned to be expanded or opened up. It is as if the Spirit of God thought it well in dealing with such circumstances amongst the saints as are contemplated here, to maintain the truth, in these high levels. In going to Ephesus, Paul came by the upper road, and, when going to Jerusalem, he and Barnabas and Titus moved in spiritual buoyancy, occupying the saints *en route* with the work of God. I believe that is a principle, in dealing with evil, to maintain the high spiritual level; so that sowing to the Spirit is the next thought here. "He that sows to the
{394}
Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life". It is a suggestion that directs you to other scriptures for the thing that you reap. God has His crop in the fruit of the Spirit in chapter 5, but the believer has his crop in sowing to the Spirit.
J.O.S. Does Isaac sowing in the land and reaping a hundredfold have any suggestion in relation to this?
J.T. Sowing to the Spirit is a wilderness suggestion, and the result would be entrance into the land. The Holy Spirit given to the believer is the means of entrance into eternal life, but it is a crop, a harvest that you reap.
Eu.R. What form would sowing to the Spirit take?
J.T. It is just that in all your calculations and motives this is in mind. Sowing to the flesh is gratifying the flesh, allowing the propensities and desires which gratify the flesh; sowing to the Spirit is that you consider for the Spirit.
G.A.v.S. Is the reaping a question of God's government?
J.T. Well, I think so, very much like "glory and honour and peace to every one that works good" (@Romans 2: 10); eternal life is among the things secured there.
E.J.McB. Was the great woman sowing to the Spirit in making room for the prophet?
J.T. Indeed. The Shunammite woman follows on the widow, who had the vessels filled with the oil, and she makes provision for Elisha.
M.W.B. Does sowing suggest the idea of spiritual expenditure, parallel with @John 4 in some respects? That gives the idea of drinking or receiving, but here it is rather spending. Is that a point to be noted? The sowing implies that you expend, following on what was said, that the woman laid out in order to serve the prophet.
J.T. At the set time she was to reap. She had been barren, but now she is to have a son which is a suggestion of life. Then, the son dies, but he is given back
{395}
to her alive, and, in a sense, she has eternal life in the son back from the dead. The mother of the child took up her son living, made alive by the prophet; he is handed back to her, and she went out -- she had her fruit.
P.L. And she is still in possession of her crop after seven years of famine; this son is with her in a living way.
J.T. And Gehazi who had "fallen from grace", is able to tell the king about her.
P.L. Would you say why you regard this as a wilderness exercise?
J.T. Sowing to the Spirit undoubtedly refers to wilderness circumstances, the alternative being sowing to the flesh. The Spirit comes in in the wilderness, but the fruit contemplated is in the land.
W.C. There is a period between the sowing and the reaping in which it is possible to lose heart.
J.T. It is a question of confidence in God, really, like a farmer who sows his seed; he puts it in the ground, but then it is a question of what God will do for him. God gives the seed a body as it pleases Him. But then I have to wait for that. Certain crops take a short time to come up, others take a longer time, and it is in patience we wait for the crop, but it comes. If I sow to the flesh, I shall reap corruption, a terrible thing. Think of the hideousness of that! But sowing to the Spirit, one reaps life everlasting, even although the crop may take a good time to come. You are dependent on God, and I believe that is where a farmer has a big advantage, for he is dependent upon God directly. But think of God working for you day and night when you have put your seed in the ground! And that is the principle of sowing to the Spirit. It is the Spirit of God; and God works in that way, and you will get your crop in due course.
H.M.S. Did you say that we sow in the wilderness
{396}
and reap in the land, or do we reap in the same field in which we sow?
J.T. The wilderness is not the soil; you are the soil yourself. When Jacob came to Isaac he smelt him, and said, "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed", @Genesis 27:27. It is all potential as yet; there is no crop in the field yet. The soil is the person, but I am speaking of the outward environment, that you are in the wilderness; that is, in the testing place. The flesh is there too in you; it is the mixed condition in which one is. If I sow to the Spirit, well, the field is there. The simile is that I have the Spirit and the crop will come. Our chapter touches new creation, but eternal life is what I get for my sowing to the Spirit. Romans shows that it is the end: "But now, having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life", @Romans 6:22. But then, there is new creation, and we have to go elsewhere for that. It stands in relation to Ephesian truth, but it is touched on in Corinthians in a very instructive way: "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised", @2 Corinthians 5:14, 15. Then the apostle says, We do not know anyone after the flesh henceforth: "So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation" @2 Corinthians 5:17. I think that is where @John 9 comes in. The water of purification is usually to remove what is impure, but Siloam is to remove something that Christ put on the person. He spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and, put it on the man's eyes, and he has to go to Siloam and wash. That is, he removes what the Lord put on him. We cannot say that that is impure; it is simply that the believer is relieved of any thought of a world with Christ after the flesh in it. That is not God's mind at all! He did enter into this world;
{397}
He came born of woman, actually in the world, but not to stay in it. The believer has to come to that; that Christ died, that the flesh and blood condition has come to an end; and that the world that God has in mind involves Christ *in another condition*.
G.A.v.S. Is the question of new creation, as we have it in Galatians, more connected with the removal of the world's system? It comes in here immediately after "the world is crucified to me, and I to the world".
J.T. He says, "For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation". It is persons that are in mind. He is referring to circumcision again, his mind being full of what they were suffering from. But circumcision is nothing; they needed to come to new creation. In Corinthians it says, "So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new". Even Christ as He was here, no longer exists *in that condition*; there is no *such* Christ as existed in this world, and any one assuming that God had any such thought as the continuation of Christ as in flesh and blood here, is misled. It is Christ in *another condition*, and that involves for us new creation -- new creation does not of course refer to Him. It is God's work. God is the Creator, but I am the subject of it.
H.E.S. In these great subjects being just suggested and not developed, is there the thought that we should be encouraged to pursue them?
J.T. Yes; as for instance, in the Old Testament; in treating of certain subjects we are sometimes referred to other books; see @1 Chronicles 29:29.
W.L. Is the reaping now, or does it look on to the future?
J.T. It is now, I should say. Eternal life as come to us in Christ is not a question of sowing on my part; it is a question of the purpose of God. "For the wages of sin is death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord", @Romans 6:23. That is,
{398}
God has placed it there; but then the present crop, the present entrance into it, is made to depend on sowing, on my exercises, whether I make room for the Spirit in my calculations. If I am thinking of lands, or being wealthy, or a man of the world in any sense, I will reap corruption; but if I am calculating for God's world, I sow to the Spirit, because He is the only Medium for carrying me over.
W.L. So you would say the government of God enters into it, and that is now?
J.T. That is right, whether a man is living in God's world, or in this world.
W.A.W. Did the man in @John 9 reap in that day?
J.T. He did; as soon as he met the Son of God and believed on Him and worshipped Him. That is the principle. He did not have long to wait.
H.F.N. Would you say a word on our two privileges here, as forming part of the "household of faith" and the "Israel of God"?
J.T. The presence of the "household of faith" in this epistle is very noticeable. The allusion would primarily be to Abraham's household, and you would expect that here. Even Hagar and Ishmael belonged to it outwardly, but it is a household marked by faith. "So then, as we have occasion, let us do good towards all, and specially towards those of the household of faith". The "Israel of God", I suppose, would be the saints looked at as marked by the Spirit, but the "household of faith" is that I am in it on that principle, that I belong to that household beginning with Abraham. The "Israel of God" alludes to Jacob, that is, his flesh being crippled he came into the good of the Spirit.
M.W.B. Is that new creation?
J.T. It is concurrent with it. "And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God": this is the rule of new creation in contrast with the law of Moses.
J.J. Do you connect eternal life with new creation?
{399}
J.T. It is another line. You do not get new creation in Romans properly, but you get eternal life there. Eternal life is God's answer to death, meeting it here; but new creation is wholly new. "The old things have passed away; behold all things have become new" @2 Corinthians 5:17.
H.F.N. The "brands of the Lord Jesus" are a most touching ending to the epistle; would you say a word on them?
J.T. I suppose they mark the highest spirituality. The allusion, no doubt, would be to the marks they would put upon people's flesh, the "brands of the Lord Jesus" corresponding with His sufferings.
E.J.McB. Is that in contrast to the marks of circumcision?
J.T. It is an allusion to that. Circumcision was a sort of mutilation of the flesh, but here you have the "brands of the Lord Jesus" corresponding with Christ in His sufferings.
J.J. Are eternal life and new creation both looked at individually here?
J.T. No. "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation" @2 Corinthians 5:17. It has been pointed out that eternal life properly belongs to the earth, but new creation goes further. New creation is heaven and earth made new. The principle is already applied to the christian, that there is new creation. It is not that he is a new creature, but there is such a thing as new creation; if any man be in Christ, there is such a thing as that. Presently it will apply to heaven and earth, but the christian is in it.
G.A.v.S. Is the "Israel of God" new creation?
J.T. The reference is to those who are marked by the Spirit. The "household of faith" is Abraham; the "Israel of God" is Jacob; but new creation is that everything old is set aside -- old things are passed away, all things have become new. That is the state of things in eternity which we enter into now by the Spirit; and the christian is already the subject of new creation: "created anew in Christ Jesus".
{400}
J.T.S. We are to walk according to this rule worked out.
J.T. It is a very exalted walk. Walking according to this rule is the very highest thought of walking you can get. In Ephesians, for instance, it is said that God "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" @Ephesians 2:6 because of His great love wherewith He loved us, and then it goes on to speak of "good works, which God has before prepared that we should walk in them", @Ephesians 2:10. God has ordained them. I suppose they would be the high places, what came out in Christ, what He ordained that we should walk in. We are to find out what is ordained for us, on this exalted level as "created in Christ Jesus for good works".
C.E.T. Would the close of @Isaiah 40 fit in with what you are saying? It says, "Lift up your eyes on high, and see! Who hath created these things, bringing out their host by number? ... Dost thou not know, hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not nor tireth? There is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and shall tire, and the young men shall stumble and fall; but they that wait upon Jehovah shall renew their strength: they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not tire; they shall walk, and not faint" @Isaiah 40:26 - 31.
J.T. That is very good. We should all discern the applicability of that scripture to this thought of walking after the rule of new creation.
Ques. Would new creation bring us on to the ground of divine counsel, and the "Israel of God" show the complete triumph of God in relation to our path here?
J.T. Quite so; the "household of faith" and the "Israel of God" run together.
{401}
H.E.S. Why is "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ" in this epistle connected with the spirit, and not with the individual? Is there significance in that?
J.T. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren". They really had lost touch with God. The spirit is the highest part of a man, that in which he is in relation with God, as over against the soul. They certainly needed that, as we all do, because the point is to keep our spirits right. As we have it in @Malachi 2: "Take heed then to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth, (for I hate putting away, saith Jehovah the God of Israel;)" (@Malachi 2:15), and then again, in the end of verse 16: "take heed then to your spirit, that ye deal not unfaithfully". I believe that was the difficulty with the Galatians. The chapter in Malachi has in mind that "He sought a seed of God"; and I believe that is why the paternal and maternal thoughts are brought in in Galatians. There was want in that setting; the seed that God sought was not there, and it had to do with the spirits of the brethren.
Ques. Is there an analogy between the "brands of the Lord Jesus" here, and the Lord showing His hands and feet to the disciples?
J.T. There is; it is in correspondence with the Lord.
Ques. Does @Psalm 128 suggest the climax in the assembly?
J.T. Quite so. "Jehovah will bless thee out of Zion ... Peace be upon Israel!" @Psalm 128:5
{402}
THE SERVICE OF GOD IN A REMNANT
@Judges 9: 7 - 13; @1 Samuel 23: 6 - 12; @Leviticus 10: 12 - 15
J.T. It will be observed that in each of these scriptures, we have one person or persons spoken of whose relatives have just been slain. The whole family of Jotham's father had just been slain ruthlessly; Abiathar's father and family had just been slain similarly; and Nadab and Abihu, the priestly sons of Aaron, had been slain by Jehovah. There is that link between these scriptures; and then there is the teaching in @Leviticus 10: 12 - 15 leading up to priesthood, so as to ensure that those who have part in the service of God should function according to what He may have designed for them. Jotham's remarks have that in mind, that we are to function according to what God has intended for us; and in functioning, to be conscious that we are according to what God intended us to be, refusing to be influenced otherwise. Then, in the case of Abiathar, we have an allusion to priesthood as governed by the directions intended for it, the ephod being the priestly garment that denotes what is required by God in His priests. Then, finally, in the priests that were left -- for it is a remnant in each case -- the food that sustains them in freedom from what is natural. Those are the thoughts I had, and the Lord may use them to help us.
L.D.M. Is your thought that there is a remnant in keeping with the present day?
J.T. Yes. In Jotham's case, the family of his father had been ruthlessly slain, and so with Abiathar; but with Jotham we see superiority to the circumstances, that he is not under the power of them. He is on the top of mount Gerizim, that is in victory. He is not occupied with the calamity, nor with the fact that he was the only one left; he makes no allusion to that, but to what should continue for the service of God and man.
{403}
F.J.F. Is your thought that things should go on just as though there had been no failure?
J.T. Yes. Whilst feeling things, we are occupied with what is to continue, according to divine appointment; that is not to be interfered with. There is no disaster from God's side, there is that which continues according to His appointment. The olive tree, the fig tree, and the vine think only of functioning, and refuse to be influenced otherwise.
D.L.H. So that in priestly power we are to rise above what is natural and what would naturally affect us.
J.T. That is what stamps the three passages. The Lord Himself alludes to this passage in Samuel, and calls Abiathar the "high priest"; "in the section of Abiathar the high priest", @Mark 2:26. We should view the section from that standpoint; and so the suggestion is, that in such apparently calamitous circumstances there is to be no diminution of priestly intelligence and order.
P.L. We get it in the scripture: "Ye are sons of Jehovah your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for a dead person. For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God", @Deuteronomy 14: 1, 2.
J.T. That is another passage that corresponds. "Abiathar the high priest", the Lord calls him, and our attention is therefore directed to priesthood of the highest order. He is alluded to here as having brought the ephod with him; @1 Samuel 23: 6.
Ques. Would not the history of Abimelech show that what is not by divine appointment cannot last long? I was thinking of it in contrast to the fruitfulness of the olive, and the fig, and the vine. A history like Abimelech's might cause much in the way of tears amongst the saints, but faith would be comforted that it can only last a short time.
J.T. That is what the passage would teach. Alluding to him in verse 14 it is said, "Then said all the trees
{404}
to the thorn-bush, Come thou, reign over us. And the thorn-bush said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, come, put confidence in my shadow; but if not, fire shall come out of the thorn-bush and devour the cedars of Lebanon". Abimelech's conduct brought him quickly to an end. There was no substance there; no honour for God -- a little for himself, perhaps, in his own way of thinking, but none for God and none for men.
Ques. What would the trees represent in our day?
J.T. The olive represents the believer honouring God instead of having himself before him -- honouring God and man. You think of God and of your brethren in your service, instead of thinking of yourself.
N.K.M. Is that true fatness according to God? It says, "Should I leave my fatness?"
J.T. "Then Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked", @Deuteronomy 32:15 -- he became rebellious, but the olive retains its place, and refuses to be influenced otherwise. Although prospering, the believer is thinking of God, and men -- for you do not ignore the brethren; they are in view.
F.W.K. Is that why Jotham stands on mount Gerizim, and not on mount Ebal?
J.T. Yes, it is the mount of blessing. The position denotes superiority to the circumstances, that he is occupied not with himself, or like Elijah, saying, "I am left, I alone" @1 Kings 19:10. That was a poor thing, he was in the wilderness on the way to Horeb, a man giving up his service. Jotham has no thought like that! The service of God is to go on as heretofore.
P.L. So that the one who says, "I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God", immediately says "I will praise thee for ever", and then, "I will wait on thy name, before thy godly ones, for it is good", @Psalm 52:8, 9. Is that honouring God and man?
J.T. That is very good. There are those who may say that they are thinking only of God, but we must think of the brethren also in our service, for we are
{405}
their servants too. It is much easier to say that I am a servant of God, than to say I am a servant of the brethren.
L.D.M. It is not only a question as to functioning, but whether we are functioning according to God.
J.T. According to God's design or intention. Jotham's remarks would show that no calamity interferes with that, but that God's service goes on.
E.L.M. Would you see the same thing with Paul in @Romans 11? There was breakdown, the people cast away, but the root and the fatness of the olive tree were there, which he would draw upon?
J.T. You mean it was carried on by the Gentiles? In any little service that is going on today, that is the public testimony; we are partaking of the root and the fatness of the olive tree. That is, God's service goes on. He has appointed that the gentiles should come in, and we are not assuming anything, but are carrying on on those lines in a public way, hoping that there is some fruit.
E.L.M. I wondered whether the breakdown in the two sons of Aaron would be the result of their not feeding on that food.
J.T. We shall come to that, but what a food indeed, to sustain us in the priesthood! We are to continue, according to @Romans 11, to stand by faith, to continue in God's goodness on that principle. Jotham represents the superiority of those who might be overwhelmed with calamity. He is "on the top of mount Gerizim", and, whilst he points out the end of Abimelech, he is occupied with what is for God in blessing, which is the mark of our dispensation. Things are to go on, as the Lord said; He told His disciples He would meet them in Galilee, and He came up to them, it says, "but some doubted". Then He says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth", @Matthew 28:18. He is not hindered by the unbelief of some, but just goes on, and enjoins them to baptise and make disciples of
{406}
all the nations -- a very positive thing. Jotham's position and remarks show that there is no cessation of the service of God; God is to be honoured and cheered, and man is to be honoured and cheered.
Rem. There is not much for God in simply waving over the trees.
J.T. Nothing at all. It is just the ambition of the flesh to rule, as we see it around today in christendom. Man really would wave over the trees, but there is nothing for God in that. The passage would teach us that, and preserve us from any thought of ruling amongst the brethren.
N.K.M. Would there be feelings according to God in what Jotham says, and in the way he says it? It says, "he ... lifted up his voice, and cried": would that indicate right feelings? Then, does he speak with authority? "Hearken to me, ye citizens of Shechem, that God may hearken to you". Would that enter into his service?
J.T. He really inherits his father's spirit. His father had experienced his brethren being slain; @Judges 8:19. These are things that we ought to take note of -- the enemy's power in slaying, whether it be one's brethren or one's sons. Gideon's brethren were slain, and now Jotham's brethren are slain; that is, we have to accept that sort of thing, but still we must go on, and go on in what is positive. That is, God has His means of going on, and that is what He asserts.
J.O.S. Would @1 Corinthians 4 bear on this subject? Paul speaks to the Corinthians of their reigning as kings without us, and then he speaks of the extreme sufferings that he endured, and then how things were carried on: "For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power", @1 Corinthians 4:20.
J.T. The apostle has no thought of giving up, nor has he the slightest intention of copying what they were doing; they were reigning as kings. He said, "I would that ye reigned" @1 Corinthians 4:8, but in the true sense, which
{407}
would be a millennial thought in the kingdom. He says, "God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death ... . To the present hour we both hunger and thirst", @1 Corinthians 4: 8,11. But then, see the fruitfulness there was for God and for man! The apostles themselves are the best evidence you can get of that principle of honouring God and man. You see the spiritual fatness of the apostle in his second letter to the Corinthians, and all to the end that God might be honoured; and yet that man also might be honoured, for they were not ready to honour the poor man that had sinned. The time had come to honour him, for after all, a leper is to be restored and beautified and dignified, according to the type of the cleansing of leprosy, in @Leviticus 14. The Corinthians were not ready for that, but Paul was -- that the man should be restored; @2 Corinthians 2:7.
Ques. Is it significant that, when supremacy over the trees is in view, Jotham twice puts God first: "God and man"?
J.T. That is a word for us at this present time. Our brethren have been slain, and we may expect that, but the service of God must go on. We may say, Where is the means for it? Where are those to carry on? But Jotham has no question about that at all. It is going on, and it goes on on this principle that each retains the place that God assigns to him and fits him for. God has thought out everything, and made preparation for every contingency right to the end, and it works out in each functioning according to the divine thought of him. If each functions according to what God intends him to do, the service of God will go on.
F.J.F. So would the scripture in James come in there, that man should reflect God and be His image: "made after the likeness of God", @James 3:9? Is it so that if each one is drawing from the fatness of the olive, there will be something of God seen about him?
J.T. That is right, and the woman's place also in
{408}
1 Corinthians is made very plain. The order of God is plainly marked out for us: "But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God", @1 Corinthians 11:3. All are to function, each in his place according to divine appointment.
D.L.H. There is a scripture that has struck me very forcibly of late in @1 Corinthians 12, that every member of the body is necessary. Each one is necessary and should function according to the place in which we are set in the body, whatever it is -- sisters as well as brothers; @1 Corinthians 12:18.
J.T. So that you have the organism maintained in that way in the priest; and, as regards gift, it is said, "God has set certain in the assembly" (@1 Corinthians 12:28), not in the body. The organism goes on in each one functioning in his place in the organism; but the gifts are set in the assembly, that is, they are the same persons, but the saints viewed as an assembly.
D.L.H. What I have noticed in one's own local meeting is, that a good many of the dear saints of God come and take their place in the meeting rather as expecting that other people will do something, than that they should function themselves; whereas I suppose each one ought to bring his or her spiritual quota to the meeting, which would certainly be filled up by those who were spiritual. Do you go with that?
J.T. I do, indeed . You find in regard to gifts, that many complain they do not get visits from those who are gifted, and overlook that the principle is, "what hast thou in the house?" @2 Kings 4:2 What are you doing with what you have? Then, another thing -- indeed, it comes out here in Abimelech, he bases his claim to leadership on his relations with the citizens of Shechem. That is, he is making gift, as we may say, a sectional matter, and a matter of natural family links, whereas God sets the gifts "in the assembly" -- never in a locality, never in a country, always in the *assembly*. It is a matter to
{409}
be noted, because we are apt to think more of persons who are gifted because they are in our locality, than we do of those who are not, but to be truly assembly men and women we should regard them as in the assembly, wherever they may be geographically. That is where Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem failed. Jotham is concerned about the fact -- at least, in his remarks it is implied -- that there is the olive tree, and the fig tree, and the vine, God's creatures intended for a certain specific purpose, and each of them says, I am not going to be influenced away from that.
J.H.T. It is said of Jotham that he was the youngest son of Gideon: would that correspond with the little power in Philadelphia in which things are continued? Then the reward to the overcomer as having honoured God is, "I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name", @Revelation 3:12?
J.T. That is confirmed by the allusion to "little Benjamin", and he who is their ruler without aspiring to it.
P.L. So "If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place" (@Ecclesiastes 10:4) -- is that what these trees do?
J.T. Each retained his place, which was a profitable one. That is the point to notice, that each is functioning profitably, first for God, and then for men.
L.M. Does not Malachi raise this question in a broken day? "If then I be a father, where is mine honour?" (@Malachi 1:6); and then, "Will a man rob God?" (@Malachi 3:8), and then God shows how He would "spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him", @Malachi 3:17. Would the prophetic word encourage us to go on in the service in a broken day?
J.T. Quite so.
P.L. So that in the presence of brethren who are morally slain, as in the division under Jeroboam, you get
{410}
the answer of Abijah, "But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests that serve Jehovah are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites are at their work" (@2 Chronicles 13:10), and then at the end, "we have God with us at our head, and his priests, and the loud-sounding trumpets to sound an alarm", @2 Chronicles 13:12.
J.T. You see it carried forward in Josiah's day in a striking way. It says that the king stood in his place, and the priests were in their place, and the Levites and the singers. These are suggestions, if we carry them out and observe them, that the service of God will go on whoever may be removed or fail.
Ques. Is it significant that in verse 21 it says that "Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there"? Is it not the faithfulness of God that will sustain us all in times of difficulty? The thought of the well comes in early in the Scriptures, and at Beersheba you learn the faithfulness of God.
J.T. You learn it at Beersheba, but Beer is just the well, the refreshment that you stand by and which will keep you fresh.
Now Abiathar, being a remnant of the priests, bringing the ephod is very remarkable, that the priesthood is to go on according to God, and not to be reduced in its quality, but maintained at the height of @Exodus 28. David had been exercising the priesthood without the ephod, and God heard him, too, before Abiathar came. In fact, the Lord Jesus says of him that he went into the house of God. He actually did that under terrible pressure -- the murderous enmity of Saul. He went into the house of God, and obtained the shewbread, the food for the priests; showing that in his need, as the Lord says, in his hunger he went into the house of God. Our need often sends us into the house, and it is well that it does. He got what he needed, but now he prays to Jehovah, and God answers him, but then he prays by the ephod as soon as it comes to him.
{411}
That is to say, we are reminded of what is suitable to God; we have recourse to that.
E.J.McB. Is your thought that we are not only to be profitable, but we are to have the liberty of priestly access to God with us in this ephod, in spite of eighty-five persons being killed?
J.T. That is the thing to note. He brought that with him in his calamity; and that is what the Lord Jesus had in mind in alluding to this. It was in "the section of Abiathar the high priest" @Mark 2:26, doubtless alluding to the priestly service in bringing the ephod, in spite of the calamity, that the service of God must go on on the highest level that God intended for it, according to @Exodus 28. You get more about the ephod in 1 and 2 Samuel than anywhere else outside of Exodus, and it is just to show us that in times of public disorder, the service of God must and will go on -- and the saints come to it.
F.J.F. Would the presence of the ephod suggest that God would come in and answer petitions?
J.T. He answered the petitions before. That is, God will answer the petition of a christian, however uninstructed he may be, if it is a petition of need. But then, you come again and again, and God says, Well, there is something suitable to Me in all these questionings. I am ready to answer your need, but I want you to understand that I have My order in My house, and it is to your profit that you should know that and keep to it. I believe that is what the ephod means.
Ques. What did you mean when you said that the people of God come to it?
J.T. David came to it, and throughout his history he does not lose sight of the ephod. No doubt many of our brethren today get answers from God, but they have no thought of what is suitable to God in the way they approach Him and speak to Him. He answers them, no doubt, but at any time He may raise the question as to order, and what is becoming to Him.
{412}
N.K.M. Would the ephod have in mind God's requirements rather than ours?
J.T. It is a question of God's requirements. I have two things in mind; there are my needs which God respects, but then there is what God requires; this is what the ephod suggests.
D.L.H. David put it on on a very remarkable occasion when he conducted the ark to its rest.
J.T. That is very suggestive, because it was a linen one then, showing that, although he had everything under his hand and could do as he wished, he was marked by sobriety.
L.D.M. He speaks of the way it was done at the first, as not after the due order.
J.T. The linen would mean that he had been irregular.
L.D.M. Is that borne out in @Philippians 3, where the apostle says, "For *we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh", @Philippians 3:3?
J.T. Yes. I think the ephod means priesthood *par excellence*. There were other priestly garments, but more attached to the ephod than to the others. The onyx stones on the shoulders of the priest, and the breastplate, and the other things were attached to the ephod of the high priest -- of Christ Himself. The garment denotes what is priestly, what God requires in His people as they draw near to Him, and no one can disregard this with impunity. We may get answers, but in due time God will raise this question with us.
Ques. What would you say as to the different character of the exercises that turn David to God on those two occasions?
J.T. The second is the treachery of the citizens of Keilah, persons you have served. That is another matter you have to face. We may serve people, and they may turn against us. The citizens of Keilah would deliver him up.
{413}
D.L.H. We have said a good deal about the olive tree, is anything to be said as to the fig tree and the vine?
J.T. There is a good deal, of course. The fig is sweetness. It comes in between the olive and the vine, and there is a good deal in Scripture about that. The vine is the cheer that God has in His people, and that the saints have too in any one that answers to the vine. What a great thing it is in our day, when everything is so dark outwardly, and broken, that there is some little bit of cheer for God. Of old it was said that He was refreshed. He has cheer in His people, and men have that too.
Ques. Why is God not mentioned in relation to the fig tree?
J.T. It is a general thought that would enter into all that you have in the way of refreshment. "The bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother", @Philemon 7. "For he has often refreshed me", @2 Timothy 1:16. And so the drink offerings of God were to be offered in their place.
J.H.T. Does Peter refresh the Lord's heart in the presence of one who would deliver Him up in @John 6, when he says to Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God", @John 6:68?
J.T. I am sure he does. It is remarkable that the idea of the drink offering comes in with Jacob. It is in connection with recovered persons. We do not read of it in @Genesis 28, but we do in chapter 35:14.
N.K.M. What have you in mind in the last scripture we read?
J.T. It was just to call attention to the food that supports the priesthood, in circumstances that might overcome them, bearing in mind that it is still a remnant. It says, "And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the oblation that is left of Jehovah's offerings by fire, and eat it with unleavened bread beside the altar; for it is most
{414}
holy", @Leviticus 10:12. The oblation is a question of Christ's humanity, and they were to eat it beside the altar as most holy. To sustain the priesthood, we have to keep to that food above all other, for it is a question of that kind of Man. The Lord Himself *never* was overcome by natural influences. Then it says, "And ye shall eat, it in a holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons¬ due, of Jehovah's offerings by fire; for so I am commanded. And the breast of the wave-offering, and the shoulder of the heave-offering shall ye eat in a clean place", verses 13,14. That is a wider thought. The holy humanity of Christ is the food sustaining us inside, but there is that which is to be eaten in a clean place, which would be wider. And then, it is "thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee". That is the saints viewed as a household, as a family, sons and daughters; we are maintained in the fellowship by this food.
Ques. What does "beside the altar" suggest?
J.T. It is a reminder of the lengths to which Christ went. He went into death and suffered. He is seen sacrificially from the outset, as for instance in John's gospel: "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world", @John 1:29. That means that He is there sacrificially; He came in in that way to die.
F.J.F. Was it their due because of God's thought concerning them, and they were entitled to it? They do not give up the divine thought.
J.T. It is put in that way; it is their due.
J.H.T. Do the four gospels suggest this kind of food for the saints?
J.T. They do. The humanity of Christ is seen in each, and John specially stresses the sacrificial side. He has a way of introducing things informally, so that he presents Christ in service before John the baptist was cast into prison. That was the time of Jesus taking up His service, but the apostle John speaks of Him in service before that.
{415}
F.W.W. Would all this be suggestive of the way in which we should meet crises in our assemblies, when they come along?
J.T. I think so, to keep the balance. We are so easily influenced by things that happen, and it is an important matter to have the right food, so as to be balanced and to stand immune from all natural influences, whatever they may be.
F.W.W. You mentioned at the outset that death had come in in regard of each case; there had been a definite attack of the enemy. Would all this help us as to the way in which we are to meet such a position?
J.T. Quite so; these efforts of the enemy are apt to affect us unduly. If we review the state of things in christendom today it has that tendency. The drift of apostasy is so great that it is calculated to stagger us, but these scriptures ought to teach us that the service of God goes on, whatever happens.
F.W.W. I suppose that outwardly the cross was a great disaster according to men, but God's work went on.
J.T. You can see that in the two going to Emmaus. It was disaster to them, but they soon became occupied in the service of God; returning to Jerusalem, they "found the eleven, and those with them" @Luke 24:33. They were gathered together, the service going on.
R.D.S. "If I will that he abide until I come" (@John 21:22) -- would that apply?
J.T. Quite so; the Lord will have some one. John represents the continuation of the testimony.
E.L.M. Putting the three scriptures together, would we find power in them to carry on the service? There is the refusal, suggested in the trees, to exaltation, which the Corinthians fell under the power of; and then, in the second, bringing in the ephod; and the third being nourished by the proper priestly food. Would those things enable us to carry on?
J.T. That is the point, that the service is to go
{416}
on. There is no other thought in the mind of God. What these scriptures present guarantees the continuance of the service, and ought to be a great encouragement to us all, especially to young believers. You will notice that the priest's daughters are brought in. You cannot have an assembly, according to 1 Corinthians, without sisters.
L.D.M. You get the breast and the shoulder in connection with the clean place: does that suggest how things are carried sympathetically and feelingly in households?
J.T. It is a question of love and strength.
L.D.M. The testimony is supported by households.
J.T. That is how the truth stands in connection with Paul's service. One has often said it, and others, but I do not know if it is taken in much, that the sisters are not doing much; matters are too much left to the brothers. "I sent before thee", God says, "Moses, Aaron, and Miriam" @Micah 6:4.
D.L.H. Does that not correspond with the words that every member of the body is necessary?
J.T. Yes, whether brothers or sisters. Miriam represents a secret formation in view of the time when she would be needed. Undoubtedly it was she who did the service for her mother when Moses was in the ark, of bulrushes. She served then, but her name is not given in Scripture, as far as we can see, until she was over ninety years of age, meaning that she had a long secret history, and I believe God would remind the sisters of this, so that they may be equal to their calling. They are essential to the public testimony, as 1 Timothy shows; and the elder women are to teach and be examples to the younger ones.
Rem. In regard to @Micah 6, from which you are quoting, it was a question of the controversy the Lord had with His people as to His own strength and righteousness.
J.O.S. Does not Paul emphasise what you are saying
{417}
in @1 Corinthians 11, when he says, "However, neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord", @1 Corinthians 1:11? He would give each a particular place in the public testimony?
J.T. Then he shows in chapter 7:35 how a sister is to wait on the Lord "without distraction". How many of our sisters think of that? How can sisters serve the saints like Miriam, save as waiting on Him and formed accordingly?
Rem. @Psalm 68: 11 says, "The Lord gives the word: great the host of the publishers", and J.N.D. has a footnote, "i.e., women publishing victory, like Miriam: the word is feminine".
J.T. That is good, indicating how sisters may serve.
L.D.M. Phoebe, a "helper of many" (@Romans 16:2), would be a good example.
J.T. Just so. That chapter is very *apropos* of what we are saying, for sisters have a prominent place in it. The first two mentioned are sisters, Phoebe and Priscilla, and there are many others.
{418}
THE HEAVENLY CALLING
@Luke 9: 23 - 36
J.T. It was the mention twice of "two men" as present on the mount speaking with the Lord, that has led to the suggestion of looking at this account of the transfiguration at this time. Some of us were engaged recently with the place man, as such, has in the book of Ezekiel; in chapter 1 his place in the amber spot over the expanse, a symbolic representation of divine power upon earth; and then a man seen as clothed with linen with the ink-horn upon his loins in chapter 9; then in chapter 40 "a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass", possessed of a flax-cord and a measuring-reed; and then finally, chapter 43, a man standing by the prophet in the place of the divine dwelling, the residence of the glory and the divine presence. I thought a view of this scene in Luke would help us as to the place man has, as it were, in the precincts of heaven and in heaven itself. In @Luke 24 there are two men "in shining garments" at the open sepulchre, that is, at the resurrection of Christ; and in @Acts 1 there are two men in "white clothing" at the ascension; and finally, in what represents the Lord's place of glory on high, in @Luke 9, there are two men. I think the Spirit of God would impress us with these facts as indicating the place man has with God, both as introductory to the final state of things, the glory itself, and then on the mount -- two men, we are told, "appearing in glory". It seems to me that these facts, presented as they are in Ezekiel and Luke, taken in relation to similar ones elsewhere, are to accustom us to the supremacy of man in the divine counsels, even over angels; wisdom's delight anticipatively being with the sons of men, and all making for manhood practically with us, in the way of formation. The verses in @Luke 9: 23 - 27 have that in view. They make demands
{419}
upon us with a view to making men of us. So the Lord alludes to their position: "There are some of those standing here", He says. They were *standing*, as if the truth ministered was affecting them. I think that is the attitude preliminary to the glory.
P.L. Does "I know a man in Christ" (@2 Corinthians 12: 2), convey the thought? Has Paul, as seen in the early part of that epistle, been in the pathway, of which these verses speak previous to the transfiguration?
J.T. Yes, in all those fourteen years, he was consciously a man belonging to heaven; he had been there, and the fact is mentioned to set us in movement.
G.A.v.S. Would the thought of standing and maturity thus go together?
J.T. I think so. In the presence of such instruction as the verses contain, there is energy, a readiness for what may come in. Something is to follow, for such instruction as we get in these verses from 23 to 27 is not final; it is preparatory in order to bring about a state of readiness for anything the Lord may suggest further. A standing attitude is suitable at a time of education. We shall be sitting presently; we shall be raised up together and made to sit down together, but with a view to that, a standing attitude is becoming to us now. It is an educational time, and heavy demands are being made in what the Lord has said, so it is suitable to be standing.
P.L. John the baptist was in the standing attitude. In @John 1 he is standing (verse 35), and in chapter 3, he "stands and hears", @John 1:29.
J.T. Yes; the Lord Himself had been standing, as John said: "In the midst of you stands ..." (@John 1:26.) Great things were to come in and he was ready; and so John stands as the Lord comes to him. He comes to John, who baptises Him, and then John stands, and later, as you say, he "stands and hears" the voice of the Bridegroom. Great things were coming;
{420}
indeed, John's gospel would prepare us to see "greater things".
Rem. There were women standing at the cross, and some who were not in the spirit and sympathy of it were sitting down and watching Him.
J.T. That is in keeping with what we are saying. His crucifixion was not final; anticipatively there was more to come, and so the next chapter brings forward those women at the grave.
F.G.W. Would there be any connection with what you are saying and the two sons of oil in Zechariah standing "before the Lord of the whole earth", @Zechariah 4:14?
J.T. That is the idea; a standing attitude is one of alertness and readiness for what may come, which I think ought to impress us, both in regard of service now, and in regard of the translation of the saints. "But what I say to you, I say to all, Watch", @Mark 13:37, is a similar thought.
P.L. "Abraham remained yet standing before Jehovah", @Genesis 18:22.
Ques. Would the two men standing "by them" in @Acts 1 correspond with the two men in glory? I was thinking how much Luke speaks of two men -- Peter and John, Saul and Barnabas, Paul and Silas. Do you think he continues the thought of two men standing on earth?
J.T. That is right; and they are said to be in "white clothing", which I think is an allusion to purity in the testimony. Mark speaks of a young man "clothed in a white robe" (@Mark 16:5), at the sepulchre. In @Acts 1 there are two, and they are calling attention to the manner of His going up, that as they had seen Him go up, so He should return. They called attention to the manner of Christ's movements, which fact bears on the history of the assembly: "the manner", the reflection of that is to be here.
D.L.H. Did not Stephen see the blessed Lord
{421}
Himself "standing at the right hand of God", @Acts 7:55 that is, as ready for some fresh movement if there had been any response?
J.T. Just so, still waiting there in patience on Israel.
Ques. Why does it say, "some of those standing here"?
J.T. To test us. Who is it to be? There is another thought at once suggested, and that is the question of sovereign selection. Going to heaven is not of itself consequent on our being in a standing attitude; there must also be the question of sovereign selection; we shall be there on that principle.
J.R.S. Is that in accord with the preceding words: "If any one will come after me"? I was thinking of what you said as to those standing by.
J.T. The whole passage is to bring about alertness, which the Lord values. He alludes to the fact that they were standing; they were not listless or taking their ease; they were standing in an attitude of alertness, which is seemly after such instruction.
F.S.M. Would this be in accord with chapter 12: "*ye* like men who wait their own lord", @Luke 12:36? Would that be the attitude?
J.T. Yes. The instruction contemplates that I have energy. It seems to me that it is an extreme demand to test our genuineness. As He says, "If any one will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me".
P.L. Would the energy be seen in the expression, those "who by night stand in the house of Jehovah", @Psalm 134:l?
J.T. Yes. The Scriptures are full of the thought, and it seems to bear peculiarly on these last days. I believe the Lord is speaking to us as to this. There are those who go in for rioting and drunkenness, chambering and lasciviousness, taking things easily, listlessly and licentiously, but over against that you have persons who
{422}
are on the alert, and the Lord speaks to them: "There are some of those standing here".
Ques. Does it link up with verses 1 and 2 of the chapter where reference is made to demons and diseases? Would those agencies bring men down, so to speak, in helplessness?
J.T. Just so. I suppose demons are powers acting in a general way, and diseases are in the sense of an epidemic, and added you have the thought of healing the sick, that is, specific cases. All these are over against this attitude of standing. There is no demon power in them, no disease occurrent, nor is anyone sick; it is a very healthy state of things. It is to that state the Lord addresses Himself as regards heaven.
J.J. Would the men standing at the eleventh hour in @Matthew 20 be on the same line -- waiting to be hired?
J.T. Yes. Then there are many who talk about the Lord's coming in a very theoretical sort of way, without taking note of the demands that it makes. Those who wait for their own lord are in readiness. Many have taken up the thought of translation with little idea of the corresponding suitable attitude.
Rem. It must have been very delightful to the heart of the Father to look down upon men who had been given to Christ out of the world, matured men according to @John 17.
J.T. Yes, indeed.
Ques. Does @Ephesians 6 show us how to stand?
J.T. Well, that standing is holding your ground: "having done all, to stand", @Ephesians 6:13.
H.F.N. Elijah spoke of "Jehovah of hosts ... before whom I stand" (@1 Kings 18:15), and to Moses, when the people are sitting (@Exodus 32: 6), God said, "Behold, there is a place by me: there shalt thou stand on the rock", @Exodus 33:21. Would those two men illustrate what is before us?
J.T. That is very good; they are the two men here,
{423}
and they stand. What the Lord says is preliminary to the idea of ascension. Then the two men at the sepulchre are in shining garments; I think the dual thought is just testimony to the idea; as if God would impress us with the thought as in the precincts of heaven, the eternal state of things, we may say. We are to be impressed with the thought that at the resurrection of Christ, or His ascension, or in the scene above, men are there. The scene in Luke makes way for what Christ is above. John says, "it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is", @1 John 3:2. I think that opens the door for the consideration of what Christ is now, what He is to be as Man eternally, and in that transcendent glory, a glory beyond anything apparently any man has yet seen. There are those who are fit for it. It is not only what He was here during the forty days, not only what He was even before, but *what He is* in that transcendent glory that is evidently beyond anything yet seen, and there are men in liberty with Him there. They "appeared in glory"; they are in full dress, as it were. They appeared in glory speaking with Him, and they are said to be "two men". It is not a question of what is historical as in Matthew and Mark, simply Moses and Elias, well-known men, but here it says "two men" twice, and that is mentioned before they are named, as if the idea of manhood is the thought, and they are appearing in glory and speaking with Him in the supreme glory.
J.O.S. In @Ezekiel 43 is the prophet introduced into the glory of the house? It says, "a man was standing by me", @Ezekiel 43:46.
J.T. That is what we were saying at the beginning. That seems to be in view in Ezekiel in that respect; they were to be sustained there in the divine residence, as it says, "the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel", @Ezekiel 43:7.
{424}
It says, "a man was standing by me", without saying what he did. He is there to sustain us there, but the wonderful fact is there was no need for Moses and Elias to be sustained here, they are equal to the position; they are speaking with Jesus; they are not at all disconcerted by the transcendent glory, because He was transfigured, whatever that may mean. Luke says that He "became different", which leaves it indefinite, but it suggests infinitude. The difference is beyond any comparison with man, it is different from what *He was* generally down here. There is no thought of glory taken on by Him, it is what He is in Himself; what He is opening up, and, as I apprehend, is what is personal and beyond anything, as far as Scripture shows, that has yet been seen; as John says, "it doth not yet appear".
H.P.W. If we are to regard these as sample men, is it to be noted that Moses had already learned the lesson of holiness? "Loose thy sandals from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground", @Exodus 3:5. Is that one of the qualifications?
J.T. Quite so. His education is all behind this occasion. No one was more qualified than he to speak about the Lord's decease, for his whole ministry had that in view. In the typical sacrifices, he was conversant with that; and he was hidden in the rock on the mount when the glory passed by. God said, "Behold, there is a place by me: there shalt thou stand on the rock. And it shall come to pass, when my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand, until I have passed by" @Exodus 33:21 - 22. But that was all educational and past; there is nothing of that here; he is in perfect freedom in the presence of the glory, and he speaks too. The men apparently take the initiative in speaking. It is a place of holy liberty where we can converse with the Lord. He converses with us, no doubt, but we can converse with Him.
A.J.G. Is it significant that Peter when about to put off his tabernacle was dwelling on this incident?
{425}
J.T. It is most significant. I suppose he was never more capable of dwelling upon it than then.
Ques. Would you say that the priest seen standing would be in the light of this in his soul? It says, "every priest stands daily ministering, and offering", @Hebrews 10:11.
J.T. It is the attitude of service. I suppose the shining raiment of the two men in @Luke 24 is the reflection of what had been reached through death and resurrection, the reflection of what God is. It will be noticed here (@Luke 9), that the two men being there is mentioned first by the Spirit as a fact; and then secondly the disciples saw them as awaking from their sleep. The matter is confirmed, but the Spirit of God, it seems to me, would impress us peculiarly with the thought of the men. Luke is the only one who mentions "two men", and the thought is confirmed first by the Spirit's account, and then adding, "having fully awoke up they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him", verse 32.
Ques. What is the thought in "he went up into a mountain to pray. And as he prayed ..."?
J.T. That of course, as has often been remarked, is a witness to the dependent Man. We have the Lord probably ten times in Luke in that attitude. It is a very beautiful thought; as He prayed the thing came about, God honouring the dependent Man.
Rem. In that way you have a display of moral glory preceding personal glory.
J.T. Quite so.
J.J. What do you say about the identification of these two men?
J.T. You can understand that the names given, only add to the thought that these are men of quality. They are not like the men at the sepulchre, and the ascension, who are just angels; they are men of body and experience, God as it were bringing forward the Old Testament testimony to Christ, what the work of
{426}
God was in those times; that it was not merely typical, but there was formation in these men, so that they are now qualified to come out and speak with the Lord in this wonderful scene. I suppose they properly represent the heavenly saints, that is, ourselves anticipatively, and that makes it all the more marvellous for us.
P.L. Does it link up spiritual elevation and intelligence in the assembly with a history of moral worth?
J.T. God would note the value of past history, so that it is in keeping with the great testimony of the wilderness. "What hath God wrought!" (@Numbers 23:21) That is what all will see in the consummation of divine counsels; there is history behind it.
Ques. Is there any connection between the prayer here, and the Lord's present service of intercession on high?
J.T. It is more to call attention to the Man, what He was. No doubt He was praying for others, but the point is, He was engaged in that, whatever He was praying for. What He was below, He was up there.
F.S.M. Would you say a further word as to His glory? The expression is used twice in the chapter, and in verse 26 there are three glories mentioned, His glory, and that of the Father, and the holy angels. What is the character of His glory as transfigured?
J.T. Well, that is what I should like to have made clear. The Lord may help us to consider what He *is*; what He was, of course, both in His flesh and blood condition, and during the forty days, and what He is I think this points to what He *is*.
M.W.B. Would you draw a contrast between the resurrection condition of our Lord and what He now is?
J.T. I think we should. John had seen Him in both previous conditions, and he had seen this too. This is but a suggestion of His present glory. John had seen this, and yet he says, "it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
{427}
appear, we shall be like him" @1 John 3:2. It seems to me there is something in that to indicate what is beyond anything so far seen.
W.C.G. Would the scripture in Timothy describe what He was? "Confessedly the mystery of piety is great". @1 Timothy 3:16
J.T. That is right. "God has been manifested in flesh", that is the bare fact. But then, He "has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory" -- not *to* glory. I think that gives the clue; He was "received up in glory", @1 Timothy 3:16.
Ques. Would @Colossians 1 bring forward what He is? "Image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation", @Colossians 1:15. Would that bear upon it?
J.T. That is what He is personally, and would apply at any time. When we are speaking of the Person, there can be no change, but as to His condition there may be. It is His condition we are speaking of, and it says, that we shall be conformed "to his body of glory", @Philippians 3:21, whatever that is.
C.O.B. Where would you place, "have I not seen Jesus our Lord?" @1 Corinthians 9:1 when Paul speaks of the glory?
J.T. He saw Him of course; he was equal to the others in having seen the Lord, and he saw Him in some sense, I apprehend, in glory. Whether he saw the fulness of the glory, I do not know, but he would have some thought of it. As we said he speaks of "his body of glory", whatever that is. I think we ought to make room in our minds for something additional, for what we shall be.
Rem. The Lord says, "There are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God", and in @Acts 1 it says, "speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God", @Acts 1:3.
J.T. The bearing of that is the testimony, and the
{428}
bearing of the holy scene of the mount on the three was the testimony here, but we cannot limit this. The kingdom of God is a great fact here in testimony, and "the Son of man coming in his kingdom" (@Matthew 16:28) is mentioned in Matthew, which I think is a further thought. It is how He comes, "the Son of man coming in his kingdom". But Paul speaks of "his body of glory". Well, what is that? John says, "it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him".
H.D'A.C. What is the connection between that thought and the one later in John's epistle: "as he is, so are we in this world" (@1 John 4:17), not, 'we shall be'?
J.T. That is abstract, I apprehend, and in keeping with John's epistle, that we might learn how to abstract ourselves in mind, so that we are in accord with Christ in our minds even now. It does not contemplate our mixed condition; it is more an abstract thought.
H.D'A.C. It does not say, 'as we ought to be'.
J.T. Just so. It also says, "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not", @1 John 5:18. All these are abstract thoughts, practical thoughts but abstract, and it is a question of power to lay hold of them. It is a question of power in my soul, whether I can think abstractly in that way; but when He is manifested, what will He be like?
W.C.G. When Paul speaks of the heavenly calling -- "the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" @Philippians 3:14 -- does he suggest a personal manifestation of it?
J.T. He says, "I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus"; not that he had already attained it. He sought to arrive "at the resurrection from among the dead" @Philippians 3:11, which would be in keeping with the two men in @Luke 24; but the "calling on high of God in Christ Jesus", well. I believe that is what we need to understand. I
{429}
think there is something in that beyond what has been manifested.
W.C.G. He encourages them: "this also God shall reveal to you" @Philippians 3:15.
M.W.B. You referred just now to the fact when the disciples were fully awake -- is that regarded as having a spiritual bearing, implying something after the nature of the prayer in Ephesians l? "being enlightened in the eyes of your heart", @Ephesians 1:18.
J.T. That is suggestive. It says, "but having fully awoke up they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him", and then Peter goes on to speak about the tabernacles. I think it is an allusion to the saints waking up. The thing is a fact; the change is a fact; but now, as awaking, "they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him". "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee", @Ephesians 5:14. I think there is something at the present time that we may see as awaking.
H.F.N. Why does Peter in his record in the epistle speak of being "eyewitnesses of *his* majesty"? Then he goes on to say, "For he received from God the Father honour and glory" @2 Peter 1:16 - 17. How do you link that up with what Luke speaks of in connection with His glory?
J.T. Of course he is speaking of this, and understanding that what they saw was "the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" @2 Peter 1:16, and the way that bears on the testimony. It bore on his testimony, but the point is whether there is not something represented in this glory, beyond anything that has yet been manifested.
H.F.N. That is just the point I wanted help on. Would Peter have more the thought of Matthew's account in view, the way he refers to it, but would Luke bring out more what you are speaking of, something peculiarly distinctive as to His glory?
J.T. I think Luke's account sustains Paul. Matthew and Mark rather sustain Peter, which makes it all the
{430}
more suggestive, because Paul is occupied with glory; he is the minister of it, you may say; he speaks of "the glory that excelleth", @2 Corinthians 3:10. Of course, that is covenant glory, but the suggestion is very remarkable. It reminds us there is that which will be manifested beyond anything yet known, an "exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (@2 Corinthians 4:17), and I think the Lord would train and accustom us to that, to what we shall see.
Ques. How far does @John 1:14 go? "We have contemplated his glory".
J.T. That is a "glory as of an only-begotten with a father" which was manifested here, but I am inclined to think it does not go as far as Paul's ministry. I think we ought to be prepared for the full thought, and you must get that from Paul. I believe Luke has in mind the full thought. "A voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory", @2 Peter 1: 17. These superlatives ought to be noticed. There is increase contemplated, and you get the full thought of everything in Paul.
P.L. So you get the "riches of his glory": would this great thought be wrapped up in that?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. We are "transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit" (@2 Corinthians 3:18) -- would that help?
J.T. That all relates to the covenant, but there is the thought of increasing glory: "from glory to glory". I do not think anything will be stationary or limited in heaven; it will be wonderful, and God would remind us, as standing, of what there is and what the calling is, the "calling on high of God in Christ Jesus", He being the expression of it Himself. But then He is a divine Person, and the glory is the expression of what He is; it is not what He takes on, but what He is.
G.A.v.S. In these different passages is there indicated that God's full thought is lying in the future? and that therefore, while it is in the compass of God's
{431}
thoughts, it is for us a matter to reach out to in exercise of soul?
J.T. That is what we have been remarking as to @Philippians 3. The apostle aimed at arriving "at the resurrection from among the dead" -- that is one thing, and then he pursued "towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus". That goes beyond resurrection; it goes beyond what Christ was as amongst His own during the forty days.
Ques. Do you think what one may speak of as the two expressions in relation to the Lord -- His glory and His sufferings in Gethsemane -- and the disciples asleep on both occasions, would show how weak the flesh is, and the great need for spiritual stature to meet the conditions?
J.T. That is the point of this meeting to us. There is this great thing awaiting us, and it is a question whether we are *standing*, whether there is the development of manhood. You have two men in three positions; two at the resurrection, two at the ascension and two in the glory. Well, this in chapter 9 is like the precincts of the heavenly domain, being the suggestion of what is final -- what Christ is in the excellent glory. God would awake us. "Having fully awoke up they saw his glory". What a marvellous suggestion that is! -- "and the two men who stood with him". They saw the heavenly scene, a scene to be apprehended, as the apostle says, "the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus", @Philippians 3:14.
E.J.McB. Is your thought that we may get an anticipative view of it in the soul?
J.T. Yes; it is to be grasped, and yet we may say it is still beyond us. I do not think anything in this sense is exactly final. It is *not* what He takes on like Moses; the Lord's face shining is *what He is*, and the expression from Himself of the thought of Man.
Ques. Did Peter have any thought of this when
{432}
he said, "who has called you to his eternal glory", @1 Peter 5:10?
J.T. That all bears upon it.
P.L. Does the word "pursue" used by Paul in Philippians suggest that finality is not reached?
J.T. Even in himself -- quite so. That ought to remind us of what it is, that he pursued the thing, that he might attain what he was apprehended for, what the saints are apprehended for in Christ.
J.J. Would that be seen in the fact that these three entered into all this while still in the bodies of flesh and blood, not like Moses and Elias? Is that not the marvel of it?
J.T. Peter alluding to it as about to put off his tabernacle, indicates that it was very definite with him.
J.J. And do you think the expression "bodies of humiliation" goes with the earlier verses of @Luke 9, and then "bodies of glory" being like Him as He is?
J.T. Yes.
A.J.G. Have you in mind that His body of glory will be the shining out of all the moral glory that is in Him, and is apprehended in Him, and *not* as taken on by Him?
J.T. That is right. It is taken on by us; we are the workmanship of God, but not so with Christ. "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", @1 John 3:2. What will it be? John says it is not yet manifested, but when we see Him we shall be like Him.
P.L. Would the expression, "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance" (@Hebrews 1:3), have any bearing on this?
J.T. That of course is of God's glory, but think of the Person who is capable of that! I think, however, we should lay hold of what Christ is as Man, as the pattern of men, designed for the divine counsels, and see the effect of that. I think that is how things work, that what we are outwardly, we are inwardly; it is not something taken on for which we are not equal; the
{433}
seeing suggests ability to take on the greatness of what *He is*.
Rem. Peter's speaking was not quite in accord with what he saw; he saw His glory.
J.T. Exactly; he was not equal to it yet, but as he was about to put off his tabernacle, what a history lay behind, and he could speak of it then. I suppose you can get nothing more pregnant with spiritual thought than Peter's own remarks.
Ques. Is there an interval of silence necessary between what is seen and the speaking about it? It says, "*they* kept silence, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen".
J.T. You feel it is a time for quiet meditation as you enter the sanctuary, for instance. The principle of absorption, of taking the thing in is to regulate us. The ministry of the Spirit throughout this period is to make us great inwardly, to give us power and vision, so that we may take in the greatness of the divine thoughts, so that when it is manifested we are equal to it; it does not overpower us.
W.C.G. Does not our oneness with Christ help us in that regard? "He that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one", @Hebrews 2:11. How does that fit in?
J.T. It all works into it.
C.O.B. Does Stephen answer to it? He is spoken of as a man, and he is able to put into his own words what he saw.
J.T. Quite so. You get constantly throughout Scripture, "What seest thou?" and it is a good question. What do I see? Well, I am going to be like that, but it may be greater than what I already see, and we should be prepared for this.
M.W.B. It says in @2 Corinthians 5, "Now he that has wrought us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit" (@2 Corinthians 5:5), in connection with the bodies of glory. Does that give in any sense an anticipation of what you are speaking about?
{434}
J.T. I think that helps. The apostle began by speaking of looking on what is unseen, and then the exceeding weight of glory, and then the house from heaven, and then he says, "Now he that has wrought us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit". @2 Corinthians 5:5 We have the earnest of the thing in the Spirit, so that we learn to look at it.
Ques. Does that not agree with the end of @Philippians 3, where the Lord is spoken of as the One who "shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory" @Philippians 3:21?
J.T. That is good: "according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself" @Philippians 3:21.
J.H.B. Could we have a word about the two men in @Luke 24 and @Acts 1, as leading up to what is before you?
J.T. First of all it is what is in resurrection. The women were in perplexity, and I think God meets perplexity by something concrete, which is a suggestion for ministry. When people are in perplexity, you want to present things explicitly; and there are the two men in shining garments. It is as if God would say, There is nothing to cause perplexity. There is the great thought that resurrection implies a shining, and it is *men* that shine. It is a great victory, the reflection of what God has reached. Then the two at the ascension would call, attention to order, the way in which things are done. I believe the Lord has been helping us as to the *manner* of things. It says that they saw Him go up, and the two men point to that: "the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven" @Acts 1:11. That is something objective. Well, that is not to be forgotten; He is to come back in like manner; there is to be no change in that respect, and I suppose the interval is a filling up of that thought as to order, and the way things should be done.
Ques. In @John 17:24, the Lord says, "Father, as
{435}
to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory". Is not the answer to that to be with Him and like Him, to behold that glory, and would that not refer somewhat to sonship?
J.T. Being like Him is the full thought of sonship; that is, we await the full thought of it. What we have now is more the liberty that belongs to it. The "spirit of adoption" gives you the thing, but we have to await the full thought. So we have in @Romans 8, the "revelation of the sons of God" (@Romans 8:19), and the "glory of the children of God" (@Romans 8:21), which I apprehend is sonship.
Ques. What do you understand as to the two men who "appearing in glory, spoke of his departure"?
J.T. The thought is rightly illustrated in *full dress*. They appeared "in glory". It is a great scene, a scene of glory, and they are equal to it. The disciples were not; they did not have full dress; the two from heaven did. They represent the heavenly saints.
Ques. Should we be equal to it spiritually?
J.T. Quite so; we should be so "in assembly". The covenant helps us in that; it is "from glory to glory", and we are fitted for the assembly thus.
Rem. The apostle says, "For whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God", @2 Corinthians 5:13.
J.T. That ought to be before us. It is as if Paul would say, When I think of God, what He is, and the calling on high, I am beside myself; he had such a grasp of it.
Ques. Was Peter in it when he fell into an ecstasy; @Acts 10?
J.T. Yes; he would be outside of natural reckonings, occupied with the spiritual realm. He was not caught up into heaven.
{436}
THE SAINTS AS THE INHERITANCE OF GOD
@Hebrews 11: 13 - 16; @1 Corinthians 1: 1, 2; @Ephesians 2: 6
I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak about the saints, connecting what I may have to say with the passage in @Ephesians 1, which speaks of God's "inheritance in the saints", which is to be known by us. The apostle there prays to God, "the Father of glory", that He would give the Ephesians "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him", @Ephesians 1:17. That prayer was to the end that we might be enlightened as to the hope of God's calling and "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints", and the exceeding greatness of His power "which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead" @Ephesians 1:20. Those are items of knowledge of a supreme kind, and no saint should be devoid of this knowledge. It comes in through the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God. I speak only of the second item, that is, the inheritance that God has in His saints, and I hope to be able to divide up this thought into three parts. Firstly, what the saints are as the subjects of God's work as called -- in general, in the types, what appears in the book of Genesis; the passage I read from Hebrews alludes to this book. Secondly, the passage in Corinthians is to be linked with the book of Exodus. Thirdly, the passage in Ephesians is to be linked with the book of Deuteronomy. In order to apprehend the truth in detail and in its full bearing we need to go to those typical books.
The verses in Hebrews directly allude to Genesis, where the saints are viewed as the subjects of the work of God. It is as if God would allow His work to show itself as by itself, so that its own essential quality might appear, and what can be more delightful in that sense than the work of God showing itself? The Lord alludes,
{437}
for instance, to the lilies. Consider them, He says, "how they grow" @Luke 12:27; not how they are cultivated -- that of course has its own place, but "how they grow". That is what Genesis presents -- how things grow. The saints there are not seen as organised. They are so many persons, linked up indeed in a family way, but the allusion by the Spirit to them in the Psalms is to a "few men in number, of small account, and strangers" on the earth; "they went from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people" (@Psalm 105:12,13); they were defenceless outwardly, exposed to the ruthless hand of the world, but protected by God; and God is seen as speaking to the rulers of the world about His people, small though they were and of little account. Is there not an analogy today? The saints are to understand themselves in this respect. More, of course, might be said of them even as viewed in this light, but the correspondence is very definite. Outwardly, the saints are of little account, here and there one of them in business, one of them in domestic service, in a variety of ways they are occupied, but the more known, the less thought of. To be well thought of by the world is no credit to the saints. "Woe unto you", said the Lord, "when all men shall speak well of you!" (@Luke 6:26.) Not, indeed, that we are to be quarrelsome with our neighbours. The neighbours of the blind man whose eyes were opened enquired of him, and he answered them. The Pharisees enquired of him, and he answered them. His parents are enquired of about him, but they undertake nothing in the way of defence; he was of age, they said, and so was to be enquired of himself. They offered no protection; nor can we count on nature, even the nearest of relations, for defence. As our true character comes into evidence, they will fail us. And so, the psalmist alludes to the saints in that way; they are defenceless, moving about from nation to nation, but then, how comforting that God rebuked kings on their account! Is there not
{438}
something in that, in the light of current national and international developments? May not the saints of God reckon on God rebuking kings on their account? The more we hold to divine principles, the more this will come about; the more we stand in consistency with the work of God of which we are the subjects, the more shall we be disliked at heart by the world, and the more will God intervene for us. Whatever the world thought of the saints of old, He says, "Touch not mine anointed" @Psalm 105:15. They have nothing to distinguish them in man's account, but in God's account they are anointed. "Do my prophets no harm". Where is the mind of God to be found save through them? God undertakes for us. "Come out from the midst of them", He says, "... and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters" @2 Corinthians 6:17. National feeling is to be watched; our words, too, in regard of those who rule are to be watched, our position is with God. God says to Abimelech as to Abraham, "he shall pray for thee", @Genesis 20:7. What a thing that is! And God enjoins us to pray for kings, and He considers for them on our account.
That is briefly how the truth I am presenting stands in the book of Genesis; and so the Spirit of God reviews the position in @Hebrews 11:13. "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them". They had opportunity to have returned to the country whence they came out, but now they desire a better country. These are the saints viewed severally, knowing each other of course, linked with each other in a sense, but not organised. They are subject to the rulers, of course -- the most subject of any people are the saints of God, but they seek "a better country, that is, an heavenly", that is deliverance from what is national. While observing with the utmost strictness what is due to those that rule, and praying for them, we are their best friends. As friends of God,
{439}
should we not be the best friends of men? That is the position in Genesis, so that it is said, "God is not ashamed to be called their God". It is not a question of their numbers, for it is expressly stated that they were few men and of little account, but, because of what they were inwardly, because of their outlook, because of their grasping the promises of God -- laying hold of them although afar off, embracing them "God is not ashamed to be called their God", verse 16. That is indeed what He proposes to them. In speaking to Abraham, He says, "It is I", as one Person speaking to another. How God regarded Abraham thus -- and then He enters into covenant with him, and gives him a sign and says, "I will ... be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee" -- there is no change in that attitude -- and "I will be God to them", @Genesis 17:7,8. I would urge that on young ones especially, what it is to have such a God as our God. I will be your God, He says. He proposes it in that peculiar way, and, isolating Himself in the presence of Abraham, He says, "It is I", as if to invite Abraham to consider who it is who is speaking to him. One could say much as to what happened subsequently in the wonderful visitations to Abraham by Jehovah, but I speak only of what is said in this passage, that "God is not ashamed to be called their God". And then He makes preparation for them. The legislators of the world are doing their utmost to improve conditions here; we know how poor the result is, but think of God making preparations! He prepared the heavens; this wonderful physical universe is all His handiwork, but think of Him preparing for those who are marked off thus, as "not ashamed to be called their God": "he hath prepared for them a city". Now, that is the position of the saints viewed severally, as the subjects of the work of God in this world, and it is a position that is very attractive it is to me, that God is not ashamed to be called my God. Paul speaks of "my God", the God he knew;
{440}
and what will He not do for us? He will supply all my need "according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus" @Philippians 4:19.
Now, in the passage in Corinthians, we have the saints viewed as organised. They are the same people, no longer viewed merely as the subjects of the work of God, but also as coming under ministerial authority, as set together in an organised way. That is, God would have something here in this world, not simply so many people as the objects of His care, but as His habitation. When we come to Exodus it is the same people redeemed, so that God has undeniable rights over them. He had more rights over Israel in the wilderness, than He had over them in the land of Canaan before they came into Egypt; that is, He had the rights of redemption; and in that right, He formulates and establishes a ministry, and enters into covenant with His people. It is no longer so many men going "from nation to nation", but "so great a people"; no longer now simply so many persons, but a "kingdom of priests". God is now raising the question of service, of how we are to be with Him and to serve Him. He says, "ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me", and every Israelite was included in that, every saint. That was what was in His mind, "a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation" @Exodus 9:5 - 6. It is now a kingdom and a nation, and a dwelling place. What a heritage God has in the saints, viewed in this light! What He has in this world, in spite of what is in it, in spite of the rejection of Christ, in spite of the existing hatred of God and of Christ in the world, God has a dwelling: "let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them", @Exodus 25:8.
Now, that is Exodus; and it involves the most precious things, in a great variety of materials. These materials are to be supplied by the same people that have been hitherto regarded as so many individuals; they are now to supply the means of a house, a dwelling place for God. It is very appealing, if you take the list in @Exodus 25 -- gold, silver, brass; blue, purple, scarlet,
{441}
fine linen; goats¬ hair, rams¬ skins dyed red, badgers¬ skins, and shittim wood -- all these furnished by the saints. Think of what is in them! Where is the mine of minerals that can supply such things? The saints form the reservoir of all this supply -- the raw material -- and then, too, the requirements and skill in constituting them fit for the dwelling, and, finally, the dwelling itself. Can anything be more attractive, as it is understood, than the fortieth chapter of Exodus? All these instructions carried out to the letter, the tabernacle set up, every item of it functioning according to God. The tabernacle set up and anointed in every part of it, the cloud covering it and the glory filling it. It is not now simply a matter of protection, but God claiming the saints, viewed as such material formed in the power of the Spirit. The cloud covers the tabernacle and the glory fills it, and Moses could not enter. Think of God, as it were, intimating, I am so delighted with this that I want it all to Myself, for that is really what it meant; not that He is there in any selfish way, for love is not selfish, but to show how pleased He is with it.
Moses could not enter: that is no discredit to him, he represents authority which for the moment is not needed. Moses is the man that tells you what to do, and in the wilderness there is no getting away from his authority; what a man he was! Stephen says, "This is that Moses ... that was in the church in the wilderness", @Acts 7:37, 38. It says that he "was faithful in all his house" (@Hebrews 3: 2), and his faithfulness required that he had to give orders, but orders coming on the principle of "living oracles": "Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying ..." being constantly repeated. So that although Moses could not enter, the position now is, what God has in the wilderness, in an adverse scene, but as effected by one who is faithful in all God's house. "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" @1 Corinthians 10:22.
That is the position; so that whole-hearted surrender,
{442}
whole-hearted obedience, whole-hearted subjection is the order, if I am to have part in this wonderful structure that is covered by the cloud, and filled with the glory; the residence of God in the wilderness. I think that should be most attractive. It is not attractive to the flesh, but it is to those who love God, and that is the underlying feature in Exodus -- there are lovers of God. Without lovers of God you cannot have this. God says: "shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me" (@Exodus 20:6) -- there are the thousands. What can God do in this world without lovers? What can He do with them? He can have a habitation for Himself, a residence here in spite of the contrariety; and He likes it so well, that He fills it, taking it all on for Himself for the moment. It is not only the residence of God, but it is the tent of the testimony, and the tent of meeting too, where the saints meet God, and where the testimony is enshrined, and it goes through. Stephen says, "Our fathers had the tent of the testimony in the wilderness" (@Acts 7: 44), and it was received "from their predecessors", who brought it in "with Joshua". They are accredited with that; not simply that Joshua did it, but that they carried it in with Joshua. It is the military man, but the fathers carried the tent of testimony over, and then we look on to David, as it says, "until the days of David".
Now, I just touch on the final scripture, namely, the place of the saints in heaven. I have been speaking of the dwelling here, and of what is carried over, for the testimony is not to be lost. We shall see the ark of God's testimony in heaven presently, after the assembly is raptured by Christ; for the testimony goes over. The days of David suggest the heavenly side of things. David represents headship, but I only want now to show you that the saints are viewed anticipatively in Ephesians as in heaven. There could be no heavenly colour, no blue for the ark and holy vessels, aside from an understanding of the heavenly position. In truth,
{443}
the assembly herself here is based on that. It is a heavenly thing on earth and that can only be understood as we anticipate the position of the saints in heaven. Hence it says, He "has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" -- not with Christ there, but in Christ; @Ephesians 2:6. The point is dignity or status up there; so that we might have a look into that holy, glorious scene.
That is why I referred to Deuteronomy, because in the last chapter of that book, it tells us that Moses was taken up to the top of Pisgah, and Jehovah showed him the land -- but not merely the land. It was, of course, the bare land, but I am speaking now in the language of the Holy Spirit, which we have to notice. Abraham was directed to look "northward and southward and eastward and westward" @Genesis 13:14, and to survey the land; but there was nothing said of the tribes in it when Abraham saw it, whereas when Moses saw the land, it was the land of the tribes. What a beautiful thought that is! It is anticipatively looking into heaven as the heaven of the saints! Oh, you say, it is the heaven of God. Yes, indeed, and the heaven of Christ, the heaven of the Spirit, and the heaven of the angels, but think of heaven with the saints in it! Is that not attractive? "Jehovah shewed him", it says, "the whole land, Gilead to Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah" @Deuteronomy 34:2. Think of that! How lovely to see heaven with the saints in it! That was the view Moses had. Not that the tribes were actually in it but the Holy Spirit mentions, that it was "the whole land, Gilead to Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah". Let us have no anxiety about the saints; they will *all* be there. It is not simply that they will all be raised. We shall be raised. "Behold, I tell you a mystery", says the apostle, "We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed, in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the
{444}
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible ..." @1 Corinthians 15: 51, 52. Let it be *shown* to us; let the Holy Spirit show it to us, but then, it is not only that we shall be changed and raised -- the dead raised and the living changed, but there is the further thought in @1 Thessalonians 4: 16,17 that "the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then *we*, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them" -- note that. He has "raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies"; that is anticipative. God can so speak, and faith can so regard the position, that the saints are *there*, and we are to look into heaven; we are to be shown it with the saints in it. Stephen did not see the saints, I admit, but there was one saint caught up there; there was a "man in Christ" caught up there. He was not there when Stephen looked in, but there is the thought that the heaven that is presented to us is the heaven with the saints. We are to look into that, and see that. Not one will be omitted; we shall meet them all.
<blockquote>"Nor what is next Thy heart <br>Can we forget; <br>Thy saints, O Lord, with Thee <br>In glory met". (`160:8)</blockquote>
Is that not stimulating? God would show it to us, as He showed it to Moses. Presently Moses would be in it, as we see in the New Testament. We shall soon all be in it, but let us look into it now, and see "Gilead to Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hindmost sea" -- the whole of it! That is what was shown to Moses. It was shown to one who wished to go into it. Do I wish to go into it? That is the question, whether I care for it. "Holy brethren", says the writer to the Hebrews, "partakers of the heavenly calling", @Hebrews 3:1. Have I a taste for that? Moses had, and he represents
{445}
that side. "Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land ... that goodly mountain, and Lebanon", he says, @Deuteronomy 3:25. He would like to be there. As he could not enter the tabernacle when the glory filled it, so here he could not enter the land; not because -- at least from the standpoint of Deuteronomy -- of any personal defect in him. He was debarred, indeed, according to Numbers, for disobedience, but in Deuteronomy it is not that. Spiritually it is because he represents authority. We shall not need to be told what to do up there; we shall have no wills to be subdued up there; nor do we need anyone to tell us what to do in the assembly, as we are there in the true spiritual sense. It is a question of the liberty and the intelligence we have in that in which God dwells and in which He is served.
Well, that was all I had to present, and I hope it will lead to some practical effect in us as to what the saints are to God, as the inheritance of God, both now and for ever. "For the Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance", @Deuteronomy 32:9. "Ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me", @Exodus 19:5. May God bless the word thus to us!
{446}
THE ASSEMBLY IN VIEW IN THE GOSPEL
@Luke 4: 38, 39; @Luke 7: 44 - 47; @Luke 8: 45 - 48; @Luke 10: 39, 42; @Luke 13: 11 - 13
In my remarks, dear brethren, although they are intended to be initial and foundational, I have the assembly in mind. Luke is not, as Matthew, specially an ecclesiastical gospel, but the assembly is in mind. The writer being the travelling companion of Paul, who was minister of the assembly and who shared his sufferings in some measure, and knew something of the breathings of the heart of the great apostle, could not but be imbued by the Spirit with the thought of the assembly, in writing his gospel. It is peculiarly evangelical, as we are all perhaps aware. No other gospel or book has such a variety of evangelical touches as Luke. It is Jesus come down, taking the lowest place in order to be low enough for all, in order to be near to all, for *men* are in view and not any particular nation. The angelic host at the outset celebrates the mind of heaven in regard to what had transpired at Bethlehem: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men", @Luke 2:14. This remarkable, as I may say, poetic pronouncement is uttered on the occasion of the birth of Jesus. "Unto you", said the angel earlier, "is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord" (verse 11); a wide outlook is thus contemplated. Humanity is in mind as the area or material in relation to which the evangelical operations of God should proceed. It bows the heart, and appeals peculiarly to the needy soul. No gospel takes a more touching account of human need.
While this is everywhere stamped on the book, the divine need is also there; something too often forgotten by us, that there is such a thing as divine need, and moreover, that in meeting human need God has His own need in His heart: "For of him, and through him,
{447}
and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever", @Romans 11:36. We shall never be right unless we are standing in that setting. He had His own need in mind, and the need of His beloved Son, speaking reverently. God is foreshadowed in Abraham, who having a son, desired that he should not be alone. He was not to be alone, and so we find with Isaac, as a type of Christ as risen from the dead, that he remains, as it were, in the elevation of the mount on which he was in figure offered up. Abraham returned with his young men and went to Beersheba, but nothing is said of Isaac descending. Instead of this, we immediately have the introduction of Rebecca and the great concern of Abraham that his son should have a companion in his own realm; for the companionship of the assembly for Christ is in heavenly places. It may be here for the moment in Sarah's tent, but its destiny is in heavenly places. It is a question of the need of Christ, a question of the need of His love. Love has needs, and so we find in this gospel, as in the others, "the Lord has need of it". In meeting our need, He has in mind to gratify His own, hence, every one who has become a subject of the gospel is claimed by the Lord for the assembly. The Lord will not be satisfied, I would say to anyone here who has not come to this, until you do come to it, until you say with the rest of us that we are not our own, we are bought with a price; we are Christ's, we are for Him; till then you have not answered to His desire. As it is said, that ye should be "to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God", @Romans 7:4. Let no one assume that the relief that has come into his soul through the gospel is the end of the matter. The end of the matter is the heart of God, the divine needs; God would have Christ and the assembly. If you have not yielded yourself to Him, He claims you now for the assembly; He needs you; your place is vacant, so to speak -- it should not be so. The Lord puts in His
{448}
claim. Do not deny Him. It says, He "loved the assembly", of which you in His mind form part, "and has delivered himself up for it", @Ephesians 5:25.
Now, I want to work out as fully as the time allows, from these women, an amplification of what I have said. Luke furnishes us with these five women, and they stand in his narrative in relation to one another, not promiscuously, but constructively. The thought of construction is an important idea to get into our minds. That is to say, the woman in chapter 4, prepares for the woman in chapter 7, and so on. The first great thought is simple, as indeed I hope you will see; it is subjection. It is said in the epistle to the Ephesians that "the assembly is subjected to the Christ", chapter 5:24. It is the divine mind that is thus conveyed to us, for that is to be her place and attitude; "subjected to the Christ", The relief that comes to this woman in chapter 4 makes way for this; the relief, as it were, synchronises in the result that the Lord intended, and I doubt whether anyone really profits by the gospel as the Lord intends, save that the result He has in mind synchronises with the relief, God must come into the mind as relief is enjoyed, if things are normal. This is an important matter, and applies to young believers, or to those who may be old in years, but have never yet come to it -- the Lord has need of them, for He has relieved them for a purpose. So the first thing, as I said, is subjection. The Lord, as you will observe here, stood *over* this woman. Think of *who* it was that stood over her. Picture the scene: a feverish person -- Peter's wife's mother, as in his house was in circumstances tending to irritability; but, however provocative a set of circumstances may be, there is no excuse for irritability. The work of God cannot go on in our souls in a feverish condition. The Lord is teaching us to be restful, to learn to lie fallow, to be in His hand, as clay in the hand of the potter. The Lord stood over her. What an impression it must have conveyed to her soul! Such
{449}
a One! It was more than a mere figure. The Lord is never a mere figure; He is a real Person, and a Person of influence. Whether He speaks or otherwise, the influence is there, and if He stands over you when you are in a state of impatience, a state of feverishness, it is to impress you with His moral authority. In such a state you are no material for Him, and so there must be a change, and that change comes about in the recognition of Him in His authority; not here official authority, but that which is suggested in the majestic Personage that stands over you. It must be so. He is Lord of all; even if we do not admit it, the authority is always present in Him.
Then, you will observe in the passage, that He rebuked the fever. There is much of this feverishness, especially in large cities where pressure is great. As time goes on, it seems as if the pressure of circumstances increases, and saints have to be fortified against what is peculiarly current, to learn how to be free from perturbation, fretfulness, and complainingness. Christ in His personal authority comes into the soul and subdues it, for that is the idea. He stood over her and then He rebuked the fever in her, for it is a question of a disease. He rebuked the disease and the fever left her and "she arose and ministered unto them". In a little way she is an assembly person. The Lord intends it so. She served *them*. It is a believer's household that is before us here. It is the house of Peter. Possibly some of them had provoked her, but she served them. She is not selective as to whom she serves; she is not to be one of those who make special friends amongst the brethren. Special friendships provoke partisan feeling and resentment, and militate against the work of God in His people. Whether it be all in the household, or all in the local company, or all within one's range, one is actuated by the spirit of Christ, serving all. How are we to serve? It is in a new way; it is "in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter", @Romans 7:6; I believe this
{450}
principle begins here. Luke is building up something beginning with this woman, and he leaves her in subjection and service; activity in the service of the saints is greatly needed.
The next woman is the well-known one in chapter 7. She is a *lover of Christ*. I do not know of any term that may be applied to us which is more forceful in a way than to say that he or she is a lover of Christ. It is a wonderful distinction to be reckoned amongst the lovers of Christ. I hope no one here is exempt. I speak feelingly, for Scripture says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maran-atha", @1 Corinthians 16:22. We cannot afford to be reckoned amongst such. Let us range ourselves with the lovers of Christ; He deserves our affection. Now this woman is not presented to us as a subject of direct service on the part of anyone. There are many such today who have come into the truth as breathing the spirit of the testimony of the time. Chapter 7 of Luke is designed to convey to us the character of the dispensation throughout. A great evangelical influence has come in and God is operating in relation to it. The south wind is blowing; God can bring in the south wind when needed. This chapter indicates what is current, that an evangelical spirit prevails. That is seen where the spirit of the dispensation is restored and maintained in any little measure -- a very great matter. So that she is not presented to us as the subject of any particular service. It is as if she breathed the air of the moment. And what a moment it is! Happy is every one who has lungs spiritually capable of taking in the holy evangelical air that is intended to mark the time!
Whence is she? Who has told her about Jesus? We are not told, but she knows about Him. Let no one complain that they have not been told. He is to be known. Do not complain that you have not been told that the sun is in the heavens; it is foolish. Jesus is in
{451}
the front in this chapter. There is an evangelical current, and this woman breathed of it. She is a lover of Jesus. He says so; she does not. I would rather have Him say that I am a lover of His than that I should say so. Think of Him saying to any of you, You are a lover of mine, yea, telling others about it. "He turned to the woman"; she is in His mind for the moment. Here it is love begotten by benefit. That is the initial kind of love that enters into christianity. God comes down beside you and relieves you, whether directly or indirectly, and you love on account of the benefit, a great result. The Lord commends it; He says of her, "she loved much". That word "much" in His mouth is much. Think of Him saying it of one who hitherto had been a poor sinner of the city! Does it not appeal to you, that Christ needs lovers? He needs them in a personal way and also for the assembly. I am not fit for the assembly if I am not a lover of Christ; but if I am a lover of Christ I must surely accede to His request in the Supper and also in other respects. Let me show it. This woman showed it; that is the point. "Seest thou ... ?" He says. He was looking at her Himself. Think of that! He had already turned to her. Think of the Lord of glory turning to you, and calling the attention of others to you! How attentive the angels would be when the Lord speaks thus of any one! Even when we repent the angels take notice, there is movement in heaven. How much more when our affections become active toward Christ, and when He says, This one is a lover of Mine. She belongs to the assembly in principle. He is securing one and another, each representing some feature, and this is one of the *great* features. May God grant that not one may leave this hall other than as a lover of Christ! There are those here who it may be do not love Christ. No others will be in heaven than those who love Christ. You want to be there; but it must be in suited dress. The activity of love is the shining out of glory. Moses and Elijah, "two men",
{452}
as they are called, "appeared in glory", speaking to Jesus. They were lovers of Christ.
Now the next woman is in chapter 8, representing the body of Christ. The body is said to be of Christ; @Colossians 2:17. No other material but what is of Christ will do. Here a little, and there a little, but all of Christ; the members are formed out of Christ. Something of Christ entered into that feverish woman's soul when He stood over her; something formative entered into the woman's soul in chapter 7. He tells her that she had faith: "thy faith", He said. He would not send her away otherwise. Those who have faith have some formation. Whatever was in her was greatly augmented, we may be sure, as He turned towards her. There was in this the radiation of the love in Him towards her. What an impression she would carry away! Think of what the effect would be when she went away! Suppose you had met her and made inquiry, how affecting her remarks would be. She was a lover of Christ and so was in principle a member of His body. And what the Spirit of God has in mind as to this third person is that she is likewise a member of Christ's body; we can only be this as *transparent*. Opaque persons are not members of Christ's body characteristically; double-mindedness and reserve are foreign to the body of Christ. There is no shining out of Christ through an opaque body. What is needed is transparency. She touched the Lord; she was going to be a secret disciple; she was going to get benefit secretly, and get away and enjoy her benefit, and forget the glorious Person out of whom the virtue came. Power had gone out of Him, power actually going out from His Person. He says, "virtue is gone out of me", He was conscious of it. The disciples did not understand. This is a chapter of assembly material. We get the man sitting at the feet of Jesus, then the woman here, and the child later. It is a chapter specially requiring spiritual understanding. It was a secret matter with this woman, but the Lord will have things
{453}
out, and things exposed by herself; for she exposes herself, and He allows that. He says, "Somebody hath touched me", but He saw to it that she spoke for herself, that she told her own story. He spoke of the woman in chapter 7 in the most touching terms, as I have been saying. He is not commending this woman for the moment; He is calling her "Somebody". That is not a family name. No one here wishes to be so named. A member of Christ is to have distinction. The Lord intended that this "Somebody" should become identified, and she fell down, a movement perhaps that is not very current with us. It belongs to christianity; it is one of the accredited movements of christianity. Prophetic ministry is calculated to cause people to fall down. Ministry is excellent that brings that about. Ministry should be of a searching character. So-called meetings for ministry should have the character of prophecy, of a word from God, a word that searches the inner parts, so that there is transparency. The man, it says in @1 Corinthians 14, who comes in, falls down; because somebody in prophetic power is ministering the truth. May God prosper meetings arranged for this purpose! They are His own ordering. They are intended to expose us to God, and, if necessary, to one another. The unbeliever coming in falls down, Scripture says, and confesses that "God is indeed amongst you". What a great result that is! That is how assembly material is brought about. We may have a thousand listening to the word of God, but there can be no assembly material practically, aside from what I am saying, aside from transparency; and the prophetic ministry is intended for that, to search us through and through. We may as well face it now, for searched we shall be. The judgment seat of Christ indeed will bring everything out, but the apostle was facing it already. We do well to anticipate the judgment seat of Christ. This woman falls down and tells all the truth, and the Lord says, "Daughter", as much as to
{454}
say, You belong to the family now. It is not merely some unknown person in the crowd, but a known individual with a status in the family. How blessed that is! You must not miss it. The inner state is relieved by the power that went out of Christ, and formation was there as testified in the woman's confession; that is what is implied -- the body of Christ.
Well, passing on to Mary of Bethany, I need not say much, but you can see how she fits in here. It is another feature of the same person, we may say. We have a subject person serving all; we have a lover of Christ; we have a transparent person, searched through and through, and then recognised with family distinction. Now we have a person seeking intelligence, for surely intelligence must mark the assembly. When the apostle Paul addresses the saints in relation to the Lord's supper he says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say", @1 Corinthians 10:15. I should have that in mind now. The assembly is to be marked by the greatest intelligence. To be the companion of Christ, it must be so; one that can share His thoughts, enter into His feelings, sympathise with Him -- she is called, "the Lamb's wife". The Lamb's wife is His confidante. It is a remarkable thing that the wife comes out, before the bride. It means just what I am saying, intelligence as to the moment, intelligence as to what He is going on with, intelligence as to the dispensation. So that we understand Christ, we know headship. Let us think of this. What is headship to me? How can Christ be my Head if I am not in spiritual intelligence? Well, how am I to be spiritually intelligent? By sitting down and listening to Him. It is not a question of asking Him any particular thing or question, but listening to what He is saying, and if He sees you listening, He will say what you need, He will take account of your need, and He will lead you on to the vast range of things in His mind. Think of the mind of Christ, what is before Him! Paul says, "*we* have the mind of
{455}
Christ", @1 Corinthians 2:16. We can think like Him; that thought is implied. Now, Mary represents that side, and I do urgently appeal to you, I urge upon the brethren the need for intelligence, not simply that I know this or that truth, or the prophetic line, but the mind of Christ, what He is going on with. For that is the great thought. Am I going along with Christ, and having part with Him in all He is doing? I believe that is what is meant in the term, "the Lamb's wife"; she is His confidante in the time of suffering. Mary sat at His feet, we are told, and the Lord says of her to a complaining sister, that she "hath chosen that good part". There is no lack of this kind of complaint abroad. Why are we not evangelical? Why are we not of a missionary spirit? We may well let such questions search us through, but we want to sit at the feet of Jesus and hear His word. Let that be the first thing in regard of requirements, in regard of service, in regard of activity; let us have His mind; we want His mind, and that is in the word. He discloses it in the word. She sat and listened to what He was saying, and the Lord defended her.
Finally, the well-known woman in chapter 13 presents the climax of the subject. It is another feature that belongs to the assembly. She was bent together, we are told, by the devil. It was no mere malady -- rheumatism, or one of the many "isms" that pathology speaks of now. It was not a question of those things. That we get in chapter 8. The physicians did their best, but their best was their worst; she rather suffered from them. Now, it is an act of the devil. What do you think an act of this kind means? It is meant to rob Christ and God of what They are seeking. Think of the enemy having such an advantage over me that he is spoiling me for that for which I am apprehended. What is being worked out here is something for God. What is that something? That He might be glorified, and this woman does that when she is relieved. This
{456}
is not said of any of the others. As I said, it is a constructive matter, and the end in view is that God is seeking something -- and He gets it. How does He get it? She is loosed of her infirmity. The Lord calls to her; it is urgent. If the devil has done this to you, the Lord is calling to you about it now. The other woman was twelve years with her secret disease; this act of the devil took place eighteen years before. What was the intent of it? To defeat the divine purpose in the woman. She was a daughter of Abraham. The daughters and sons of Abraham are the objects of the bitterest satanic opposition. They belong to the family of faith. She belonged to the family of faith, and the devil said eighteen years before, I will defeat the divine intent in that woman, and so he bound her together.
This may be applied to some of us if we look back in our histories. It is well to do that. Where you have history given as here in years, it means that I am to look back in my history and see what has happened, and if things that have been bound by an act of the devil have not been righted, get them righted. It is not too late. The Lord called to her; it was urgent. "Thou art loosed", He says. That was His mind, and then He lays His hands upon her, and she was made straight; she is made upright and she glorified God. Another great feature of the members of the assembly is uprightness. The Lord lays His hands upon her, and she stands upright. It means that He is identified with her. Now, this is the first time you get this feature, but you see, she is to glorify God in the assembly, as we may say. It is said in the great assembly epistle, Ephesians: "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages", chapter 3:21. It is one of the finest statements that you can find, certainly in regard of the assembly. One is never tired of repeating it, and this woman enters into that. The Lord lays His hands upon her, not His hand only, but His hands. He would say now as to anyone like
{457}
her, Satan has deprived Me of you for eighteen years; I want you for the assembly. He sings in the midst of the assembly, and He needs such as you to sing in the assembly where God is glorified. It is a wonderful thought that there is that here on earth today in which God is glorified, and I want to be in it too. I am sure everybody here who is sincerely a christian would say the same thing, I want to be in that in which God is glorified, not that in which man is glorified; the world is built up for the glory of man, but the Lord Jesus is building up something, preserving something, ordering something for the glory of God, where God is to be glorified, and that is what comes out here. She glorified God, and the Lord is identified with that, and I believe He is helping us greatly in view of it.
Well, may He help us now to follow up these thoughts and see how they bear on each of us in our local settings and in our universal setting as of the assembly, for His name's sake.
