READINGS ON FIRST THESSALONIANS (1)
@1 Thessalonians 1: 1 - 10
J.T. The first epistle to the Thessalonians is suggested because there are a great many young people among the brethren, relatively, in this country, and the epistles to the Thessalonians peculiarly apply to youth, to the young among the saints, to the young that existed in Paul's time and, we may thank God, in our time. There is quite an increase among the young, and especially among the young men that are available for service, for preaching; so the first epistle to the Thessalonians is selected because it contains such an appeal to youth, to young assemblies too, and to the youth among them. In fact it may be said that they are Paul's first epistles, and undoubtedly he had in mind the freshness that existed among the saints of God in his time and that they might be set on their way rightly. So we shall observe that he speaks of imitation. It says in verse 6, "and *ye* became our imitators, and of the Lord, having accepted the word in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Spirit, so that ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia: for the word of the Lord sounded out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith which is towards God has gone abroad, so that we have no need to say anything; for they themselves relate concerning us what entering in we had to you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and to await his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from among the dead, Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath". So there is great stress laid on the idea of imitation, imitation of
{2}
others who have been long in the way and have known the truth, and ministered it, too. So the point is for the younger ones to think of what is needed and see how it is to be learned from those long in the way, from the elder brethren.
R.W.S. So we have the opening and laying down at Thessalonica in @Acts 17. Would that not bear on all who are young? We have examples in the elders, but the tendency in this country to which you alluded would be met by the opening up and laying down of the truth, would it not?
J.T. Quite so. The opening up is the ministry that would bring out the truth, and the laying down is the authority that accompanies it, which is always needed. Opening up is one thing and laying down is another, and that implies the authority that goes with the truth.
C.H.H. Would the term "to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father" be a term of affection?
J.T. Yes, implying the security of the position. How well they would be taken care of. It does not say that in Romans, or Ephesians, but it says it here. "in God the Father", it is a peculiar expression for an assembly.
L.E.S. Would the laying down be in accord with the Holy Scriptures? They would be the basis for all that is said.
J.T. Just so. The Scriptures are the only authority that we have, so that we have sure ground to stress authority. "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable", @2 Timothy 3: 16. It is not only that it is authoritative but it is profitable, that is to say, as we look into the Scriptures we see there is nothing else to compare with them. The young people need to get that into their minds and hearts, and that they are profitable. It would keep them from reading other things that are unprofitable and defiling.
{3}
C.M. Would the fact that Paul identifies Timothy with him here in this first verse indicate something as to what you are saying as to the young coming into the truth and being usable in it?
J.T. He was a comparatively young man himself. He had learned the truth from his mother and grandmother, which is a good source for young people to learn from, their godly mothers and grandmothers in the houses. It is a question of household influence and authority.
A.R. It says in @Acts 17 they "joined themselves to Paul and Silas". Would that suggest the idea of a good lead and young people linking themselves on with the elder brethren?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Would you preach from the New Translation (Darby Translation) of the Scriptures, or the King James version on Lord's day evening in preaching the gospel?
J.T. That is an important question. As far as I am concerned, whenever I try to minister the word, whatever it may be, I use the New Translation (Darby Translation) now, because it is accurate, and many of us are inaccurate and are apt to be misled by inaccurate statements.
Rem. In @Acts 8 we have a verse in the King James version which is not genuine, and some have thought that as it is there it is all right to preach from it, which I would not do.
J.T. I think that is worth while considering. At one time it was felt that it might appear that we had a Bible assumed to be our own, and that it took on the character of sectional feeling, whereas now the New Translation (Darby Translation) is so well known that we are perfectly safe in using it.
R.W.S. In the preaching too?
J.T. I do. I would have no difficulty about it now, because it is so well known, and where the preaching goes on, as a rule the brethren are all there, a large number of them relatively anyway.
{4}
The question, therefore, is whether we read the Bible enough, especially sisters, whether we read the New Translation (Darby Translation) and get the accurate translation that it contains.
F.J.F. Mr. Darby said of Mr. Raven to watch that young man for his mind is formed by Scripture.
J.T. Just so. I would extend that to the sisters. They should read at home and privately and incessantly themselves, not only wait for the household reading but read themselves. "From a child thou hast known the sacred letters".
Rem. You suggested the other night that we should read our chapters five times and Mr. Darby's Synopsis once.
J.T. I would say that.
Rem. I thought it would confirm the importance of getting things from the Scriptures.
J.T. Quite so.
R.W.S. In all our meetings then, including the preaching of the word of God, we are quite right to use the New Translation (Darby Translation). Is that what I understand?
J.T. I think so. Why not use the best? The notes, too, in the New Translation (Darby Translation) are very copious and useful and we all should read them if we can, read the notes and commentaries on the text.
R.W.S. Then our Bibles in the meeting rooms should be the New Translation (Darby Translation) instead of the Authorised version.
J.T. Well, I would say so.
A.J.G. Should not the brethren bring their own Bibles?
J.T. Very good.
R.W.S. I mean the Bibles for strangers who come into the rooms. They should be the New Translation (Darby Translation). We have a good many Authorised Translations in our meeting rooms.
{5}
W.W.M. Is it not important for every brother and sister to have a New Translation (Darby Translation) and read it? It should be laid on our consciences.
J.T. Just so and read the notes as well as the text.
W.W.M. It should be an exercise that those who do not own one should have one.
F.J.F. In Oxford University they use Mr. Darby's translation as the best French as a model to learn from. It ought to be no difficulty for us who love the truth to have it in our homes and in our meetings. No doubt the Romish authorities are aware of the ministry that is published by us.
J.T. I quite believe that. Someone was sitting by a priest who was reading one of our books and the brother nearby to him made an inquiry about it. He said 'we get all the books that are published'. So it shows that if we circulate books they ought to be authoritative.
Ques. Would @Luke 1 help us to be attending on the word and accurately acquainted with it?
J.T. Quite so. Of course, we try to get accuracy in these meetings. We attempt to be accurate and if any brother gives out anything that is not quite accurate, the thing is to question him and point out what is accurate.
Ques. You mean if I were to say something that is not quite accurate now, you would check me now?
J.T. Just so, and whatever you say elsewhere too, I question that if I hear about it. Every brother should be ready and open to be questioned, because there is so much current among the brethren in different parts of the world that it is right that everything should be accurate. What is said and done should be accurate. In some places we get special customs, whereas our customs should all be accurate and agree with each other.
{6}
F.J.F. A priest spoke to me the other day in this country when I was speaking to a man in the hospital. I said, 'Salvation is found only in Jesus', and the priest said, 'Yes, it is found in Jesus and His church'. The priest is right, that salvation is not only in the Lord, but in its present aspect it is in the church.
J.T. Just so. Mr. Raven stressed that very particularly, and God used it and has used it ever since, that salvation is not only in Christ but in the assembly. Why should it not be? If the assembly is Christ's spouse, she should know everything as taught of Him. These special meetings now are of first rate importance. God has greatly blessed them in this country for the last fifty years. These meetings are little, relatively, but God is blessing them and the thing is that we should agree with each other. That is to say, we should be catholic; the word would mean that it is universal and we are in agreement with each other.
A.J.G. Would you say something as to the three things mentioned in verse 5? "For our glad tidings were not with you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance".
J.T. "Our glad tidings", that is Paul's. Then again we have corresponding to that, "knowing of whom thou hast learned them", @2 Timothy 3: 14. We should know the persons who say things, that we can rely on what they are saying. So we have here, "For our glad tidings were not with you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance". That is to say, the thing is manifest that it is in the power of God. It is not simply that it is accurate, it is from the Scriptures, but it is in power. Evidence should be there that it is in power.
A.J.G. Would the power be connected with the fact of the ministers themselves being in accord with
{7}
the glad tidings, so that the Holy Spirit could identify His power with them?
J.T. Quite so. "Knowing of whom thou hast learned them". So it pleases God if He takes up any whom He would use, to see to it that they arc instructed according to the Scriptures, otherwise we have local customs and local ideas. In our country people say, 'Well, we say so and so', but it should be accurate or it should not be said. We should have the Scriptures behind us or we should not say anything.
W.J.B. The Spirit of truth would bear on this question of accuracy, would it?
J.T. Quite so, not only the letter of truth but the spirit of it. The word *spirit* has a peculiar meaning in that sense and it ought to be understood, the spirit of a *thing*, not the spirit of a person.
F.K.C. Is that why the Lord says in @John 7: 38 "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water"? It was the Spirit of truth the Lord was bringing forward.
J.T. Quite so. "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said". It is what the scriptures say, not only what the letter is; it is what they say. Then "out of his belly" means his inwards. It is not simply external, what is said with his mouth, but his inwards.
Rem. In @2 Corinthians 4 Paul, speaking about his ministry, says, "We have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God. But if also our gospel is veiled it is veiled in those that are lost". Would that support what you have in mind as to the importance of the truth? Is the idea of the Spirit of truth involved in this?
{8}
J.T. I would say that. The Corinthian epistle contains more questioning than any other epistle because Paul himself was questioned there. It is a humbling thing when the brother who is ministering the truth is questionable, but it is still more humbling if he is questioned unwarrantably. In Philippians Paul says that some were preaching out of contention, evidently having something against Paul. It is very humbling that there should be a tendency to question the brethren who are ministering the truth, whereas if they are ministering the truth, the truth ought to commend them.
W.J.B. When Paul said, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" (@1 Corinthians 14: 37), did he mean that they were to discern the authoritative element in his ministry?
J.T. It is not only that Paul was accurate, but it is the Lord's commandment, and that is what he was stressing. Let him recognise that the things we minister are the truth, he says, the Lord's commandment. If the Lord has spoken, there is no more to be said, but to bow to it.
Rem. The Lord Jesus says in @John 8: 40, "Now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I have heard from God". Then Paul says in @Galatians 4: 16, "So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you?" It is a serious matter if a brother who seeks to minister the truth is set aside on account of personal feeling.
J.T. Quite so, I go fully with that.
R.W.S. Is it not a favour of God that in this country, which is relatively new, you might say, the testimony has been sustained and, we might say, augmented so that there are models whom we can follow? There are persons whom we can imitate.
{9}
I wondered in that connection about how long the testimony has really been in this country.
J.T. Mr. Darby was one of the first to minister in this country. He ministered here very much and I would say he established the truth more than anyone else who ministered here.
R.W.S. I note in his letters he was here and in Canada, but then he went back to England. I was thinking of those who came here and stayed here and had children here, and meetings were established here, whether that does not go back to probably 1880, 1890 or 1900 so that young people now have an advantage which young persons did not have forty years ago.
J.T. Just so.
A.B. In the reference to opening and laying down as in Thessalonica, you have us in mind; "in word ... in power ... in the Holy Spirit", the word is for ourselves and the Spirit of truth has a present bearing on us.
J.T. Just so. Most of us have come a distance and it has cost us something; it is well that it has cost us something because what costs us something is usually more valued. We are not on a holiday when we come to these meetings. We have come to learn something.
A.B. What has been said in regard to reading the New Translation should help us in relation to the spirit of the truth. While there is "the scripture of truth" (@Daniel 10: 21), there is the spirit of the truth which has its present bearing on us.
J.T. So that when brethren go back from a meeting like this, they ought to be able to carry what is said so that the truth is spread, and the truth carries its own weight.
G.A.T. In @John 8: 31, 32, discipleship is connected with knowing the truth.
{10}
J.T. Just so. Discipleship, as usually spoken of in Scripture, involves that we are learning the truth. So as we see with one man in the antediluvian world, the seventh from Adam; his name means devoted or disciplined. He carried the thing on and transferred it to others.
G.A.T. I just had in mind how it followed on. The Lord says, "ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free", @John 8: 32.
J.T. Then again, "If therefore the Son shall set you free", (that is the Lord Jesus), "ye shall be really free" (verse 36).
F.H.L. In verse 3 the apostle credits these young believers with three great qualifications, each qualified by a phrase. Would you say a word about that? "Remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labour of love, and enduring constancy of hope". There is a wonderful foundation in that.
J.T. It is a remarkable combination of thoughts, "remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labour of love, and enduring constancy of hope". That ought to speak to us. I have often thought of it in looking through these two epistles, how these words are there. You have faith and hope and love, and there is this idea of constancy, "enduring constancy of hope". I believe perhaps the scarcest thing among the brethren is hope in the true sense. We are not hopeful and cheerful enough. We are too doleful, instead of being cheerful because of the greatness of the things we have come into; they are to come to pass immediately. The hope is immediate, we might say. For many reasons I think we are entitled to think and say that the coming of the Lord is near, and then there is another beautiful expression, the appearing; and there are those who love the appearing of the Lord. It inspires hope in our hearts. It is very near; it is imminent.
{11}
A.B. Is it confirmed at the end of verse 6, "having accepted the word in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Spirit"?
J.T. Quite so.
A.R. Bearing on your remark would you explain verse 10, "await his Son from the heavens". That is not the rapture, is it?
J.T. No, it is His Son from heaven. It is properly the second coming of the Lord, and these epistles are full of it. There is mention in every chapter in the first epistle of the Lord's coming. It is not simply He is coming for us but He is coming with us, I mean to say He comes openly, so that He is to be with us and we are to be with Him. "We shall be always with the Lord".
A.J.G. Why does it say "await his Son" and not await the Lord, for instance? Is there any link with the second Psalm where the Son is given the inheritance, "Ask of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance, and for thy possession the ends of the earth", @Psalm 2: 8? It is the Son who is given all things.
J.T. Just so. "Await his Son" is a beautiful expression. There is something about the idea of the Son that bears on the affections of the brethren, what the Son is. There is peculiar attractiveness in it. John's gospel is full of it. Christians are never called sons in John's gospel but the Lord Jesus is constantly called it. He is the Son.
A.R. Would that bear on @John 3: 35, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand"?
J.T. We have cited that. "The Son"; it is that Person, and this passage here is very like it. "await his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from among the dead, Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath".
{12}
A.J.G. While the day of glory is about to open up, it is really a great system of affection that will be introduced then. Is that the thought?
J.T. That is what I would say. What a thought comes into the heart in connection with the Son; of course power goes with it too, but it is the Son, meaning the Son of the Father. He has that place in the whole universe; He is the Son, and every being in the universe, using the word 'universe' to convey the idea of what is general, will recognise that the Son is the Son, and there is no one to compare with Him.
A.J.G. "All may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father", @John 5: 23.
J.T. Just so. I am glad you said that.
J.H.E. Would that connect with @1 John 3. "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God"? Then it brings in the manifestation, "we shall see him as he is".
J.T. Quite so. "What we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", @1 John 3: 2. That does not appear yet, but we apprehend the love. "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God. For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we children of God" (verse 1). It is children we are dealing with, not sons. John hardly ever uses the word sons as referring to the saints, only in one place, but the point is that now we are children of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be, that will be sonship, but it does not mention that, save as saying "we shall be like him".
J.H.E. I thought that all our blessings are spiritual.
J.T. Quite so, we are the children of God now, that means that we derive from God, the idea of derivation, whereas sonship is dignity.
{13}
J.H.E. "And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure", @1 John 3: 3.
J.T. Quite so, that is the present application now, the children are to be pure.
R.W.S. Verse 10 of our chapter says, "and to await his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from among the dead, Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath". That Person is Jesus, not only "his Son from the heavens"; the personal name is designed to affect us inwardly, is it not?
J.T. Jesus, He is our deliverer from the coming wrath. The personal name is used, not Christ, but the personal name of the Lord.
F.J.F. So that it is very precious for the youngest believer who knows Jesus. He is the same blessed Person.
F.S.C. It says in chapter 5, verse 9, "God has not set us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ".
J.T. It is the whole name and title, "who has died for us, that whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him", @1 Thessalonians 5: 10. That is a very beautiful phrase.
D.P. Would the setting up of an assembly in a city become a test to a servant to bring in proper food so that steady growth might be maintained? The Thessalonians were planted in very difficult soil and it would require proper ministry so that they might not come under the power of what was current around.
J.T. Quite so. The food indicates who they are, that they are the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore the importance of refusing such food as would impoverish. There is so much read by young people that impoverishes them. We want to get proper food, and these three-day meetings afford an opportunity for
{14}
developing a certain line of truth that may be especially used for the young people at the present time.
F.K.C. I would like to ask whether this idea of *model* should be seen with us? It says, "so that ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia". Paul said to Timothy, "be a model of the believers".
J.T. Surely if someone wished to look at the model we should be fully fitted for it, that we may justify the idea that is to be presented in us.
J.L.P. The saints at Thessalonica seem to have had a good foundation, among other things, in faith. Would you say if we have not a right foundation we will be weak in the testimony to others? It says that the word of the Lord sounded out from them.
J.T. So that it says in @2 Timothy 2, "Yet the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".
C.H.H. Do you think that owing to the circumstances they were passing through there was a tendency to lose the constancy of hope, because it is not mentioned in the second epistle? Their faith and love was abounding but there is nothing about hope. Do you think there is a tendency among us to lose hope?
J.T. I think so. One has often noted that we give way on the line of hope; we are not marked by expectancy of the coming of the Lord; we do not love His appearing. It is not simply that we speak of the Lord's appearing, but we are to love it. He is to be seen when He appears.
G.H. In connection with the Lord's coming it says, "So encourage one another with these words", @1 Thessalonians 4: 18. Would that be to promote hope?
J.T. I should think so. Encouraging one another would keep us from becoming droopy, because we so easily become droopy and disconsolate. So that we
{15}
are to be encouraged, not simply that the truth encourages, but the saints encourage each other.
W.W.M. The apostle says in @Romans 15: 13, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit".
J.T. Abound in it. Very good. These things, I believe, are intended as we are here now to help the younger brethren to see how the older brethren have got things, and they can speak of them and take them in and encourage others who are not at these meetings; take home good tidings to encourage those who could not come.
H.B. Would the word in @Deuteronomy 6: 7 help, "thou shalt impress them on thy sons, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house"?
J.T. Yes. There is so apt to be very little in our conversation that is profitable; whereas what we hear is the great thing and we want to impress it on others a, we go home.
A.J.G. Do you think the apostle was bringing in a further establishing feature in saying, "Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election" as though he would remind the Thessalonians that the way they had received the gospel was evidence of their being elect of God? Is not that a very establishing feature in the soul?
J.T. Yes. There is something very peculiar in being elected of God. We have the word chosen too, have we not; it says of the Lord "with God chosen, precious".
F.J.F. God has greatly privileged us above all believers on the earth to have the light of the assembly, and the question is how much we appreciate it.
J.T. And in appreciating it, to speak of it to others as we have opportunity, and especially in the home circles, the children and mothers. Be sure to carry
{16}
something for them to partake of that will build them up also.
L.E.S. Do you think that the difficulty with many of us is that we do not understand the bearing of our baptism? Does not baptism enter much into what we are saying?
J.T. Quite so.
F.W. James says, "Have patience, therefore, brethren, till the coming of the Lord", @James 5: 7.
J.T. Yes. We feel the need of it constantly, but the coming of the Lord draws nigh.
{17}
READINGS ON FIRST THESSALONIANS (2)
@1 Thessalonians 2: 1 - 20
J.T. Referring again to the matter of youthfulness indicated in this epistle, it might be remarked that the word *children* is used in different senses, not only here, but in John's epistles. We have stressed the idea of youthfulness and the idea of children, but the first sense is that the word *children* alludes to the saints generally irrespective of age or growth, whereas on the other hand, the word *little children* in John's epistle refers to growth. It corresponds a good deal with what we have in this epistle. I mention it because some of us may carry away the thought that 'children' is used only of youthful persons, whereas the word sometimes conveys the thought of children generally; that is, God's children. So we have in John's epistle, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", @1 John 3: 1. That refers to the saints generally. It is not a question of youthfulness but rather derivation. On the other hand, in that same epistle we have the idea of little children, first the idea of children in the general sense, and then we have fathers, and young men and little children. The latter alludes to youthfulness, to growth and the like. It is important to keep this in mind so that we are not misled by any expressions as to the saints, because God is thinking of us in the main as His children. "See what love the Father has given to us". It is the Father; He has bestowed this on us that we are to be called, not His sons, but His children. Then the little children refer to the saints who are young in the faith, which is the point in our first epistle, that the saints may be regarded as not developed very much in the truth. Of course, it is a humbling thing if we are not developed when we
{18}
should be. At the same time Scripture makes a difference between the two things. The lack of growth, of course, is almost surely the evidence of a low state amongst the saints, a low condition. These meetings are in order to lead up to full growth, because that is what God intends. We cannot assume that we will be little children in heaven. We have to assume that we shall all be perfect in heaven, complete.
R.W.S. In @1 John 2 the reference to the unction is in the paragraph which begins, "Little children, it is the last hour". Then it says in verse 20, "And ye have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things". Again in verse 27, "But as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him". Does the fresh ministry as to the Person of the Spirit promote greater growth in all of us and especially the young?
J.T. The little children are to become full grown, and the Spirit, of course, is the power for that. So that we have in the first reference, chapter 2: 1, "My children, these things I write to you"; that refers to Christians generally. Then we have in verse 12, "I write to you, children", which also refers to Christians generally. Then we have in verse 13, "I write to you, fathers", that is full development, "because ye have known him that is from the beginning". That is to say, they have gone the full length of the instruction, they are called fathers. Then again, "I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one". That is number two. Then again, "Little children", if you look at the note you will see that this refers to growth. It is the third reference that refers to growth. It is a question now, therefore, of what is in our minds in I Thessalonians, because it is assumed in what has been proposed that the condition here is in need of development
{19}
and growth, otherwise, without making any charges, there should not be so much difficulty locally. What is in one place may be true of every gathering represented here, that is to say, a low state, and the great point is self-judgment and making way for the Spirit of God. So that John says, "we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is". That is future, already we are the children of God.
R.W.S. I want to see, and all of us, the wonderful favour of the day in which we are, with the precious ministry of the last few years especially, that we can move out of the little children state to full manhood.
J.T. Well, if we are to be in heaven, it must be so. We might say, how can it be so? we suppose the time is short. Well, it is a question then of what God can do, not what we think, but what He is capable of doing, so that God can do a great deal in a short time. Job says, "I know that thou canst do everything", @Job 42: 2.
F.J.F. Why does the Lord call the disciples in @John 21 by the term 'little children' when they were coming back to him on the lakeside. Verse 5, "Jesus therefore says to them, Children, have ye anything to eat?" The note refers to @1 John 2: 13, 18, 'little children'. Why does he call them little children?
J.T. It is not in the text, not that I deny what you say, it is just children in the text. There is not much in that, only the idea of children. It is a diminutive thought undoubtedly in the Lord's mind, but still it is children according to the text of the translator.
F.J.F. I was thinking of what was said, that the time for learning is very short, and we have the Holy Spirit and the Lord to help us to move forward. I thought it was very encouraging that the Lord did not say any harsher word to them. They are still very precious to Him although they had wandered away.
J.T. You mean they went after Peter?
{20}
F.J.F. Yes, would that cause disunity if some are straying away?
J.T. I do not think we should make very much of that, that they followed Peter. It was more a matter of a careless way of doing things, because the Lord knew where they were actually as to the state of their souls. The Lord afterwards went at length into Peter's condition. "Simon ... lovest thou me more than these?" It is a question of love and Peter had assumed to love more than the others. The Lord corrects him in all that. As you say, it may refer to state, but at the same time I do not think it is a question of the general weakness of the saints at that time. It is more that they needed correction. Peter says "I go to fish" and the others say 'we will go with thee'. The Lord brought them back and served a dinner for them. "Come and dine", He said to them. They were viewed as men really; we do not say "Come and dine" to little children. They are viewed as intelligent.
A.J.G. Would you say it was no reproach to the Thessalonians to be little children because they were only about three weeks old, but it was a reproach to the Corinthians to have to be addressed as babes?
J.T. There has to be the little children stage in a spiritual sense with those who are recently converted, but under proper care and influence and example and teaching they will grow normally. But with the Corinthians they had a great deal of the apostle's ministry and yet when he wrote to them he had to tell them they were only babes in Christ, which was really a reproach to them.
F.W. "As a father his own children, we used to exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify, that ye should walk worthy of God". The children need help.
J.T. Quite so, there is a need of care. The apostle acted as a father to them. He regarded them as his
{21}
own children. That would mean what they were generally to him, that they were really converted by God and had some growth and so were capable of taking on the truth. The word is "For ye know yourselves, brethren, our entering in which we had to you", and so on. So the position he is taking here is in keeping with what we have been saying, that they were young in the faith; but still, there was some growth in them and they needed a father's care and he had shown, and was showing, that to them. At the same time there was definite formation or he could not have spoken to them as he does. He assumes they are intelligent. So he goes on to say, "For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, not to be chargeable to any one of you, we have preached to you the glad tidings of God. *Ye* are witnesses, and God, how piously and righteously and blamelessly we have conducted ourselves with you that believe", that is to say, they were characteristically believers. "As ye know how, as a father his own children, we used to exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify, that ye should walk worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory". Now I would submit to the brethren that what he says indicates a real, distinct formation in the Thessalonian saints and that they are ready for what the apostle has to say, and the whole epistle implies that there is the Spirit's work and formation in these saints. That is a very great matter.
N.B. Would you tell us why the thought of God is so prominent in this chapter? There are twenty verses and the term God appears fourteen times.
J.T. I am glad you speak of that. It is not the way God is presented in Romans exactly. Here it is what God is; God is love, and that is what is spoken of in this epistle, as John speaks of Him. We have a great deal of the salvation of God in Romans. It is more to bring out the responsibility to which God
{22}
holds His people, not simply that they are lovable, but that they are serviceable to God.
Rem. In verse 10 he puts the Thessalonian saints on a very high level when it comes to witness.
J.T. It says, "*Ye* are witnesses, and God, how piously and righteously and blamelessly we have conducted ourselves with you that believe". They are viewed as believers; they really have faith.
Rem. I can see that. My point was that when it came to a question of witness the apostle says, "*Ye* are witnesses, and God".
J.T. We are responsible to God; it is not the Father, but God as such. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", that is the idea. It is the great Creator and the One to whom the whole creation is responsible.
A.B. Is Paul outstanding in that way in regard to his ministry? No one says like Paul, "God is my witness", @Romans 1: 9. He calls God into his own personal matters in relation to his service.
J.T. That is good.
W.W.M. Would there be a difference in the thought of "a nurse ... her own children"; that is the gentleness and tenderness that would be shown to a young child, and the apostle's speaking of himself as a father with his own children which refers more to the faithfulness that would be needed to maintain things?
J.T. Just so. They were of such value to him, "his own children". In figure he uses the expression "a nurse"; it is a figure of his attitude toward the Thessalonians, that they began well. He regarded them as his own children, and therefore worthy of all the care he could confer on them.
J.K.P. In chapter 1 you were calling attention to imitators of Paul and of the Lord. In this chapter
{23}
it is the thought of imitators of the assembly. Does that suggest the further idea of growth you have in mind? I was thinking of their taking on the truth in a broad way in relation to other assemblies as stated in verse 14.
J.T. These brethren became imitators of the assemblies; it is plural, "the assemblies of God which are in Judaea". Why should it be noted that they became imitators of the assemblies in Judaea? I take it to be a credit to them. They are not selfish or partisan or national in their feelings. It is a question of God, "the assemblies of God which are in Judaea", that is, the general idea that is conveyed is, that they were imitating the assemblies in Judaea. Undoubtedly there were a great many meetings in Judea at that time. It was Judaea, that is where the Jews lived. So the Thessalonians were not national. Judea had been a great field of God's works, and they imitated that. We might say we had better imitate Judaea because God has been working there and we get light there. We are so apt to be national.
F.N.W. Does the influence of a father like Paul free the saints generally from national feeling?
J.T. I think it would, because Paul would be with God in all that was going on; he would not be national. Sometimes we are apt to be national. If a brother comes over from England, he might say things are done so and so in England, and it might not be right even. National feeling is the hardest thing to get rid of.
R.W.S. It is linked on with suffering in verse 14, "for *ye* also have suffered the same things of your own countrymen as also *they* of the Jews". The feature of suffering was set out in Judaea and how they acted would be an example to the Thessalonians. In our day would not the way the trade union matter has been met in Australia and other parts be an example to us here in the way we should meet it?
{24}
J.T. The word is "your own countrymen"; that ought to prevent mere national feeling; your own countrymen, the persons with whom you live, are apt to be persecutors. If they are apt to persecute you, then we are not likely to be national, and it is a very wholesome thing.
A.B.P. Had they seen suffering in the apostle, and the spirit that marked him though having suffered?
J.T. He would be an example to them.
G.H. The epistle starts with "Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians". Is that to bring out the good state among them?
J.T. Well, they were Thessalonians. It is important that we should take account of nations where God works. At Thessalonica there was a real work of God and Paul was used in it. They were Thessalonians and yet the apostle speaks of their own country. Another thing is they are said to be "in God the Father". God is taking care of them, not simply that they are God's, but the Father's, "in God the Father".
J.K. In @1 John 2, verse 13, a word is used which conveys that the state produced continues. Is that what should be seen in the saints today?
J.T. I think it would refer to what is local; as regards the work of God in America, there has been great improvement over fifty years, and I believe the explanation is largely that meetings such as these have been continued steadily during all this period. There is great encouragement for us to go on. There have been more of them lately than ever before in this country and Canada, I believe, showing that God is working with the brethren and He helps us. The Spirit of God Himself is helping us, because He is acting as the One *sent front heaven*. He is here in obedience, as it were, to carry out the will of God in this country and to work the work of God in it.
{25}
J.K. So that in that way we are privileged to see that as children of God there is a state being produced that continues.
J.T. As far as my memory goes, it is fifty years that these things have been going on. Our dear brother, Mr. S., if I may be allowed to refer to him, lived here for years, and God greatly blessed him because he aided brethren to come from different parts, from England particularly, and they came and were used. The work of God in that sense has been greatly augmented during these years, and it is still being augmented by means of these meetings.
Ques. Speaking about the work of God in this country, should we not be exercised that there are so many large cities where there are no meetings? What can we do about the matter?
J.T. Take Buffalo, near here, there is no meeting there; and many others like that. It is a great sorrow and exercise, but at the same time the work of God to a great extent is comparatively recent in this country.
Ques. Yes. I would like help as to what our exercises should be as to that matter. Should we pray more frequently at the prayer meetings that other saints in this country should also be drawn into the pathway of separation?
J.T. I think what is needed, to begin with, is the spirit of evangelisation, which marked Paul peculiarly. He connects the glad tidings with God, not simply the Father, "God's glad tidings" (@Romans 1: 1); that is something that should appeal to young hearts, that God is behind all evangelisation, and that should promote the spirit of evangelisation in all the saints, so that we talk to people in the light of that, that we bring in the gospel at every opportunity.
R.W.S. I wonder if @Acts 17 would help. Verse 1, "And having journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica"; that is,
{26}
two cities appear to be passed by and Thessalonica is evangelised. In this country there is a meeting in Washington which is growing; there is more there than there used to be, so that God still has the cities He wishes to have in the testimony. In the key cities of the world, really, the testimony is there, is it not?
J.T. Well, there are more brethren in this general meeting that I ever saw before in Rochester. That is something; it shows increased interest.
C.H.H. Would you encourage evangelising like @Luke 10, where you might visit a city and find a son of peace in a house which would be a nucleus for an assembly? The house precedes the city in @Luke 10.
J.T. That is good. There may be something to be said about all that as to this country and Canada, because I do believe there is general interest proceeding in these countries and in the adjoining countries to the far south; even in the Argentine there is a nice interest, a Roman Catholic country.
N.B. In @Acts 17 we read that those in Berea were more noble than those in Thessalonica, yet we do not hear of an assembly in Berea. Would you help us as to that?
J.T. It would look from the words spoken that there must have been an assembly there. They found things out from the Scriptures. The allusion would imply that there was an assembly there.
F.J.F. Would it be right for a brother to go to a town where there was no meeting if it was laid on his heart by the Lord?
J.T. If it is laid on his heart, it must be right, surely.
Rem. It is remarkable that the queen of the south came up to see the one who says, "I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem", @Ecclesiastes 1: 12. God has not overlooked Africa.
{27}
J.T. That is to say, the preacher was a king, so the preaching was in good hands. It is a great inquiry as to what God has at the present time in different parts of the world to proclaim the glad tidings, and that is by preachers. The word *preacher* ought to be looked into carefully because it is the means that God has of announcing the glad tidings. Solomon was a king, but he was also a preacher, Jonah and several others were preachers. Nebuchadnezzar was a preacher. There are quite a few preachers who are a help and an encouragement to us if we follow up what is said of them in the Scriptures.
Ques. This great evangelical idea is not limited to local platforms, is it? It is the great thought of God for men.
C.M. In verse 13 there seems to be an indication of the kind of preaching that had been going on in Thessalonica, does there not? It says, "And for this cause we also give thanks to God unceasingly that, having received the word of the report of God by us, ye accepted, not men's word, but, even as it is truly, God's word, which also works in you who believe". It was not only a matter of the preaching going forward but the way in which it was received and God working in those who believe.
J.T. Quite so, so that the solution we come to is that everything is to be traced back to God. God has made use of men like Paul, they were preachers and God was with them. We must trace everything back to God if we are to be right. That ought to come out in meetings like these, that God is working.
C.H.H. Would the experience in @Isaiah 6 enter into evangelising, the thought of the moral preparation and then the prophet saying "Send me", the idea of being sent and being available to be sent?
J.T. God is ready to send, of course: at the same time do we convey the idea of preaching, the heart that goes with the preaching, how God is in that
{28}
heart? Isaiah, I suppose, is the most evangelical of all the prophets.
A.B.P. Does @Romans 10: 14, 15 bring that into the present day? "How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without one who preaches? and how shall they preach unless they have been sent?"
J.T. Very good. There are a great many who can preach at the present time, but the next thing is whether God is with them, so that there is power in the preaching and real product of fruit from the preaching.
F.H.L. At the end of @Acts 17 Paul is preaching in Athens and getting results but he does not seem to continue the work. Would you say a word about that? "Thus Paul went out of their midst. But some men joining themselves to him believed; among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them". In view of all that has been said as to evangelisation, I was wondering why Paul does not continue the work there.
J.T. The indication is that the work was very small, but it was there anyway both in men and women. There was a man and a woman, "and others with them". There was some fruit from it, and we do get fruit in our little gospel meetings. We should, and do, get fruit and additions to the meetings too through the preaching. So that we should not be altogether discouraged, because God is working in this country and in Canada.
R.W.S. You made an observation a few days ago in a reading on @Romans 3 that preachers should understand Leviticus in a better way than they do. It came in in connection with the mercy-seat.
J.T. I do think that, that Leviticus is very little understood by the brethren, especially as to the law
{29}
of things, how things are done and according to law, so that they are not done according to man's will, but according to law in Leviticus. The law of things is given in Leviticus.
R.W.S. Yes, I am just wondering how that applies in the gospel preaching.
J.T. Well, how things are done in the word. Whatever we are doing should be governed by law, by what is right, not done any way, because the whole of Christendom has veered away to man's way of doing things. It is what we are trying to do now in meetings like this to keep things according to law, according to the law of God. The apostle says it is a question of the commandment of the Lord; it is a question of the commandment that is according to God. The whole of Christendom has veered away from that to man's way. God has been helping us in what the brethren have been seeking to do for 150 years, what is right to do, what ought to be done as we are together. They began to do what was right and then open brethrenism developed almost immediately. The devil got in, in opposition to the great revival of the truth, but the Spirit of truth continues with the saints. He is with us now to teach us how to get things done right. It says the daughters of Zelophehad speak right; it is a great matter to do things and say things that are right.
A.R. Is that why Paul refers in this chapter to the glad tidings of God?
J.T. Just so, it is in keeping with Romans, but I think it is to appeal to the Thessalonians in their youthfulness, because they are ready to take in things. Although they are youthful, they love God. They are of God. There is a lot to indicate that they love God and they want to hear about God, that is more what is meant, whereas in Romans it is more the responsibility that attaches to the thought of God,
{30}
but here it is the love that is drawn out to God, that the Thessalonians loved God.
J.L.P. Would the end of Matthew's gospel have any bearing on what has been before us? The Lord says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth". And then commissioning the disciples to go and make disciples of all the nations, and then the matter of teaching them to "observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you". @Matthew 28: 18, 20.
J.T. And the next thing is that "*I* am with you all the days, until the completion of the age". That is, the Lord is going to be with us if we do this, not simply the responsibility that attaches to it but He is going to be with us. "Baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit", it says at the end of Matthew, and the Lord says I am going to be with you always. That would mean, not what John says, but what Matthew teaches; that is to say, the Lord is with us always, whereas in John He comes to us. "I am coming to you", He says, @John 14: 18. In Matthew He is always with us, and I think we ought to pay attention to that too. We can always count on the Lord.
W.W.M. Would you say a word about the street preaching? Should we carry it on?
J.T. I think it is a first-rate work. When I was in Australia the last time, I noticed that there was no street preaching and l pointed it out to the brethren. There is street preaching now always. We do it in this country.
W.W.M. It speaks about Philip going down to Samaria to preach. I wondered if it would be right for any who had it laid upon his heart to preach in other towns besides the ones in which we have our meetings.
J.T. It is a question of what God is doing. If He lays it upon your heart, it must be right to do it; I would say it is always right to do it whenever you
{31}
have an opportunity. Another thing that comes up is whether there is fellowship in what is being done, whether the brethren are with you in it.
W.W.M. The scripture says, "How shall they hear without one who preaches? and how shall they preach unless they have been sent?" @Romans 10: 14, 15. Would the idea of being sent be more connected with the love of souls that God would put in a man's heart to try to win others?
J.T. Just so. I would add to what you have said the idea of fellowship, and the other thing is that the brothers are to have gift. There must be some gift before there is preaching, some ability from God to preach.
W.W.M. In regard to the preaching of the glad tidings, the word of God, while you have in mind the blessing of men, would you have the assembly in mind because that is where the result for God counts? Unless there is a result for God you are really only adding to the confusion of Christendom.
J.T. Just so.
A.J.G. Do you not think we might well pray more definitely for specific gift in preaching? There should be real power and obvious results.
J.T. I do think that. I would hardly venture to say how many persons there are who can stand up and preach, and preach well in a sense, in New York district. The great thing, therefore, is to ask God about power. There should be power; not in word, but in power, as the apostle says; ability, too, as to the words used because there must be ability and understanding, but at the same time to be sure there is power attached to it.
Ques. How do you get power?
J.T. You get it from God. God gives the power.
Ques. Do you mean by saying that, that we are to have power, that one should have moral weight before God?
{32}
J.T. Quite so. And then there is another thing that has to be attached to all this, that whether it be God Himself, or whether it be the Father specifically, or the Son, or the Spirit, They should be regarded as God. Whether it be the Father, or the Lord, or the Spirit, each One can be regarded as God, so that divine Persons are viewed interchangeably. They are all God; if They are doing anything, God is doing it. Therefore, we are wonderfully enlarged by thinking of divine Persons and how They can be viewed as interchanging with each other in the service. But God is always working.
Rem. I wonder in that connection whether you might give us a word as to verse 12 and the last verse of our chapter. "That ye should walk worthy of God" and "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? are not ye also before our Lord Jesus at his coming? for ye are our glory and joy". The two divine Persons are mentioned.
J.T. Quite so, and you can add to that the Spirit too, because the Spirit operates also as God.
Rem. I wondered whether it was God in the full sense in verse 12, involving the three divine Persons. We might get help as to the idea of walking "worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory", and then the "Lord Jesus at his coming". What would be the distinction?
J.T. Whatever divine Person we mention, by the terms that are mentioned we can say whether it is God Himself, or the Lord Jesus, or the Holy Spirit. We see the names of divine Persons and how they may be presented in Scripture, then we can understand what terms to use. Is that God, or who is it, or is the Person specifically mentioned? If it is not specific, it is God, of course, that is the thought. Then if Christ is mentioned we can see that He is called God too. "He is the true God and eternal life", @1 John 5: 20. And the Spirit is God and may
{33}
be called God too, so that we can always arrive at what term to use when we are speaking of divine Persons.
G.S. Does verse 13 involve the Spirit really, "the report of God by us" and "God's word, which also works in you who believe"?
J.T. It might be. It says "give thanks to God", that is God in general, and then "having received the word of the report of God by us". "The report of God" may be by the Spirit. "Ye accepted, not men's word, but even as it is truly, God's word"; that also may be regarded as involving the Spirit. Another thing to keep in mind to confirm all that, is that the Spirit has come down; He has been sent from heaven. It never says that God has been sent down, God comes down; that may be the Spirit. God comes down and works here.
C.H.H. @Revelation 22: 17, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely". Does that give an evangelical touch to the final phase of the assembly's history?
J.T. Just so, at the very end of the dispensation, an evangelical touch. In fact that whole chapter has an evangelical touch about it.
R.W.S. Paul says, in verse 18, "Wherefore we have desired to come to you, even I Paul, both once and twice, and Satan has hindered us". I wondered about Satan hindering the great apostle Paul, and whether there is anything like that today.
J.T. He is the adversary against God; the word implies an adversary. Paul was conscious of that all the time; "Satan has hindered us", he says.
R.W.S. I am puzzled a little by it. I wondered if you had experienced anything of being hindered by Satan in your service. Paul wanted to go once and twice, and Satan apparently hindered him. I
{34}
wondered, without being personal, if you had ever experienced being hindered by Satan from going to a place.
A.R. Would not the Second World War be Satan hindering? You could not go to England during the war.
J.T. It may have been discipline for me. Some ministrations were hindered and stopped altogether. Certainly we have to recognise the fact that Satan is allowed to act. Presently he will be imprisoned and then he will be let loose after that. Sometimes God allows him liberty.
Ques. In @Daniel 10: 13 it says "The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days". Do you think that is the same idea?
J.T. Quite so, exactly the same thing.
J.T.Jr. Paul says to the Corinthians that Satan should not get an advantage: "That we might not have Satan get an advantage against us", @2 Corinthians 2: 11. That is for us to see to, is it not?
J.T. We are watchful to that end, that Satan may not hinder us.
J.H.E. The Lord could detect quickly; He said to Peter, "Get away behind me, Satan", @Mark 8: 33
J.T. Just so, very practical in that sense. The Lord dealt with him at once.
{35}
READINGS ON FIRST THESSALONIANS (3)
@1 Thessalonians 3: 1 - 13
J.T. The specific features of the truth in this chapter are not as striking as in the others, especially chapters 4 and 5. These two chapters will afford much for us as to the Lord's coming. One thing that has come to mind that we have not touched on as much as the truth requires, and that is the matter of God Himself, God as such, according to the way the Spirit may help us as to the titles that we should use. We should know how to use them, and use them as needed, and it is thought that we should therefore begin with the different titles. The first title in the Bible is God; God Himself is in mind, and the reference is to Him as Creator in @Genesis 1. The second chapter of Genesis has much that we should look at; that is to say, the modifying effect of Jehovah, which will eventually work out in the truth of the Father. The second chapter of the book of Genesis modifies the first; that is to say, the first refers to God as such, as the Creator. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth". That is how it begins. "And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters". The Spirit of God is alluded to as well as God Himself, but the first title is God; it is a plural word. It is the word used to specify the Creator as such. It is thought that we should become more familiar with the idea of God as the Creator, and how He is referred to throughout the Bible in this sense, especially in John's gospel. We have in John's gospel, for instance, the idea of the world, that God loved it; "God so loved the world". Not that we want to cover the whole Bible at one reading, but just to touch on the divine titles, the divine names of God, and how they differ and how they bear on
{36}
the various phases of the truth. Of course, it is hoped that we shall work out the thoughts that are in mind even in connection with this third chapter where God is not spoken much of, but He is spoken much of in the whole epistle and especially in relation to the Lord's coming. So that the first title is Elohim, which is God. The translator tells us it is in the plural and refers to the Creator. We should at least go away from these meetings with a clear view of God as the Creator and how He speaks of things in the creation. Another thing that comes up is why the creation of man is reserved for such a recent period as we get in @Genesis 1: 26; he comes in on the sixth day of the so-called creation. Therefore to clarify expressions that are much used as to God and as to the creation it is well to keep in mind that it says that God loved the *world*. While the idea is not here in this chapter, it is thought that there is very little idea of what is in mind, that is, that God loved the world. God is so spoken of as being God of many things as well as persons. The first thought is that God loved the world, so loved it. According to John's gospel, "God so loved the world"; and why is it said that He loved it? It is not a question of man in it, but the world itself, not a question of persons in it but the world itself. There must be something that draws out God's thoughts in love. The question is whether we understand all this. It is readily understood if we think of the persons that are in it, beginning with Adam, but the *things* that are in it without specifying man at all.
F.J.F. Do you think that that involves that all creation, even the smallest thing, had in some way reference to Christ? God loved the world because everything in it had in some way reference to Christ.
J.T. Well, it is doubtful that the reference to Christ should be brought in so early, because the things that are in the world must be in mind.
{37}
F.J.F. I was thinking of what it says in Colossians, that He is the beginning.
J.T. Quite so, but it is too soon to go into that. We are rather to get the thought of why it says "God so loved the world". We know that there is a great deal of evil in the world, but it is not that that is in mind, it is something else. It is something that came from His own hand that is in mind.
A.Macd. With reference to the city of Athens, mentioned in this chapter, it is interesting that Paul preaches in Athens and says there, "The God who has made the world and all things which are in it", @Acts 17: 24. Is there a link with what you are saying?
J.T. That is a good thought to bring in if you are preaching the gospel, but we have to go behind that, and see what it says in John's gospel about love, God loving the world. You can bring in the gospel conveniently in what is said about Athens, but then, why, in John's gospel, is God said to love the world?
R.W.S. Is there the thought of order and beauty in the thought of the world in @John 3: 16?
J.T. That must be what is in mind, because God expended much on the creation. We can hardly compass it, especially when we think of the word world in the plural, that God made the worlds by Christ, "by whom also he made the worlds", the plural; we do not know how many worlds, but He made them, Christ made them. What we are saying is preliminary to the great thought that is in mind, that we should become more conversant with the great idea of God, God Himself, and then the variation of titles that are found as to Him in the Scriptures.
L.E.S. Would the last few psalms support what you are speaking of, bringing in the greatness and glory of the creation? The variety and vastness of
{38}
the realm of creation consummates in celebrating in praises the greatness of God.
J.T. Quite so. The Psalms finish up with God. But then the question arises at once as to why love is brought into it, merely as to the creation itself, that God *loved* the world, not the worlds; we do not know how many there are, but we do know the one we are in now, and that is what is in mind, because that is where the gospel is preached. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal". That is the great thought that is in mind, and how much the brethren generally are conversant with that great thought of the world.
Rem. It says of the earth that He formed it to be inhabited.
J.T. Yes, but we have not the people yet, because it is a question of the world, nakedly, the world. God so loved it. We may say, and rightly, that the persons must be in mind, because "He gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal". We have to come back to that. We ought to work up to it and get the whole thought underlying it, and see how John deals with it, and then see how it comes into our chapter.
C.A.M. In connection with this great subject we have the thought of the power of God. We have possibly connected this idea of power largely with God's first creation, but the thought you are expressing now seems to stress that the idea of love was there in a special way originally.
J.T. God is over all and through all and in us all. That is an Ephesian thought which, of course, ought to come into what we are talking about, but then why should He love the world? Why is it put as the world? Why should He love it?
{39}
A.R. Does your remark bear on the first five days of the creation as well as the sixth day?
J.T. Well, we have to go back to the first five days of the creation as you say. It says, "in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", that is to say, God made it Himself, not the Father, nor Jehovah, but God Himself; that is to say, Elohim. The translator tells us that it is God in the absolute.
Ques. Is your thought that the world was a perfect sphere for the bringing in of Christ and all that was to be consummated through Him?
J.T. That has been said already, but I thought it was better to get back to the basic thought of the world, without coming on to Christ or the people that are in the world. Of course, Christ must be in mind. There is no question about that because He has made everything. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being. In him was life, and the life was the light of men", @John 1: 1 - 4. It was not the light of angels; it was the light of men. That must be touched on, but then, before that we have to come to the basic thought of why God loved the world. It does not say He loved the people in it, but loved *it*.
M.O. Does this matter stand related to the will of God? In @Revelation 4 the elders say, "For *thou* has created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created".
J.T. Quite so. You have the same principle in Colossians. But we must get back to the idea of Elohim; that is to say, to Him who is the absolute in everything, that in all that happens historically we must go back to the source of it. Why should it be? He deals with the naked thought of the world.
{40}
Why should it be said that God loved it? It is God, Elohim, not Jehovah, not the Father, but just God, God Himself. What is in mind is that we should think of God, what God is, and our minds trace back everything that happens to God.
G.S. Do you have in mind God's own handiwork of which it is said that it was good?
J.T. That is right, and there is something, if we can ever get at it or ever understand it, that affects the heart of God. I should say more the mind of God, that God's mind has been active. Why was it active? It was to bring out all that exists at the present time; it is to be in our minds to think of it, and how God is using it.
A.B.P. Did the Lord Jesus have this in mind when He said, "Consider the lilies, how they grow"?
J.T. Just so.
A.J.G. When Paul in Romans speaks about the Creator, he says, "who is blessed for ever. Amen", @Romans 1: 25. Does that enter into what we are saying?
J.T. Very good; that brings God in peculiarly, as we have already had, that God in Romans is more the Creator, and that things are of Him and that He is the Author of the gospel. But then we have to go back, if we preach the gospel for instance, and ask why it should be said that God loved the world and why it is God, God Himself, and why it is the plural. Who are the Beings that are behind it all, and what do we know about Them, and what do we know about the other worlds that are spoken of that God made through Christ in a mediatorial sense? He made the worlds by Christ.
F.W. In Colossians before Paul speaks of men he speaks of all things in heaven and on earth. Would you say a word about that?
J.T. That is another thing, reconciliation. We have come to a new heaven and a new earth too,
{41}
but we are now dealing with the present earth. Why should God make it and what is there in it that draws out His mind or His approval or, we might say, His affections, that He loves it?
Ques. Do I understand that it was the world before sin came in? "God so loved the world", some people think it is the world as it is now, but is it @Genesis 1: 1: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth". Is that what He loved?
J.T. Well, the word beginning helps in your thought. "In the beginning" and then we have the same expression in @John 1. It relates to the Word, "In the beginning was the Word", the Logos. But now we are dealing with God, not the Logos, but God Himself, Elohim, a plural word. Why should He be engaged with it in His mind as something to be admired or loved? Why should it be, that is the question, not that I wish to puzzle the brethren, but that we should be conversant with God as Creator and see what part He has in it, and how it works out and how He brings us into it, so that we get Colossians and Ephesians all touching on this point.
R.S. Do you think @Romans 1 helps in that, that what He created and made became a testimony to His eternal power and divinity?
J.T. That is right.
J.L.P. Would it be covered too in @1 Chronicles 29 when David said "Thine, Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the splendour, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is thine", and then David goes on to speak of God as "Head above all".
J.T. It is good to bring that in too, that God is Head. It is a peculiar word and applicable to God, that He is Head, and it must apply to the creation too, that is to say, the thought of God in His knowledge creating.
{42}
F.N.W. Is there a link in that way with @Proverbs 8 where wisdom speaks of "rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth"?
J.T. Very good, some may say that wisdom is Christ there, in the way He is spoken of, but it is not Christ exactly, it is an element by itself. Wisdom is an item by itself that attaches to God. It used to be regarded that Christ was wisdom there; in a certain sense He is, but properly speaking, wisdom is a thing, not a person. Wisdom is a thing attachable to God.
T.W. Is the expression *world* in @John 3 a development on the thought of earth in @Genesis 1?
J.T. The word *world* must include the heavens too; it must include the whole system of creation. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".
A.B. Is it not that God loved an ordered system governed by fixed principles?
J.T. Very good, fixed principles, not simply a principle, but principles. It is a question now of getting our minds active in what is needful if we want to get at the truth, because the truth implies the creation, not the creation of man exactly, but the creation by itself as specified in the first chapter of Genesis. The word is "God created the heavens and the earth", not made it, but created it.
G.H. The last verse of @Genesis 1 says, "And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good". Would that bring out how God looked upon it with delight?
J.T. That is what He made in the days that are mentioned; it was a question of days. But what we are talking about now "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" is not what is alluded to in the days. The first verse is just the bare thought of creation, and after that Satan had something to
{43}
do with it. There was a chaotic condition that came into it, and then the days came in so that God might order it as He wanted it for the present time as we have it now.
G.W. What is meant in @1 John 2 where it says, that we are not to love the world?
J.T. That is the moral system, but what we are talking about is the physical system as God made it, before ever it was touched by sin. It was before sin came in that God created everything, and then we come to the fact that it is all by Christ.
Ques. Is @John 3: 17 in line with @John 3: 16, "For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him"?
J.T. That is the moral side, the moral condition.
F.J.F. Did God love the world, because it was to be the arena where He would display Himself?
J.T. That is right.
H.B. Would @Isaiah 45 help? "For thus saith Jehovah who created the heavens, God himself who formed the earth and made it, he who established it, -- not as waste did he create it".
J.T. That is to say, what we have now is not what is mentioned in the first verse of Genesis. The latter is what God did in the beginning before Satan had anything to do with it or sin had anything to do with it. "In the beginning God", not Jehovah, not the Father, but God, "created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was waste and empty". He did not create it that way. It is first the bare thought, that "God created the heavens and the earth", without saying anything more.
R.W.S. When it says "the sons of God shouted for joy" (@Job 38: 7), would they reflect what was in God's heart at the time?
J.T. No doubt they had some light, that would be the angels, showing that the angels were created
{44}
before men, but they must have been created after the first verse of Genesis, when "God created the heavens and the earth". As far as I understand, the angels must have come in after that. They were to be used, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?" @Hebrews 1: 14. They serve not only God but men, therefore they are in view after the creation, after the first of Genesis. The bare thought of the creation must come in before anything that we have had to do with, because we read "before the foundation of the world". The Lord Jesus says the Father loved Him "before the foundation of the world", @John 17: 24. We must make way for that, that God did something before the foundation of the world.
F.J.F. Mr. Darby said when he looked at a rose that he loved it because of the One who made it. Would that be right?
J.T. The flowers, the growth of the earth, that would be the third day of the creation when all that was made. We have vegetables on the earth and all that, but then we have to go back to the first verse before we come to that. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth". What did He actually create? We have an atmosphere attached to it too, necessary for it, so that we have to work all that out in our minds, that "God created the heavens and the earth". Elohim, that is the God of power, because the word implies His power.
J.V.W. Would @Psalm 90 help in that? "From eternity to eternity thou art God".
J.T. Well, that is Moses, and he brings it down to our condition here. It is the bare idea of creation that we are talking about. We should not stop at that because we want to get at something else, but we do not want to leave what we began with without some thought to carry away with us in our minds to
{45}
educate us in the things of God that will work out in regard to moral things.
A.J.G. Is it to be noted that in the day of eternity God still has heaven and earth, "a new heaven and a new earth", as though what He started with in creating the heavens and the earth was His prime thought that He goes right through with?
J.T. Very good. The final thought implies that something has happened, some adverse or sinister thing had happened and that originated with the devil, and the book of Revelation shows how that is finally met. There is no formal evidence or statement as to anything happening save that "the earth was waste and empty", not the heavens. We should stop there and get something into our minds to carry away that we can use in working out the truth in a moral sense.
F.K.C. Do you think when God takes up the matter with Job following on Elihu's speech, that He helps Job in what is moral, but He calls attention to the physical universe, the stars, the heavens, the light, darkness, and calving of the hinds. He says, "Where wast thou when I founded the earth?" @Job 38: 4.
J.T. Just so, so that it is a teaching subject from the standpoint of the book of Job, that Job is to be taught. He is teachable although it takes a long time to bring him to perfection in teaching; he is teachable and of course that may come out in the thought we had in mind. The whole book of Job will come out in what we have in mind, because what helps us as to that is that Satan comes in in that book. The young people get things from the schools that are damaging and defiling, but we are to have in our minds to connect everything with God. Then we come to the mediatorial side, that all was on mediatorial principles, that Christ made the world, but God made the worlds by Christ. He is the Mediator
{46}
of creation first; the Mediator of redemption second. We can leave the thought of creation now and come to redemption and then the chapter we have read.
Ques. In verse 11 it says, "But our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus". Would it be right to connect that with redemption? Would the person that we have in mind in regard to redemption be the Lord Jesus?
J.T. We have not yet come to redemption; we have been engaged in the thought of creation. There are two great thoughts, that Christ Himself is Mediator, firstly of creation and secondly of redemption. He is Mediator of both, and then when you come to a further thought of mediatorship, it is the law. Moses was mediator of the law, ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator; that is, a law to govern things. The question now is to come to the idea of redemption; that would bring us into our chapter, because we want to see the idea of God as lovable in this book, particularly to be loved by young Christians.
E.A.L. In Thessalonians you have been bringing forward a great deal the thought of youth. In Ecclesiastes we have "Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth", and it says in the footnote that *Creator* is plural. We cannot come into the sense of remembering our Creator unless we have right basic thoughts about creation.
J.T. If you look around the earth and the heavens, everything is in your favour. Why should not young people be enjoined to remember God as the Creator? "In the days of thy youth", that fits in with the point in these meetings, that God is to be known and remembered as the Creator. We can come into it and think of it, how God appears in the way in which He does appear in the third chapter, leading up to the fourth chapter and the fifth that we will have later. It is a question of the young people
{47}
getting something into their minds to carry away as to creation, because creation is a learning book, full of things that are instructive to our minds and profitable in a moral sense in all that relates to us, leading up to the assembly.
F.H.L. Can we link up @Psalm 19 with what you are saying? Behind that is there the thought of God being love, so that there is glory to shine in that way?
J.T. Quite right, and then the idea of the law comes in after that.
R.W.S. So that all that we have had up to this point would remove any thought of evolution which might be imbibed by the young in the schools.
J.T. Quite so. As soon as the children go to school, they are face to face with things that are not according to God. Evolution is a direct lie of the devil. The young people are to be taught by us, by their mothers and fathers, that it is a false thing, the work of the devil. Therefore, the point now is that the young people might carry away something in their minds to defend them, to protect them, to enable them to look into moral things profitably, and see where they are in relation to God, that God is the Creator of everything and that Christ is the Mediator of creation.
F.J.F. Is it true that God never works up to a thing; He works down from the top?
J.T. That is right. God is in heaven and we are on earth. Then we can work out our thoughts to the idea of mediatorship and the high priesthood of Christ. He is in heaven, and the Holy Spirit is here among us today, that is to say, God and Christ in heaven and God in the Spirit here in the assembly. These are all profitable things, especially for young people, to carry away with them to defend themselves from the evil things that are taught in the schools.
{48}
R.W.S. All that bears on our chapter, for in verse 5 Paul says, "For this reason I also, no longer able to refrain myself, sent to know your faith, lest perhaps the tempter had tempted you and our labour should be come to nothing".
J.T. Not the devil, but the tempter; the Lord Jesus had to do with the tempter. The young people should get into their minds what the tempter may do to them. So it says, "For this reason I also, no longer able to refrain myself, sent to know your faith, lest perhaps the tempter had tempted you and our labour should be come to nothing". Well, it is very important to get something on those lines, that the work of God should not come to nothing. The tempter would seek to bring the work of God down to nothing in our mind.
R.W.S. The next verse is beautiful: "But Timotheus having just come to us from you, and brought to us the glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have always good remembrance of us, desiring much to see us, even as we also you"; so that there is great comfort.
H.E.E. It is remarkable that Paul did not send an older brother to the young christians. He sent Timotheus who was young and would fit in.
J.T. Quite so. He was a young man, a lovable young man. There was no one like him, and we want such persons.
F.J.F. It is important what you are saying, because we have an example in Africa of a young brother who was very happy in the Lord, and he went to the university and a professor there taught him terrible things. The result was that he gave up the fellowship, and he did not believe what it says in the word of God.
J.T. That shows the danger to young people in the universities, and we could cite many cases here in this country of that same thing. Parents should
{49}
be careful to watch over children in the schools to see what they are learning, and to see that their minds are refusing evil and entertaining the good, because we get the good in these meetings, in all our meetings. The good is found in the Lord's supper, the prayer meetings, the reading of the word of God, and the preaching of the gospel, and so forth. Provision is made for the young people in our meetings, wherever they are held, whether small or large. The point is to get them to see what is good. The good is of God, and the Spirit of God is here to help the parents to bring the good before their children and to keep it before them.
Rem. Would not the devil use anything he possibly can to overthrow faith; if not evolution, he will use suffering or affliction, such as we have in this chapter.
J.T. Quite so. The young people get it too. If they are faithful to the Lord, they will get it from their school companions. They will get the evil and persecution with it. That is alluded to here.
Ques. Speaking about university education, would it not be advisable for the young people among us who elect to take a university education to be careful to see what subjects they take? Certain subjects are worse than others. Should we be careful what we select for our studies?
J.T. I think parents could get the hearing of the teachers and urge them not to bring certain things before their children. Very often teachers are amenable to influence on the part of the parents, to keep the children from what is damaging. Tell them why. Young people in the schools are very often used of God as a testimony to others.
C.H.H. Would you say there is a great necessity for home teaching, that they might be instructed in the counsels of God so that they might not be discouraged by the breakdown and wreckage they see
{50}
around, but see what is going through? The knowledge of the counsels of God would preserve.
J.T. Something better than what the schools present. In earlier days we had Sunday schools for children, and it was found that they were allowed to go out wherever they wished while the readings were going on. The brethren began to see that it was better to bring the children to the reading meetings on the Lord's Day afternoons than to let them be by themselves. So that Sunday Schools as far as I know have been altogether abandoned by the brethren. They have not been found to be helpful spiritually.
C.H.H. Someone alluded yesterday to @Deuteronomy 6. It speaks about impressing the children as you sit down in the house. In chapter 11 it says you are to teach. Impressing and teaching children is a home necessity, is it not?
J.T. The believer's house is the greatest place for the children to learn; it is the safest place for them to learn because God is there. God is in the believer's house. It is well to stress upon the children that the devil is outside, but God is inside a believer's house. Keep young believers in the house, where the parents are, where the good influence is, where the Bible is, see that the children are saved from the street.
W.W.M. Do you think we have an example in Moses that would stimulate every parent? Some of us have missed it, but one sees that Moses was put into the hands of his mother and she instructed him, evidently, in the ways of God, in such a way that when he came to years he turned to the people of God and did not turn to Egypt. In speaking of Sunday schools, I experienced as a boy myself what I fear has been damaging. Parents send children to Sunday schools to give them a spiritual education that they should get at home. Any of us who have missed it with our families, it is because we did not
{51}
take care of them at home when they were young. Do you agree with that?
J.T. Surely. So children are baptised. There used to be difficulty with some in getting the children baptised, but now there is hardly any difficulty at all. They are baptised in the houses. They are baptised, according to Peter in the name of the Lord (@Acts 10: 48), and secondly, according to @Matthew 28, "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". All that is available to children, and parents who have them baptised ought to bring them up under the power of the word of God, because that is what is provided for them.
J.K. This morning you were giving us a word as to the supremacy of God in @Genesis 1, then in @Genesis 2 the modified term, then God coming into revelation as Father. Is that not the great anchor to our souls as we see God has been pleased to move and reveal Himself in Christ?
J.T. Very good, so that the second chapter of Genesis is Jehovah. It is a modifying thought from the word Elohim, but that leads up to the New Testament where we have the name Father. The children are brought up in the households according to the power of that name.
J.K. That is what I was thinking, so would that not be the great anchor to the soul as we lay hold of the fact that God has been pleased to reveal Himself and to bring us into the marvellous truth which we are enjoying today.
J.T. Quite so. So it is that Hagar went away from her mistress. She was to have a son; the Angel of Jehovah found her and spoke to her and she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, "Thou art the God who reveals himself", @Genesis 16: 13. The thought was to bring the child up in the light of that, of the God who reveals Himself.
{52}
Rem. In regard to an earlier remark about the young brother in fellowship going to a university and becoming an unbeliever, I cannot understand how a believer can become an unbeliever. Would you say something about that?
J.T. It is the tempter. The apostle speaks of it here in verse 5, "For this reason I also, no longer able to refrain myself, sent to know your faith, lest perhaps the tempter", that is the devil, "had tempted you and our labour should be come to nothing". That is how a believer becomes an unbeliever, or partially so. That is, he is damaged in his soul by the tempter.
Rem. He is never really entirely an unbeliever again. You say he is damaged in his soul.
J.T. He might be, of course; if he is born again he can never become an unbeliever again, but suppose he was not. He might be brought up under good influence and yet he might not be born again. We want to be sure that the children come into new birth. If they are not born again, you cannot trust them, therefore we have to keep in mind that the influence indicated in the power of the new birth is there. We can count on that.
C.H.H. Reverting to the verse quoted earlier "that ye have always good remembrance of us", would that not indicate the importance of having young people at the meetings so that they might get acquainted with those who serve, because I suppose that would refer to Paul and those who were with him. There would be a certain amount of attractiveness about their ministry and deportment which the young people really ought to be helped by.
J.T. Another thing is that the young people very often congregate with other young people, whereas to get the good of the truth they should be with their elders, with their parents, because the damage is when they get with each other. The good influence
{53}
is not there. The parents influence is a protective influence and can be relied upon.
A.R. Bearing on that would it be confirmed in @Acts 21, "all of them accompanying us, with wives and children, till we were out of the city. And kneeling down upon the shore we prayed. And having embraced one another, we went on board ship, and they returned home"? You get the children there accompanying Paul.
J.T. The children were with them to see Paul away. Now we have here something that confirms all this in speaking of the tempter, and the children are especially the objects of the tempter. "But Timotheus having just come to us from you, and brought to us the glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have always good remembrance of us"; that is to say, young people are to think of the elder brethren, to get the truth from them: "desiring much to see us, even as we also you", that is how Paul regarded them, the young people, "for this reason we have been comforted in you, brethren, in all our distress and tribulation, through your faith, because now we live if ye stand firm in the Lord". That is to say, the apostle's very life was bound up with the Thessalonians standing firm in the truth.
Rem. "For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him", @Genesis 18: 19. Abraham's household were all subject to him.
J.T. Abraham is said to be the father of us all, and Sarah is said to be the mother of sisters.
E.A.L. Would the "good remembrance of us" underlie the thought of paying attention to the present ministry? When we leave these meetings we may have a good remembrance of you, but when we think of you we think of the ministry that proceeded from you to us.
J.T. Well, that is the idea. There are many here that young people can think of, and that is
{54}
what the apostle had in mind, that the young people he was speaking to had remembrance of him. They would think of Paul as their teacher, they received the gospel through him. That was the case with the Thessalonians, the gospel had come to them through Paul. Then the question is for the household and the parents to carry on unceasingly with the right thing to keep the truth before the young. So that he says "For this reason we have been comforted in you, brethren, in all our distress and tribulation, through your faith, because now we live if ye stand firm in the Lord". His very life, you might say, was bound up with the Thessalonians, showing what a heart he had; indeed, that heart ought to be reflected in every parent here today. "For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice on account of you before our God, night and day beseeching exceedingly to the end that we may see your face, and perfect what is lacking in your faith?". He mentions faith several times for that is the point. They were not simply getting instruction, but growing in faith, because the dispensation we are in is the dispensation of faith, and if we do not have faith we are nothing. What is not of faith is sin, it says, a very solemn thing.
J.L.P. Would this help the young people to become contributors to the joy of the servants? John mentions in his epistles to Gaius and the elect lady that he had no greater joy than to see his children walking in the truth. Is that your thought?
J.T. Just so. It goes on to say, "and perfect what is lacking in your faith? But our God and Father himself". Now we have come to the names of divine Persons, it is "our God and Father himself", first of all, and then "and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you. But you, may the Lord make to exceed and abound in love toward one another, and
{55}
toward all, even as we also towards you, in order to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints". "All his saints", not some of them, so that the thought of the Lord's coming is seen peculiarly throughout this epistle, and the next one too. Here in every chapter, the coming of the Lord is mentioned. The Lord is coming with us, not here that He is coming for us, but He is coming with us. The next chapter will tell us that God is in that too, that God will bring us, but here it is the Lord Jesus bringing all the saints with Him.
A.R. How far back does that go? Does that include the Old Testament saints as well as the New?
J.T. I would think so, all the saints up to the present time, a wonderful thought. How comprehensive the Lord is as to His saints. He gathers them as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings. We shall see in the next chapter that God will bring them with Him, showing that divine Persons are differentiated. They are interchangeable in some cases. Here it is the Lord Jesus bringing all the saints with Him. In the next chapter it is God bringing them with Him.
F. Would you connect @Zechariah 14: 5 with the last verse here? "And Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee".
J.T. I am not sure whether it is the same idea. In Jude it says, "The Lord has come amidst his holy myriads", a great thought. We have all that in our minds as to the Lord's coming, what will happen, what a great thing it will be. The word is in @2 Timothy 4, "to all who love his appearing", that we love the thought of the Lord showing Himself to the universe. "Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail
{56}
because of him", @Revelation 1: 7. These are glorious things that are ahead of us when the Lord comes, and it is very imminent. We shall have more about it in the fourth chapter, because it is a chapter that is more pungent as to the truth of the Lord's coming than any other one. We are to "encourage one another with these words", that is to say, the words of chapter four.
J.R.H.Jr. In the latter part of this chapter, touching the activity of divine Persons, is there an allusion to it in the thought of "may the Lord make to exceed and abound in love toward one another"? Is the working out of it the activity of the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is not referred to directly in this section which makes so much of the activity of divine Persons.
J.T. I would say the Spirit would be implied in that, because the Spirit is here. We can well recognise that to be so when it is a question of love, as it says "may the Lord make to exceed and abound in love toward one another ... before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints". The idea is what we are going to be when the Lord comes. The Lord Jesus Himself is mentioned here, so that we must define the Persons we are dealing with, but undoubtedly when it is a question of love the Spirit, being here Himself, is active. His operations are in mind.
J.T.Jr. Verse 8 of the next chapter shows that: "given also his Holy Spirit to you". The Holy Spirit is in us.

READINGS ON FIRST THESSALONIANS (4)
@1 Thessalonians 4: 1 - 18
J.T. From the outset of these meetings it has been commented upon that the coming of the Lord is prominent in this epistle. The Lord's coming is a phrase familiarly used. It appears in this chapter peculiarly, not simply His appearing but His coming for us. It is a hope that we have. What is noted particularly is those that have fallen asleep; those of the saints who have died are particularly important. So verse 13 says, "But we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are fallen asleep, to the end that ye be not grieved even as also the rest who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus has died and has risen again, so also God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus. (For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we, the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord, are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep; for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice, and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord. So encourage one another with these words.)". I read all the passage that relates to the Lord's coming so that we might have it all clearly before us before we proceed fully in the chapter, and with a view, too, of the further thought of the Lord's coming in chapter 5. We want to begin with the first thought in chapter 4, which is sanctification. It says in verse 3, "For this is the will of God, even your sanctification", and it goes on to say, "that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification
{58}
and honour", and so forth. So the prime thought immediately is sanctification.
R.W.S. Paul says in verse 1, "For the rest, then, brethren". Does that not seem to characterise Paul's epistles, as if having completed the body of the epistle, he brings in some final thoughts in saying, "For the rest"? This seems to contain a most important part of the epistle. He sometimes brings in great matters as an appendix.
J.T. That is to say, what remains to be said. Of course, there is a second epistle which we are not going to look into, but, as you say, "For the rest" would imply what remains to be said now.
E.A.L. Would verse 10 of the previous chapter help in that, "beseeching exceedingly to the end that we may see your face, and perfect what is lacking in your faith", as if that might have a connection with the beginning of chapter 4? In all the chapters read, belief or faith seems to have a very important place. It is only on the basis of our faith and belief that we can come into these truths you are bringing before us.
J.T. Just so. And the idea is not simply faith in the sense of the profession of Christianity. It is not simply that, but it is "your faith", that which each one of us has, "a measure of faith", faith being the measure of things for a Christian. Without faith it is impossible to please God; whatever we have heard as to doctrine, we must have faith or we cannot please God. Faith is a peculiar thing that God appreciates in His people. And hence here, "if we believe", that is to say, the coming of the Lord is in mind, but faith underlies all that. It can only be for those who have faith. Those who have not faith are awaiting judgment.
A.R. And also, would you say, the coming of the Lord would be for those who are clean? Hold your vessels to honour.
{59}
J.T. Exactly. That is the idea of sanctification.
A.R. Sanctification and honour are in contrast to uncleanness, as it says in verse 7, "For God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification".
J.T. Sanctification implies holiness, not simply that we are clean but that we are holy. It is a great thought with God, to be holy. "Be ye holy", He says, "for *I* am holy". We cannot attach faith to God; faith is not applicable to God, but it is applicable to Christ, however. He is the Author and Completer of faith. Holiness belongs to God. "Be ye holy, for *I* am holy". Therefore, this first paragraph refers to sanctification, not only cleanness but sanctification; that is to say, one is to be holy.
F.J.F. Does that imply that the vessel is ready and suitable to be changed at any moment?
J.T. Just so. An elect vessel. Paul himself was an elect vessel unto the Lord, to bear His name before kings. So God is very concerned about the vessel, that is to say, what it contains, and then the character of the vessel. It is what you contain or have in you, but character too is in mind.
L.E.S. Does not the present ministry as to the Holy Spirit directly bear on this?
J.T. There is a word here about that. Verse 7 says, "For God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification"; and then verse 8, "He therefore that in this disregards his brother, disregards, not man, but God, who has given also his Holy Spirit to you". The vessel is in mind, but what is in it is the prime thought; that is the Holy Spirit. There cannot be anything greater than that in anybody. There must be the idea of the vessel.
E.A.L. In chapter 1 we have, "having accepted the word in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Spirit". That is the way in which we accept the truth, referring to what has just been said as to the Holy Spirit.
{60}
J.T. Yes. "Also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance". So the vessel is of prime importance in view of what is in it. The Holy Spirit is in the assembly, of course, but each person, each believer has the Holy Spirit; that is, if he has really received the Holy Spirit. A person may be born again or at least in some sense a vessel of something in the sense of quickening, but the prime thought is that of a vessel possessing the Holy Spirit, the greatest thing that can attach to us, because it is the presence of God Himself here on earth, in view of His place in the assembly that "God is indeed amongst you".
C.H.H. Would that be consistent with @1 Corinthians 6, "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own? for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body", @1 Corinthians 6: 19, 20?
J.T. Quite so. Therefore, each vessel here today is of prime importance, that is, not only a believer who is in some sense quickened, but one having faith, a true believer and knowing that he has the Holy Spirit. So in Ephesus the first point made is "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" @Acts 19: 2. They did not know about the Spirit, and that is the question, whether we all know about it, and whether we all have the blessed Spirit of God, and thus that our vessels are pure and sanctified.
Ques. In @Ephesians 4 it says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God". Is that individual?
J.T. Yes, but it might be the assembly, too. Because of your relation with other believers, you may grieve the Spirit. You may be all right yourself, but you may affect other believers. We may not honour other believers as we should.
F.H.L. Did the apostle know that there were local conditions requiring this ministry?
{61}
J.T. I would think so. I would think that Paul would keep in touch with the assemblies. It was a great matter with him. He had the care of all the assemblies, which is a great matter. So here we have "with all his saints", the idea of the wholeness, the completeness, of the persons implied. The assembly, of course, is the prime thought in the present dispensation because of what it is as a vessel, and how God can use it. Therefore, the importance of each one keeping himself clean and sanctified.
J.L.P. The will of God enters into this matter of sanctification, and in the second chapter of the next letter the divine choice. "God has chosen you from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth". I would like help as to the thought of salvation being linked on with sanctification in the scripture read.
J.T. The second epistle is just to enforce and enlarge what is contained in the first epistle, the first is the prime thought. We are being held in our conversation to this matter of sanctification, to get a grasp of it inwardly and carry it away with us.
W.W.M. In @Acts 15 Peter says, "And the heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit as to us also". Faith must precede the Spirit, would you say that?
J.T. That is the idea exactly. The whole dispensation stands thus; it is a dispensation of faith, but then it is not only that, but there are certain characteristics that this epistle peculiarly stresses. What we are engaged with now before coming to the thought of the Lord's coming, is sanctification. The saints should be clear of this world, but especially in this matter of personal relations with others that would defile them peculiarly.
A.B.P. Should there be a measure of sanctification before the Spirit is received? Is that necessary?
{62}
J.T. I think the work of God in the soul effects something, but it is not complete without the Spirit, the word *sealed* is used in regard of the Spirit in Ephesians. We must have the seal, the sealing is by the Spirit. There may be a work of God before that, but it is not complete without the sealing.
F.J.F. Are a believer's children looked on also as sanctified?
J.T. Well, externally, God would look at them not only in themselves but in relation to their parents, because God is reserving His thought as to what He thinks of parents. He attaches much to parents, not only individual persons, but their children. But then they may not all have the Spirit, but God looks at them in relation to their parents. Then the next thing is for parents to bring up their children "in the discipline and admonition of the Lord". The parents have to see to that, but at the same time the person may not have anything beyond what we might call quickening, which is not complete, but something of that kind in a person who believes. If his parent believes, it is more to the point with God that He should refer to the parent as well as to the child, so that the whole household should be saved. Hence the first reference to salvation is that Noah prepared an ark for the saving of his house and that implied, in principle, what God has effected in the gift of the Spirit in this dispensation. There were no gifts in the old dispensation, but there was a work of God with men but no completeness. The law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope does, by which we draw nigh unto God. It must be the better hope, implying the presence of the Spirit.
Rem. The previous remark about parents and children does not apply to the Lord Jesus, "the holy thing".
{63}
J.T. In the expression "the holy thing", it is the Babe that is in mind. The word 'thing' would not be used otherwise. The Lord is called a boy afterwards, that is, a grown child, but the word 'thing' is used in Luke only and refers to the Babe condition. It is a very remarkable thing and the word is to Mary, the mother of the Lord. "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God". He is not yet called that outwardly, He is going to be called that. Mary heard that from the angel's lips. The angel says remarkable things to Mary in view of the great fact that she was to be the Lord's mother. There was Elizabeth too linked up with her, because she was her kinswoman, the mother of John the baptist, who was the forerunner of the Lord. It is a great matter to think of the mothers of such persons, the mother of John the baptist first and then the mother of Jesus, the greatest honour that could be conferred on anybody in that sense, to be the mother of the Lord Jesus.
F.N.W. What is holiness?
J.T. Well, it is a question of state that applies to God. It applies to God first; God is holy. "Be ye holy, for I am holy". It is therefore effected by the power of the Spirit, the Spirit viewed as oil. The word 'anointed' implies that the person is indwelt by the Spirit. The word 'oil' alludes to the Spirit as rendering us holy. Oil is used as a figure to convey an idea, that of man being dignified by receiving the presence of the Holy Spirit on the ground of the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ.
M.O. Does John in his epistle link the truth of sanctification with the Lord's coming when he says, "And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure"?
J.T. Just so; there is a strong link between these epistles and the epistles of John. They are closely associated. Of course, John was an apostle too, and
{64}
Paul was the great apostle of the assembly. We learn almost everything from Paul as to the assembly because he had that ministry expressly.
A.B.P. Having the hope in him would be by the Spirit; the thought of 'in him' links on with the power of the Spirit to make that hope living?
J.T. Just so, and having that hope we know that we have the Spirit of God.
A.A.T. Are sanctification and holiness the same?
J.T. Very much the same, sanctification refers to holiness, but the word 'holy' is full and complete because it applies to God Himself. You could not have it more complete, because it applies to God. God is holy. "Be ye holy, for I am holy".
A.B. Does the footnote to sanctification in verse 7 help? It is 'holiness', as in @Romans 6: 19, 22. But 'sanctification' is used in English for the result as well as the activity which produces it.
J.T. Very good, therefore the importance of these notes in the New (Darby) Translation.
Ques. May I ask a simple question for those of us who are young? How do we get holy? We used to sing a hymn, 'Take time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord'. Would we get more holy if we had more communion with the Holy Spirit?
J.T. Quite so, the gospels are the basis of the New Testament, but the epistles are written for a special reason to bring out the completeness of the truth of Christianity. The gospels have the truth of Christianity in mind, but the epistles have the details that are needed to fill it out. Of course, the great thought of the gospels is to narrate the coming here of the Lord Jesus Christ, a divine Person, born of a woman, that is to say, born of Mary.
R.W.S. Verse 4 says, "that each of you know how to possess his own vessel". It is a word we use commonly, the 'know-how'. All of us, young and old, should know how.
{65}
J.T. Know how to possess, that is the idea. "That each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour". That is the point we are stressing and that the Spirit of God is stressing in the beginning of this chapter, but we want to go on to the coming of the Lord because that is the main thing before us in this reading.
A.R. Holiness would precede the rapture.
J.T. What we are dealing with now is to lead up to the idea of the rapture, the coming of the Lord.
W.W.M. @2 Corinthians 7: 1 reads, "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear". That comes in after speaking of coming out and being separate, being here for God.
J.T. Quite so. I believe this epistle largely links on with the Corinthian epistles. We have promises in chapter 7, and we are called upon to lay hold of them. These promises refer to the previous chapter.
Ques. In @John 17 the Lord says, "I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth". Is that a different form of sanctification?
J.T. You mean setting apart; it is not a question of the state of the Lord Jesus at all. It is a question of the attitude He has taken up personally, and it is in relation to them, setting Himself apart in view of their being set apart.
J.W. This matter of the 'know-how' seems to stand related to the divine authority, the will of God, linking with what you said in an earlier reading as to God as Creator and the recognition of His authority.
F.W. Is the reason for the lack of sanctification because we are not actually looking for the Lord's return? Paul spoke of ardently desiring.
J.T. That is just what is in mind in this reading, that sanctification precedes the matter of the coming
{66}
of the Lord. It is important that the brethren should have the thought of sanctification if we are really desiring to go to be with the Lord, to be translated, because it is imminent now as we believe fully. The state that is suitable for it is a great point in the early part of the chapter. Someone has enquired what is sanctification, what is holiness? It is the effect of the Spirit received on the ground of the death of Christ. It is the effect of the Spirit's operations, that is the meaning of it, that it is holiness in that sense to be made like God Himself. God is holy, therefore we are to be holy. If we are to join the Lord in the translation, we should be suitable. We do not just go up to be with the Lord as we are here today, because there are certain conditions in us that have to be discarded and forever set aside. We shall not need them eternally.
H.E.E. We might go back to the first verse, "Ye ought to walk and please God". John looked upon Jesus as He walked. What a walk that was!
J.T. He was affected, quite so, and said, "Behold the Lamb of God". And the disciples were affected by that and they followed Jesus. So that is the idea here, that we are to be in a suitable state to be translated, because the Lord is concerned about that. He is coming to take us up; "The Lord Himself ... shall descend". He is going to do that, so that He is looking for us now to be sanctified, that is to say, that our vessels are to be holy. That is the first part of the chapter.
G.D. Would there be a certain urgency suggested in the last chapter of Revelation? "The time is near ... he that is holy, let him be sanctified still. Behold, I come quickly". Would there be urgency in that in connection with sanctification?
J.T. In that chapter it says "the Spirit and the bride say, Come". The Spirit of God is involved in that word "say, Come". The Spirit is saying it too,
{67}
as well as the bride. So it is well said that what we say should be said well.
Ques. Is Enoch an example?
J.T. Just so, he is the seventh from Adam; that is, he has gone through the whole course. The word 'seven' implies that he had gone through the whole course of instruction, from Adam to his own time. He prophesied of the Lord coming with His holy myriads. So Enoch had the testimony before he was translated that he pleased God. We are looking for translation now and this chapter deals with it. Therefore, if we expect to be translated, let us please God in what we are doing.
Ques. Before you go on, would you say something about honouring the body? It says "his own vessel in sanctification and honour". God is not going to leave our bodies here when the Lord comes; He is going to translate our bodies. Should we not value our bodies in the way that God values them? Does the word 'honour' bring that out?
J.T. Quite so. We should especially keep in mind that the Lord's coming is mentioned in every chapter in this epistle. Therefore, we can see the Spirit of God makes a great point of it, and we ought to make a great point of it. So the idea in this part of the chapter is sanctification in view of translation. We should be cleansed but sanctified as well, which has reference to God, that God is holy and we should be holy. The Lord is going to come for us and take us up, but it says in verse 14 that God will bring the saints with him. God Himself will do it, so it is a question of God, to be holy as God is holy. So the word is, "Now concerning brotherly love ye have no need that we should write to you, for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another". Then in verse 13, "But we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are fallen asleep", because now it is a question of the coming
{68}
of the Lord. God is going to bring the sleeping ones with Him; He will not leave them behind. It is not simply those who are alive and remain but those who have fallen asleep from Abel down. We will all be transferred to be with the Lord.
A.R. What you are saying now is that God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep, and the Lord Himself shall descend and then you referred to the fact that the Spirit of God quickens our mortal bodies; the Godhead will all bear on the rapture.
J.T. Quite so, so that God brings the sleeping saints with Him. He will not leave them here on the earth, even if they are dead for a thousand years. God will bring them with Him. Then we are taught how. It is the Lord Jesus, for God has given everything to be in His hand, even the matter of translation is to be in the Lord's hands. He is to do it; so the word 'how' to which attention has been drawn, how the thing is to be done, is a great matter.
A.B.P. In that connection I was struck with the footnote in John's epistle. "And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure". The footnote says 'Him who is to be manifested'.
J.T. When He is manifested; now we are children of God, but when He is manifested we shall be like Him. This is how it is to happen.
A.B.P. Purification is as having the manifestation in view.
Ques. Would the knowing how be knowing how to use the Spirit? We put to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so.
C.H.H. I think you have said that the parenthesis from verse 15 to the end of the chapter was fresh light for the apostle that he himself had not received before.
{69}
J.T. It is a new thing. The Lord's coming was in mind throughout Scripture, but this is one of the most distinctive thoughts that we have in all the Bible as to the Lord's coming, and how it comes about, what happens. It says "if we believe", again we come back to the idea of believing, of faith. "For if we believe that Jesus has died and has risen again, so also God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus". Then the remaining part of the chapter is to unfold to us what will happen. Thus the great stress in the early part of the chapter as to sanctification and honour, but sanctification especially.
R.W.S. Is the allusion to God, in verse 14, to the Father?
J.T. It is the ordinary sense of the name *God*. In @1 Corinthians 8, we are told "to us there is one God", and then we are told, that He is the Father, and "one Lord, Jesus Christ". Here in verse 14 "if we believe that Jesus has died and has risen again, so also God will bring with him", that is God in the ordinary sense of the word *God*, including the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Either one of Them can be called God, but here it is God in the full sense without any qualification.
Ques. In verse 16 there is the designation of a person, is there not? "The Lord himself", is that the Operator?
J.T. Just so, and then we have the Father Himself, too, but Christ is the Operator here. It says, "for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout", notice the word 'assembling', the church is in mind, "with archangel's voice". Why should the archangel be mentioned? Well, it is; it is a special matter. "With archangel's voice and with trump of God", it is God Himself in the voice, "shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first". That is part of the operation.
{70}
F.J.F. Do you think it is a military allusion?
J.T. I think it is. It is mentioned in @1 Corinthians 15 and is a military allusion. The "assembling shout" here is a military allusion, but @1 Corinthians 15 is more so. There is more in @1 Corinthians 15 as to that point than there is here.
Ques. Would being caught up together in the clouds and meeting the Lord in the air be simultaneous?
J.T. Let us see how it reads. "Then we, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord". Meeting the Lord in the air is the final thought. We meet each other first, that is, the whole idea is caught up together, the whole assembly, as it were, is caught up.
R.W.S. Verse 16 says "and the dead in Christ shall rise first". Does the Lord touch the dead first and then does the Spirit in us who are living change us? According to @Romans 8: 11 the Holy Spirit has to do with the living. You have said possibly the brethren do not fully understand this yet, as to the action of the Spirit in quickening our mortal bodies.
J.T. I am referring to that, "for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air". I would assume that the whole physical condition that we arc in now is involved; we meet the Lord in the air; not beyond the air. There is a certain limit to the depth of the air, and we are to meet the Lord in that place. So He comes down part of the way, I would say. We all go up together, and we have met together in the air, but we are going to meet the Lord in the air. The Lord is clearly coming
{71}
down to meet us and then we shall be forever with the Lord. Our comfort is in the words that are mentioned "so encourage one another with these words". The general position is that we are here now, and what is behind us is all the dead in Christ. They will be raised, and as regards the living the action of the change is by the Spirit, that is what I understand. @Romans 8:11 says that the Spirit is the power of change. After we are changed, we are caught up together with those who have been raised to meet the Lord in the air "and thus we shall be always with the Lord".
E.A.L. Does it mean where it says "and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first", that the dead get their heavenly personalities when the Lord comes down from heaven and raises them? I think you have said that the dead go to heaven, not when they die, but when they are raised.
J.T. Quite so, the point stressed now is how the thing happens, that is to say, the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven, but the first thought mentioned is that God is in the thing, so that the great thought of the divine personality is God, and He is involved in this. Then the trump is to be heard; it is "trump of God", so that 'to know how' is of great importance to keep in our minds, to know how the thing happens; it is a wonderful happening. The Spirit of God is pleased to give those facts to show what does happen.
Rem. You said elsewhere that the Holy Spirit has to do with the living and the Lord with the dead.
J.T. That is exactly what I believe and what Scripture teaches. The Spirit has to do with the living because of His dwelling in us. But then @1 Corinthians 15: 51 shows that all are to be changed. The dead are raised by the Lord, but as regards the living, if the happening were to take place
{72}
today, the Spirit would do it. The Spirit of God would change us. The Spirit's work is the first work in mind, but the Lord descends. It does not say the Spirit descends; He is already here. The sound of God's voice is to be heard by the trumpet, the "trump of God". So it is well to keep all these items in mind so that when we talk about them to one another we know what we are saying and we know what words to use. What hope arises in our hearts according to it!
F.N.W. The other day you used the word 'detail' as to the quickening of our mortal bodies by the Spirit. Would that add to us in a detailed way now in a moral sense? We have been speaking of holiness. Does He not help us now in reaching a state of holiness in a detailed way, but presently He is going to quicken our mortal bodies? He has to do that work in a detailed way then, does He not?
J.T. Quite, our mortal bodies, that is what we are in just now. They have to be changed. Your clothes will have to go. The Lord will do all that but the Spirit will be the agent of it "on account of his Spirit which dwells in you", @Romans 8: 11. That is to say, He will do all the details, to speak reverently. The Holy Spirit will undertake graciously to deal with all matters relative to how we are to go up. The Lord Himself is coming down to see us; "thus we shall be always with the Lord". The Lord will do the reception, but the Spirit will do the changing, what is needed to fit us for the change.
J.T.Jr. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come" would be in line with that. The thing would be in the saying, the intelligence would be in it.
J.T. Quite so.
A.B. It is very beautiful to think of the Lord descending with an assembling shout, and the Spirit in relation to the living quickening the mortal bodies, co-ordinating with the Lord.
{73}
J.T. Quite so. All that implies that the assembly is in mind, the whole of it is in mind, that we all go up together. The Spirit has to do with that, but the Lord Himself does the raising of the dead. He can take them out of their graves. He has been dead Himself -- wonderful -- we speak reverently, the Lord has been dead Himself, three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. He knows it all experimentally, and then the Spirit will do all the balance of the work, because there will have to be a preparation for us to go into heaven where we are to be eternally. We will not need anything that we are wearing now; it will all be dealt with in the power of the Spirit. Now let the brethren just dwell on the fact that the action of the Spirit will touch us, and He is here today to serve us, to help us in our minds. But presently He will do other things; that is to say, what refers to our bodies. The Spirit will do that. We will be changed "on account of his Spirit which dwells in you". The Spirit will do great things and what He will do finally is to quicken us, to quicken our mortal bodies.
Ques. Who is going to decide when this moment arrives, the Father, the Son, or the Spirit? I am thinking of the Scripture, "But of that day or of that hour no one knows ... but the Father". Is the Father in charge of it all; is He determining the time?
J.T. Well, it is a question of the Scripture that links up the Father with all we are saying. I would think all the divine Persons are involved, the matter is so great and glorious. They will all be in this great transaction.
N.B. Would @Acts 1: 7 help? "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority".
Rem. That is the trend of the scripture I had in mind, but I think the scripture I quoted has to
{74}
do with the appearing more than the translation. But this last scripture quoted is better, and seems as if the Father is in charge of determining the exact time.
W.W.M. The scripture referred to is in @Mark 13: 31, 32, "The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away. But of that day or of that hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father".
Rem. I thought that scripture might refer to the appearing or the ending of things, whereas we are considering the translation, the rapture. It seems as if the time is determined by the Father according to @Mark 13. Does the Father also determine the time in connection with the rapture?
J.T. Well, you might say that the operations in relation to the rapture are all simultaneous. It says "in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye". God does that, and that is the reason God is mentioned first here, "God will bring with him". God will determine the time. Of course, the divine Persons would be all in it. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit will be all in this great transaction.
M.O. What you have said in relation to the Holy Spirit should help us to understand the glorious completion of His service to the assembly, should it not? That would be His last service to us while we are on earth, would it not?
J.T. The Spirit will always remain with us: He will never leave us, even in heaven. The Spirit will go with us because there is to be service there. God will be glorified there in His saints, glorified in all that believe. The glorification will be in the power of the Spirit.
F.J.F. Mr. Darby's hymn says, 'By the Spirit all pervading' (`14:5).
J.T. Just so, that is just the word.
{75}
J.C. "And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth", @John 14: 16.
J.T. Yes, He will be with us for ever.
F.J.F. Is it right to think that the Holy Spirit will revive the whole church before the Lord's coming, so that we will all say, Come?
J.T. Well, very likely, but we are saying it now. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come", not that they will say it, but they are doing it now.
F.J.F. And the others who are not in fellowship with us?
J.T. It is not a question of fellowship; it is a question of going to heaven. All the divine Persons are in it. They are all in the transaction. It is going to be wonderful. Think of the wonderfulness of it! Every true Christian will be involved in it whether he is in fellowship or not.
R.J.C. What is the distinction between the clouds and the air?
J.T. They are just agencies that God has. It is said that the air is about forty-five miles deep, so the air is in mind. The higher we go the more attenuated it is. The Lord will come into it. It is wonderful that we get all these details in this wonderful chapter.
F.J.F. So the Lord will come very near the earth.
J.T. It will be as near at least as the depth of the air. It is said to be about forty-five miles high and the Lord will come into that, so that it will be a near matter.
Ques. How do you view the Old Testament saints in relation to the assembly?
J.T. That is a question which I am not prepared to answer, but it looks to me as if @1 Corinthians 15 would deal with the whole matter. This chapter seems to be more limited, more in connection with Paul's own personal feelings about the saints in
{76}
Thessalonica. It seems to be a matter of Paul himself and his own thoughts given to him by the Spirit. @1 Corinthians 15 deals with the whole matter.
T.W. You used the express word 'assembly' here.
J.T. I think perhaps the Lord's movements relate to the assembly only, but I would not be sure about that, because I think He is concerned about all of His own. He has secured them all.
Ques. Will you differentiate between this remark, "fallen asleep through Jesus", and "the dead in Christ"?
J.T. There is not much change, only the "dead in Christ" is more official.
Rem. Reference has been made to the Old Testament saints. I wondered whether they had something to do with the first-fruits.
J.T. Well, I think they have. I think the Lord will change them all; He has died for us all and we will all go up with Him. I believe that fully. Then there are the millennial saints too. We have to consider that. There is so much to be said about it. The book of Revelation has much in relation to this matter as to the translation and our going to be with the Lord for ever.
Ques. Is it your thought that this epistle would fit in with what you have already said in relation to John's epistle? "I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father". It is somewhat limited to young persons who knew the truth in a limited way.
J.T. I would say there is a good deal in that, but it is not absolute. We could not exclude from the Thessalonian saints men and women. We know that in the millennium there may be old men and old women, so that we have to consider all that when we are dealing with this great subject. We have begun with the idea that it deals with young saints, that is not simply in age, but persons who are young
{77}
in the faith. It is a question of faith, and if we have faith we are included. We are to regard them as young because they are not long in Christianity, only recently converted but they might be old people. In the millennium there will be old men and old women walking on the streets showing what a change there will be, but still they will be as we are here today, in flesh and blood. We will not be in flesh and blood; we shall be like the Lord. "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is".
J.H.E. This wonderful ministry to young believers, resulting in our looking for the Lord momentarily, will help us to keep short accounts.
J.T. Just so.
{78}
READINGS ON FIRST THESSALONIANS (5)
@1 Thessalonians 5: 1 - 28
J.T. We have already remarked on the subject of the Lord's coming as seen in this epistle, that it is to be divided into two parts, first, the Lord Himself presented by the apostle and a direct word on the point. "For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that *we*, the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord, are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep; for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then *we*, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air". Now this is the first great part or feature of what is called the Lord's coming. The second feature is the fifth chapter. So the word is "concerning the times and the seasons", that is to say, the public coming of the Lord Jesus enters into the idea of times and seasons. It goes on, "brethren, ye have no need that ye should be written to, for ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night". Now this is called "the day of the Lord". It is implied in the expression "the coming of the Lord" but the "day of the Lord" is a longer period. It would appear in the book of Revelation that it is to be a thousand years, but any way, it is spoken of here as "the day of the Lord". Our reading this afternoon will cover this latter phase of the so-called Lord's coming. In the first phase in the fourth chapter it is the Lord coming for His people, and we are to be with Him forever. "The day of the Lord" involves more; it involves a certain period which may be regarded as the millennium, the period of a thousand years. It is a day in which
{79}
God would show what He can do even in the present circumstances physically. The day will show what God can do for men in spite of conditions. So we have here, "But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that ye should be written to, for ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night". The idea is a day of action; the word 'day' includes a long period in which God will show what He can do in the present world as it is. It is for us to be ready for it because His coming will be public, and we will come out with Him. We ought to be in every way in accord just as He comes to take us. That is the idea of this book, these chapters especially.
R.W.S. Is this day ushered in by judgment?
J.T. That is the way it is presented. He says, "that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night". That is, it comes secretly, as it were, without announcement. We can only arrive at the thought by what we have learned and what we learn from other parts of Scripture. It comes secretly; it is not to be announced in any public way. It is to come as a thief in the night. He does not tell us when He is coming, but it is "as a thief by night". He comes suddenly.
J.K. Does the day of the Lord bring in the thought of authority?
J.T. I think so. It is the day in which people will have right-of-way everywhere. The world will not be governed as it is by certain races or nations. The Lord will do it. He will do it publicly. Things will be right for a thousand years, and we should read @Revelation 19 to get it clear in our minds. The fifth chapter of 1 Thessalonians has to do with the second part, as we may properly call it, of the coming of the Lord, that is, the public coming and the consequences of it. The Lord Himself will take things
{80}
in hand and His titles, as given to us in @Revelation 19, show that He is to be in charge publicly. Everything is to be done under His control. Other scriptures, of course, speak of what will transpire during the thousand years, in fact, the Bible is full of it. It will be a wonderful time, a time in which God will show what He can do with the world as it is. After this, there will be a new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness shall dwell, not simply be there, but dwell. That will be the eternal condition. So this chapter contemplates what we are speaking of; it contemplates the Lord coming to take charge of things. Coming like a thief in the night indicates that He comes secretly, but then the public position will be seen presently and it is described in @Revelation 19.
A.B. In relation to the Lord descending and the assembly being caught up to be with the Lord, is it that there is now to be no hindrance in relation to the expanse; that is, the expanse is claimed for God as in @Revelation 12 where Michael and his angels fight in relation to the casting out from heaven of the devil and his angels? But in chapter 5 it is more the clearing of the earth in relation to the establishing of righteousness.
J.T. Well, I think that is a fairly good setting out of the facts. It is taken up in an orderly way in chapter 5 of 1 Thessalonians.
A.R. Why does Paul speak to these saints and say, "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief"'? Why does he speak to them in that way'?
J.T. That would mean that they had been instructed as to prophecy, although they were young Christians. Evidently the apostle Paul took occasion to instruct young believers as to prophecy. The beginning of the great revival of the truth in the last hundred and thirty years was largely occupied
{81}
with prophecy. In verse 4 we read, "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness". We might say that of ourselves today, that we are not in darkness. Every brother here knows something about the prophecies of Scripture. So it says, "Ye ... are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief: for all ye are sons of light". That is a remarkable expression, "sons of light", meaning that we have light, not only information, but that we have light. We are luminous.
A.R. Would it help us to understand the books of Isaiah and Daniel?
J.T. Yes, especially Daniel.
F.J.F. Is what you have been speaking of at the end of the fourth chapter the first part of the first resurrection?
J.T. I think so. The whole period from verse 13 has this in mind, what is to come in in the future, the prophecies that are found in Scripture in regard to the future. The fourth chapter deals with ourselves being translated to heaven which is a great matter too, the greatest of all events, because the saints, the assembly, and the saints perhaps of the Old Testament too, those that belong to the Lord will all be translated to heaven. The birth and death of the Lord Jesus imply the greatest things, the greatest events that ever happened on the earth. But the coming of the Lord is a great event too, perhaps second to that -- the Lord's death first, and then His coming in glory described in @Revelation 19, a wonderful scene.
J.W.D. "When they may say, Peace and safety". Does that give us any light as to what will be before men between the two comings? I thought it was a period which will be deluged with judgment and misery.
J.T. I think it refers to the present time, to be simple, what is current at the present time among
{82}
the nations would indicate that they are going to do great things. Great things are going to happen in this and other countries, and the world is going to be wonderfully improved, and they will say, "Peace and safety". Steps will be taken to prevent war, but we have to go by the prophecies of Scripture if we are to know what is to happen in the future. We have to read the Scriptures and learn from them. "When they may say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them". It is a terrible thing, but @Revelation 19 gives a full description of the wonderful time that is coming, involved in what we are saying now, that the Lord comes publicly to set things right in this world.
R.W.S. Will the millennium be universal over the whole earth or just a part of the earth?
J.T. I think the whole earth will be included. It is God's earth. "The earth is Jehovah's and the fulness thereof", @Psalm 24: 1. "God is the King of all the earth", @Psalm 47: 7. He has claimed the earth for Christ. He is going to give it to Him.
R.W.S. I thought you had intimated earlier that the western world had contributed the assembly, and that the millennium bore more upon the eastern world, India and China and those parts.
J.T. The book of Acts contemplates what is done in an evangelical sense, so God has "appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained" (@Acts 17: 13, A.V.). "A day" is the same expression as we have here. That is the great event that is coming, and that will include India, China and every part of the earth, because it is God's earth. It indicates His wonderful bounty to men. The earth yields what man needs in abundance. Take this country as an illustration. See the abundance that it yields; perhaps more than any other country, this country is abundant in its yield for the good of man. God has appointed a
{83}
day to rule the world by Christ. He is not ruling it now, although He is ruling it indirectly, but the day is coming when the Lord Jesus will rule. God has appointed that, that He should judge the world. "He will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead", @Acts 17:31 (A.V.). That is the assurance that we have, that God has raised Him from the dead. Our Lord Jesus will come out in public to rule the world, not only to judge, the word 'judge' means to rule, but everything is done that is necessary. He will simply deal with men in punishment, but will rule the world in righteousness.
T.W. @Psalm 2 says, "Ask of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance, and for thy possession the ends of the earth".
J.T. Very good.
A.A.T. @Revelation 19: 10, "For the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus". Does that apply to the period we are speaking of?
J.T. It applies to the present time. It is what *He* is. "The spirit of prophecy is" not will be "the testimony of Jesus".
F.J.F. Does the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ involve that a new world has begun already for faith?
J.T. The resurrection of Christ has already happened and that goes forward to what we arc saying now. He has raised Him from the dead according to the verse already quoted from Acts, and the bearing of all that will be seen in the future and will come in after what we are speaking of now. Of course, Christ is already raised, He has been raised by God, and that is the testimony that goes forward to the prophetic world.
F.J.F. My point was, do we get the advantages by faith of that great day, the millennial day?
{84}
J.T. Quite so, so that you get in the epistle to the Hebrews, "the world to come, whereof we speak", that is the world of prophecy. It is already existing for faith in that the Man whom God has ordained has been raised from the dead, the Lord Jesus. He is not ruling yet, but He is going to rule and the bearing of His resurrection will be there.
F.J.F. I would like to get clear for ourselves, are we not already in the joy of that great day?
J.T. We are assembly people and have the light of everything, the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; we all have light in our souls.
C.H.H. It says in this chapter, "Ye are sons of light".
J.T. That is exactly the point, that we are sons of light. Those who form the assembly are that because they are illuminated from the face of Jesus.
A.R. We can enjoy the day of the Lord here now.
J.T. Because we have light about everything.
F.J.F. Is that why, when Paul spoke in Thessalonica, they said, "These that have turned the world upside down" because they spoke of another king, Jesus?
J.T. Just so, they had power to do it. They could not have turned the world upside down without power. The apostles did it, and it was a time of conversion of men. They turned the world upside down, but they organised the assembly.
F.J.F. And they overthrew idolatry in Europe and it has never raised its head since.
J.T. Just so, and it will be done in Asia too. Others will take our place to do that in Asia. They will turn the world upside down there too, so that the darkness will flee and the light will shine everywhere.
F.H.L. Would @Philippians 1, "Jesus Christ's day" be an expression understood in the assembly in contrast to the day of the Lord?
{85}
J.T. Just so, although I should not like to separate anything in that sense because it is the Lord Himself that is in mind. The day of the Lord is the day of the Lord Jesus, the same as Jesus Christ, of course.
F.H.L. When would that be -- "Jesus Christ's day"?
J.T. "Jesus Christ's day" is the Lord's day, that is, the day of the Lord. Another thing, the Lord's day is the first day of the week too, meaning that it is the day in which He has power and we are to recognise it. We do not do anything except what has to be done, because it is the Lord's day.
R.W.S. Does the day of God look on to the eternal day?
J.T. That is the eternal day, God's day, because of the greatness of the result. It is what God will be in the millennium, the day of God, what He will do in His mercy for men. He is doing good now, but He will do far more in that day. It will be a wonderful time. I would say that machinery and all that will be discarded. I may be saying too much, but my impression is that machinery and all that sort of thing that men have devised to make things better and make a show will all be destroyed. God can do without it, although of course, it may be His own creature, but I believe that God will show what He can do with the things He has actually brought in here Himself on the earth. These things will be usable and enough for all that He wants to show.
A.R. Without automobiles or aeroplanes, do you think?
J.T. Do not make too much of it; we cannot name the things because we will never stop if we do that. But the general idea is to show that in the creation God has put all that is necessary for men, and therefore it says, "He formed it to be inhabited", @Isaiah 45: 18. That is to say, men are inhabitants
{86}
of God's earth, and God has put into it all that is necessary for the inhabitants. It has been made to be inhabited.
M.O. Does the day of the Lord make way for the day of God?
J.T. That may be so, but I should not like to make that too distinct because the day of the Lord is the day of God. The Lord is God. The divine Persons are three and any One of Them can be called God. So that we cannot distinguish in that sense as to divine Persons because any One of Them is God and may be called God too. We have to be specific and Scripture is usually specific in naming divine Persons so that you know what Person is speaking.
M.O. I was thinking of the work of subjection being completed by Christ and then the day of God being ushered in.
J.T. Well, that is quite right, only be careful that you do not becloud divine Persons. They are all divine and all equal. We cannot say that One is greater than the Other. We must be careful about that, not to convey that One is greater than the Other, only that in the economy, as we call it, They are; the Father is greater than the Son. I say this only to keep the thing clear, that the economy is different from the past eternal conditions.
D.P. Will the Lord be vindicated publicly in His day against all the charges that were made against Him?
J.T. Undoubtedly He will, everything will be cleared up in that day, at the same time I would say that the day of God must be the greatest day We can have nothing greater than God. That is a thing to keep clearly in our minds. We can have nothing or no one greater than God.
R.S. In @2 Peter 3 it says, "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will
{87}
pass away with a rushing noise, and the elements, burning with heat, shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it shall be burnt up". Then verse 12 speaks of "hastening the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved". It seems as if they are similar.
J.T. They are. Peter runs on with Paul because in the same epistle he says "our beloved brother Paul"; there is no difference between them, no feeling of rivalry between them at all. There is absolute clarity between them. We are now dealing with this fifth chapter of 1 Thessalonians and we want to see how it bears out what has been said. It is not the coming of the Lord for us; it is the coming of the Lord universally, and @Revelation 19 gives a full description of it. The point of these meetings is that the saints may have their minds clear and carry away something that will stand by them in regard to the truth, in regard of what we call the prophetic map, the map that God has ordained to set out His thoughts.
L.E.S. In the book of Daniel, chapter 7, we have the incoming of the Son of man with the clouds. It says "there came with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed". That would have this in mind, would it not?
J.T. It is very important because Daniel is the particular prophet that opens up the prophetic map, as we call it, of the earth. Daniel has a great part in that.
Ques. I was going to ask about the verse already quoted from @2 Peter 3, "The day of the Lord will
{88}
come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise". Does that not seem to apply after the millennium, the elements being dissolved and the earth and the works in it burnt up?
J.T. The eternal state is in mind, I would say. Peter depicts the eternal conditions that God is going to bring out, the day of God.
Rem. He carries the day of the Lord right on as ushering in the eternal day.
J.T. Just so.
A.B.P. Do you distinguish the day of tribulation from the millennium or is it the beginning of the millennium? I was thinking of what we speak of as the period of the great tribulation for three and a half years, or the period that it may be, is that before the millennium?
J.T. Surely, it is before. What God will do before, leading up to the cleansing of the earth.
A.B.P. Is what we are speaking of included in that, that period of tribulation rather than the peaceful conditions of the millennium?
J.T. Quite so, the tribulation. The Lord has made promises about it. The Lord says to the assembly in Philadelphia, "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth", @Revelation 3: 10. That is, the earth dwellers are in mind. They have to be dealt with in judgment by God. He wants heaven dwellers now, and they are content to stay on the earth.
D.P. Will there be any earth in the millennium?
J.T. I think there will. I think it will be the earth as we have it now, even the sea, I suppose, will be there, but in the eternal state there shall be no more sea.
J.R.H.Jr. Do the words, "ye know perfectly well" indicate how much the Spirit has helped the saints,
{89}
so that our knowledge has this character, knowing perfectly well?
J.T. Paul had been among these young Christians in Thessalonica, and they were converted. It is said these are the first two epistles he wrote. The indication is that they must have learned a great deal from Paul. He did not leave them without a knowledge of the prophetic world that God is bringing in.
C.H.H. @Revelation 19: 16 says, "And he has upon his garment, and upon his thigh, a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords". I was wondering if that furnished a basis for the doxology of Paul in @1 Timothy 6: 13 - 16, which says, "I enjoin thee before God who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession, that thou keep the commandment spotless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall show, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship; who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom be honour and eternal might. Amen". Would the consciousness of this produce a worshipful spirit?
J.T. Quite so, and that passage in Timothy coincides with what we are reading, not that Scripture exactly repeats itself, but there are passages that go together. The Lord Jesus is in mind, the power is in the thigh. Man's power is in his thigh if it is a question of actual power. That is what I was saying earlier about the machinery that men have made that I doubt if God will use it. The Lord will have power enough in His hands for everything that is needed in the coming world.
Rem. I would like to mention what Mr. Stoney said about @Revelation 22: 16. "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the
{90}
assemblies. *I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". He pointed out that only those would be ready to wait for the Lord as the bright and morning star who are in the good of recognising Him as the root and offspring of David in His divine and royal rights in regard to this earth.
J.T. Just so, the root is Deity, the Lord's deity, and the offspring is His manhood. That is what appeals now, that we have the Lord among us as Man, but He remains God nevertheless.
R.W.S. How do you understand verse 10? "Who has died for us, that whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him". How do you understand the last clause?
J.T. That is one of the encouragements that are especially to be with us, so that the Lord died for us, that whether we may be watching, or whether we die in the meantime, we are to "live together with him", not only to live, but "live together", which is a lovely thought for Christians, to "live together with him". That is future. If we enter into it now, it would be a question of spiritual power, that is, the Holy Spirit being here always available to help us, to do things for us.
A.B. Is that why Paul says in writing to Timothy, "I am already being poured out", but then he further says, "Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing"?
J.T. That is what we are dealing with too. In the millennium all that will come to pass. It is a wonderful time ahead of us, so that we should never be droopy or disconcerted, because of the wonderful time that is ahead of us, but also because of the wonderful time that is here. The Spirit of God is here on earth to take charge of the saints, and Christ
{91}
is in heaven to do the same as a Priest. The Lord is doing everything in heaven that is needed to be done. The Spirit is doing everything on earth that is needed to be done. So it is a wonderful time even now.
J.L.P. Do we anticipate the day of the Lord each week as we come up to the Supper? Would it be right to say that? I was thinking of affording the Lord His rights.
J.T. Instead of saying the day of the Lord I would say the Lord's day, which is one of the terms applying to the first day of the week. John the evangelist who wrote the book of Revelation says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day". That is what happened on the Lord's day, not in the future, but on the Lord's day now. So we can realise what His day here is because He comes in among us on the first day of the week. It is His own day that He can do as He likes, as it were, and we enjoy having Him with us. I hope everyone understands what I am trying to say. So we have the Spirit of God in us to do this and the Scriptures in our hands so that we should be understood in what we are saying.
W.W.M. It says in our chapter "ye know perfectly well", and then it says, "*Ye* are sons of light and sons of day". That is what we are now.
J.T. Just so. So that the light is effective in us already because of the Spirit being here. He is God Himself; wonderful to think that it is so! God Himself is amongst us.
Ques. Would you say a word about @Hebrews 9: 28, "thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation". "Those that look for him the second time" would that be the remnant when they look
{92}
for the appearing of the Lord at the beginning of the millennium or would this refer to the rapture?
J.T. It refers to us. This book is written for us by Paul, undoubtedly. It is written for the assembly.
Rem. We thought it applied to the rapture.
J.T. So it does. If we love the Lord, we are looking for Him.
Ques. You told us in New York that some who have not the Spirit will get the Spirit in a moment before His coming; is that right?
J.T. You cannot limit God in any way. God can do a great deal in a moment. In a twinkling of an eye He can do things. So that there will be some perhaps at the time of His coming who do not have the Spirit, but He will take care of that I am sure. It belongs to our period; it is the period of the Spirit. We might call it the day of the Spirit and that would be right too, because it is the day of the assembly in which the Spirit dwells. He is here in the assembly.
F.N.W. Are we to be, therefore, as those who have heard the midnight cry, "Behold, the bridegroom", and to see that we have the oil?
J.T. I think so. That is Matthew, the assembly gospel.
F.J.F. When the Lord comes, will we come with Him?
J.T. Well, when it says, "God will bring with him" that means, we may say, the Lord will bring us with Him. It is the same as God bringing us with Him. Before that He comes for us to take us up and then we come with Him. He will bring the church with Him; He will be espoused publicly.
F.J.F. The heavenly city coming down.
J.T. Just so.
Rem. Enoch prophesied that the "Lord has come amidst his holy myriads", @Jude 14.
{93}
J.T. Quite so, that is the saints, "his holy myriads". They are made holy; we have the Spirit before that or we would not be holy.
F.H.L. Jude says "to set you with exultation blameless before his glory", referring to God. Is that the rapture?
J.T. I would connect it more with the Lord Himself in display as in @Revelation 19. I would think it alludes to that; the day of the Lord and the day of God refer to the time when the Lord has a free hand, but that is a different matter from the rapture. He comes secretly when it refers to the rapture. The verse just quoted is the public situation that we are dealing with, the time when He is doing things.
Ques. In @Luke 23 the thief on the cross said to Jesus, "Remember me, Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom". That should be helpful in relation to the rapidity and non-restriction of the operations of divine Persons, would it not, even in an hour of tremendous pressure?
J.T. The man is given more than he says. The Lord answers him, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise". The Lord would be there and he would be with Him. That is a remarkable thing that the Lord should say that to him. If you take the facts as they are, the Lord was saying that when He was on the cross, and He was going to be in the grave three days and three nights. So that it is a disembodied state until resurrection. The Lord left His body for the moment. He is in paradise, but that is all a mystery. We cannot understand that, but He said it, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise". The man was dying too, but the Lord was dying. So that we have to think of the condition of the saints in the Old Testament. Their bodies are in the grave, in the earth, but then those saints have some place; they are with the Lord, that is
{94}
all we can say, where He is. To depart to be with Christ -- that does not refer to your body, it is your spirit.
A.B.P. You would say he was a son of light; he went into the day?
J.T. I would think so, we are all that, in principle at least, even the little ones in principle.
W.W.M. You made a remark earlier that they have something. No doubt we are concerned as to many people in Christendom we do not know about as Christians. It says in @Revelation 2, "As many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come". Whatever they have, they have something, and we have to leave it at that.
J.T. Very good.
A.B.P. Would it be right to say that what we have been speaking of helps us in relation to the Supper and what follows it, that we are free to leave the earth because we know all will be settled righteously in relation to it?
J.T. Just so. That is to say, we have the Spirit and by the Spirit we can leave, depart for the moment to be with the Lord in ecstasy, we might call it. Peter had an ecstasy. He was going to have a meat but instead of that he had an ecstasy while waiting for it and he saw wonderful things.
R.W.S. It says in verse 23, "Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly: and your whole spirit, and soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ".
J.T. It is very remarkable; I was thinking of that. I want to repeat it so that everyone will hear it and carry it away with them. "Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly", not partly, that is God's wish for them all. "Your whole spirit, and
{95}
soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ", marvellous! That is the apostle's wish for them, that all this should be true of them. It is wonderful to have in mind "Now the God of peace", that is God Himself, but the God of peace. He is the God of other things, but He is the God of peace. "Himself sanctify you wholly: and your whole spirit", that is the inner part of man, "and soul", the feeling part of man, the love part of man, "and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ". Then it goes on to say, "He is faithful who calls you", that is God Himself (see chapter 2, verse 12), "who will also perform it. Brethren, pray for us". It is very beautiful.
J.H.E. In @Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus says, "Blessed the peace-makers, for they shall be called sons of God".
J.T. Showing that we should all make up any differences before we sit down to the Lord's supper. If there be any differences locally, let it all be settled. There is a means of settling it before we sit down at the Lord's supper.
A.B. So that we are not only sons of light but sons of peace.
J.T. Just so, sons of peace; God is the God of peace and light, so we are sons of God.
A.R. It says in @Matthew 5 to leave your gift at the altar and be reconciled to your brother.
J.T. Quite so.
A.MacD. Is that why Paul says here, "Quench not the Spirit"?
J.T. Quite so. It is just possible that we may do that in any locality, because of bad feelings arising that are not settled. Rather let it be settled. That is the point. Why cannot we settle things? There
{96}
is a means of doing it. The truth of redemption coming into our minds and the Holy Spirit coming into our hearts, there is surely means of settling everything.
F.J.F. When we break bread it says "Ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come", @1 Corinthians 11: 26. Do we in a way claim the earth for the Lord every time we break bread?
J.T. I am not sure that the Lord is dealing with the earth just now. He will take it presently. I think He is leaving it just with the government that God has set up to look after it. On the first day of the week at the Lord's supper the Lord is concerned with us as to what we are doing, that we are remembering Him, showing forth His death, calling Him to mind. I do not think the Lord is concerned about much else just now, because God has ordered everything as regards the world and the government of it. There are a great many nations, but God is looking after them, and the powers that be, the governments of the nations, are ordained of God. But I think the Lord Jesus viewed by Himself is not engaged with that, except that He has part in Godhead of course, but He is looking after the saints, thinking of the assembly and the gospel. That is what He is going on with.
Ques. "Let a man prove himself", that is the point, is it not?
J.T. That is good, "Let a man prove himself, and thus eat". So that we have things right if we do that.
F.N.W. Does this verse in @Hebrews 12 fill out what you are saying? "Pursue peace with all, and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord: watching lest there be any one who lacks the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you".
{97}
J.T. That is what I would call one of the peculiar features of the epistles; they deal with details, and that is one of them. The Lord has taken care to indicate what we should do for ourselves. He will do other things, but what we should do for ourselves, take care of that, that is what the Lord is saying to us. 'Do not ask Me to do it if you can do it for yourself'. The Lord will do things for you if you cannot do them, but if you can do them, you should.
J.T.Jr. It says in verse 22, "Hold fast the right". There are things that are right and they should be held fast amongst us.
J.T. Quite so. "Pursue righteousness ... with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", @2 Timothy 2: 22.
J.T.Jr. If what is right is established in a locality, it should be held to firmly.
J.T. In answering the question, 'What is righteousness?' Mr. Raven said it was doing what was right. That is very simple, doing what is right.
E.A.L. I wanted to ask in regard to what you said about settling matters quickly. Some of us know in our localities how necessary that is. Personal, household or family feelings must be dealt with or we will not have liberty in the service of God. It says in @1 John 4, "If any one say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?". The point in settling these matters quickly is that we then come into the condition where we can be right before God.
J.T. Just so. John wrote three epistles. The verse just read is one of the best practical sayings I know in all the epistles as to our relations with the brethren.
{98}
J.H.E. Verse 26 says, "Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss".
J.T. Very good, that protects us from any frivolous actions. We have to be watchful about that, to look out for holiness in all that we are doing.
{99}
*Pages 99 - 335 -- "Readings in Matthew's Gospel", Great Britain, 1950 (Volume 183 - Old Series)*.
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (1)
@Matthew 1: 1, 18 - 25; @Matthew 2: 1 - 23
J.T. Although the gospel of Matthew is in mind, the gospel which is engaged with the assembly, the idea is not to cover the whole of it here, but rather to confine ourselves to the first thirteen chapters now, and then, if the Lord permit, consider from the thirteenth chapter to the end in London.
Our minds should be kept peculiarly pure in dwelling on these two passages of scripture, because of the supreme importance of what is narrated in them, and that we should maintain the sense of holiness, "without which", it says, "no one shall see the Lord". As the time will be somewhat limited, it is thought that we should pass over the genealogies, although we may have to touch upon certain important elements in them. From verse 18 we shall consider the birth of our Lord Jesus, but at the same time we should not overlook verses 16 and 17, where it says, "Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ". And then we are told further, "All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations". It would not therefore be right to pass over these important verses, because they deal with the forty-two generations, evidently carefully measured. Luke, in the third chapter of his gospel, goes back to Adam, but here the genealogy goes back first to David and then to Abraham. Luke gives us the whole genealogy from
{100}
the Lord Jesus back to Adam, and this too must be in our minds, for we are dealing now, especially in our times, with the great facts of the Scriptures, the whole of the Scriptures. The word is, "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable", and we have to consider the whole of them, because the enemy is attacking the Scriptures, and this has been so almost universally since their inauguration. But the Spirit of God is stressing the idea of Scripture itself, and thus, in fairness to the truth, we must include what Luke says as well as Matthew. In Matthew we go back to David and then to Abraham, but in Luke we get the Lord's genealogy traced back to God Himself. It says, "of Adam, of God" (@Luke 3: 38) and that is a matter everybody should take account of.
Ques. Does it emphasise His deity?
J.T. Well, I would say that if you touch on that, it is in John. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God", @John 1: 1. That is the most pronounced statement you have of deity in the gospels.
J.S.E. Is there some importance that in these genealogies in Matthew we reach the thought of "David the king", and then the magi's question is, "Where is the king of the Jews that has been born?"
J.T. The word 'king' has a peculiar place in Matthew, and we, of course, have to pay attention to that as we proceed, but the peculiar thought as to deity is in John. It is not that it is omitted in any part of Scripture, in a certain sense, but the peculiar stress as to the deity of divine Persons, especially the deity of the Lord Jesus, is in the gospel of John.
Ques. Would you say the very idea of generation must be connected with manhood?
J.T. I would think so. The word 'generation' has a great place here, whereas it has not a great place
{101}
in John. The word is peculiar in its place, and I think we might just refer to Genesis for that word. It says in @Genesis 2: 4, "These are the histories" (or 'generations' as the footnote says) "of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens".
Ques. Would not Emmanuel convey the thought of God too?
J.T. Well, that is the truth, the word "Emmanuel" means "God with us", and, of course, it ought to come into our chapter.
Ques. I wondered why the name Emmanuel is just mentioned, but not developed in Matthew?
J.T. Well, that is enough, you know. When it was a matter of Scripture to support our liberty to address the Holy Spirit, some said, Well, it is only mentioned in the scripture in @Numbers 21, "Sing ye unto it"; but that is enough.
P.L. And would you say, by extension, the expression "I am with you all the days" conveys the thought of "God with us"?
J.T. Quite so -- "all the days". It is a remarkable thing that the Lord says that in Matthew, which is the assembly gospel. It does not say in Matthew that the Lord Jesus goes to heaven.
P.L. Is He thus pledged to stand by His assembly here?
J.T. That is the idea, exactly. He is here with us today, in Edinburgh. The Lord is here. "I am with you all the days", He says, "until the completion of the age". You might say, He has been with us every first day of the week; but the truth according to John is that He comes to us. In Matthew He says, "Behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", but in John He says, "I am coming to you".
It says, "All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and
{102}
from David until the carrying away of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations". So that Matthew is very specific as to these generations, and our minds must travel back to them.
Ques. Is there something distinctive in each?
J.T. I am sure there is. It is a question of bringing out the reality of the humanity of Christ. How real it is, and how accurate all is! Certain kings are omitted in this account, but then God is God, and He has a right to omit them if He wishes. If they are not worth mentioning, He has a right to disregard them, and so it is in Matthew.
P.L. So the great principle of sovereign selection operates from the beginning in this gospel?
J.T. Quite so. God is entitled to any selection He might be pleased to make, and we have to be subject to it. It is a great matter for sisters and brothers alike to learn to be subject. We might mention the matter about the sisters, because God is helping us as to the matter of subjection, and we are to be subject to the Scriptures in every detail, Infidelity, of course, would intrude itself, but we are to stand out, every one of us, as believers in the Lord Jesus, as faithful to Scripture. "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work", @2 Timothy 3: 16, 17.
P. L. Is the authority of Scripture peculiarly stressed from the beginning here, in verse 22, "Now, all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord", and later on we have the same expression, "which was spoken by the Lord", and then the prophets and what was spoken through them? Is there instruction for the
{103}
assembly in the emphasising of Old Testament scripture?
J.T. Quite so, and accuracy too in the quotation and interpretation of Scripture. The idea of "Thus saith the Lord" is very prominent in this chapter. At the same time there is the thought of righteousness attaching to Joseph. He was "a righteous man", which is a very important thing. We are told to "pursue righteousness ... with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", @2 Timothy 2: 22. I appeal to the brethren because I believe what we are saying now is of peculiar importance. Scripture should have its place, and we should be righteous, and we should call on the Lord out of a pure heart. It is not simply those who believe, but those who have pure hearts.
Ques. May I inquire why the carrying away to Babylon is particularly mentioned? You have mentioned the scripture in Timothy, as to calling on the Lord out of a pure heart, and I wondered whether that was a suggestion of the way back from Babylon to Christ. We have the setting up of things in David, and then the breakdown publicly, but the maintenance of God's thoughts in Christ. Does the passage you quoted from Timothy indicate morally the way back, and is that prophetically outlined in these generations?
J.T. That is very good, I would say. So many are not coming back, and we are trying to get them back. It ought to be the first thing with the brethren, to help persons back. It was said in the Lord's own day, that many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more (@John 6: 66).
H.F.N. Is this great matter of righteousness emphasised by the Lord's first utterance in the gospel, "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness", @Matthew 3: 15?
{104}
J.T. Just so. When John the baptist would have prohibited Him from being baptised, He said, "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". That is to say, He associates, in grace, John the baptist with Himself, which is a very precious thought, and we ought to learn from Him, however advanced we may be, or helped of God, to consider each other and identify others with ourselves.
Ques. Would not these verses show that a righteous man receives peculiar help from the Lord, for he was hindered from doing what was in his mind to do?
J.T. What about the question in Matthew of a righteous man, and the reward of a righteous man? (See @Matthew 10: 41). What is in your mind about that?
Rem. The peculiar interest of divine Persons seems to be seen in that he is followed up in his meditations and thoughts, and that they are put right in accordance with what God has done.
J.T. Quite so. I was thinking I would raise that question as to righteousness, as entering peculiarly into the gospel of Matthew, because we have to deal with history and facts. We have to bear witness, as it says, as they do in the courts in this world. We have the idea of two or three witnesses, and we have to do with that in assembly matters. All this is essential so that things may be followed through and the facts brought out and stated clearly. We need to see that things that are stated are so. It is said of the Lord Himself, that He did not say so-and-so, and we are apt to say things that are not so, and we ought to be very careful that we state the truth and the truth only.
Rem. In verse 18, which we read, it says, "she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit", and I wondered if that would not indicate the great place that the Holy Spirit would have in all that we
{105}
are to find out, and the conclusions that we are to arrive at.
J.T. Very good indeed. Joseph was established a righteous man, and of course, he is the kind of man that ought to attend the care meetings, so that the truth as to everything is brought out. Therefore I think righteousness has a peculiar place in Matthew, and this bears very much on what enters into our deliberations, and the things that come up for assembly judgment. Joseph was a man who could regulate his mind; he could follow up the truth and search things out, and so God honoured him. He had a wonderful distinction in becoming the reputed father of the Lord Jesus Christ.
G.M.S. It says, "while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him". Do we get the same in @Acts 10? When Peter pondered on the vision, the Spirit said certain things to him.
J.T. Very good. According to Luke, Mary thought on the things that were said to her, and it says that she pondered them in her heart.
J.S.E. Is it touching that an angel can speak so freely of the Holy Spirit to a man?
J.T. It is remarkable; but you may have something more in your mind?
J.S.E. I was just meditating on this precious setting, that an angel could speak to a man of what the Holy Spirit had done. I was wondering whether we ought not to be more at home in relation to what the Holy Spirit is saying, for it is intended to help us forward toward the end that God has in mind.
J.T. Then, what a place angels have! It says, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?" @Hebrews 1: 14. They are not above us; they
{106}
are not as great as men, but they are ministering spirits, and we can reckon upon them. It has to be remembered, too, that they were created long before men. That is an important thing too, to have in our minds, as to the idea of man, that man was not created as early as angels, but very much later, according to the actual facts of Scripture. Perhaps we are not conversant very much with the thought of man being a relatively recent creation, although it is very clear in the Scriptures.
H.F.N. Is righteousness the basis of manhood in relation to the assembly?
J.T. I think so. For instance, in chapter 18 we have "if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter ... it shall come to them". Man has a great place there. It is "two of you". It is not two angels, but "two of you", two men. I would like to hear what you think about that.
H.F.N. I think that is excellent. I suppose each of the gospels gives some distinctive feature of manhood in that way? In Luke, in relation to Simeon, it is "a man in Jerusalem", and you have often called our attention to the fact that John is the pattern in regard to spirituality, and so Matthew stresses the great thought of righteousness. Would that be right?
J.T. I think that is quite right. The subject of man is so important. The word is, "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus", @1 Timothy 2: 5. "The man Christ Jesus"; that is a great point made. We have had great encouragement in New York in considering the question of 'Man'. It is a prime question for every one of us, because we are all men, and God is stressing what manhood is. It is wonderful to think that Christ became a Man -- yea, that God Himself became a Man, because that is the truth. "He is the true God and eternal life", @1 John 5: 20.
{107}
H.F.N. We have all been following, with intense interest, how the subject of 'Man' has been developed in the readings in New York.
J.T. I am thankful to hear that, because I am sure it is important that we should all become familiar with the idea of man, especially in view of God Himself becoming Man in Christ. It is no less than that; the incarnation is the whole basis of all the Scriptures, and everything that is being said has man in view. God has been pleased to reserve the idea of this wonderful creature, and it is because the Son was in mind; the Lord Jesus became a Man. So in Mark He is immediately referred to as the Son of God, and then the Spirit of God goes back to John the baptist and so forth; but at first it is "Jesus Christ, Son of God". He is a divine Person.
W.S.S. What you are saying reminds us of the beginning of @Isaiah 32, "A king shall reign in righteousness ... And a man shall be as a hiding-place".
J.T. That was in my mind. I am thankful for what you say, because it bears on what we are talking about.
J.H-s. Is it significant that in this gospel, Pilate's wife says, "Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man"?
J.T. That just brings up the whole question of sisters, a matter that we have had before us for over a year now, so that they are here today in these three-day meetings. Pilate's wife has a great place, and it is remarkable that she should be mentioned at such a time and that she calls the Lord Jesus "that righteous man". Let the sisters therefore be very careful as to what they say about divine Persons, and that they speak rightly and reverently and holily about Them, and let them be sure that everything that is said about divine Persons is properly spoken.
{108}
W.C. Would the view in Matthew's gospel in regard of the bringing in of man be for the working out of moral questions, that is in Christ and the assembly, bringing in the woman?
J.T. That is good. I am glad you say that, because it comes into our care of the saints. Many cases of evil come up and have to be adjusted, and therefore the idea of righteousness is most important. It is an excellent thought; Pilate's wife can speak of the Lord Jesus as a righteous man, and she advises her husband not to have anything to do with Him.
M.A.W. Do the four women who are named in the genealogy bear on that? You have Thamar, Rahab, Ruth, and the wife of Urias.
J.T. I should think so. Although some were disreputable persons, you might say, yet God does not fail to bring them forward. Then see the place Rahab finds in the Scriptures, and she comes in here in Matthew. She tells the spies to return another way, and the magi are instructed to do the same thing here. It says, "they departed into their own country another way". They did not go back Herod's way. It is a great matter to have recourse to some other way, if it is a right way, and to defeat the devil in his movements.
Wm.H. Would there be any suggestion of following righteousness when it says that Joseph was a righteous man, but at the same time "unwilling to expose her publicly"?
J.T. I was thinking of that, and what a peculiarly righteous man he was, and how he defeated the enemy, notwithstanding the enemy's efforts.
A.H. Does @Isaiah 9 help with the development of this matter, especially in verses 6 and 7, where government, peace and righteousness are referred to? "and his name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of eternity, Prince of peace".
{109}
J.T. That is well worthy of being brought into our consideration, I am sure. Isaiah brings forward the Lord Jesus as "Father of eternity". We must not think that it is "the Father" that is in mind there. The name "Father of eternity", is really *Father of the age*. We must be careful not to say that it is the Father, because it is not; it is "Father of the age".
Ques. Have you something further to say in regard to the place that the Holy Spirit is given and emphasised by the angel, in regard to the change that was necessary as Joseph purposed in his heart to put Mary away secretly? He is told now that he is not to do it. I should like to have some help in regard to the way in which the truth is now brought forward as to the place the Holy Spirit has in relation to the great thought of the incarnation.
J.T. It is one of the things that God has specially brought up in recent times, and, of course, it is quite right to bring it in here, because the Spirit is so stressed and the place He had in such a secret and holy relation; it is *most holy*. That a divine Person should be thus in such a circumstance is marvellous, and that God should, as it were, allow this to be recorded in the holy page of Scripture, but it is true, nevertheless, and we all have to learn to read Scripture accordingly and let it have its full place and be holy in reading it; because we are to be holy, even as God is holy.
J.M. Would the words there, "before they came together", be intended to guard the miraculous conception of the Lord Jesus?
J.T. Just so. God does not hesitate to use these expressions, but they should be clothed, in our thoughts, with holiness, because we are so apt to let our minds run away with us in dealing with these holy things, whereas God has been pleased to condescend
{110}
to speak of them by His Spirit, and yet they refer to the Lord Jesus Himself.
G.M.S. Do these verses distinguish between *who* the Lord is in His Person and *that* which He is in manhood? It says, "that which is begotten".
J.T. Quite so, but the holiness of the whole scene is what should affect us peculiarly at this time. We should not overlook the meaning of these holy things as coming particularly into these first two chapters. It says that without holiness no one shall see the Lord (@Hebrews 12: 14). So let us not forget, if it be a question of persons coming into fellowship, we must have holiness.
A.C.S.P. Would you be free to say another word as to the three-fold reference to the angel appearing in a dream?
J.T. I suppose the time had not come for the great actions or activities of the Holy Spirit. The time had not come for that, but we have come to it, so that we do not count on dreams now. I do not. I never remember having any light from dreams; but we get light from the Holy Spirit. The blessed Spirit is here to give us light. You have something else in mind?
A.C.S.P. I was wondering whether it preceded what the Spirit may do today, particularly in connection with the reference earlier to the fact that Joseph pondered these things.
J.T. Well, just so. What I am saying, I am sure, is true, because we do not count on dreams now. I would not rely on them, but the Spirit of God is here to replace them. If therefore there is any question, let us speak to the Spirit. That raises the question as to speaking to the Spirit. It is mentioned, you might say, only in @Numbers 21, but every one of us at any time or at any minute can speak to the Holy Spirit.
{111}
If there are any not clear, they ought to be clear at once. We want the whole truth and nothing but the truth. We are to go in for it, and go in for it wholly. The Holy Spirit is a divine Person; there are the three Persons, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and the one name covers Them all. We cannot say that any angels hold that place at all; they are creatures, and ourselves too, we are creatures, but there are three divine Persons, and we must make much of every One of Them and give Them the place that Scripture gives Them.
T.T. In the book of Job, reference is made to God speaking in dreams, but now we have God speaking in Son, and further, the Holy Spirit speaking expressly.
J.T. That is just what we are saying. The Spirit is here and no one shall take His place. He is a divine Person.
A.H.G. Is man peculiarly fitted for receiving divine communications as having the Holy Spirit?
J.T. As having the Holy Spirit -- quite so. It is wonderful that we who are believers should have the Holy Spirit, and so the question is put by Paul immediately to some in a certain place in the Acts, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" @Acts 19: 2.
A.H.G. I thought it would amplify what you have said in regard to man, and the place that man has, he being now peculiarly capacitated to receive divine communications.
J.T. And that brings out what we have already said, that man is the most recent of all the creatures of God. It was said that God brought the creatures to Adam and he named them, and God let the names stand; but God brought the woman to Adam too, and Adam says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman". Then it is also said that Jehovah *built*
{112}
her. She was built a woman; that is to say, already she was a type of the assembly.
Ques. Mary kept this great matter a secret even from Joseph. Is that a commendable feature?
J.T. Well, I would say the Spirit of God had to do with that; it was not an accident. It was not left to Mary, and there is nothing here to be attached to her as wrong; she simply did not do it, but the Spirit of God took care of that. In the same sense the Spirit of God is taking care of wonderful things for ourselves.
Ques. Is she not signally marked out by being called "the virgin" in verse 23? She was particularly suitable for the great transaction that was involved. It says in @Isaiah 7: 14, "Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign; Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel". The note to "the" says it is the 'emphatic article'; so it is not an ordinary person, it is a person suitably selected.
J.T. Quite so, and that is confirmed here in @Matthew 1: "The virgin". It is the only one so designated.
Ques. Is the virgin feature to be developed in the assembly?
J.T. Quite so. "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11: 2. It is a word that has full cognizance in the Scriptures. You do not get Eve called a virgin; the word 'woman' is used. She is built.
J.S.E. Rebecca is the only woman in Genesis so named, is she not?
J.T. I think so, so far as I remember. It is a fine word, just as the word 'woman' is a fine word. The Lord uses that word as to the woman of Samaria; He credits her with being a woman. The word 'woman' has the same place relatively as the word 'man', although in @Genesis 1 the word 'man'
{113}
covers both man and woman; both Adam and Eve are covered by the word 'man'.
H.F.N. Does not the Lord say to Mary of Magdala in @John 20, "Woman, why dost thou weep"?
J.T. But He called her Mary afterwards, showing that He brought in the familiar thought, which is just what you might expect of the Lord in His grace with such a one as that.
Ques. Is it necessary to stress that Mary, the Lord's mother, remains a woman, that no deity attaches to her?
J.T. We do not want to mention names, but what do the Roman Catholics mean as to the word 'woman'? They say, 'Mary the mother of God', which is terrible blasphemy.
Rem. May I just remark how beautifully Scripture speaks of it: "Mary, the mother of Jesus". Is there not, in Scripture, sufficient to meet every wrong thought that has ever been introduced?
J.T. Just so. Of course, Luke helps us more fully. Luke is a peculiar gospel with regard to the precious vessel of the birth of the Lord Jesus. He speaks of Mary, the Lord's mother, and gives us her wonderful psalm that we should all remember. A typical Hannah is seen in Mary.
Rem. You have something to suggest further in regard to the second chapter, just to go over it before we close.
J.T. What is to be noticed is the use of the term "little child". It is not the same as in Luke, where the babe is mentioned. In Matthew it is the little child, and I think that the Spirit of God refers to what is somewhat more developed, and that has to come under consideration when young people are wishing to come into fellowship, because they are not babes. The case of Eutychus, in @Acts 20, whose age is not mentioned, but who is called a youth, and then a boy, would show that children have to be
{114}
taken care of in view of the fellowship. They should not be held up too long until they are brought into fellowship, because it is a question of the assembly.
P.L. So that it says, "Yea, have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?" @Matthew 21: 16. That is connected with the children in the temple?
J.T. Quite so. Pardon me for alluding to New York, but there we sometimes allow them into fellowship as young as ten. I think the brethren might do well to consider that some children develop quicker than others, and if they are fit to have part, the Spirit of God can actually use them. It is therefore time for us to recognise what is there.
P.L. They are saying something of their own, spiritually, are they not?
J.T. 'Something of their own'; I know that it is so; some of them do say something of their own.
Rem. So that it would be a question of judging the work of God, and not exactly the age.
J.T. That is just it; judging the work of God. Of course, a child is slow, no doubt, but some of them move more quickly than others, and I think we should respect that, because God is God, and we should respect what He does. We are speaking especially of the Spirit of God now, because He has been sent down from heaven and He looks after things in that sense.
M.A.W. The idea of reception seems stressed here. The expression "Take to thee the little child and his mother" is mentioned several times.
J.T. It would show the responsibility attaching to Joseph, as to how he should care for the child. It says, "the little child and his mother"; that is to say, the little child is more prominent than the mother. So with any little child among us we have to discern what the work of God may be and recognise it.
{115}
J.T.Jr. In chapter 18 the Lord takes the little child to Him, and in chapter 19 the disciples do not seem to be right about it because they rebuked those that brought the children.
J.T. Quite so; very good.
J.McK. Does the way the divine system comes into operation in this chapter give some encouragement as to the young being committed on the line of righteousness? I was thinking of the way the angel comes in so frequently in relation to the little child and his mother, as though heaven is equal to the matter once we are committed on this line.
J.T. Well, quite so. We can easily discern whether there is definite committal and whether the child has really a mind capable of being committed in itself to anything of God. The mind is given to the child, and our spirits are given to us, from God, not from our parents. A child does not get his spirit from his parents, he gets it from God, and, of course, we have to make allowance for what God does at any time.
A.R. Would that be illustrated in the Lord Himself, at twelve years of age, when He said, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?" @Luke 2: 49. He was fully committed.
J.T. Just so. I think He marks the way for us.
Ques. Are not some of our children damaged when they are very young through lack of this fatherly care?
J.T. Will you illustrate how they get damaged in their youth? You are stressing very young?
Rem. Yes. We ought to have the assembly outlook as regards the children in very early days, and seek to bring them into things, counting on God and His wonderful work.
Rem. So that in the book of Numbers, whilst you have maturity in view, you also have the idea of "a month old and upward".
{116}
J.T. Well, just so.
Ques. Would you look for them to learn, after they come in, more about the position we occupy? Sometimes they are held back because, it is said, they do not realise the position.
J.T. Just so. So that the Lord sets the example of the plural in that sense. He says to John the baptist, "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". The plural, we might say, includes young persons as well as older ones.
Ques. Had Paul got that in mind when he says: "The bread which we break"?
J.T. Quite so. "Is it not the communion of the body of the Christ?" is it not that?
W.C. In regard of the young ones, it says in @Psalm 128, "thy children like olive-plants round about thy table". Does that suggest children as taken up by the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so. They are round about the table of the parents, showing that the children are to be taken care of.
E.A.L. Would the fact that Herod slew all the boys who were in Bethlehem show how important this state of potential manhood is?
J.T. Quite so, and the terribleness of the suffering. Rachel's sufferings are referred to there and we must not forget that too. She is a sister. It says, "Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not".
A.M.W. We read in @John 6, "There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes". He would be in fellowship, would he not?
J.T. Well, I would think so. He was entrusted with them. He had some responsibility, and that would be an indication that it was time for fellowship.
{117}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (2)
@Matthew 3: 1 - 17; @Matthew 4: 1 - 25
J.T. I suppose we may regard it that Joseph was guided by the Spirit of God as to what he did in taking the little child and His mother into Nazareth. It says in verse 20, "take to thee the little child and its mother, and go into the land of Israel". But he feared to take Him into Judea, as it says, "he was afraid to go there". We may gather (and perhaps get instruction from it) that there was certain latitude given to him, which he took and which God approved. We may, in our time too, as occasion offers, take a certain latitude or liberty as it were, which God approves.
P.L. Does the possible danger, which the son of such a father as Herod (@Matthew 2: 22) constitutes, afford latitude for going carefully and in wisdom?
J.T. Quite so. The treasure was great and the risk was great, but nevertheless he evidently was under divine guidance, and the action was approved. What he did fulfilled the prophecy, as it says, "so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets" -notice "through the prophets", it is not simply one prophet but "through the prophets" -- "He shall be called a Nazaraean". So that there was evidently an approval of Joseph's action. I am mentioning this because God is God, and we must not think that He does not, as it were, regard things simply, to speak reverently, and allow people to act according to what is right obviously, or can be approved obviously, in ordinary circumstances or the like. What Joseph did was approved, the words 'so that', in verse 23, implying that. It was an important matter that the Lord Himself should be spoken of as a Nazaraean.
{118}
P.L. According to Luke, "they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth". So He was returning to His locality, was he not?
J.T. Just so. It is the idea of a locality, which has become very prominent in modern times amongst the brethren. The idea of a locality is in principle unfolded in the first epistle to the Corinthians.
T.T. He did not refuse to go; it says, "he was afraid". There was no will involved. That would be important.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Does not this idea of assembly latitude being allowed to assembly persons, or to the assembly, run through the gospel?
J.T. What you say is certainly well worth considering. I suppose you have in mind that the gospel of Matthew is the great gospel of the assembly, and therefore certain latitude may be taken.
Rem. I am thinking of how much the Lord would leave to us to do, giving us certain latitude in it.
J.T. For instance, you might think of going to Australia, and go, and God would be with you, and perhaps you had not thought of it earlier.
Wm.H. Would that lay the basis for what marks the assembly as intelligent persons?
J.T. Just so. "I speak as to intelligent persons; do *ye* judge what I say". The first epistle to the Corinthians leaves the way open for many such suggestions. For example, we have in chapter 7, "if the unbeliever go away, let them go away; a brother or a sister is not bound in such cases". That is to say, the Spirit of God would allow certain things; and so it is as to many cases in marital relations according to the first epistle. The question of marriage, of course, becomes exceedingly interesting in that sense, and serious, as to partners that we may select. At the same time God is wonderfully merciful, and comes down to us in certain conditions, and
{119}
honours what we may do. We know in the Old Testament that God honoured certain things in His servants, in different parts, as the brethren will remember.
G.M.S. It says, "The Lord preserved David whithersoever he went", @2 Samuel 8: 6.
J.T. Just so, and He told him at one time to go to a certain place, because He had given him certain advantage over the enemy.
P.L. So the word to Abraham, "And they said, So do as thou hast said", @Genesis 18: 5.
A.H.G. In this matter of latitude, have you in mind that this gospel leads up to the thought of sons moving in liberty?
J.T. So it is. The Lord says, in chapter 17, "Then are the sons free", and, of course, we can understand how the principle of sonship would therefore prevail in the gospel of Matthew and work out in the liberty of the assembly, in the worship of God. The worship of God properly begins, I believe, with the Lord's supper, and it is remarkable that in Matthew sonship is introduced. "Then are the sons free", the Lord says. But then He says to Peter, that he is to go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that came up, and take it for the Lord and himself. So that there is liberty given in those cases, which is a very important thing to have before us.
A.H. Had you in mind to say anything further about this matter of locality? I was wondering whether the first three verses of @Isaiah 53 might bear on it. What a delightful matter there was for God in that! It says, "he shall grow up before him as a tender sapling".
J.T. Quite so. "When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him". "He shall grow up before him as a tender sapling, and as a root out of dry ground". So that the Lord grows up into
{120}
His place. But there is liberty in the position which He occupies as before God.
W.C. In the matter of divine latitude, is it governed by divine instruction as in the case of Joseph? You said this morning that we do not get guidance in dreams, but by the Spirit. The note to the word 'instructed' in chapter 2, verses 12 and 22, indicates that it is an answer after consultation. In our case, is it a question of waiting on the Spirit?
J.T. Yes, but Joseph went down to Nazareth because he was afraid. He was governed by fear, perhaps right fear, but still he feared. The magi did not fear.
W.C. In addition to fear, it says he was "divinely instructed" in going to Nazareth.
J.T. There was certain latitude allowed, as we have said. At the same time the two cases are not alike, because the instruction is specific to Joseph, whereas it was not to the magi, but they did the right thing because they were wise men. The word means 'wise men'.
Ques. Would you illustrate what you have in your mind as to how the matter of latitude might be applied.
J.T. Well, just what we have been saying, that there is latitude, that God is God and He comes down to us at times, and, you might say, speaking reverently, He sometimes changes His mind. The same is true in the Old Testament.
P.L. Would the expression, "thy commandment is exceeding broad" (@Psalm 119: 96) allow for it?
J.T. Very good. That belongs to the Psalms, and the Psalms are exceeding broad because they are so extensive, and they correspond with the Pentateuch, referring to experience with God in things. The Psalms and the Pentateuch would agree together in that sense; there are five books in each, and the
{121}
experiences of the Psalms would correspond with the intelligence and authority of the books of Moses.
A.H.G. Does God, in that way, take account sympathetically of our feelings? I was thinking of Joseph being afraid to go there.
J.T. Just so. God is, as it were, implying that He agrees to it; He comes down to it. God is God, and we have to learn to increase in the knowledge of God, because He is God and He is full of love. God *is* love, and we must expect that He will act lovingly thus, as I was saying.
Ques. Does the word, "wisdom is justified of her children", bear upon the matter?
J.T. Quite so. The reference to the magi has that in mind. They were wise men; they were not governed by political fear of Herod. They went another way, and God approved it. They could have gone the way that was left to them, but they went another way. It was not very specific; God did not make it a specific thing, but they went the right way clearly. They might have taken the first way, but the other way was better.
E.A.L. Do we see that in Jonah? He was not right regarding this matter of latitude from the divine side. The Lord really changed His mind in regard of Nineveh, because of its repentance, but Jonah did not seem to be able to change. Jehovah did not destroy Nineveh; and it grieved Jonah that what he had prophesied did not come to pass.
J.T. God told Jonah how many people there were in the city -- "a hundred and twenty thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand". There was no mistake in what God was saying. Whatever Jonah might have thought, there was no mistake in what God said. He said there were so many persons in the city, and should He not change something to meet all that? I mean to say that God is God, and He takes His
{122}
own liberties, and so it was that He would save the Ninevites. The immensity of their number was in His mind, and Jonah should have thought of that.
H.F.N. In view of what you have said regarding latitude, how does it bear on the opening of 1 Corinthians? We have there, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth", and then, "all that in every place". How would the thought of latitude in our assembly relationships apply?
We are just taking up, at Bournemouth, the exercise as to whether we should work together with our brethren in Poole and Parkstone. We all recall the exercise that the saints passed through in regard of local responsibility, and now I was wondering whether the brethren joining up together in privileges and administration would come within the range of the latitude of which you speak. We have been two separate towns, although, of course, it is all one place. Now the exercise is as to whether we should not work together as our brethren have done on the Merseyside.
J.T. The question is whether you are merely aiming at unity, or is it the case that the facts regarding Bournemouth and Poole warrant it? Do you not think you should decide yourselves, in Bournemouth, what you should do in these local matters, without the matter being made a general question among the saints?
H.F.N. That is what we are doing.
J.T. I think that is quite right; and that is what we do in New York. We have five boroughs in New York and have no difficulty on that account, but in many other places they have not got such advantages. It is a question of the brethren being wise, like the magi, using the good wisdom that God gives them. "Wisdom is the principal thing", Proverbs says. We are called to be wise in these things, and I think that, in local matters, the brethren generally
{123}
should leave the matter to the local brethren, and the Lord will help them in due time as to what to do.
W.S.S. I think it might possibly help to say that in the exercises that we had in the Liverpool area, we were very much helped by Matthew's gospel, as that which accords us liberty to act in the best interests of the saints in the place. It says in chapter 17, "Then are the sons free".
J.T. I fully follow that, because I have known quite a little about that district, and I think the brethren generally agree to it, and leave it with you in the meetings concerned.
W.S.S. We find it has worked out exceedingly well, and I believe it might be an encouragement to others similarly placed, that we have this latitude to move in liberty, and the Lord comes in and supports us.
J.T. Quite so. In olden times there used to be much more difficulty about brethren and localities, and God has helped us to be patient with each other, and if we give time to it the right thing will be done. There was a case down in the south of England, and although the brethren there decided one thing, it was not approved fully, and I am not sure that it can be approved yet, because there is such a distance of countryside between the two localities. There is hardly the idea of a local position there, binding the two localities together. There are brethren here who know something about it.
Ques. Would it not be the way of wisdom to investigate as to what basis there is for two or more meetings to join up? There would have to be some basis, not just that it is thought to be a good idea.
J.T. Well, when you have two meetings, and five miles between the two, is there a basis for unifying the two meetings into one? I doubt it
{124}
very much. There is so much land between the meetings to which we have referred.
Rem. That is what I had in my mind, because some suggestions have been made as to merging where there hardly seems to be any working basis for it.
G.M.S. Chapter 4, verse 13, brings in the matter of locality. It says of the Lord Himself, "and having left Nazareth, he went and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the sea-side", and that fulfils another scripture.
J.T. Very good, and another thing that may be said about Nazareth and its position, is that it was higher up relatively. There would be better surroundings and a better neighbourhood physically, than the neighbourhood of the Sea of Tiberias. The position about the lake was not so healthy, or happy, or free as the position in Nazareth. So that the Lord, as it were, ignored His own comfort in going down toward the sea. We have to bear in mind that there are localities *and* localities, and the Sea of Tiberias, or Galilee, would be lower down, less comfortable, less healthy, than Nazareth.
J.P. We had this morning about Joseph being a *righteous* man; and now, at the end of chapter 3, the Lord uses the words, "for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". Everything in the assembly should be based on righteousness.
J.T. I would stress the word 'all' -- "all righteousness" -- which is a great matter in the things of God as to localities.
I think now we might proceed to chapter 4, to bring out the truth of the Lord's temptations, which, is the main thought that we should have before us at this time. We have the Lord Jesus Himself carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil, so that the temptation is very serious and real, and we have to examine each one
{125}
because there are three specific cases of temptation, but before them a period of forty days during which He was tempted. The first thing is, He "was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil", which is a most remarkable thing, that the Spirit of God should carry the Lord Jesus up into the wilderness. The Spirit did that, and then it says, "and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he hungered".
G.M.S. You were speaking of manhood this morning. Is it significant that the Lord's first quotation from the Scriptures here in this gospel is "Man shall not live by bread alone"?
J.T. Yes. Man is the word; not 'a Jew', but 'man'.
A.M. Would the mention of fasting imply that there was no reliance on nature's strength at this juncture? Are we to understand that in meeting the enemy?
J .T. Quite so. I think we should take up immediately this matter of the temptation by the devil, and the Lord being carried by the Spirit, for what the Spirit is doing now is a thing that enters into the present exercises of the brethren. He has been sent down here to do things, and He is doing them, and we should make room for Him.
J.T.Jr. Do you think that the Spirit might therefore lead us into any set of circumstances which might involve temptations, and the question is how we act in them, and what ability we have to meet what might be brought to us?
J.T. Well, now, the next thing would be whether we are always ready to overcome the temptation in the spirit of an overcomer, because that must be the case. The Lord was the overcomer in this whole paragraph. I do not know whether that was in your mind at all.
{126}
J.T.Jr. Yes. We have, to be guarded lest the circumstances which we might find ourselves in lead us to fleshly dealing with the thing instead of bringing in what would meet it in the power of the Spirit, the word of God.
J.T. The first one ought to be looked into. "Then Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil: and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he hungered. And the tempter coming up to him said, If thou be Son of God, speak, that these stones" -- you will remember that we are now dealing with the devil's own words in this particular verse -- "that these stones may become loaves of bread. But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth". That is to say, there is such a thing as the mind of God, and we have to consider that before we answer any temptation. It is a question of God's mouth and what He has said. Every one of us is to be subject to God. It is not the 'Jew', but it is just 'man', and what man should do or should not do. We should be governed by God's mouth, which is the most precious thing which we ever could be governed by.
P.L. Would that link on a little with the "loin girt about with truth" -- power in that sense, in the knowledge of God, to meet every exigency as it arises?
J.T. The loins suggest the feelings and affection that properly belong to a man, or a woman. He is pretty sure to be tested, but then he is to be girt about with truth. Truth is the great thing there "Having girt about your loins with truth", @Ephesians 6: 14. It is a question of the truth, and not simply the actual verbal truth, but the Spirit of truth.
Ques. Would the trade union matter that the brethren are at present facing have a bearing on
{127}
it; the loaves of bread, in contrast to what proceeds out of the mouth of God?
J.T. Very good. It is a question of circumstances. If the temptations are divided specifically, the first thing is a question of circumstances, a man's bread, as we call it, and his family's bread; what he can eat and what he can drink, what he has to feed himself and his family. The question of circumstances is the first thing to be brought out in these temptations, that "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth". We are to be governed by the mouth of God, and how precious it is to have the mouth of God open to us, to speak to us.
Rem. I was wondering about the verse in @Psalm 37. It says (verse 30) "The mouth of the righteous proffereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh judgment; the law of his God is in his heart; his goings shall not slide". Are we preserved as the law of our God is in our hearts?
J.T. I am sure if we looked into the Psalms we should all find wonderful facts that should govern our circumstances, because it is a question of experience. The first thing you get in the epistle to the Hebrews is almost entirely quotations from the Psalms. It is for each of us to look into the Psalms, as to what guidance we can get out of them.
Ques. Is there a moral suggestion in the fact that it says "Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit"? Is there a moral elevation about the wilderness journey of the saints, if it is in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Well, very likely. There is a certain position in the Acts where the apostle came through the upper districts. Well, what does that mean? There must be something bearing on heaven.
J.A.C. Referring to the Lord as overcomer, would you link that on with the word to Laodicea, "He
{128}
that overcomes, to him will I give to sit with me in my throne; as *I* also have overcome, and have sat down with my Father in his throne", @Revelation 3: 21?
J.T. Just so; so it is the overcomer that is stressed in those cases, in the book of Revelation. It is all overcoming. It is the test for every one of us, and the Lord is the model. Then the corresponding thought for us to consider is, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". That is to say, we have to understand what the Spirit says and compare it with what the Lord says, because it is a question of the government of the assembly here on earth in the book of Revelation.
A.B. Would the word that goes out of God's mouth suggest fresh communications brought in, in the way of guidance?
J.T. I would say that. It is not a stale matter; it is not simply the *Collected Writings*, but the freshness of the present ministry. That would be the idea; it is what is fresh. God is constantly giving fresh things for us.
J.A.C. Would you connect, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies", with "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God"?
J.T. Well, the Spirit is the Spirit of God, of course, but we have to be careful as to the actual divine Persons that are in question. I do not know just what you have in mind, though.
J.A.C. Linking on with the thought of what is said as to every word proceeding out of the mouth of God, would that be in line with the thought of the Spirit speaking expressly?
J.T. Well, in the latter passage it is definitely the Spirit; sometimes the expression "the Spirit" is used and not "the Spirit of God". I mean to say, the Spirit of God is the Spirit, but then God Himself
{129}
has also to be understood to be speaking under certain circumstances. We do not therefore always say it is the Spirit. It may be God Himself; that is to say, the whole three of the divine Persons may be involved in a matter, and They may all speak together, because They are always agreed, in that sense. On the other hand, we have the word, "One Spirit ... one Lord ... one God and Father of all". That is, we have to decide which divine Person is speaking. We have to decide that, because it is not always the Father, or the Son, or the Spirit; we have to decide who it is. That is a thing that tests us, as to which divine Person may be speaking.
J.H-s. You have in mind that the speaking is one?
J.T. Well, the speaking is one, only that we have to distinguish, for instance, between what the Father says and what God says as God. We have to be specific in what is said, because the divine Persons are three, the Father, the Son and the Spirit, and although the one name covers all three, at the same time we have to distinguish between each of the three, in any given circumstance.
J.H-s. I was wondering as to the question raised by the devil at this time, the tempter, "If thou be Son of God, speak". It is a question of what God says; what comes from God's mouth.
J.T. The Lord immediately goes on to that. He says, "Man shall not live by bread alone". The devil said, "Son of God". He was aiming at confusing the Lord, and it was a question of what God said, what was uttered by the mouth of God actually, and whether we can say that it is so.
G.M.S. Was the tempter insinuating here that sonship was connected with Deity, "If thou be Son of God, speak"?
J.T. Just so. He was, in a certain sense, saying that the Lord was Son of God, but in truth it was a
{130}
question of man, and the devil was confusing the whole matter. It was a question of man. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth".
T.T. On each occasion the Lord says, "It is written". What is the significance of that?
J.T. It is the authority of Scripture. It is said of the Lord, "Having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself", @Luke 24: 27. It is a question of the authority of Scripture.
A.R. Would the verse that John speaks to the young men help in this matter? He says, "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one", @1 John 2: 14. Overcoming by the word of God.
J.T. We have to go back to the three gradations of persons in John's epistle. First of all, you have the general term of children, "I write to you, children", and that is Christians generally. Then you have, "I write to you, fathers"; that is experienced men. And then, "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you". And then we have "Little children". These are the three gradations into which Christians are divided.
A.R. The young men evidently are overcoming the wicked one by the word of God, just as the Lord in the temptations referred to the word of God, to meet the enemy. Would that not be how we meet the enemy today?
J.T. Just so. At the same time I think we ought to make a little more of the whole subject, because we have to begin with children, which is a general thought, and then fathers, which are men of experience, and then young men, which are persons who are young, young in the truth and young in the
{131}
Spirit, and then finally there are little children. There are three gradations, besides the first general designation of "children". I think John's epistles ought to be carefully read and studied with a view to understanding how the truth is developed, especially the first epistle. The first epistle of John is a first-rate section, and ought to be carefully studied by the young people especially, because of the three gradations seen there.
{132}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (3)
@Matthew 5: 1 - 26, 48; @Matthew 8: 1 - 34
J.T. No doubt many will be aware that there are seven mountains spoken of in Matthew. This is the first one in chapter 5, and it is of consequence that it should be noted, because it gave the Lord the opportunity to elevate Himself in His ministry. So that it is said, "seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them". The position is thus very clear as to the Lord placing Himself where His disciples can receive His instruction, and it is to be noticed that "his disciples came to him". He did not ask them to conic; they just came, showing that the interest in Him was increasing, and now He is ready to teach them. There are certain blessings to be observed, in the chapter, nine in all. The thought is that, after we have considered the verses read in chapter 5, we should proceed with chapter 8, leaving out chapters 6 and 7 on account of lack of time. It is to be observed in the beginning of chapter 8 that the Lord is said to have come down. He is on the level of the earth, as it were; that is to say, lie is where He would be in touch with men. We thus observed, no doubt, that we have not yet properly come to the assembly, and we shall not come to it until we take up the later chapters.
V.C.L. You referred to the nine blessings; is there any link with the fact that nine times in the chapter later on the Lord says, "I say unto you", as over against all that has been said before? Is this the beginning of Christianity?
J.T. I suppose Christianity is anticipated. That is to say, the Lord was about to inaugurate it, and now, in this section in chapter 5, it is a question of
{133}
legislation, so that we may call it the legislative section, and we might call the mountain 'the mount of legislation'. There is the idea of blessing in the early part of it, and then the Lord asserting His authority in the words, "I say unto you". So it is said that the listeners were impressed with what He said, because He spoke with authority, not as the scribes, and, of course, it is a matter of great importance that there should be authoritative teaching of Scripture.
P.L. "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things", @2 Timothy 2: 7
J.T. Just so. That is what Paul said, reflecting the Lord's own way.
Ques. Would this be the law of the kingdom in the absence of the King?
J.T. I would say that. It is the law of the kingdom in a certain sense, although, of course, the assembly is more in mind than the law. Nevertheless, the Lord stressed the law of Moses, really, in this chapter when He says, "one iota or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all come to pass". We have thus to differentiate between the law of the kingdom and the law of Moses, and yet the law of Moses has to be fulfilled. We have to understand too, as we proceed, how it is to be fulfilled.
Ques. The Lord emphasises the characteristics of those that would have a part in the kingdom?
J.T. I think when we come to the kingdom and those who have part in it, we have to come to the principle of law. As it says, "I speak to those knowing law", @Romans 7: 1. That is to say, the Roman saints knew law, and so it is that in Christianity we know law. The law of Moses is not abrogated at all; it still stands, and every jot and tittle will be fulfilled, which is very important. There are no voids left in the ways of God; His thoughts remain intact; wherever they appear, they
{134}
remain intact. But then we have to remember the gospels are rightly called the gospels; they refer to Christ. It is the Lord Jesus, as it says in the beginning of this book, "unto the Christ". That is to say, the forty-two generations had to come in until the Christ. The whole long period had to come to pass "unto the Christ", and the Christ, of course, was born of Mary.
Wm.H. Does He then become law to us?
J.T. That is what I would say. He becomes law to us, because He is God, as it says in John's epistle, He is the "true God and eternal life". We have to begin with the idea of God, and then the added thought of eternal life, linking up the idea of life, which is so necessary for ourselves; that is to say, for men in this world.
Ques. Has Paul that in mind when he says, "Not as without law to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ", @1 Corinthians 9: 21?
J.T. That is right; "legitimately subject to Christ".
A.A.T. In verse 3 the kingdom of the heavens is spoken of. Is that different from the kingdom of God?
J.T. The "kingdom of the heavens" is a question of the law of heaven, here below, on the earth. The Lord says in chapter 6, "let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth". Then it says, "Give us today our needed bread, and forgive us our debts", and so forth. It runs on to the idea of the authority of Christ, in the sense of legitimate or legal authority. It is not simply the word 'legal', but what is according to the mind of God in a legal sense.
E.A.L. In that passage, "thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth", it is that everything that happens on the earth is governed by what comes from heaven.
{135}
J.T. It is a question of what comes from heaven, and the priority that heaven takes over the earth. Heaven must come first.
J.R. Was not that what Nebuchadnezzar had to arrive at, that "the heavens do rule", @Daniel 4: 26?
J.T. Quite so.
M.A.W. Would all that be involved in the righteousness which is to surpass the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees? 'A better righteousness', according to the footnote to verse 20 of chapter 5.
J.T. It says, "For I say unto you". It is one of the "I say's"; one of the Lord's deliberate assertions of authority. "I say unto you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens". That is to say, the scribes and Pharisees are out of it. The Lord is the supreme authority now in regard of the law. It was not what Moses said, but what He was saying. At the same time, what Moses said has its own place and the Lord would not allow one jot of it to pass away until all was fulfilled. The thought of God is that all His will must come to pass, and the Lord Jesus is the One to do it, as John would say, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand", @John 3: 35.
W.S.S. Is the thought that these principles are to be worked out first of all in the assembly?
J.T. I think that is just the thing, they are to be worked out in the assembly. That is to say, everything must, as it were, be put aside until the time of the assembly, and, of course, the time had not yet come. The Lord had to die and to rise again and go into heaven before these things could come to pass. But they must come to pass, and the idea is that they will come to pass in the assembly.
{136}
W.S.S. I was thinking that in the millennium this will be realised in the kingdom on the earth, but in the meantime the assembly is in the position where these things are worked out as under the rule of heaven.
J.T. Quite so. The idea in the creation according to the beginning of Genesis was that the earth must come into view, but that the heavens must come first. Genesis had its own place from Moses, but the assembly must come first; it must have precedence. We are now in the days of the assembly.
Ques. Do these sixteen verses emphasise also the thought of what is in the heavens, the reward in the heavens and the Father in the heavens? Would you say something as to those features marking the disciples, in view of what has been said about them coming out in the assembly.
J.T. The order of the truth is that it was the time of legislation, and these first sixteen verses of chapter 5 give the main thought. The Lord had gone up, according to the word, "seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them". Notice this, He sits down on the mountain and they come to Him, and having opened His mouth He taught. We have already had the thought of the mouth of God, but here it is the mouth of Christ. "Having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying ..." and the sayings are in the following verses. There are a number of blessings, nine of them altogether.
A.A. Is there any significance in the change of pronoun in verse 11, from the third person to the second? It says, "Blessed are they" until verse 11, and then it says, "Blessed are ye". Would the assembly be in view?
J.T. It is the disciples, and they anticipated the assembly. They are potentially the assembly, but,
{137}
of course, we have to remember what John writes, "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified". That is to say, the Spirit of God had not really come because Jesus was not yet glorified. Now, of course, He is glorified, but then He was not. The time of the Spirit had to be awaited, but the time of Christ was there, according to the verse in chapter 1, "unto the Christ". The Christ is presented as here now, in the passage we are dealing with, so that things are progressing; the ways of God are proceeding, and in due time room will be made for the assembly. It has often been said that the assembly is the main express train, so to say, and other things must give way, take side tracks, to let the assembly go through. But in the meantime other things were going through, and the Lord Jesus was causing them to go through in this wonderful gospel.
A.A. Is it that He has in view potential material for the assembly?
J.T. Quite so potential. The way for it is coming, but in our chapter the assembly has not come yet. We get it from chapter 13 onwards, and I hope that God will help us to look at the idea of the assembly in the proposed meetings in London. But here, in the verses we are now reading, the assembly has not actually come into action. We have to wait for the assembly, because we have to wait for the Spirit. Nothing can happen without Hint, and so, as the Lord said in a later gospel: "Do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high". We have to learn to wait for the power.
J.S.E. Would it help us if we were to lay hold of the fact that the legislation is here, and that it is the only legislation by which perfection is reached?
J.T. Just so. The word 'perfection' is used and that is why we read the one verse in the end of
{138}
chapter 5: "Be *ye* therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect". We have to weigh carefully those words, because we have the same idea in @Hebrews 11, "that they should not be made perfect without us". They have to wait for us before they are perfect, but on account of the Holy Spirit indwelling us we belong to those that are spoken of as perfect. The greatest possible fact at the present time is that we have the Holy Spirit.
Rem. In verse 16 He says, "Let your light thus shine before men, so that they may see your upright works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens". It would seem that that links on with the last verse you are referring to, "Be ye therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect".
J.T. We have to read it in the context, because the word *perfect* here has not exactly the same force as the word in @Hebrews 11. Perfection now refers to those who are indwelt by the Spirit of God; these are the only ones really perfect at the present time. Of course, people may say, are any of us perfect? -- but that is not the point, for the word 'perfect' has to be used in the abstract.
A.H. Why is the testimonial position in view here? I was thinking of verses 13 to 16 particularly, and the effect of the saints presence upon the earth.
J.T. We have to consider whether the Holy Spirit is here in testimony, or whether the Lord Himself is here as He was now in the passage we are considering. He is carrying on on His own lines; it is the Christ. It is not yet the Spirit, but the Christ. Now I just want to know what you have in mind as to the testimonial position.
A.H. I was thinking of what the Lord says, "ye are the salt of the earth ... *Ye* are the light of the world", and then "Let your light thus shine" so that the Father is glorified.
{139}
J.T. All that is wanting really of what the full thought of the assembly has in mind. We have not come to the full thought of the assembly yet, in Matthew. We have to wait for things; and the testimonial time will come in due course. The idea of perfection here is short of the full thought, and the reason is that we must have the Spirit before we can get the full thought.
W.C. What is the force of the passage in @1 Corinthians 2: 6, "we speak wisdom among the perfect"?
J.T. That is Christianity, involving the Spirit.
W.C. That supposes that what we are speaking about has been arrived at in principle.
J.T. Well, the assembly has not arrived yet in the chapter. The Lord has arrived, and He said, "I have a baptism to be baptised with, and how am I straitened until it shall have been accomplished!" @Luke 12: 50. The Lord had to do that, but He is speaking here anticipatively. He has to go to heaven and sit on the right hand of God before that can fully happen. He is there now.
H.F.N. Is the emphasis here on the Father as the standard of perfection just as God said to Abram, "Walk before my face, and be perfect"? Is it the Father as the divine standard whom we reach on moral lines?
J.T. Just so, but it is a question of what we understand by the Father. We have to see the way John presents the Father and the way Matthew presents Him. Matthew presents Him in a certain Jewish connection, and we have to be patient and see how it is worked out; we have to be patient till time is given to work things out. The Lord said, "how am I straitened", He had to lie three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. That is one great fact. But then He rose from the dead and remained on earth for forty days before He went
{140}
to heaven, and before He went to heaven the Spirit had not come. So we have to wait for things and see how they are worked out.
Ques. Does verse 17 suggest what was there personally in the Lord Jesus Himself, "but to fulfil"?
J.T. He says, "Think not that t am come to make void the law or the prophets; I am not come to make void, but to fulfil". That is to say, it is potential. The Lord is anticipating things, but He is saying them in His own way, which He has a right to do. He had become the Christ and was here on earth, and He had to wait to do certain things. He, Himself, had to die -- wonderful thing that always touches us, but at the same time He is doing things; it was a *doing* time. The gospels are all on that line, but particularly now Matthew. John is different, his gospel having a character all its own, and so he makes way for the Spirit, but then he says the Spirit was not yet, and the reason was, because Jesus was not yet glorified. So we have to wait for things. Things have not all come to pass at once: we have to wait for them and, in fact, we have to wait for Paul. The Lord intended to have Paul, but He waited for him, and He did have him.
J.T.Jr. Does the principle that things have to be waited for come out in the first chapter of Genesis? We begin with the first day and then there are six days one after another.
J.T. Very good. The seven days had to come round; and we must not forget to say that He made the stars, as well, so that nothing is omitted; only give time for it.
J.A.P. Are these 'blesseds' in the main the Lord's own character?
J.T. Well, they would be; but He is speaking of them as having an application to the disciples, because they came to Him. It was He who took the initiative, as it says: "But seeing the crowds, he
{141}
went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them". That is to say, they were there, and He utters all these blessings. It is a question of how these features come out in them, how that character is to be seen in them. Of course, in some sense they must have come out in the Lord, but it is a question of what has come out in the disciples. When we come to chapter 10, the Lord will help us more clearly to see these points, because there we have the apostles. As soon as we come to the apostolic time, then we get something. We have not got that yet; we have to wait for chapter 10.
Ques. Why does the Lord begin with, "Blessed are the poor in spirit"? Is that a kind of basic idea?
J.T. I should think so. But I am reminded of a passage in the Psalms, where the word 'poor' refers to the Lord Himself. In @Psalm 34:6, it says, "This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him". I think the Lord Himself graciously took this attitude, which is a remarkable thing.
Rem. I just thought that "poor in spirit" would form a kind of basis on which other things could be built up. Haughtiness of spirit is the contrast, and that is cultivated in us in the world, is it not?
J.T. I think it also brings out what was happening, in connection with these wonderful people. I use the word wonderful because they become the most wonderful men on the earth; the apostles. They are called disciples here. "His disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them", and then later on it says, "Blessed they who are persecuted on account of righteousness, for *theirs* is the kingdom of the heavens". That is to say, the saints come into persecution, and that has marked the history of Christianity from the very outset. It took on a peculiar character at the time of the Reformation, but now we have things easier. The
{142}
Lord says, "I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come". There is modification in our times, but in Luther's time there was peculiar and intense suffering, and, of course, at the beginning of Christianity too there was great suffering. Suffering, however, is the order of the day, as it says, "to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also", @Philippians 1: 29.
F.M. The Thessalonians experienced it in a very serious way, too, did they not? It says, "so that we ourselves make our boast in you in the assemblies of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations, which ye are sustaining; a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for the sake of which ye also suffer; if at least it is a righteous thing with God to render tribulation to those that trouble you, and to you that are troubled repose with us", @2 Thessalonians 1: 4 - 7.
J.T. Just so. God regards it as a question of righteousness. The Thessalonians were peculiarly cared for by the apostle. They were like his beloved children, and, in the second epistle, he specially speaks of that, and he says it was a righteous thing with God that they should rest with him; that is, with Paul; that they should rest with him in view of the persecutions they had to endure.
A.H.G. In what sense was the kingdom of the heavens theirs?
J.T. In the sense that the King was there, in the city of the great King; things were happening.
A.H.G. Would it involve that they had all the gain of the power that is connected with the kingdom of the heavens?
J.T. What I am endeavouring to say is that things were happening because the King was there.
{143}
Nathanael says, "Thou are the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel", and the question is, what is He doing? When the Lord was here, the kingdom was here in His Person, but the kingdom is here now because the Spirit is here; that is the difference. The Spirit being here involves the kingdom too, as well as when the Lord was here.
G.M.S. Does chapter 8 make manifest that the King is there? I have in mind these wonderful examples of divine power as manifested in the Lord here. There is not a situation but what He can meet; the King is there.
J.T. That is it. That is just what I am thinking. The King Himself was there, but the Holy Spirit had not yet come and His presence here would also involve the kingdom. No one will be in the assembly until he has the Spirit. So that there is an immense difference.
P.L. Do we have this suggested in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes? You have the expression, "The king's favour", @Proverbs 14: 35, and "the word of a king", @Ecclesiastes 8: 4, and many other references to Him, but all awaiting its filling out in substance in the virtuous woman.
J.T. Quite so. The woman of worth is there. Solomon said that he had found one man, but he had not found one woman. That is to say, we have to wait until the woman comes.
W.S.S. Do we not all need to realise much more fully the fact that the power of the kingdom is here today and that we are in it?
J.T. That is the point; that is just what I am trying to stress, that the power of the kingdom is here; it is here today in this hall. That is to say, the Spirit of God is in this hall actually amongst us and trying to help us, and *is* helping us.
W.S.S. I was thinking of it in relation to all the problems around, the difficulties which have to be
{144}
faced, the elements which are a menace to the position, and the fact that the position is impregnable.
J.T. So that the Spirit of God never fails us. He never fails the saints. There are the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit. The Spirit is graciously helping us, but the Son is the only One that could have died. The Son has died and is risen and gone into heaven; but the Holy Spirit has come down. The Lord Jesus has come down Himself; He was not sent down, but the Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven, and He is here now to do everything for us in the sense of the Paraclete. So that everything is attended to. There is not one thing missing if we only let Him act for us.
J.McK. Does the position that the Holy Spirit takes up in @Acts 2, sitting upon each of them, correspond somewhat with the position the Lord took upon the mount authoritatively?
J.T. I would think so. The Lord Himself says, "He shall give you another Comforter", and you might say He is equal with the first One.
J.McK. I was thinking that whilst we have things so beautifully set out in the Lord, we have to keep them there and wait for this moral power and authority in the assembly to fill them out.
J.T. Quite so. In the book of Acts, the Spirit of God is seen as acting of Himself; chapter 13, for example, shows that while God the Father was in heaven and the Lord Jesus had gone up into heaven, the Spirit had come down and He was acting of Himself.
We might as well proceed now with @Matthew 5, showing how it works out in the idea of perfection. These 'blesseds' are most precious because they are so diversified and they are anticipating, because the apostles themselves could hardly be said to be characterised by all these things. Even Peter himself
{145}
got out of the way; he denied the Lord, so that we have to see that the Spirit of God was awaited in all these matters, and He has now been sent down from heaven that everything should be cared for and nothing should be left unattended, and that the truth of the assembly should proceed steadily.
E.A.L. Would you say that, in an abstract sense, with the Lord's presence with them, they had the victory over the world?
J.T. Well, so far. You did not mean otherwise than what we have said, that some of them were very imperfect, as, for instance, Peter. What can we say about that, but be humbled about it?
E.A.L. Bearing in mind that they had the presence of the Lord there, and then as we have in John's epistle, "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God". And then we have, "And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth. For they that bear witness are three: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood". We have the cleansing power of the water, and the redemptive power of the blood, and while the Spirit is here now, the Lord's death must have come first, before the Spirit could bear witness.
J.T. Quite so. All that is most important. It comes to us almost every day, that the Spirit of God must be made way for; He will then do everything for us which is needed to be done. "He shall receive of mine", the Lord says, "and shall announce it to you".
Ques. Had you something to say about chapter 8, the Lord coming down from the mountain?
J.T. I thought it would open up the subject of the gospel, for the Lord Himself is acting in an evangelical sense. So the first thing is, "And behold, a leper came up to him and did him homage, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou art able to cleanse me. And
{146}
he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed". The Lord did that immediately. "And Jesus says to him, See thou tell no man, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses ordained, for a testimony to them". I think we can all see that Christianity has not come yet in this passage; we have to wait for it; and so the Lord says, "See thou tell no man, but go, shew thyself to the priest". The priest was one who had to do with God. That is the idea of a priest, as it was in the Old Testament times, and it was still there, and the Lord appealed to it and said there it was. He said, "I am not come to make void the law ... but to fulfil", and so it was that the priest was there. The law was still in vogue, and in power, and He was active, and therefore the man was healed. So you go on, in verse 5, "And when he had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, beseeching him, and saying, Lord, my servant lies paralytic in the house, suffering grievously. And Jesus says to him, I will come and heal him". Notice this, how quickly the Lord does things. It is an evangelical time and the Lord is doing it Himself; He has not the apostles even, to do it; He is doing it Himself. There are times in which He does things Himself, and He will do them at times if we let Him do them. "The word of a king is power".
V.C.L. Would not this, where the Lord acts as a model, underlie all that the apostles are able to take up and do in the Acts after the Spirit had come, and would all be in their minds as having seen the Lord do it and the way He did it?
J.T. Very good. Is it not wonderful that the Lord says, "he shall do greater than these, because I go to the Father". A wonderful thing! The Lord says, They shall do greater things even than I am doing. Now, I am careful in saying that. The Lord
{147}
was doing things Himself; there was no one else to do it but Himself, and He did it, He did not leave it undone.
E.A.L. Mr. Darby is very emphatic on that. He says this dispensation is greater.
J.T. Quite so, it is greater; it is going to pass away, but it is still what it ever was. It is the greatest of all dispensations and it is still active, and it is a question of each one of us being in it and doing what we can. It was said of one "What *she* could she has done". It is a question of doing what we can, because the Lord will accept it.
M.A.W. Is the Lord seeing a foreshadowing of this dispensation when He says, "Not even in Israel have I found so great faith"?
J.T. Chapter 8 is a great evangelical chapter; but it is the Lord Himself who is doing things. He is not even speaking of the disciples doing it. He is doing it Himself.
G.M.S. So the quotation from Isaiah, in verse 17, is "Himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases".
J.T. Quite so. You will remember that it says in Luke, "Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old". "He was beginning to be", and He was there ready as of age. He was a fully-developed man according to time. He was there, and "He was beginning to be about thirty years old".
G.M.S. Would you say more about "Jesus himself"?
J.T. Well, it is the consciousness of the Lord Himself; the consciousness in Himself, that He was there. It is wonderful that such expressions should be used, because He is God Himself, as we have already said, but now He is here in this gospel and in the other gospels, in a mediatorial sense, and He is doing things Himself.
{148}
A. M. Does the incident as to the centurion stress the importance of faith? Is He calling attention to faith?
J.T. I think the word *faith* is now coming into prominence, because it is a question of the dispensation that we are in anticipatively. It is a time of faith, and the Lord Himself says, "when the Son of man comes, shall he indeed find faith on the earth?", @Luke 18: 8. Well, He is hopeful of that clearly, in the time of the Son of man, but now it is the time of the Spirit. The Spirit is here as sent from heaven; it is the time of the Spirit, and He is promoting faith in the saints.
A.M. Apart from present active faith in the Lord Jesus, has the Spirit power to operate in us?
J.T. The Spirit is here to do that, but then you might well say the Lord is here too. "Behold, *I* am with you all the days", He says in @Matthew 28: 20. According to that passage, He has never left, but according to the book of Acts He has left. So that we just have to sec things as they are in Scripture and deal with them accordingly. But to proceed with the evangelical side of the chapter, it says, "the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not fit that thou shouldest enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant shall be healed. For *I* also am a man under authority". Now notice that, "For *I* also am a man under authority". The Lord was in that position too, which is a remarkable thing. "*I* also am a man under authority". It is not *in* authority, but *under* authority. The Roman centurion was under somebody else; he has a general over him. It is to bring out the thought that the Lord was under authority too; He was under God's authority. It was a mediatorial position. So that it says, "*I* also am a man under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he roes; and to another, Come, and he comes;
{149}
and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it. And when Jesus heard it, he wondered, and said to those who followed, Verily I say unto you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith". Well, that is remarkable; but you could hardly say anything of the kind as to Israel now. It is a question of the Spirit now; not the Lord's presence here now, but the Spirit of God is here, and things arc being done because of that. Then the Lord says in verse 13, "Go, and as thou hast believed, be it to thee. And his servant was healed in that hour". And then again, "when Jesus had come to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law laid down and in a fever; and he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose and served him". That is another beautiful indication of how things were being done at a particular time, and it is the Lord Himself who was doing it, and He made a servant of the woman. It says, "when Jesus had come to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law laid down and in a fever; and he touched her hand, and the fever left her". The Lord did it Himself, and then it says: "she rose and served him". Elsewhere it says she served *them*, but here it says "she served him", which is a fine thought in a sister. She served the Lord as having been healed of her fever. Fever is a very irritating thing, and causes much trouble in households, but the Lord healed her Himself. He does things Himself at times.
V.C.L. Does the Lord really cover the whole sphere of evangelical service; first in the leper and then a man and then a woman? Does that not really set the example for the whole scene of evangelical work?
J.T. That is right; very good. It is a good thing you came to the woman, because there is a very great absence of service of sisters in that respect.

READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (4)
@Matthew 10: 1 - 42; @Matthew 11: 20 - 30
J.T. What is to be considered here is the matter of apostleship, although the word *disciple* comes first. It says, "having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, so that they should cast them out, and heal every disease and every bodily weakness. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these". Then the apostles are clearly set out and Peter comes first, as it says, "first, Simon, who was called Peter".
A.A.T. Is the word 'first' in connection with his position amongst the disciples? That is, it is not exactly an order but the principal place he took?
J.T. Peter had the first place in the Lord's mind, in the apostleship, and it has been well attested that Peter has been honoured in that service. God had given him the leading place, and so here the word 'first' is used. "Having called to him his twelve disciples". They are called disciples, but it says, "he gave them power over unclean spirits, so that they should cast them out, and heal every disease and every bodily weakness". So that clearly the Lord's mission involves relief for mankind, relief from satanic power operating on man. Much could be said, of course, on that, and much has been said in ordinary writing as to 'Man' and why the Lord selected man for this service, and why they have power. Here they have peculiar power to relieve man.
Ques. Is there anything that would correspond to this in our day, the assembly day?
J.T. It would be a question of ability or the power that may show itself in brothers, as it has done and is doing. It is a question of divine sovereignty, that there should be power in man to relieve others. In due time Christ died and rose,
{151}
and remained on earth for forty days, and then, it says, He has "gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him". So that power is clearly in the hands of Christ, the Father having given all things to be in His hands. So that if there is power of this kind, that is manifestly useable to help others, we should recognise it.
J.M. In giving the twelve power, had the Lord in view an extension of His own gracious work as seen in verse 35 of the previous chapter?
J.T. That is what is in mind. It says there, "And Jesus went round all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom". We have already spoken of that this morning, but it is now in order that we should again refer to the kingdom and what it is in itself.
Ques. Are these twelve, apart from Judas, in the foundation of the assembly as mentioned in the epistle to the Ephesians, "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets"?
J.T. Just so. There is only one thing to be added to that, and that is to say, the Lord had them in hand, and in due time He brought in another and another; that is, Paul first and then Barnabas. So that there were additions, but in the book of Revelation the twelve are obviously in mind, in the foundations of the city, not Paul, but the twelve, Peter being the leading one. The question is whether we understand the full bearing of the power that is involved, because it is a question of power. Where is man to be, and where are all moral thoughts to be, unless there is something of this kind in the hands of one Man, and that one Man is Christ.
G.M.S. Are the apostles put in pairs here, each pair being connected by the word *and*?
J.T. That is the way it stands. "First, Simon, who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother";
{152}
then again, "James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, who was surnamed Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananaean, and Judas the Iscariote, who also delivered him up". Now the question is -- why they should be paired.
G.M.S. I was wondering if it would bear on the present exercise as to two brothers in a locality sharing the responsibility for the preaching of the Word.
J.T. I think that is good. The question is, however, whether it is assumed or whether there is any such thing as an appointment. I think the general idea is that persons are qualified; that is to say, God brings them forward on moral lines, not on official lines.
Rem. So that the first two pairs include the brother. That is not only to identify them, is it? I was thinking of Paul and his apostolic writings, how he includes another with him; for instance, in writing to the Corinthians, he says, "Paul, a called apostle ... and Sosthenes the brother". I wondered whether it was the brotherly element that came into evidence in the working out of the exercise of gift.
J.T. Very good. I think what is perhaps more important now for the moment, according to what we have just said, is that things are placed on moral lines at the present time. That is, a man comes up and we cannot give an account of it, but he can do things. He is used of God to convert a man or a woman. He is used of God; the thing happens, and another thing happens, and another happens, and we cannot but admit it and recognise that God is working. No matter who the person may be, it becomes evident that God is working. And so the late development of the truth in the house of God
{153}
began about 120 years ago, but how and why did it come about? Well, evidently God had begun to work in persons, and so there were men such as Mr. Darby, Mr. Bellett, and many others, and things were being done by them. It is a question of what a man is able to do, as the Lord Himself says, "What *she* could she has done". It is a question of what one is able to do. Then there were women too in the service, such as Phoebe and others. It pleases God to take the sisters up in the same sense, but then limiting them, which is another thing that has to be considered. I believe God will do something for us in that respect, as to sisters. Why should they always be sitting idle at a time like this, and no liberty inwardly to say anything? Perhaps God has something to say about it.
A.A. Paul uses a forceful word in writing to the Philippians as to the sisters who contended with him in the glad tidings.
J.T. Quite so. The footnote indicates that it might read 'Those women'; it is a feminine word. They assisted Paul in the glad tidings. So that we say we are here today, a goodly few brethren together, and the question is -- Are we doing anything? Is anything being done in the conversion of souls and the building up of the assembly, and is the service of God rightly understood and freely taken part in?
V.C.L. Would you say there is no such thing as a passive place in the assembly? All that is connected with the assembly must be active, even if in silence?
J.T. Well, we have been speaking of the women in Philippians and how they assisted Paul. They are women and they can do things, and God honours them. It is just a question of the evidence of the work of God; that is how everything is determined. It is not a question of persons assuming to do things
{154}
but the work being here to be done, and there are those marked by doing it.
P.L. Paul would know the power, would he not?
J.T. That is the very point he raises.
P.L. When he came to Corinth, it was "not it persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in God's power" @1 Corinthians 2: 4, 5.
Rem. I think the sisters would like a little help as to where that which you have referred to might be liberated by them.
J.T. I think we have women's names given that would help us. It is a question of whether there is interest enough in the sisters to take the thing up There have been sisters who were peculiarly supported of God in relation to the teaching. They were very quiet and sober, but what they said carried weight. The question now is whether sister: are taking things on themselves, on moral lines, and doing things because there is that which has to be done.
A.A. How are we to understand the passage "The Lord gives the word: great the host of the publishers", @Psalm 68: 11. I understand the word 'publishers' is feminine. Does it mean the though of the celebration of what is being spoken?
J.T. I would think the word 'publishing' would mean by word of mouth. You do not mean publishing in the sense of publishing books?
A.A. No, not at all. Publishing by word of mouth. Is it the thought of a celebration of victory in that sense?
J.T. Just so, because our mouths are to be used and our hands are to be used. There are other things we might say, but in this particular case, the sisters are clearly in mind. I think God would speak to all of us, and not simply to them, because the
{155}
amount of help and labour afforded by the sisters amongst us is somewhat defective.
A.H.G. Would the service of the sisters have its place in the houses that are mentioned here? It says in verses 12 and 13, "And as ye enter into a house salute it. And if the house indeed be worthy, let your peace come upon it".
J.T. It says, "As ye enter into a house salute it". That is to say, the servants of God, in the carrying forth of their mission, are bound to come into the houses. So that readings in houses, for the setting out of the word of God, are evidently in mind, and the sisters can provide for that. But the twelve, in entering on their service, would enter into houses, and they would receive from the sisters in the houses. That would raise the question of the bringing up of young children, which is another great service that clearly should be in the hands of sisters. We have been speaking of the age at which children may come into fellowship, and how the influence of the mothers is to be there, so that the children should come into the truth and not be carried away with novels and other things in the schools.
M.A.W. Would Lydia's house and herself fit into that? She was a person with power, for Luke says, "she constrained us", @Acts 16: 15.
J.T. Yes. She had constraining power.
A.B. You were referring to the enriching of the service of God, through the influence of the sisters. Would Martha and Mary, in @John 12, support that?
J.T. I think so. Earlier Martha had been cumbered with much serving, while Mary had sat at the Lord's feet, but in @John 12 they are both happily in the service.
H.F.N. In @Exodus 35 it says, "And every woman that was wise-hearted spun with her hands, and brought what she had spun: the blue, and the
{156}
purple, and the scarlet, and the byssus. And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun goats hair". Would that bear upon what you are saying?
J.T. I think it would. Exodus fits in largely; it begins with sisters, and what they do, and sisters have a great place in what you are referring to.
Ques. Would you say something as to what is committed to the twelve in these chapters?
J.T. "These twelve Jesus sent out when he had charged them, saying, Go not off into the way of the nations, and into a city of Samaritans enter ye not; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh". That is to say, it is a question of the kingdom of the heavens, and the service of it committed to these twelve men. That is the point now that should occupy us, this wonderful service, as indicated in this chapter, because in the revival that we have part in now, the question is whether we can apply these chapters literally, but the service goes on nevertheless. It goes on as it did at the beginning, only that there is the acknowledgement of a broken condition of things. It is a day of small things, but nevertheless the full idea is here. The assembly is here. It remains intact really and will in the eternal day appear, and appear according to the mind of God. The thing now is for each of us to do what he can, and carry on the work that comes to his hand, and do it as well as he can, and God will approve him, and increase his power. That, I believe, is the real position at the present time and should be in all our minds.
J.T.Jr. Is it not significant that the power here is in regard to what is physical? That is, it evidently alludes to what the human body is as having been affected, so that the power that is coming in is to affect the person physically.
{157}
J.T. So it is prescribed in @James 5: "Is any sick among you? let him call to him the elders of the assembly".
J.T.Jr. So that even at the present time this power can be arrived at in some way as in the scripture you alluded to in James.
J.T. That would indicate that there is something within the assembly to meet every condition. It is not only what comes down from heaven, but what is here all the time, in the presence of the Spirit of God.
A.A. Do you see an exemplification of this in @Acts 5, "so that they brought out the sick into the streets and put them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter, when he came, might overshadow some one of them. And the multitude also of the cities round about came together to Jerusalem, bringing sick persons and persons beset by unclean spirits, who were all healed".
J.T. That is all in full keeping with what we are saying, and the point that is being made is that the assembly is furnished with everything it needs. Although there is a broken condition, the Spirit of God remains here nevertheless; He has not withdrawn. The work of God proceeds therefore, and it is for us to do what we can. It is not that a person has an official place, but he is doing what he can. There used to be pretension that certain ones were evangelists and should be respected in that light, and furnished with all that they needed in that light, but I do not think the Lord has supported that. What the Lord is supporting is practicability, and each one doing what he can, and the Lord manifestly helping. The full thought is what God is doing. There can be no question if God is working, for there are signs of it.
A.C.S.P. Is that borne out in the verse in @Acts 14, where the apostles return? It says, "And having
{158}
arrived, and having brought together the assembly, they related to them all that God had done with them" (verse 27).
J.T. That is just it, and the assembly was recognised there. If the assembly is not recognised, God will not come in for the person who disregards it.
Ques. Have we not in the past limited this thought of power to the healing of moral diseases? Now I understand you are drawing attention to the fact that there is power for whatever is required in order to carry on the work of God, even to the healing of bodily infirmities.
J.T. So that if persons are ill, well, why are they ill; what is the explanation of it? May there not be some moral reason for it, and if there be some moral reason, let it be dealt with in that sense. At the same time, we must recognise always that the Holy Spirit is here, and He works according to what there is in relation to the assembly. The needs of the assembly are to be met and the Spirit of God is ever ready to meet them.
G.M.S. Would you say a word as to verse 20, "*Ye* are not the speakers, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you".
J.T. That shows that the Spirit is taking up the vessels; whatever vessels may be available, the Spirit is ready to take them up. The Spirit is the actual Worker. It says, "Ye are not the speakers, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you". The Spirit speaks in us; therefore it would be a question of making way for the Spirit in all these matters.
Rem. What you are saying is widening the sphere of possible service for all that have power.
J.T. I think it is. I think any of us who go around can see that there is remarkable evidence of the work of God, and brethren ought to be on the alert to take it on, and, if they have ability, to use it and implement it by spiritual application. We
{159}
have the *Collected Writings*, but then there are current writings too, and they should not be neglected. They should be used and read, and prayed about, so that there should be progress in the different assemblies.
A.B. Referring to the question of what is physical, the passage in James, which has been alluded to, refers to the "elders of the assembly". You were emphasising what is resident in the assembly as being of first importance in this matter?
J.T. James refers to what was at the beginning. He is not referring to the late work, what we call the revival of the truth. We are concerned now with the revival of the truth of the assembly; that is in mind, and God is working on those lines, and the main thought is to lead on to the truth of the assembly and what answers to the heart of God in worship. That is what is in mind.
J.M. Would you say that "the latter glory of this house" (@Haggai 2: 9) would enter into what is in your mind?
J.T. Just so. "The latter glory", I think, as regards ourselves, is the work that is going on now and has been going on for these past 120 years. It is "the latter glory of the house". Of course, the former glory is what the apostles set up in the early days, in Jerusalem, and then the work moved toward the West, first into Europe and then to America.
V.C.L. Would what the Spirit is doing now in the assembly help us to understand that it is not the thought of a remnant at all, but that whatever the Spirit attaches Himself to, even in a broken day, has a measure of completeness about it?
J.T. I think that is good. Although the word 'remnant' was much used in olden times, I do not think it is now. I think we are to have in mind the whole idea of the assembly, and that is available to us and we can see it. Those of us who move
{160}
about can see how it does work, and how brethren are coming to see things that had not been seen before, and not the least in this connection is the truth as to the blessed Spirit of God Himself. How much is made of Him that had not been made of Him!
J.P. How are we to understand the latter glory of the house being greater than the former?
J.T. I think it would be the sovereignty of God working out the truth into the millennium. We have not come to that yet, but the latter glory will be worked out in the millennium presently.
Ques. You would not expect the same power now in regard to gifts of healing and so forth, as was found at the beginning, would you?
J.T. I do not think so. There were sign gifts then, and that was the evidence of miraculous gifts, for God was working in order to promote the whole thought of the assembly, which is to come out eternally. The assembly is to be the greatest vessel and is to come out eternally. It is now being worked out patiently, but it is being worked out in its entirety; and if there are those who want to work at it, God will support them.
W.C. Would it help if we had before us the great end in @Ephesians 4 -- "the working in its measure of each one part"? Had you in mind that this constant service is that every member of the body should function?
J.T. That is the idea in Ephesians. Colossians does not go so far, nor does Philippians; Ephesians gives us the prime work of God, and the result is seen in the assembly, which is shown to us by itself in the book of Revelation.
Rem. The conditions that the Lord indicates in verse 16, as He sends them out, would be very testing to us unless we had a real sense of the support of the Lord in the service.
{161}
J.T. It is clear that what we are dealing with now is the primary work of God at the beginning. The Lord here is before us as working alone, but presently the Holy Spirit came down, and so (as we have had it already) John has to be added to the synoptic gospels, because room is made for the Spirit in a peculiar way in that gospel. The Spirit is made room for more in John in that sense, and so it is here, "Behold, *I* send you as sheep in the midst of wolves; be therefore prudent as the serpents, and guileless as the doves. But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to sanhedrims, and scourge you in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations. But when they deliver you up, be not careful how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given to you in that hour what ye shall speak. For ye are not the speakers, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you". That is to say, the blessed Holy Spirit is here and remains here until the fixed time when the assembly will be completed.
Rem. "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world", @1 John 4: 4.
J.T. Exactly. That is John's epistle.
A.H.G. Would you say why it is "the Spirit of your Father" in that connection?
J.T. Well, the Spirit had come into evidence because the Lord Jesus had become Man, and the Spirit began to operate, but at the same time it is said that "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified". As we are dealing with it here, Jesus is not glorified. He is just here on earth as a Man, but He is working Himself.
Ques. Would the verse in Galatians support what you say? "He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, is it on the principle of works of law, or of the report of faith?"
{162}
@Galatians 3: 5. I was thinking of the operations of God in that way as contributing to what you say.
J.T. The dispensation of faith has now started. It was not fully started, according to this chapter, but it has started now, and faith is the principle on which things are being done. We have come into faith, not sight, but faith. In fact, it goes so far as to say, in @Romans 14, "whatever is not of faith is sin" - a very solemn thing! We must keep faith in view, for it is the great principle of divine workmanship at the present time. The millennium will come in on the principle of sight, but we are waiting for that.
Now, in chapter 11, verse 20, we have, "Then began he to reproach the cities in which most of his works of power had taken place, because they had not repented". These works of power were miracles really; they were just miracles accomplished on the behalf of men, for healing them and the like, but only to bring out that God was here working with a view to eternity and in view of securing them for His own thoughts, in His service.
P.L. And that all that is insensible to that in these much-responsible cities could only go on to judgment?
J.T. Well, exactly. There was much going on in Jerusalem and in Judaea at that time, and such pretentious things. But the point is to bring out the reality of the work of God; what God was doing first and foremost for the benefit of men even physically, but really to bring out the divine thoughts in the assembly. This great family, this great organism, that God had in His thoughts eternally, is being formed now and we ourselves, our very selves, have part in it. When we have a meeting like this, I say God is manifestly in that, although it is without any pretensions and without anything to show, such as the systems have in what they are doing.
{163}
Wm.H. So that over against the rejection in the cities, there was that which was well-pleasing in the Father's sight in a new generation, suggested in the babes, coming into view, the product of the work of God.
J.T. Quite so. It is very remarkable how God seems to be helping the brethren; whatever comes up, the spirit of grace seems to prevail, and God shows His hand is with them. The Lord is with the brethren, and it is a question of our being with them. The word 'brethren' is a remarkable word, as we often speak of it, "Go to my brethren", what a word that is! "... and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". That thought in @John 20 is entering into all that God has been doing amongst us for many years.
E.A.L. Is the Lord, in His ministry in Matthew, laying the basis for the reception of the Holy Spirit? The first thing He commences His ministry with is, "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh". Then He reproaches these cities here because they had not repented. And then we have in Acts what the apostle says, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit", @Acts 2: 38.
J.T. That was the word at Jerusalem. "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For to you is the promise and to your children", @Acts 2: 38, 39. There is a promise attached to it. So that our chapter, as we proceed with it, will bring this out. "But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in judgment-day than for thee. At that time, Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father
{164}
..." That is a beautiful expression, and this is what I thought we might finish with. They are the Lord's own words. It is not 'your Father'. It is just 'Father'. "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. Yea, Father" (again, 'Father') "for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight. All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son but the Father, nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him". And then this wonderful word that we often quote, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light". It is a wonderful chapter, and these few verses, referring to the babes and the Lord's communication with the Father as to them, are one of the most wonderful passages in the gospel.
A.A. What is the force of this word, "Jesus answering said"? Does it suggest the response on the Lord's part in the intimacy of communion with His Father?
J.T. I think it would. You have a similar thought in the book of Revelation. In chapter 14, verse 13, we have, "Blessed the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit ..." The "Yea" is, so to say, an answer to a question. "Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours". These verses in Matthew are beautiful; the passage is one of the most precious in the gospel of Matthew.
J.T.Jr. Does He not refer to this again in the last chapter of Matthew, when He says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth". Is He not alluding to that in resurrection?
{165}
J.T. Quite so. That is the end of Matthew, and there is much in it in view of the work of that particular time. The disciples were to baptise to "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". There is only one name given to the three divine Persons.
J.M. Does Peter respond to the invitation "Come to me" in saying, "Lord, to whom shall we go?" The Lord becomes the centre here, but in the verse quoted from @John 6, Peter arrives at it in his own soul.
J.T. Quite so. "All things have been delivered to me by my Father", the Lord says, "and no one knows the Son but the Father, nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him". And then the "Come". "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest". These are the Lord's own words, so it is a spiritual appeal to any who are burdened. "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me". I think it is one of the most wonderful passages, as I said before, in the gospel of Matthew, if not the whole of Scripture. There is such a spiritual appeal, to any heart that is burdened, and how many are burdened! They do not speak of it often, but how many are burdened! The Lord's word here is, "Come to me, all ye who ... are burdened", and then how He meets it all!
M.A.W. Does it not go beyond the body now? It is "rest to your souls".
J.T. I think it does. I think it is a wonderfully blessed word, a spiritual word that is an appeal universally to any who are burdened. The answer to it is really Christianity, the presence of the Holy Spirit in the assembly.
{166}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (5)
@Matthew 12: 1 - 50
J.T. This incident of the Lord going through the cornfields evidently implies at least the thought of food, which is always an important thought. The Lord gives a lead here, and, although He does not pluck the corn, His disciples do. That is to say, He gives the lead, but the disciples take the liberty that He gives. "His disciples were hungry", it says, "and began to pluck the ears and to eat". That is to say, the Lord gave them liberty to do it, though He Himself did not do it. He set example before them, which we ought to be able to understand as we proceed, by the liberty of His own movements, and the brethren took liberty from it, and the Lord approved it. He justified it, although the enemy attacked it. We have constantly this sort of attack in connection with the ministry. This chapter is full of that which is needful to strengthen us in our service, and in our worship.
Ques. Does what the Lord brings forward in verse 3 show how He would support and approve of what they had done?
J.T. I think it would, and it would run into a general principle, that the Lord may do things; He may not be always specific; He may leave it with others whom He may fit to serve and develop the truth.
Rem. He says: "Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry".
J.T. David was a godly man, and he represents the idea of godly men, men to be trusted and to be allowed to do things. Heaven will commend them in due time, if they are right.
E.A.L. The Lord in this chapter not only endorses what David did but He also endorses John the
{167}
baptist's ministry, because He uses the same term, "offspring of vipers".
J.T. Terrible words, showing how severe words may be employed in ministry. Others may say, it is too severe; but is it too severe? Certain severe things have to be said at times, and we have to see why it is that they are said.
A.A. Does this illustrate the thought of latitude that you spoke of earlier in these meetings?
J.T. That is just the thought, and we are attempting to enlarge on it now in chapter 12.
J.A.P. Why does He do these things on the Sabbath? Was it that the Sabbath had ceased to yield anything for God under the old system?
J.T. The Sabbath had ceased to be what it was in the beginning of Genesis. It is now being, as it were, set aside by the Lord's ministry. We cannot commend it now; we cannot just speak of the Sabbath now in the ordinary sense of the word, especially in this country where they make so much of the Sabbath and of ordinary religious ceremonials.
Ques. Would this trustworthiness attach to these persons as having taken the yoke that the Lord refers to in the previous chapter? They had learnt from Him, and is it not working out now, in trustworthy persons to whom much liberty can be given under the Lord's direction?
J.T. Just so, and then the next thing is an attack by the Pharisees, but the Lord set a certain example and the disciples followed it. The Lord did not direct them to follow it, exactly, but they did, and the Lord approves it and justifies it, so that the word 'here' is inserted in verse 6: "I say unto you, that there is here what is greater than the temple". That is the great point that was to be brought out, the greatness and glory of Christ.
M.A.W. Do the opening words of the chapter, "At that time", stand over against the legality of the
{168}
sabbath and does it connect with verse, 25 of the previous chapter, "At that time, Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father"?
J.T. We noted yesterday this final section of chapter 11. What a moment it was and what words they were! "Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father". Think of that: "I praise thee" -- that the Son should be praising the Father: "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth". It is a question there of the communication between the Father and the Son, but this passage we are now considering is not just on the same level, but still it is to bring out another thing. That is to say, the Lord sets examples to His disciples and they follow them. He did not direct them to do it, but He gave them latitude to do it, and they did it, and then the Lord Himself defends them. The truth is brought out in the paragraph that the Lord had set down something which was in itself quite right and involved food, but He did not tell the disciples to do the same thing, although they did it, and He approved them and justified them. It is thus a question of the Lord setting the saints at liberty. We may be tied up in a country like this, or in America, by certain principles and practices and customs, whereas the Spirit of God would set us free from all that and give us liberty to do certain things that are right in themselves so that we might carry on the service of God, and the preaching of the gospel.
G.M.S. So that in the passage we have not only what David did, but twice over reference is made to those that were with him; and again in verse 5 it says, "the priests" in the plural.
J.T. So that the thought of latitude or liberty is particularly unfolded in this passage, and it is now a time of liberty. Here at this meeting in this city we are in the time of liberty, and it is for us to lay hold of the liberty and enjoy it and manifest it as
{169}
coming from God. Paul gives us the idea when he says, "Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore", @Galatians 5: 1.
W.S.S. Would there be a typical allusion to the Lord's Person in the corn; the Lord being the old corn of the land, the heavenly Man not appreciated by the Pharisees but appreciated by the disciples?
J.T. Very good. It is the idea of food of the highest quality.
W.S.S. And the Lord speaks of what is "greater" -- greater than Jonas, greater than Solomon, greater than the temple. What was greater was being missed by the Pharisees, and I wondered if the suggestion is that the disciples are persons who are apprehending what is greater in the Lord.
J.T. Quite so, and surely that is what is in our minds today as a goodly number of us are here together -- that we are more and more apprehending the greatness and glory of Christ. "*He* shall be great", it says, but then He *is* great. The Lord Jesus is the greatest of all; indeed, He is God Himself.
A.H. The Lord repeats the expression, "Have ye not read ... ?" Does our reading of the Scriptures and reading the ministry have a bearing on this matter of our acquiring liberty?
J.T. Just so. How much of the Scriptures do we read, especially in the morning reading with the children? Sometimes we are wanting in time, running off to our businesses and the like, but we should take time, because time was made by God. He inaugurated the seven days of time, from the first to the seventh day. That is to say, God is indicating that He is affording time for His people to go in for His things and to enjoy them, and to enjoy one another too, in a holy, righteous way.
J.P. I would like to ask in regard to verse 6, how much is involved in the word "what is greater
{170}
than the temple"? Does it include not only the Lord but what is there in the disciples?
J.T. Just so. It is not a question really, it is a statement of fact. That is to say, a certain thing is greater -- greater than the temple. The Lord is greater than the temple -- what is here; it is a neuter pronoun; it is what is here greater than the temple, what is in mind is the Lord Jesus Himself, and now we might say what is here, in the Spirit. It is not right to say the Spirit of God is on earth; the Spirit of God is here but He is *in the assembly*. That is important because we often do say that the Spirit is here on earth. Although in a certain sense He is, yet strictly, He is not on the earth, as I am or as any man on the earth is, but He is in the assembly. How many are there in the assembly? Only comparatively few. But all those who have the Spirit of God are in the assembly, and that is where things are.
E.A.L. You have helped us to see the Spirit is not characteristically an earth dweller.
J.T. That is right. The Spirit is characteristically in a vessel.
W.S.S. The Lord Jesus when here had no abiding place, but the Holy Spirit has an abiding place in the assembly.
G.M.S. In @1 Peter 1, speaking of the Holy Spirit, it says, "the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven". We often misquote it, saying, 'the Holy Spirit sent *down* from heaven'.
J.T. Quite so. "Sent from heaven" -- not 'sent down'. Although, of course, literally it is so, yet the word *down* should not be there. It is a moral matter; the Spirit of God is here on those lines and He is here in a vessel. The Lord Jesus was not here in a vessel like that; He was here Himself personally. According to the facts, He was literally here; first of all as a babe, then a boy, and then a man, as it
{171}
says in Luke, "Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old". He was not in a vessel; He was here as a Man; indeed He was the Vessel Himself of what was of God on the earth at that time.
J.M.R. Could you help us as to the scripture, "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty"? It says here that "the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath". Would that suggest that where there is subjection on our side, there is liberty, but not licence?
J.T. I would say that, fully.
J.S.E. Would this matter of the cornfield and the details underlying it illustrate what is said elsewhere, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free"? In our prayer this morning we distinguished between the truth as food and the truth by itself in its setting.
J.T. Quite so. Then as to food, the idea is constantly used, for the mind needs to be fed as well is the stomach, and we are dealing now with the mind. But then we go further than that and we think of the heart and the affections. We are hoping that the dear sisters who are here will be taking all this in, because the Lord will probably be raising some questions presently as to how matters are in the assembly, and what place sisters have in it; what their place may be and what their duties may be. The question of the heart thus comes up, and the mind, and the affections, and the idea of food enters into it, just as we have it here.
V.C.L. In connection with the truth and purity, would you say a word as to the necessity of putting Mr. Darby's translation into the hands of the children from the outset that they might have the best from the start.
J.T. I would think that is right. We have now come to it that we should read this translation, and
{172}
that the ordinary King James translation (as it is called) is not accurate enough for public readings and for our own reading of the word of God. I think it is quite in order, and good too, that the children should be brought up, so to speak, on the Darby Translation, in the sense of being fed in their minds by the Scriptures. It is almost universally read now, as far as I know, especially in America, and I suppose it is so here. We hardly ever read the King James translation in our public readings.
H.B. In connection with the public preaching of the word, what should be read?
J.T. I would think it is a question of any brother taking liberty according to what he has found out in his experience with God. If we are preaching the gospel, and if there is an audience of many outside people, it might be well to say that the King James version is not exactly accurate in every case, whereas the Darby Translation, which is now well known among Christians in the world, is more accurate. It is wise to read what is best, and what is best is the New Translation revised by Mr. Darby. I would say that is the way the thing should be taken up.
J.S.E. The father would allow nothing but the best robe for the son. Should we not be helped in allowing for nothing but the best in the translation of the Scriptures?
J.T. I would say that is very good. Now in the next paragraph; that is, from verse 9, the first thing to be considered is the relative value of a man. "How much better then is a man than a sheep!" So we have now to begin to see the value of a man. Anyone who knows might say, There are so many millions on the earth; and yet the question of value arises and we have to consider it particularly as thinking of what God may make out of him. Someone has said the best study of man is man.
{173}
G.M.S. The full quotation, if I remember, is: 'Know then thyself; presume not God to scan; the proper study of mankind is man'.
J.T. I am thankful to get that. I just call it to mind and thought it was a good remark, although, of course, it is not Scripture.
A.H.G. Would the title "Son of man" mentioned in the end of the previous section bear on this matter?
J.T. The word 'man' in itself is not equal to the word 'Son of man'. There is only one Son of man in the whole universe in that sense; and that is the Lord Jesus. He is the Son of man. It says in @1 Timothy 2: 5, "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus". He is the only Man to be thought of now in this setting.
H.F.N. Does the passage in @Psalm 8 put the distinction between 'man' and 'Son of man' in its right setting? "What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?"
J.T. I think the Son of man in that Psalm would refer really to Christ, to the Messiah.
H.F.N. I thought it confirmed what you were saying. The first word, 'man', according to the note is 'mortal man', and the second, "the son of man", is a different word, bringing out the unique and glorious distinction that belonged to the Lord.
J.T. Then again, in the first book of Psalms, we get the verse, "This afflicted one called". That is also the Messiah, that is Christ, showing how the Lord humbled Himself in His circumstances down here.
Wm.H. Is this expression, "How much better then is a man than a sheep!" referring to men generally, so that they might be relieved of every disability and available for the service of God?
J.T. Quite so. "How much better then", that is to say it is a conclusion reached, "is a man than
{174}
a sheep!" So that if we think of mere literal values according to man, we might say that men are not much worth and the cattle we have are of more worth; certain persons might so think, but the real thought is to bring out the idea of man; that person, that being, as we get it in @Genesis 1: "Let us make man in our image", and then the word is immediately, "let them have dominion". It includes the female too, and that is how the Spirit of God brings the matter in in Genesis.
T.T-s. The term "Son of man" is used frequently in Ezekiel. What is the significance of it there?
J.T. It is just the foreshadowing of the Lord's birth, His coming to earth. It is the position in the Psalms. We might well and profitably think of the use of the word 'man', and the recency of his creation. He is created, according to @Genesis 1; God made him in His own image after His likeness, and according to that his creation is recent. But then the idea of birth is the next thing to think of; and so the new birth, too, is also to be thought of: "How can a man be born being old?" Nicodemus says, but the Lord says, "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God".
W.C. Is there something in the references in @Job 7? Job says "What is man?" I think he is the first one to ask that question, and he speaks there of God as "thou Observer of men". Does that suggest the deep interest of God in man and his reactions to His discipline and ways?
J.T. Quite so. "Thou Observer of men" would refer to the way man is thought of. God does that; He takes account of what men are doing, and so forth. That is, he is to be considered, and God is doing it, and the next thing is, what God would make out of him, and I would think then it is a
{175}
question of the new birth. "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God". It is the new birth, really, of man. The Lord had no confidence in any of them, at first, according to the end of the second chapter of John's gospel, but then chapter 3 begins, "But there was a man ... his name Nicodemus", and then the Lord deals with him. Nicodemus says, "How can a man be born being old?" and so forth, but the real thing now is the birth -- the new birth. It is a question of what man is as born anew. So that this verse, "How much better then is a man than a sheep!" covers all that.
J.T.Jr. Would @Isaiah 45: 11 - 13, help? "Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me. It is I that have made the earth, and created man upon it; it is I, my hands, that have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. It is I that have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith Jehovah of hosts".
J.T. It is a question for interpretation as to the use of the word 'man' there and how it may work out. The great thought of man comes into mind, as we have been saying and as we are now thinking of it: "How much better then is a man than a sheep!" But then if we speak of the Lord Jesus, He is not spoken of in that way, for He is the Son of man.
R.McK. Is the enemy attacking this great thought of man? Verse 14 says the Pharisees took counsel together that they might destroy Him, following the healing of this man.
J.T. Quite so. The devil was aiming at Him. Thank God He has overcome the devil! He has gained the victory.
{176}
Ques. Would the exclamation in this sentence indicate that divine feelings and affections enter into this estimate of man?
J.T. Quite so. You do not get such feelings in the lower animals. These were all brought to Adam, and whatever Adam called them, God left the names. But now when we come to the idea of man in Christ, we are on the highest possible level, and then as to man literally he is capable of feelings and affections, although without new birth there can be no moral value at all.
Ques. Does this section lead up to the unique place that Christ had, as Isaiah says, "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight"? Is the fulness of everything set out in Christ personally?
J.T. That is what I would say. So that we are entitled to bring in the idea of better; as it says here, "How much better ..." But then you cannot think of that as applying to Christ. You cannot use the word 'better' as applying to Him.
V.C.L. Would it be right to say that one of the distinctions of man after the order of the Lord Jesus is that the Spirit of God has come upon us? Is that not the greatest elevation that man could be given?
J.T. Quite so. The Spirit came on Christ Himself.
M.A.W. Would the full thought of God's pleasure in man be seen in @Revelation 21, "The tabernacle of God is with men"?
J.T. It is in the plural, "with men". That is to say, it is over against the Jewish position and the claims that they make; it is a question of men.
Ques. Is there some special significance in the mention of the nations twice in the latter part of the paragraph, showing that God was going outside what was national, in the Jew? "He shall show forth judgment to the nations", and "on his name shall
{177}
the nations hope". Does it show that mankind was in view altogether?
J.T. That is what I think, and in @Revelation 21 the same thing would be true, "the tabernacle of God is with men". It is not with the Jews any more, it is *with men*. That is really what we have here today in our looking into the Scriptures, for in a certain sense the tabernacle of God is with us here in the presence of the Spirit of God. It is with men, with ourselves really, and that, of course, leads up to the thought of the assembly.
Ques. What is the point of the withered hand here? It seems to be a matter of making the man sound.
J.T. Would it not be to make him useful and able to do things? Is that not to bring out the true thought in the way of mending or repair?
Rem. If man is to be serviceable to God, he must be made sound.
J.T. That is the idea, and spiritually the brethren must be made sound, but first of all they must be born anew. Then the next thing is that they get to know redemption, and then they get the Spirit. That is the whole idea, the thought of man, is man possessed by the Spirit of God, and every true believer is to be regarded in this dignified light, that he has the Spirit of God. The first question asked by Paul to some was, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" and they did not know about Him. The question is whether we all know about Him, and the great thought of His indwelling.
A.B. In regard of the man's hand being healed, would it have in mind that men should *lift up* holy hands?
J.T. Quite so. It says that in 1 Timothy.
H.F.N. In view of what you have been saying in regard to the Spirit, would you kindly say a word
{178}
on the four references to the Spirit in this chapter. In verse 18, "I will put my Spirit upon him"; in verse 28, "But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you". Then in verse 31, "speaking injuriously of the Spirit", and finally in verse 32, "whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit".
J.T. Well, of course it is very much in the chapter. The possession or reception of the Spirit of God is a great thing in relation to Christianity, according to what we have just been saying. The apostle says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" and they did not know about it. Well now, the question is, Are there any here in this hall who have not received the Spirit? It is a question for them to ask themselves. We want to be honest, and to acknowledge the truth as to it. If we have not received the Spirit we are not Christians in the full sense.
H.F.N. I think that is one of the most important questions that can be raised. I can only say in my own experience I was breaking bread for eight years before I had received the Spirit.
J.T. I am thankful you say that, because perhaps many a young person here would like to know how we get the Spirit. Maybe you can tell us from your own experience, how you actually received the, Spirit.
H.F.N. You have often reminded us, that there comes a moment when we ask the Father for the Holy Spirit.
J.T. "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" The Father has to be asked; the Spirit may be definitely asked for.
H.M. Where is a believer positionally who has not the Spirit?
{179}
J.T. He is not in the assembly; that is one thing to begin with. He is not in the assembly, and he has probably not peace in his soul if he has not the Spirit. The fact that he is troubled with spiritual troubles and moral troubles is because he does not know the possession of the Spirit.
H.M. That helps, but I was thinking of the stress you have made in these meetings as to some believers not being in the assembly. Many are not clear as to that, and I was wondering where such an one was positionally.
J.T. The best and most sensible way to put that is in the negative. If he has not the Spirit he is not in the assembly anyway. We have reached a good point when we put it in the negative in that sense.
J.S.E. Is this not raising the whole matter with us as to whether our major concern really is what is proper to the assembly?
J.T. Very good.
E, A. L. In @Romans 8, it says, "But *ye* are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not the Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him". Then it adds, "But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among the dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you". We have had the truth established that it is the Spirit who does the quickening of the mortal body and it is therefore a great challenge to us, if we have not the Spirit, where we should be if the Lord should come.
J.T. Yes. That is a matter to be taken up by persons who preach the gospel, or any persons, for that matter. If there is any indication that persons have not the Spirit, tell them about it and ask them about it. Why is it you have not got the Spirit? Why is it you are not free in the service among the
{180}
brethren? @Romans 8 is a most helpful chapter in this matter, because it is intended to bring believers into deliverance and into spiritual power, so that they may serve God; that they may pray and give thanks to Him for the things they are brought into.
A.H. Would what you are remarking link in any way with verses 43 and 44, or would that be going too far? It seems a dangerous position for a house to be unoccupied.
J.T. It reads, "But when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and does not find it. Then he says, I will return to my house whence I came out; and having come, he finds it unoccupied, swept, and adorned. Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also". I would say in answer to all that, that we are dealing now with what is coming in, and which is almost imminent, and that is the great apostasy in Christendom. It is a terrible thing to think of. We are almost coming to it, the devil is going to take the place of the truth of Christianity, the truth of Christ and the Spirit. It is just open apostasy, and we are nearing it now. I do not know anything more solemn and more dreadful to think of, than the imminence of the great apostasy.
A.H. Is the great bulwark against that the Holy Spirit in my soul?
J.T. Just so, and the presence of the Spirit, in whatever there may be in a collective way, in the sense of the assembly.
J.A.C. Is that what Jude has in mind when be speaks of these "who set themselves apart, natural men, not having the Spirit"?
{181}
J.T. Just so. That is just the passage that applies; "natural men, not having the Spirit".
J.A.C. But the antidote to that, "But *ye*, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life", @Jude 20.
J.T. That is an excellent passage. Thank God for it, and that it is brought in at this time.
Ques. Has not the preacher of the gospel a responsibility to bring in this thought of the Spirit? The brethren also who interview those who wish to break bread, have they not a responsibility to discern if persons have the Spirit, knowing that without the Spirit they are quite incapable of taking up the assembly position?
J.T. Quite so. See that they have the Spirit. The *second* reference in @John 3 should be brought in now; the first is, "Except any one be born anew", and then the second is, "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God". Certain brethren use the expression 'B.A.' as applying to persons who are born again. That is what they mean, born again, but that does not mean that the person is actually indwelt by the Spirit. They are entirely wrong on those points, for a person may be born again and not have the Spirit. Would you say that?
Rem. Fully, and holding that error you could hardly look for the development of the assembly.
J.T. Quite so. They do not know it. Not that we want to traduce our brethren, if they are our brethren, but they do not know the idea of an indwelling Spirit, God dwelling in us of a truth.
A.R. Would what Peter says in @Acts 2 help? When they say, "What shall we do, brethren?". Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission
{182}
of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit". He includes the gift of the Holy Spirit in his message as he is preaching.
J.T. That is not included in what I was speaking about as to certain brethren. When they say 'B.A.' they mean just born again. They have not received the Spirit. They do not fully understand it, or teach it really in their meetings. Not that I wish to speak of these dear brethren, because some of them are really Christians, only we ought to be on our guard about it. We have the truth and are enjoying it at these three-day meetings and the like, and we should see to it and be sure that each one of us has the Spirit and that he is of the assembly.
A.B. Is it important too that as having the Spirit we do not grieve Him?
J.T. Quite. "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God", @Ephesians 4: 30.
{183}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (6)
@Matthew 13: 1 - 58
J.T. Before we come on to this chapter, which may be rightly called a parabolic chapter, there is just one word to say about the end of chapter 12. It seems that there is a slight reflection on Mary, the Lord's mother there, and it may be as well for us to face it and inquire why it should be. The same thing appears in @John 2 where the Lord's mother refers to Him as if she were directing Him to do something and complaining as to things not being done. It is only a question now of whether it is seemly for us to refer to it, but I think it is, and needful too, because she is perhaps unduly thought of and exalted. Although she is a wonderful person, she is not a divine Person; she is just a creature, and the Lord is pleased to make certain reflections, and it is a question for us to inquire why that should be. We should be guarded too, ourselves, lest any of us should fall into the same error of exalting ourselves at the expense of Christ or of divine things. In John's gospel she undertakes to say to the Lord, "They have no wine", as if the Lord did not know, and that gives rise to a right inquiry as to why a person such as Mary, great though she was, should, in any way, indicate a reflection on the Lord, because there can be no reflection in any degree at all on any action or doing of Christ.
Ques. Is it not a remarkable thing the way the enemy has seized on this, and established the idea in the great Romish system, that Mary is greater than the Lord?
J.T. Just so. That is just the very thought that is in mind, lest any of us should in any way fall into that error.
{184}
E.A.L. The Lord seemed to cover that Himself earlier in our book, where He said, "Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve". He was careful to bring that in at that time.
J.T. That was in answer to the devil, and, of course, what we are saying about Mary has not to be compared with him in any sense. But at the same time what has just been said is quite right. It is here in Matthew, and it is also in John. In @John 2 it was a marriage time, and Jesus was invited to the marriage and so was Mary, and Mary undertook to say to Him, "They have no wine", and the Lord answered immediately, "What have I to do with thee, woman?". It would be a very humbling thing that the Lord should say that to her, but still it was needed as a correction, because women are apt to say things like that; not that one would speak of women very much in that sense, but they should be on their guard not to allow themselves to say anything derogatory in any way to divine things, or about divine Persons, or even about the brethren.
J.T.Jr. It says of Levi according to @Deuteronomy 33: "Who said to his father and his mother, I see him not, and he acknowledged not his brethren". Is that the principle the Lord is setting out here? The natural side is to be rightly in its place so that it may make no intrusion on the levitical service.
J.T. I am sure it is quite apposite at the present time to bring all this up, especially as to Levi, but above all as to the Lord, and as to Mary His mother after the flesh.
J.S.E. Does all this come forward to assist us in our regard for the Lord as to who He is in Himself, and is it not significant that He is never presented to us as actually addressing Mary as mother?
J.T. Well, the Lord is not quoted as saying anything to her directly; others have said something of
{185}
her, that His mother and His brethren waited outside to see Him, but the Lord, as you quite rightly say, never called her mother. Still He inferred that she was His mother, in a sense, and so we are right enough in thinking that He did regard her as His mother, and indeed the angels said wonderful things about her in Luke.
G.M.S. Are not the two sections of Christendom exposed in verse 55 of chapter 13? One section says He is the carpenter's son; the other says He is Mary's son.
J.T. Yes, quite so. In Luke, she is beautifully subject: "Behold the bondmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word". It is right to bring out the position of Mary and how subject and simple she is, in that sense, according to Luke.
P.L. Does the new generation to which the Lord refers in verses 49 and 50 warrant the parabolical ministry of chapter 13, and is that ministry on the one hand to confirm what is genuine, and, on the other hand, to baffle imitation?
J.T. To confirm what is genuine and to baffle imitation -- I would say that is just the truth.
Ques. Do you think that this matter is intensified in that there were several of them in it? It says, "his mother and his brethren", as though they were standing together.
J.T. Just so. John's gospel would enlarge a little on that, too. It says, "After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days", @John 2: 12. And again in Luke it says, "he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was in subjection to them", @Luke 2: 51.
A.A.T. It says in @John 19: 26, "Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son. Then he says unto the disciple, Behold
{186}
thy mother". The expression "mother" and "woman" are brought together there by the Lord.
J.T. The allusion there would be to John himself, the Lord giving John that remarkable place and according him such a distinction as that. He is not referring to Himself at all there. He regards Mary as John's mother, so it says, "from that hour the disciple took her to his own home".
A.A.T. Yes. I noticed how the scripture brought the two expressions together.
J.T. So that that matter is clear, I hope, to all the brethren. It is well that it should be, and especially because of what obtains in the system alluded to. I do not feel like speaking much about that system, but it is to be spoken of because what that system sets out is a discredit to the whole testimony, the whole service of God, and the brethren ought to be wholly clear of it.
Ques. Was Mary adjusted in @John 2 when she said: "Whatever he may say to you, do"?
J.T. Quite so. She is making suggestions for the servants. There is not very much m it; but still there it is. She more or less corrects herself.
Ques. Would you say something about the Lord's expression, "for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother"? Does the Lord use the opportunity to point out that a new generation was coming to light, morally akin to Himself, as doing the will of His Father, and He claims them in kinship with Him? I wondered whether we were left with that impression that there was something there.
J.T. Yes, just so. But the question is who these persons are. The Lord says, "Behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother". You mean that there is a new generation in those that the Lord
{187}
speaks of there, and I think you are quite right in that. There is a new generation, and, by inference, we might say, we belong to that generation.
P.L. And do such furnish now, constitutionally, a trustworthy depository for this parabolical ministry and all that is to follow?
J.T. Quite so, and the Lord was able to speak freely to them at that time; He was able to speak to them with deep mutual feeling: "Behold my mother", He says, "and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother". That is a beautiful thing that the Lord should thus speak to His disciples in that sense.
P.L. And does it establish the principle of pleasurable selection on the part of the Lord in regard to those to whom He gives light in these days?
J.T. Just so. 'Pleasurable selection' is a fine phrase, I would think. We ought to be glad of phraseology that adorns the Scriptures. The Lord is Himself alluding to the brethren -- even ourselves -- those that do the will of God. The greatest thing morally, we might say, is the doing of the will of God, whoever we may be. Of course, we might easily follow up this thought in the other gospels, but there is not time. We should proceed now with the gospel of Matthew.
Ques. Are you going to say something now on those sections of the chapter which would be a help to us; a kind of basic outline of the truth that underlies this?
J.T. Well, the next thing is the idea of parables -- parabolic service. Verse 10: "The disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables? And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given; for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be
{188}
caused to be in abundance; but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him. For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand; and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see; for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them", and so forth. Now this is a very important section, because it really points to the great apostasy that is coming in. The book of Revelation would indicate that Christendom as such is going to vanish. The real Christians will go up in the rapture, but Christendom itself is about to vanish -- a most solemn thing, and this section points to it. The whole chapter, indeed, is the doom of Christendom, in that sense. Christendom will not last, and God is dealing judicially already with it in certain things that are coming to light.
P.L. Is that presented in a prophetic way, though, of course, bearing on Israel, "And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and snared, and taken. Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples", @Isaiah 8: 15, 16?
J.T. Very good. That is exactly what is in mind. It is the terribleness of the doom of Christendom. I can only use the word doom, and it is most solemn.
J.T.Jr. Speaking against the Spirit in chapter 12 would lay the basis for the apostasy indicated in chapter 13.
J.T. Quite so, the basis for it. Take any section of the world; take Roman Catholicism by itself, such as in Italy and France and Spain and Ireland, well,
{189}
that is where the basis of all this is laid. The doom of Christendom is laid in it. It is a most solemn thing to think of. And then take any other section, such as Protestantism as it is in Germany, or in this country itself, or England. The doom of the whole thing is manifest to those who have eyes to see. It is most solemn, but we should face it and be sobered by it.
V.C.L. Would you say that the positive side is conveyed in the suggestion of the word 'mystery', as though we are now put on our mettle to see if we can understand what the Spirit is conveying in a positive way?
J.T. Quite so, so it says, "The mystery of piety is great". That is on the positive side, and it is a most blessed thing to think of. But see how things are going; see what is happening, the barefaced way in which things are happening, such as, for example, Christian Science -- a terrible thing -- going on openly in the midst of Christendom.
P.L. Do you mean that something of the Lord's tears over Jerusalem in the pending doom that would result, should be found with us?
J.T. Just so. Christian Science is greatly increasing in America, I am sorry to say, and possibly in this country and in England. It is right that we should think of it, and be with God about all these things.
A.R. Would you say then that Christendom is guilty of the sin against the Holy Spirit?
J.T. Just so. That is what we get here. I had hoped to speak about that in time. Speaking against the Holy Spirit is an awful thing to think of; the consequence of it is not said as to the Father, nor as to the Son; it is said of the Spirit only.
M.A.W. Is it significant that Paul brings in the same quotation from @Isaiah 6, in speaking to the
{190}
apostate Jews at the end of the Acts, and brings in the matter of the Holy Spirit there too?
J.T. Quite so, and so he says there, "this salvation of God has been sent to the nations". That is a judicial act towards the Jews, that God was sending the gospel to the gentiles, and "*they* also will hear it", it says. A remarkable thing! The word was against the Jews, and it might be worked out, too, to see that it is against a certain class of people at the present time, who say they are Jews but are not.
J.P. In 2 Thessalonians the apostasy is coming in "because they have not received the love of the truth".
J.T. Just so. That is set over against the first epistle which is so beautiful in its bearing.
Now we must proceed in the sections. We have touched on verse 13, and what might be said is that the section comprising verses 13 to 15 is all judicial. Then we have verses 16 to 23, and it is the good ground now that we are directed to. The only ground that really yields for God is the good ground. However much profession we may make, only the good ground will yield for God. Verse 24 commences the next section, in which we have the devil's work, following on the sowing of the good seed. So that we have to wait for the result in this great parable section. "Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary". The wheat implies the real saints of God at the present time, and one can say heartily and happily that there is a goodly number of them here today, because God is greatly honouring these meetings. I do not hesitate in saying that; whether it be in Edinburgh or London or in many parts of America or Australia, or elsewhere. There is the great work of God going on, and we all want to be in it, and these meetings are to strengthen
{191}
us and make us real in it. We are heavenly, because we belong to heaven; the assembly is heavenly, and she is seen in @Revelation 21 as coming down from God out of heaven.
P.L. Does the first of these sets of three parables bear on the outward position? They refer to what is vulnerable, do they not? But the last three suggest what is impregnable, that is on the divine side. First, the darnel, and the mustard tree, and the leaven. The enemy has invaded all that, but the last three refer to the treasure, and to the pearl, and finally to the ingathering from the sea. Do they represent the kingdom from the divine side -- impregnable?
J.T. I think the idea of the gospel field is in mind, but then we have to go on a little more to get the full bearing of the whole passage, because we want to come down to the end of the section read, and to return again to what you are saying. We have another parable, that is the woman with the three measures of meal, and everything leavened; and then again, "All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable" -- notice that -- "without a parable he did not speak to them". We are exposed, as it were, by the use of a parable, if we are not real; so that "all these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them, so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the world's foundation". So these verses are to be grouped more closely. And then again, in verse 36, we have the idea of the house. It says, "Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house". Now we have to consider and see what the word 'house' means there, as over against what He has been dealing with. There is a change in the Lord's position; He goes into the house; and it adds "his disciples
{192}
came to him" and so forth. They came to Him in chapter 5, as you will remember, on the mountain, and the Lord gave that wonderful teaching on the mountain, but then He went down to the plain again, and now again He has gone into the house, and it says, "His disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field. But he answering said ..." So now we have to come to the Lord explaining things, and how beautiful it is to listen to Him explaining things. That is what we are trying to do today; very poorly it may be, but still there it is, the idea of explaining things. We are to explain things to one another, so as to be clear about them, and not foggy or dark.
Wm.H. He seems to speak of the last three similitudes that Mr. L. called attention to in the house also, as if that were a secret.
J.T. They are really leading up to the assembly, so we might continue with this section just to get the idea of the assembly. In verse 44 the word 'field' is the key-note, because it is really a gospel touch, and then in verses 45 and 46 we come to admiration -- admiration in divine things, which is a very scarce thing. We are so little taken up with them, but there is such a thing as admiration in divine things. Matthew has it, but I think John has more of it.
H.F.N. It was a great source of help to oneself when you linked the treasure up with the ministry of the twelve in the Acts of the Apostles, and the pearl with the ministry of Paul. Would you still say that?
J.T. I would say that is quite right, for Paul comes to the fine things of Christianity, as we may call them. There are things that are, as it were, ordinary, but then there are especially fine things, glorious things, in the sense of material and texture; they are fine and to be admired by the eye. It
{193}
requires a spiritual eye, of course, and it refers to what belongs to the assembly; the greatness and glory of the things that are in the house, within, as it were, in the assembly where we are secluded within with one another and with the Lord. What a wonderful thing it is, that it should be our portion to have the greatest things, the very finest things. The millennium will not have these things to the same extent that we have them. The assembly has the fine things of Christianity, of eternity, you might say.
A.B. In verse 44 you have referred to the Lord's joy in His present possessions.
J.T. We have in the types, in Abraham and Isaac, people, you might say, of great means to get things and to be in the enjoyment of them, and so it is in the verse alluded to in this chapter. "The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field". There are people of this world who can get anything they want in the way of show and texture and magnificent materials, and so forth; they can get anything they want. Well, that can be turned round to a spiritual sense, and I believe that is suggested in verse 44.
A.B. I was alluding to what you have said at one time, as to the Lord's joy in finding the possession, following on what you were speaking of. It is what He has now, His joy in the assembly at the present time.
J.T. And so what we have in the house in @Luke 15 -- everything is of the best.
J.S.E. I feel that this matter of the treasure and the pearl as coming in this gospel in the house is particularly for ourselves, that we might have a better understanding of the Lord and what He is after.
J.T. The Lord Himself is occupied with these things. "Like a treasure hid in the field, which a
{194}
man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field". That is, he values the worth of it, and he would have it. We know something about people of the world and the way they view things; they must have the best; they are only thinking of that. So it is we can transfer the thought to spiritual things; that there must be the best, and the best belongs to the assembly; everything that is the best belongs to the assembly.
V.C.L. And is it not significant that in the house the suggestion is made of great cost, as though that would underlie the appreciation the disciples would have of the value?
J.T. It is a question of whether we have become acquainted with these great and costly things, because there are costly things. Of course, we think of what it cost the Lord Jesus to secure what we have; to secure ourselves, indeed, for He has us too, and then the assembly which is the very best thing that you can get in the whole universe, next to divine Persons Themselves.
A.H. Would you say a word as to verses 51 and 52 in view of what you have remarked?
J.T. The expression "brings out of his treasure" in verse 52 is to be noted. It says, "For this reason every scribe" -- notice the word 'scribe' -- "discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old". There is some importance to be attached to a scribe here, as if God would distinguish divine writings, or persons who are writing about divine things. If you go back to J.N.D.s writings I am sure such are in mind, and, of course, Paul's writings. The Lord is never said to write Himself, except on the ground, but Paul did write, and others, as we said, including Mr. Darby. So we are dealing now with writings, and the
{195}
thought of a scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens. There is peculiar greatness to be attached to a scribe in what he writes down spiritually.
J.S.E. Is that because he is accurate?
J.T. I was thinking of that. Accuracy is a great matter in writing; I am glad you mention that, because there is much writing, of course. Take any of the ancient writings and recent writings, Greek writings, Roman writings, English writings and German writings. Much is made of writings and the persons who write, but there is nothing at all in them, compared with what we are saying now. The scribe, as we have it here, is a peculiarly accurate writer, for he is dealing with the things of God; lie belongs to God and is dealing with divine things and he would not harm them. He would not write in a careless way. He would write as they should be written. Therefore the idea of writing becomes of great importance in that sense. So much of it has come in, and it is coming along yet, and we thank God for it, because the brethren need food and they need spiritual refinement, and the writing helps to accomplish that.
J.S.E. For us is it acquired in the school of Tyrannus? I was thinking of Paul separating the disciples and taking them on in those surroundings, so that they might be accurately instructed in the truth.
J.T. Good; but we might read that. "But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus", @Acts 19: 9.
That is the idea; the school is there. Although we do not say schoolmaster there is such a thing as that in it. There is demand for accuracy and correctness; there is demand for it, divinely so, because we are apt to be so careless even in the Lord's things.
{196}
The word therefore that we are just speaking of is to stress with us the idea of accuracy and refinement, because heaven will be of that character, we may be sure. It will be according to God, and to Christ and the Spirit.
G.M.S. In connection with accuracy, is there anything to be said about the present tense used in connection with the kingdom of the heavens like a treasure, and the past tense in the second parable? The first parable is "For the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field". But then in the next parable, "Having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it".
J.T. Well, the whole passage hangs together, I would say, and illustrates what has been spoken of, accuracy in divine things.
P.L. "A workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line the word of truth", @2 Timothy 2: 15.
J.T. That is it; "cutting in a straight line the word of truth". It is a great thing to cut the word of truth accurately.
A.A. Do you see the feature of accuracy in @Acts 18: "And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly"?
J.T. Very good. They are Paul's companions; persons whom he lived with, so that we can understand what accuracy there would be as they had Paul with them. So it is with ourselves, we ought to do things well if we are to do them at all, write things accurately if we write them at all, and speak things accurately if we speak at all. We have the idea of the speaking of the Lord Himself.
Ques. Might I ask, if there is something hidden here which the Lord would eventually disclose to Peter, in chapter 16? Is the suggestion in chapter 13, the treasure and the pearl, what is hidden here for
{197}
the moment? The Lord is not disclosing what it is actually. He puts another name on it, but we could say it is really the assembly. Is that it?
J.T. Why do you refer to chapter 16?
Rem. I was thinking of "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. And *I* also, I say unto thee, that *thou* art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades gates shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens". There is something that the Lord seems to disclose to Peter now, that He had not done before; does it underlie chapter 13?
J.T. Well, I think Peter is coming into it, only he was to be superseded in time, I would say, by Paul in regard to these fine matters. It is the fine matters that Paul brings forward in the power of the Spirit, because you get all the excellencies of Christian teaching -- the chief ones, the fine and glorious ones -- in Paul's writings.
{198}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (7)
@Matthew 13: 1 - 58
J.T. The brethren will be aware of the occasion we had in Edinburgh, when we started the gospel of Matthew. The proposal, at that time, was that we should be occupied with the first half of the gospel in the meetings in Edinburgh, and that the second half (especially in view of the assembly) should occupy us at these meetings in London. Chapter 13 is in mind now because it is a parabolic chapter and treats of things that, we might say, are judicial. Christendom is on the way to apostasy, not yet openly, but on the way to it, and the thought is that these parables will enable us to deal with what is judicial, as applying to the whole position of Christendom. Although many who are not walking in the truth fully are Christians, and we do not disregard them, yet the principle of apostasy has set in. After we have considered this chapter, the thought is to take up the truth of the assembly, not the judicial side of it, but the idea of the whole assembly as the vessel of the Spirit of God here on earth.
It will be noticed that this chapter is only partially judicial, the parables in the latter half of it being spoken in truth directly. There are seven of them altogether, and the intent is clearly to give a complete outlook first of all as to this judicial aspect, and then the thought of the assembly comes in, in the treasure and the pearl, in order to complete the idea of parabolic ministry. These are features of the assembly, but they come out more fully in the direct teaching after this chapter. The chapter begins, as the brethren will notice, with the Lord leaving the house and sitting down by the sea. That is to say, it is a new setting of the truth. It implies that
{199}
the Lord has taken up a new setting, and He is to be listened to on those lines, and the idea of a sower is that something is to be produced by the sowing. Then the quotation from the prophets only confirms or clarifies the judicial idea. It is seen beginning with verse 13: "For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand; and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see; for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their cars, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them". No doubt all of us will have some understanding of the significance of these prophetic utterances; that is to say, they are judicial, and the judicial bearing applies to Christendom. It would be impossible that we should ever reach conclusion in the history of Christendom unless there were some judicial action leading up to entire judgment, as we have it in the book of Revelation. Christendom cannot go on for ever; we can easily see that. God must come in judicially, in relation to the whole system of Christendom, and that is the most solemn thing. The whole scene around us, called Christendom, is coming under judgment, and has already been dealt with judicially, hence the Spirit of God is not opening up the truth to Christendom as such in a clarified way at all. I think it would greatly help the brethren if they were to see the judicial action, as indicated in this chapter, and at the same time, be with God about it.
Ques. Does Paul in @Hebrews 6 have the same kind of thing in mind? He speaks about it being impossible to renew again to repentance, and then
{200}
he says, "For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God; but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end is to be burned. But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things", @Hebrews 6: 7 - 9.
J.T. Well, that is the relief there, but it is not here; it is not in this chapter. The parabolic ministry of this chapter does not admit of relief; it is judgment; but Hebrews does, because Hebrews is uttered in Christianity. At the same time, the judgment is quite as severe as it is here. Perhaps you will help us about that further.
Rem. I was only thinking that Paul had in mind that the matter was carried into our own time, into the Spirit's day, and the impossibility to renew to repentance persons who refused it as in Christendom, as you were saying.
J.T. The apostasy is in mind, of course, but the relation of it in Hebrews is to the Jews, and, of course, in a certain sense this chapter has the same character. The Jews are more in mind in Hebrews, however, whereas Christendom is in mind in our chapter, because the Lord has taken up a new attitude in this verse. He has taken up a new attitude, going out by the sea and sitting in the ship and speaking to people on the land. It says, "the whole crowd stood on the shore". It is a promiscuous company, but the Lord is speaking from the sea.
Rem. If we are not with God in this judicial condemnation of one system, we shall not understand the blessedness of verse 16, "blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear". That is another company altogether.
J.T. Yes, and then later in the chapter you have, in verse 36, "having dismissed the crowds", that is to say, He now clears the air of the mere professors,
{201}
and speaks directly to the disciples. It is one thing to speak to the disciples and another thing to speak to the crowds. The crowds are in mind in the parabolic teaching; that is to say, in the judicial teaching; and they are just saying what they wish. It is most solemn the way things are current abroad amongst nominal Christians. They are just saying what they wish. Some of it is speaking, you might say, in a most heartless way about the truth, denying even the holy Person of the Lord Jesus.
Ques. Is this quotation from Isaiah showing an advance on Isaiah himself, suggesting that the apostasy has ripened in the Lord's mind. @Isaiah 6: 10 says, "Make the heart of this people fat" and in our chapter the Lord says, "the heart of this people has grown fat". Is there the ripening of the apostasy in the Lord's mind here?
J.T. Ripening -- just so. That is to say, the Lord is ceasing to teach, as He had been teaching in the early part of the book, up to the end of chapter 12. He is changing His attitude in this chapter, because He goes out by the sea and sits in the ship and speaks to the crowds.
E.C.M. Does Paul's word, in the end of Acts, bear on what you have in mind? It says, "Having spoken one word", and then it says, "Well spoke the Holy Spirit" and quotes from this very passage in Isaiah. Does the Spirit enter into this matter of what is judicial?
J.T. Very good, confirming what the Lord has been bringing before us in recent times. I think the passage we have been reading is repeated three times in the New Testament, showing that this judicial side was long in mind and is now ripening, as has just been said.
Rem. The Lord does not say to the crowds, "Have ye understood all these things?" He speaks
{202}
it to those who have been immediately under His instruction, and they say to Him, "Yea, Lord".
J.T. Well, that is final. That is His final word to them, but verse 36 is the one that fits properly. "Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house"; notice He entered the house in contrast to the sea, "and his disciples came to him". It says they came to Him, meaning they were moved. In chapter 5 the same thing happened; the Lord went up into the mountain and sat down, and the disciples came to Him. And so here, "His disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field". That is to say, it is the disciples now, He is willing to teach them, and ready to expound the parable to them.
P.L. Is it prophetically suggested in His going into the house that there would be a resumption of assembly relations in the very presence of the apostasy?
J.T. Quite so. It is to prepare really for the chapters we have in mind, dealing with the truth of the assembly, for the house suggests the assembly.
P.H.H. The word 'mysteries' is used in connection with the disciples, "Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given".
J.T. That would confirm what we have recently spoken of as to mystery. For instance, the mystery of the kingdom comes in in the epistle to the Romans, and it opens up the New Testament, the epistles as well as the gospels.
P.H.H. Would it mean that the parabolic ministry is able to be understood by the disciples?
J.T. And so the Lord assumes that. Its meaning has come out fully now, we might say, in the presence and power of the Spirit and the revival of the truth too, during the years that have passed since the revival. It is no longer mystery, although in a
{203}
certain sense it may be, but it is not parabolic. What we have in the *Collected Writings*, for instance, and the current ministry, is not parabolic; it is open -- a clarified setting out of the truth, and a clarified presentation of the truth should be the aim of everyone who ministers. "Ye shall know the truth", the Lord says, "and the truth shall set you free".
Rem. So that Paul says, "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God", @1 Corinthians 4: 1. What he had was made available to the saints.
J.T. Just so. It was made available, not that we should begin to have Sunday Schools, I hope we never will, because the truth ought to be before the young people in the essence of it as well as in the fulness of it. The truth ought to be presented to the young people.
F.C.H. Is this lack of understanding that is emphasized in the chapter the result now of departing from Paul's ministry? Paul could say in writing to Timothy, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things". Has not the departure from Paul's ministry brought about this great lack of understanding?
J.T. Quite so, but then we should not limit clear presentation of the truth to Paul, because Peter set it out clearly too, and all the apostles set it out clearly. They were all men qualified to minister the truth. Peter stood up with the eleven, in setting out the gospel at first, it says in @Acts 2.
P.L. Does not Peter himself say, "If any one speak - as oracles of God", @1 Peter 4: 11?
J.T. Quite so, and the Holy Spirit is here to help us to do that. We need not be at any loss, because the Holy Spirit is here purposely to do that. He is here this very day, to open up the truth to us.
{204}
It is not now presented in parables but by the Spirit of God, according to the Lord's words as to the Spirit, "He shall guide you into all the truth".
P.H.H. Would you think that the conversation with Paul in @Acts 20 was on this line of opening up the truth in a positive way? It speaks first of all of a long discourse, and then the second word used is, "having long spoken" or conversed, or communed. Would that be the way that the truth largely is opened up today?
J.T. I think so, but do not forget the Lord's supper. The whole teaching of Christianity is bound up with the Lord's supper, and hence the continuation of it on the first day of the week. That is found in the chapter you quote, is it not?
P.H.H. Yes. It says, "And having gone up" (that is, with Eutychus) "and having broken the bread, and eaten, and having long spoken until daybreak". You mean to say that the opening up of the truth is largely based on the Lord's supper?
J.T. I think so, and hence the Lord has made it very clear to us that the Lord's supper is the beginning of all ministry, and it is the beginning of the service of God. But then another thing has to be said about @Acts 20, and that is, there was evidently a defect in the assembly in Troas. Why should he be so long? Where the Spirit of God is free, we do not have any great lengthy speech at the Lord's supper. We are to be brief. The inference thus is that there was something wrong at that time at Troas, because Paul had to say so much. I do not think any brother would be listened to much today, if he spoke to us as long as Paul did at the Lord's supper, but it shows the order of things and how the Spirit of God changes His attitude at certain times. I have no doubt the great prolongation of the speaking by Paul points to something in relation to the Reformation,
{205}
and then the recovery of the truth in clarity in the revival one hundred and twenty years ago.
Ques. The greatest corruptions of Christendom centre in the Lord's supper. Would that bear on what you are saying as to the apostasy?
J.T. Very good. It is centred in Rome. One does not like to speak too much on that point, because I think Rome is changing her attitude. At the same time, it remains the same essentially. It is the apostasy. Jezebel remains Jezebel, and we do well to keep that in mind. Thyatira was the beginning of the great corrupt teaching in Christendom, and it stays. Then we have other such things as Christian Science, Jehovah's Witnesses, and others, including Unitarianism, which is a terrible thing, the incarnation and the truth of the Person of Christ being denied. All these things have come in, and, of course, the devil has certain advantage in it, but the Spirit of God has His own advantage and retains it. Hence we have the *Collected Writings* and we have other ministry since, and God is still giving fresh ministry, so as to keep the truth as a whole before us; and we must always keep that in mind, that it is the truth as a whole. So it is that in these three-day meetings the Spirit of God has His own rights and His own advantages and He is keeping them before us.
Ques. Is that why dispensationally the long discourse has been needed, to disentangle the Supper from what is corrupt?
J.T. Quite so. I think the *Collected Writings* (taking the liberty of referring to Mr. Darby) are immensely helpful and we should all look into them carefully. At the same time there is later ministry too that God is using, and I am sure the Lord will continue to use it right up to the very moment of His coming; so that the ministry will be kept fresh and clarified.
{206}
Ques. Is it all in view of the personnel of the assembly being intelligent? Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons; do *ye* judge what I say".
J.T. And so here, the Lord says, "Have ye understood all these things?". So we should be bent on understanding, and especially the sisters, because they are apt to assume that the brothers know everything and should know everything, whereas the sisters ought to know the truth too. There were prophetesses at the beginning, and there should be something of that kind today, if we are to have the truth clarified amongst sisters.
P.L. "The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom *I* love in truth", @2 John 1.
J.T. And Phoebe too, at Rome.
F.W. In regard to what is judicial, why are the assemblies brought forward first in Revelation before the Lord deals judicially with other matters?
J.T. Well, the first thing in the book of Revelation is what *the Lord* Himself says. We have His own words, and they are given verbatim, but the Lord Himself, in what He says, directs that "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". So that it is not simply what the Lord Himself says to the assemblies, but what *the Spirit* says to the assemblies.
A.J.G. Peter says, "The time of having the judgment begin from the house of God is come", @1 Peter 4: 17.
J.T. Just so. The house of God; that is what we get here. He dismissed the crowds and went into the house; so that Peter, in principle, refers to that -- the time of His being in the house.
Ques. Why is it that the Lord not only expounds the parables that have been said in the presence of the crowds, but He adds three more in the house?
J.T. It is for the sake of clarification. It is a complete setting out of the truth as over against the
{207}
first part of the chapter. They are to be clear, and two of the later parables refer to the assembly; as, for instance, verse 44, "The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid", and then again, in verse 45, "The kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls; and having found one pearl of great value ..." That is to say, these two parables directly refer to the assembly, but we shall have to wait for the later part of the book to get the truth of the assembly. It is in mind in these meetings to get the full thought of the assembly as over against the individual side in the early chapters of the book of Matthew.
P.H.H. Does the Lord have greater liberty in the house, to bring out what is next to His heart?
J.T. One can understand that. In our own case, each one who is ministering can sec how we become clear as in the presence of spiritual and interested persons. You have found that, I am sure?
P.H.H. Yes, indeed. Does not the parable of the darnel mean that there is a mixed state of things right on to the end, publicly, but there is no mixture in connection with the treasure or the pearl. Is that what we enjoy as understanding the Lord's own thoughts?
J.T. I think at a time like this, these meetings are intended for clarity, and the Spirit of God has liberty to use any one of us, or all of us if necessary, to open up the truth. It is not a time of hiding the truth but of opening it up.
Ques. Do you regard the Lord's action in dismissing the crowd as judicial?
J.T. The bearing of it is judicial toward the crowd, not the disciples, for they are distinguished. Typically from Rome downward it is a time of hiding things; that is to say, God is dealing judicially with Christendom.
{208}
A.J.G. So that "having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house". That would leave it open for all who sought the truth to seek Him there, would it not? "His disciples", it says, "came to him".
J.T. Very good. The same thing is said in chapter 5. The Lord went up into the mountain, and sat down, and His disciples came to Him, and He opened His mouth, it says, and spoke what we call the Beatitudes -- precious truth. There are nine blessednesses referred to in that chapter, and it is similar here in the opening up of the parables. It was a time of expounding things, and I believe the *Collected Writings* -- as I already ventured to say -- are a great expounding of things. The Spirit of God has seized the opportunity and has caused it through the great servant that the Lord raised up to expound things, and now we are getting the benefit of it.
Ques. If we listen to the instructions in the house, would all of us become good householders with treasure which we are able to bring out?
J.T. Just so; we get the idea in this chapter of being like householders, that is, persons who have houses, but houses in a spiritual sense, not just for the bringing up of children and the like, but houses in a spiritual sense.
Now, the treasure is said to be "hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it" -- notice the joy of it -- "goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field". That is to say, the man is a type of the Lord, of course. "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls" -- beautiful pearls -- "and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it". So that the buyer here had means, and we can only
{209}
attribute that to the Lord Jesus and the means He has of buying things.
A.J.G. The mustard tree is one of the parables that deal with the public position. Is the character of being hidden, which is impressed upon the treasure, the divine answer to the pretentiousness which the mustard tree suggests?
J. T. I think it is like Colossians. "Your life is hid with the Christ in God". That is the height of the epistle.
Ques. Is the pearl in contrast with the leaven, the pearl suggesting what is incorruptible in itself and cannot be added to? I was thinking of the remark that the treasure being hidden was in contrast to the pretension suggested in the mustard tree, and I wondered whether the intrinsic value of the pearl in the next section was in contrast to the inflated idea through the leaven.
J.T. Yes, it is more than the idea of treasure. It says he "found one pearl" -- only one. It is a unit, but it is a precious unit; it is of great value, and who can tell the value? No one can tell the value. The Lord Himself is the possessor of it, as it says. "He went and sold all whatever he had and bought it". The Lord alone knows the value of the pearl.
P.H.H. Would not its connection with the assembly be seen in the Revelation where the gates are spoken of in connection with the pearl? In @Revelation 21, where the city, the assembly, is being spoken of, it says, for instance (verse 21), "And the twelve gates, twelve pearls; each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl". Has the pearl therefore distinctly an assembly reference?
J.T. I think so, but this parable here is strictly confined to *one* pearl. In the book of Revelation you would therefore have to distinguish what is said
{210}
because the word *twelve* comes in, in chapter 21, which is an administrative word.
P.H.H. You mean that this expression "one pearl" is an expression of refinement all on its own?
J.T. Just so. 'Refinement' is excellent because it is a word that we ought to pay attention to all the way through. We had the idea of refinement in Edinburgh, but this is refinement *par excellence*, I would say.
P.L. Does it fit in to @Ephesians 5, "even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it"?
J.T. Just so -- "also loved the assembly", and again we have the word also in @Matthew 16, "*I* also, I say unto thee that *thou* art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly". There again you have the full thought in the Lord's reference to the assembly.
E.A.L. The pearl has a peculiar entity as a jewel; it is at its best when worn on a person.
J.T. Very good, so that the bride in the book of Revelation has that distinction. "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready" -- made *herself* ready. She has done it herself.
Ques. What is implied in the expression "seeking beautiful pearls"? It is plural.
J.T. Would not the word 'beautiful' refer to the eyes? We get certain expressions used typically by the Lord covering all this, in the book of the Song of Songs. The merchantman found *one* pearl. It was of great price, and it says, "He went and sold all whatever he had and bought it". It is one thing, that is to say, the assembly.
Ques. Does it suggest what is distinctive to the assembly? Although there may be other families in mind eventually, what is distinctive to the assembly is now before us.
{211}
J.T. Quite so. It is the greatest family in the whole universe. Even the angels are not as great as the assembly.
P.H.H. The Lord says in @John 14, "there are many abodes ... I go to prepare you a place". Would that be in line with the special place of the assembly?
J.T. Just so -- "prepare you" -- and then again, He says, "if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again and shall receive you to myself", showing that His affections are bound up with the assembly.
J.McK. Would the fact that He sold all that He had give a touch of finality to the assembly? It says in verse 46, "having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had". That would imply that the assembly is a final thought with the merchantman.
J.T. Just so. It is a final thought.
A.J.G. Does the fact that it is one pearl, with beauty attaching to it, show the importance of the thought of unity among the saints in love, and then unified affection toward Christ?
J.T. Just so. I think the book of the Song of Songs ought to be well studied, in view of all this, and especially in view of this particular chapter. We ought to consider what Christ has in that book, in type.
W.C. In chapter 6 it says, "She is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bore her" (verse 9).
J.T. That is right.
A.B. And again in chapter 4, it says, "Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee" (verse 7).
Rem. The word 'pearl', I think, was first used by the Lord. There is no record, I believe, of the word in the Old Testament. The word rendered "pearls" in @Job 28: 18 in the Authorised Version is a different word.
{212}
J.T. I would accept that fully.
Ques. Does the fact that the Lord is referred to as a merchant, in connection with the pearl, indicate that He, and He alone, values the assembly at its true value?
J.T. Just so. The word 'merchant' would mean one who knows what the value is. Perhaps that is something that we are very defective in, the true and full values of what the Scriptures present to us.
Ques. So that alongside of the matter of what is judicial, there is also this matter of discernment. Are both those qualities to be formed in the saints?
J.T. You are referring to values? Very good.
Eu.R. Do we get that in connection with the judgment of the false system in @Revelation 18? In verse 8 we have "Strong is the Lord God who has judged her", and then in verse 20, "Rejoice over her, heaven, and ye saints and apostles and prophets; for God has judged your judgment upon her". Does that involve the gain of this teaching in that judgment has been maintained among the saints?
J.T. Just so. I would think that these meetings that we are having so often, thank God, would help us in arriving at true values, and then arriving at true judgments as to the evil that has to be judged; and so the book of Revelation includes both of these thoughts.
Eu.R. I thought we had been helped as to that. The judgment that will be publicly executed has been maintained among the saints who are getting the gain of the recovery, and that, I suppose, dates back from the commencement till now.
J.T. So that the book of Revelation therefore reaches conclusions, both for good and for evil. Evil is at its full height as described there, but then good too is described at its true level.
{213}
Ques. Is that why the Lord adds the parable of the seine? Having spoken of the treasure and the pearl, which are of positive value, and not allowing of anything extraneous, He adds something else, saying, "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind, which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out". We may have our attention called to the greatness of the treasure and the beauty of the pearl, yet as things proceed there is really the need for sorting things out, in the understanding that what is of value is to be preserved and what is worthless is to be cast out.
J.T. I would say, getting down to practical matters, our care of the saints, and of the Lord's interests generally, calls largely for, discerning what is good and refusing what is bad; and it should go on more and more until the end, because the Lord is seeking to give us clearer discernment as to what is good and what is bad.
F.P.S. The good figs in Jeremiah were very good, and the bad figs were very bad.
J.T. Just so; that is a similar word. But this can be easily brought down to ourselves, that in our meetings to care for divine interests, whether in small meetings or in large, we should apply ourselves more strenuously to this matter of spiritual discrimination, and arrive at a united judgment.
Ques. Does that come in in @Acts 15? Is there a sorting out there, and the result is, "Then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with the whole assembly".
J.T. Well, just so. It is, you might say, the only general assembly in the New Testament. The Roman Catholics have many general assemblies, but the only one in Scripture is in @Acts 15, and
{214}
Peter and James are the leaders in pronouncing the judgment, and the whole assembly is with them. I think our care meetings which are, of course, local and not general, and their findings and judgments, might be well based on @Acts 15.
J.P. So that Job speaks about abundantly declaring the matter as it is (@Job 26: 3).
J.T. Well, just so, "as it is". When we are talking about the care meetings, we have in mind that the brethren have the Spirit of God, and thus their final judgment is unified, it is, *in principle*, the assembly itself.
P.L. Would the word "on the shore and sat down" suggest restful investigation and enquiry in dignity?
J.T. Just so. The Lord did the same thing in chapter 5 of this book. He sat down and the disciples came to Him, so that sitting down would indicate deliberation. We should take time to do things, not rush them through but take time to do them.
P.H.H. Would the treasure and the pearl preceding, help to give us a sense of value and discernment, so that this sitting down and gathering in the good and refusing the evil would have more meaning to us?
J.T. I think they would. Because the idea of a merchant is that of a discriminative person. He is discriminating; he knows values and takes time to value things. He does not act in a hurry. He takes time.
J.McK. Would the woman of worth indicate moral correspondence to Christ? She is said to be like the merchants ships. The idea of the merchant comes much into her activities.
J.T. Solomon said, "one man ... have I found, but a woman ... have I not found", @Ecclesiastes 7: 28. That is what Solomon said. What he says in that last chapter of Proverbs is a matter of discernment,
{215}
for Solomon had a true judgment. That is what I believe is meant in that case, in the book of Proverbs, the woman is a woman of worth. It is an abstract thought. Solomon does not produce her; he just describes her and tells us what she is like, but it must be the assembly in anticipation. Solomon lighted on the thought of the assembly. So she is a woman of worth and there is no one like her, and she has children. I have no doubt at all that the thought is that Solomon lights on the idea of the assembly without saying so.
J.T.Jr. And he had confidence in her. He can trust her.
J.T. Just so. Her husband can trust her. That is just it.
A.B. Would the thought of worth or virtue be the ability to choose the good and refuse the evil?
J.T. Just so. I suppose we ought not to pass over lightly that proverb of Solomon as to the value of the woman. I believe God has helped the brethren, in recent times, to place a better value on the sisters than they had placed on them, and the time has come for them to show that they are worthy of it. The question is, "Who can find a woman of worth?". Well, why should not all the sisters think of that. "Who can find a woman of worth?" Because it all points to the coming of the Lord for the assembly, when "we shall all be changed". The thought of the woman involves the assembly, it will merge in the idea of the assembly. We also have in mind that we are to be like the assembly, in chastity. Paul says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11: 2.
P.H.H. Is it remarkable that Solomon saying "A woman among all those have I not found" should be in Ecclesiastes -- the meaning of Ecclesiastes being 'the former of assemblies'?
{216}
J.T. It is. Solomon would have a good judgment about her. So it is that we have in the last chapter of Proverbs the former of assemblies finds what he is looking for, and describes it.
Ques. The Lord says in @Matthew 12, "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother". Does the Lord, in referring to the sister and mother, show what He would look for from sisters?
J.T. Quite so. He does not agree with certain who say that Mary is the mother of God and that she is immaculate. Mary, the Lord's mother, failed very seriously, and that passage, in chapter 12 points to that. She stood without, asking Him to come out to see her, which was not respectful. And then again in @John 2 she assumed that the Lord did not know things, whereas He did know things.
Eu.R. Would this gathering the good into vessels involve the local companies of the saints?
J.T. Very likely. The principle of locality is in @1 Corinthians 1. It says in verse 2, "To the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ". "All that in every place". That is the local assembly.
Eu.R. There are two gatherings; would the gathering together of every kind cover the whole of Christendom, and then in the midst of that condition there has to be this sorting out and the gathering of the good into vessels?
J.T. The Spirit of God is implied, or there is nothing. If the Spirit of God is gone there is nothing but apostasy, nothing but judgment.
A.J.G. You mean that the good would be those who have the Spirit, and the worthless would be those that are rejected as not having the Spirit?
J.T. Just so. There is nothing at all if we have not the Spirit. We cannot assume that persons are
{217}
born anew, we cannot make anything out of that, because there must be what goes on to completion or it is nothing.
F.C.H. Would the woman of worth, as coming in at the end of the book of Proverbs, be regarded as one who is in the good of the instruction and discernment in the book of Proverbs? Is she the product of that?
J.T. Well, she is, although it is assuming she is there. It says: "Who can find". It is an abstract idea; but still we can hardly say that she is there.
E.C.M. Does this feature of discernment come in with Abigail in regard to her judgment of Nabal? She says, "For as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him", @1 Samuel 25: 25.
J.T. Very good. She was a woman of worth.
E.C.M. And then David speaks of her discernment, "Blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou".
J.T. Quite so. She is one of the best types of the assembly I know of in the Old Testament.
A.J.G. So that what is to mark the position publicly at the completion of the age, in the severance of the wicked from the just, is to take place in principle now in the assembly?
J.T. Just so. That is what I am thinking about. The assembly and the care in it is of great value, I believe, in the eyes of heaven, because of this discriminative power in the saints, discriminating the good from the bad.
Ques. Is not that discriminating power more needed today, having in mind what you said earlier that Roman Catholicism has changed its character? May not other forms of evil change their character?
J.T. Quite so. I just mention that because I have noticed it incidentally, that it *has* changed its character. It is more sympathetic to Protestantism. The fact of the matter is that certain of the leaders
{218}
of Catholicism assume that Protestant Christians belong to that assembly, as they call it, the Catholic Church. I do not know whether the brethren follow what I am saying, but it is a real fact, and there is a certain thing to be noticed in it.
H.H. Would not the effect of the conversation be seen in verse 52, "And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old". It is not 'old and new' but "new and old". Is that the thought of adjustment?
J.T. Very good. I would say that.
{219}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (8)
@Matthew 16: 1 - 28
J.T. It might not be out of place to urge the brethren to seek to chasten their souls in view of the great truth that is to be unfolded to us in this chapter. It is so familiar to us from past experience that we are apt to take it in a shallow way, whereas the immense spiritual importance of it should be taken into account, because we have to do directly with the divine Persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Then added to that, there is the idea of the assembly, and the great servant whom God raised to help in the truth of the assembly, that is Peter. The Sadducean effort is to be noted particularly, indeed we have the Sadducees and the Pharisees, as if the devil had his agents ready to confront the truth and nullify it if possible. Thus we have almost immediately the Father Himself intervening, and then the Son intervening too, saying, "*I* also".
P.H.H. Would the Sadducean element be met by the sign of Jonas? According to chapter 22, the Sadducees say there is no resurrection.
J.T. Whereas the sign of Jonas points to resurrection. Well, that agrees with Peter's confession, and shows that the Father had to do with him in the revelation. It was the Father's revelation; it was not simply the Son Himself acting, but the Father, we might say, acting first, and the Son and the Holy Spirit added to the great facts relative to the assembly.
Ques. Is it necessary, in view of our taking on what is living, to be completely free of shallowness and lack of faith, which might be indicated by the Pharisee and Sadducee?
J.T. Just so. The Lord's remark to Peter was, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens".
{220}
Ques. In verse 1 do we find the enemy presuming in the realm of heaven's right to assert itself, having in mind your subject on Lord's day afternoon? They ask to be shown a sign out of heaven.
J.T. Just so. The book of Acts makes a point of that. We had it on Lord's day, as you say, and I think it would be well to call attention to it, before we enter fully into the matter in hand now. We might challenge our souls as to whether we are spiritual, for we are dealing with spiritual things. It says, "The spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one", @1 Corinthians 2: 15. So that the spiritual is of peculiar importance as we look into a chapter like this. @Matthew 16 is the great assembly chapter.
Rem. We were speaking this morning of discernment. Is it important to discern the signs of the times as a background of the assembly? The Lord says in verse 3, "Ye cannot [discern] the signs of the times".
J.T. The question of discernment is something to be looked into by all of us. David said to Abigail, "Blessed be thy discernment". The spiritual power of discernment seems to be a point to be stressed amongst us, because the enemy particularly aims at this chapter. In the great system that we speak of sometimes, the enemy has wrought to nullify this chapter.
R.W.S. So is the opposition in the first four verses to be left, and then also those who speculate, a little later on, when it says, "Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elias". In the presence of opposition and speculation are we to judge those features in ourselves, in order really to understand what is in mind in this chapter?
J.T. Quite so, and the shallowness of the disciples, too, in questioning the matter of mere bread. How easily we may take up a point of little or no
{221}
importance and make an issue of it. We should be dealing with great things, as the Lord said to Nathanael, "Thou shalt see greater things than these".
Ques. The Lord is warning His disciples as to the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Would you say a little as to what particularly that is, so that we might be on our guard against it?
J.T. Pharisaism, of course, is superficial, religious pride and the like, whereas the Sadducees represent open infidelity, and there is a great deal of that at the present time. People are so ready to say anything they please, without any regard for the truth or the judgment of God. So that, on entering into this chapter, I think we ought to challenge our souls as to all the matters that come up here, so that we might be free to enter into the spiritual side of things.
H.H. Might I ask how this would compare with Paul's version of things in regard of his knowledge of Christ and the assembly?
J.T. It corresponds, of course. We are dealing with Peter here as an apostle, and Paul, of course, was also an apostle, and he leads too, because he deals with the body; he has to do with the body of Christ, which is a prime feature in the assembly. Peter is a stone and lie treats of the structure, but Paul deals with the assembly as a body, and he speaks of Christ and the assembly in that light "*I* speak", he says, "as to Christ, and as to the assembly". "*I* speak". So that what Paul says enters into our conversation in a peculiar way, but still we are not dealing with Paul, we are dealing with Peter here, and the great revelation made to him. Paul had a revelation too, for he says God revealed His Son in him, but the Father revealed Christ to Peter. Paul does not say the Father revealed His Son in him, but here the Lord says to Peter as to the confession he made, "flesh and blood
{222}
has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". So that we are dealing with the greatest things in this chapter, in that sense.
A.J.G. Have you in mind that the revelation of the Father to Peter constituted him invulnerable material?
J.T. Just so; invulnerable.
A.J.G. I mean if the assembly is to be invulnerable, is it not important that each of the saints composing it should be invulnerable?
J.T. Just so; and marked by permanency too. I would think the idea of a stone is permanency.
Ques. Would it be right to say that the Lord delighted in the evidence of the work of the Father, and He takes it on immediately in view of assembly structure?
J.T. Just so. "My Father worketh hitherto", He says, "and I work". The Father took the lead in everything, you might say. The Father is first; He is supreme. The economy is what is hardly understood much by us, but we have the supremacy of the Father in the economy, and then the Son and then the Spirit. The order is in chapter 28 of this book, "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". The three divine Persons are seen there.
P.H.H. Is it your point that the Father comes in here immediately, over against all the speculations in Christendom, as we might say, to reveal to Peter?
J.T. Just so. The Lord challenges the disciples as to who men said that He was, and the disciples could hardly give an answer, but Peter gave an answer. I mean to say, there was no answer except the one that Peter gave, and that was through the Father. It was the supreme answer; there could he nothing greater than it. It all deals with the Person of Christ, and life, particularly life.
{223}
Ques. Why does the Lord say, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee"?
J.T. It was in contrast to all that had existed earlier, even in the service of God; it was a new thought entirely. The Father is intervening Himself to answer the question that was raised. So the Lord says, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". It is the supreme answer; there could be no greater.
Ques. The spirituality of the matter is thus emphasised?
J.T. Well, I would say so, the spirituality of it, and the living character of it too, because it was a question of life. It is "the living God", not simply God. In @Genesis 1 we have "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", and so forth, but here it is "the living God". It is a question of life and a new order of things entirely different from anything that God had been going on with.
P.H.H. Do you mean that "the living God" and "the Son of the living God" would stand over against all the deadness of accredited religion before?
J.T. Just so. 'Deadness' is a good word on this point, because Christendom is just dead. But when we come to the Sadducees and Pharisees it is worse than that, for their attack is not merely deadness, but it is satanic, and we have satanic darkness abroad at the present time. So it is not only deadness, but satanic work. It is what belongs to the unseen world and it is still active in opposition to what is of God.
Ques. Is this operation of the Father a necessary thing for each one of us?
J.T. If you apply @John 3, I would say that it is, but this is, of course, a special thing. We are dealing with special things. What is ordinary in believers, or in men and women, is one thing, but special
{224}
things, or specialities, are another, and Peter had a special revelation.
Ques. That is to bring out the truth, which is for all of us?
J.T. Just so. We are to be onlookers. It is one thing to be a specialty, to have a special thought or to lead in anything, but it is another thing to be a bystander or an onlooker. In a certain sense we are called into bystanding; that is, entering into the thing in that sense, but not the specialist. We are dealing now with a special matter, and that is that Peter has this great privilege, and that is what the Lord stresses as He answers him.
Rem. I was noticing that the Lord does not say this of the others who were there, but only of Peter.
J.T. That is just what I am trying to say, that Peter is a specialist here. He has got a special matter, and the Father has taken him up. It is a question of the Father's selection. There is no other one like it. Paul, of course, has a similar word but, as I said, Paul says, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me". God had done it, but it has not the same distinction as Peter has here. In Paul's case it was not to establish a new system, or a new line of thought, whereas in Peter's case it was. It was the foundational thought.
Eu.R. The "*Thou*" is emphatic -- "*Thou* art Peter". Would that involve what you are saying?
J.T. It does, fully. These special pronouns in the gospels are very important to notice, and Matthew's gospel is specially marked by them.
H.H. You get the thought of Peter as a stone in relation to the Rock. There is a very close connection, is there not?
J.T. Quite. It is part of the rock, you might say, but it is distinct; it is an entity. It is not a structure, yet it is an entity.
{225}
Ques. Does that fit in with the word, "To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house", @1 Peter 2: 4.
J.T. That is the structure, but here it is the foundation. "To whom coming" *is* the foundation. Movement is the point, I think, when you come to the persons of the saints, but the revelation is a sovereign act of the Father's. It is a sovereign act. It does not bring in all the saints at all; I mean to say, not each individual. The structure, of course, is in mind, but the action of the Father is a sovereign action, and no one else has any part in it directly. It is a sovereign action of the Father in Peter's soul.
R.W.S. At the moment?
J.T. Well, at the moment; the Spirit had to come in to make it effective, but it was there anyway. It was the Father's action. And so, corresponding to this, it says, in @Luke 11: 13, "If therefore *ye*, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?". But in this case it is the sovereign action of the Father. No one else has part in it but Peter. We come into it, of course, in due time through redemption and the Spirit, but this is a sovereign action of the Father, and the Lord says, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee", notice "to thee" -- "but my Father who is in the heavens". It is a sovereign action of the Father.
F.C.H. Do you connect the sovereign action with what the Lord says, "*I* also, I say unto thee ... I will build my assembly"?
J.T. Just so. It is an "*I* also", but it is the second thought. The Father has the first thought, but the Lord says, "*I* also". That is, the Lord is taking the second place. He also does something,
{226}
and He says something to Peter, "I say unto thee". He called Peter 'a stone'.
Ques. Would you say that the assembly has been given to Christ by the Father?
J.T. I would like the quotation from Scripture to cover your question. What scripture are you alluding to?
Rem. @John 6: 37, "All that the Father gives me shall come to me".
J. T. I would go with that.
H.H. Would you say a little more on sovereignty, and how it applies at the present time?
J.T. It is a word that applies peculiarly to the Father. Of course, the Son has sovereign rights too, and the Spirit has sovereign rights, but it is a term applicable peculiarly to the Father.
P.H.H. Would you be free to connect this at all with the mention of Moriah in the Old Testament? It means, 'that which Jehovah shows', both in connection with Abraham and later in connection with Solomon, where Solomon built the house.
J.T. Quite so. These are sovereign actions. Zion was a symbol of what is sovereign.
P.H.H. May I just read the verse, in @2 Chronicles 3: 1, "And Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah", which means 'shown by Jehovah', "where he appeared to David his father". I wondered whether the showing by Jehovah was at all comparable with the Father revealing to Peter.
J.T. It is very like it. You feel peculiarly about this chapter, how sovereignty comes into it. It is the laying of the foundation of Christianity. It is not the millennium, but Christianity; that is, Christianity to be known in the assembly, because we have to regard things in this way.
E.S.H. Does the Canaanitish woman in chapter 15 also involve sovereignty?
{227}
J.T. That passage contains a group of facts which characterise the Lord's ministry here, but I do not think it is specially a matter of the sovereignty of the Father.
P.L. Is the Father in all this actuated by love for His Son, that where He is rejected He should have a vessel -- the assembly -- where He could give His mind?
J.T. Well, you have to come to that, but what is the particular thing you allude to here?
P.L. The sovereignty of the Father. Is it not a matter of love with Him that the Lord rejected should have a vessel He could call His assembly?
J.T. Just so. We have not come to it, though. I think we should try and keep to the passage, verse by verse; it is so full and important.
Ques. Do you mean that whilst Peter was assembly material, the assembly was still prospective?
J.T. Still prospective, because the Spirit had not come down. Everything waited for the Spirit coming down, and the Spirit coming down awaited the Lord going to heaven. It was not simply the dying and the resurrection of Christ, but the going to heaven, and the exaltation of Christ.
A.B. Would the reference to "my Father who is in the heavens" have relation to the Father's supremacy in His own sphere?
J.T. Just so. It is the place He has. It is heaven having pre-eminence in all these things, and then it is not simply heaven, but "the heavens", and that brings in the whole point of the heavens, and where they are and what they are. Elsewhere we get the third heaven, and then we get what is beyond all the heavens, and that the Lord has gone as far as that. These are questions that need to be answered in our souls, because the Lord went beyond all the heavens, into a non-created condition which the creatures do not reach.
{228}
Eu.R. Have you in mind that "*Thou* art Peter" involves the sovereign work of God in the believer?
J.T. Peter had made a confession and that confession was that Christ was the Son of the living God. As we have noticed, it is not simply the Son of God, but "the Son of the living God", and then the Lord says, "*Thou* art Peter, and on this rock ..." meaning that "this rock" is the Lord Himself.
Eu.R. Would you say that the stone really is akin to the rock, and does that involve that the believer is taken account of in an abstract way as the subject of the work of God?
J.T. I suppose that would be right, but I think it is well to take account of the foundation by itself. There is only one foundation. The Rock is the foundation, and the Rock is the Christ.
J.T.Jr. It was what the Father did. The Lord did not do it; the Father did it, and that stands by itself?
J.T. Yes, quite so, and then the Lord just takes it on; He adds, "I say unto thee ..." The Lord takes on things, so as to give them form and bring them into the concrete structural position. But then everything, in this sense, awaited the death, resurrection and ascension of Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Ques. Is there perfect continuity in that work, in the Father and the Son, and, as soon as it was needful for the Spirit to come, He comes?
J.T. Very good. One has often wondered at the absence of any allusion to the Spirit in @1 Corinthians 8. We have, "there is one God, the Father ... and one Lord, Jesus Christ". One has often wondered why the Spirit is not mentioned there. But we have to make way for Him, and I think God has helped us to do so in recent times. There must be room for the Spirit. We must have the three Persons as in
{229}
this gospel: "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".
J.P. What are we to learn from the Lord's words in the end of verse 18, "Hades gates shall not prevail against it"? The footnote refers to the character of the opposition.
J.T. It is the unseen world in its activity. In warfare an unseen or hidden position gives a great advantage, and so it is that Hades is a hidden position and it has a great advantage, but the Lord says it will not prevail; in spite of its advantage it will not prevail. So that the advantage is in divine hands in everything.
A.J.G. The revelation by the Father in Peter's soul was a hidden matter, was it not?
J.T. Just so. It had to come out and it has come out.
P.H.H. You mean it has come out in ministry?
J.T. Quite so.
P.H.H. What is involved in the double expression "the Christ" and then "the Son of the living God"?
J.T. Well, I suppose "the Christ" is the Messiah. That is to say, it covers the whole matter of Israel's place, which is awaiting the fulness of the nations, but still Israel's place has to come in. "The Christ" involves Israel's place, only it is a term which also fits in in Christianity. Peter says, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God", so that "the Christ" has a place in Christianity. The chapter has to do with Christianity, in truth, as is evident in the chapter itself.
Ques. Does it show that what belonged to Israel was not overlooked, but the assembly takes precedence?
J.T. The assembly takes precedence over Israel. I would accept that fully.
{230}
Rem. Because the Lord does not say anything more, or speak about anything else but the assembly.
J.T. Quite so; and so in @Acts 1, when the disciples inquired as to whether the kingdom would come in immediately, the Lord says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority", and therefore the Lord tells them what they are to do, and that the Spirit was to come upon them. That was the point for them to learn and to go on with, rather than to refer to Israel.
A.J.G. Is not the thought of "the Christ" greatly enlarged in Christianity, especially in the epistle to the Ephesians?
J.T. I would say that fully.
J.McK. Would this structure have specially the earth in mind, and administration on the earth, as in keeping with Matthew generally, involving the present time?
J.T. It involves the earth, but Peter had committed to him the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, according to this chapter: "And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens". Well, that is that earth is not everything, it is only touched on here; the heavens are pre-eminent in this passage. In view of Christianity and the assembly the heavens are pre-eminent; so that the truth is that the assembly comes down from God out of heaven. It is not an earthly thing at all; it is indigenous to heaven, and the sooner we make that plain to each other and generally, the safer we are, because earth is one thing and heaven is another, and the assembly belongs to heaven. It comes down from God out of heaven, "having the glory of God" -- it is a marvellous statement!
{231}
Ques. Is that what Peter had to learn in @Acts 10, as to the vessel coming down from heaven like a sheet?
J.T. Just so. It is a four-cornered thing, which alludes to what is universal, but it is all taken up to heaven. It goes up to heaven to stay there, clearly, and I suppose the assembly is involved in it.
H.F.N. Is that why in Edinburgh, in reference to the Holy Spirit, you were impressing the fact upon us that He is dwelling in us and in the assembly, and not exactly down here on earth?
J.T. That is very good, because many times one has heard or discerned that the Spirit is regarded as on earth, whereas it is not so literally. The Spirit is in the assembly; He is in a vessel, and so, in Elijah's day, things were to be put in vessels.
Ques. "On this rock I will build my assembly". Is it in your mind that "I will build" involves His glorification?
J.T. Quite so. It must be, because it is a question of the Spirit coming down. He said to the disciples that He was going to heaven and that they would do greater things than He was doing on earth, so that the heavenly position is shown thus to be pre-eminent.
Rem. Would you say then a little more about the rock? It seems as though at this time the rock was existing, but that the building of the assembly was a future idea.
J.T. That is true. There was no building until Christ died and went to heaven. The building is by the Spirit, and although it is accredited to the Lord Jesus, yet the actual immediate building is by the Spirit. The Spirit is operating as One sent from heaven.
F.C.H. Is that covered by the expression in @Hebrews 3: 3? "For *he* has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has
{232}
built it has more honour than the house. For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things is God". He who built all is God.
J.T. Well, that is the Deity stressed, but as identified here with Christ. He was the builder; and not one thing was done without Him -- that is, God in that sense. The first chapter of John's gospel shows that, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God ... All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being". That is, He is God Himself. I think that is the idea in the passage in @Hebrews 3 to which you allude.
F.C.H. Would that connect with this scripture as the one who builds -- "I will build"?
J.T. Quite so. The Son builds, and the Son is God Himself. So it is in John's epistle, "He is the true God and eternal life", and that shows how Scripture changes things for us and makes them intelligible to us, so that we can compare spiritual with spiritual and not contradict anything that is in Scripture. We ought to be clear that everything that Scripture says is absolutely right.
G.H.M. Is there any link with Paul's reference to the foundation? "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ".
J.T. That is a good question. That is @1 Corinthians 3, whereas we are dealing now with @Matthew 16, but I think we have to see that Paul's line implies a foundation too. There is no other foundation laid but Jesus Christ, but that does not set aside what Peter states here as a confession. Paul does not deny what Peter says. They are both agreed really, for Paul is supported by Peter in his epistle. There is no disagreement, I would say, in the two statements. There is just one foundation really, and we get it again in the epistle to Timothy. It says,
{233}
"the firm foundation of God stands", that would cover both, "having this seal, the Lord knows those that are his", showing that divine Persons know everything. Everything is within their reach in the sense of knowledge.
G.H.M. That confirms your thought that the Person is the foundation.
Ques. Why do you think the Lord says, "And I also"? Would that substantiate His deity?
J.T. It substantiates His right to speak as the Father speaks. The Father and the Son are agreed. That brings out another matter, how the divine Persons are one. We never should say they are united; they are one. The divine Persons are one. "I and the Father are one".
Ques. Does that not result in the synchronisation of divine operations?
J.T. Just so. Sometimes in John's writings you can hardly say whether it is the Father or the Son; it is often so; They are one.
W.C. May I ask if the building here is viewed as complete or still going on, that is anticipatively of the Spirit's day?
J.T. It is still going on, because we are in the Spirit's day. I think we might say that this is the Spirit's day, although I do not think that it is actually scriptural. "The Spirit was not yet", it says in @John 7, "because Jesus had not yet been glorified", and that helps us as to the presence of the Spirit here below. "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified". So that the two things synchronise.
A.J.G. So that whilst the building is attributed here to the Lord, in that He says, "I will build", does it actually take place by the Holy Spirit acting through gift?
J.T. That is what I would say. The Holy Spirit is sent down, and He is the great Operator, and I
{234}
believe the word *expanse* in @Genesis 1 is to give scope for divine operations, and that is the position at the present time.
W.C. Would you say how it links on with the building of the woman, in @Genesis 2?
J.T. I think it is used as a type. It is the first type of the kind that we get and the first time the word 'built' is used. I think it just alludes to the assembly secretly, as it were, or covertly introduced, and how often we have found joy in the thought of it! "Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman", @Genesis 2: 22.
P.H.H. Do you think the building in @Genesis 2 is to be viewed as a completed thing?
J.T. It will be noticed that Jehovah did not say anything, but He allowed Adam to say it. It says, "And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead. And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man. And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man". The brethren will notice that God is not said to say anything in all that statement. It is what He does, but Adam says the things. God is honouring His servant. And so it is earlier that He brought the animals to Adam, that he should name them, and so Adam named his wife too; he calls her 'woman'.
P.H.H. Is it in your mind then that this scripture in @Genesis 2 views the assembly as a completed thing; that it does not refer so much to process of time?
J.T. Well, of course, the word 'complete' might fit there, but as to teaching or instruction it is not completed. We have to wait for the Spirit to come down and redemption accomplished, before it could
{235}
be completed. I am sure you have in your mind what is right in a sense, but I think we ought here to keep to the Scriptures. How could we say the figure is complete? It is just a figure.
P.H.H. I must confess that I thought that, in a certain sense, the building was still going on, viewing it as a type, and God now doing it by the Holy Spirit. I thought that it was still going on, but perhaps I am wrong in that. Perhaps it is the complete assembly as the woman that is to be in our minds.
J.T. Well, it is only a type, of course. The real thing now is going on by the Spirit, what we have in the Spirit.
Rem. So that in @Ephesians 2, whilst it speaks of the future, "the building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord", it also says, "in whom ye also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" -- as though there was a certain touch of completeness at the present time.
J.T. Well, that is Ephesians. That is real building by the Spirit.
R.W.S. Does the expression in verse 21, "From that time", suggest that all that has preceded now has to be worked out. It is all anticipative up till now, but the Lord has to go to Jerusalem and suffer and die and be raised, for the working out of all this great matter.
J.T. Quite so, and I can see that now clearly, that the Lord has enjoined silence as to this great matter; it is an assembly matter. It is not a public matter, and never is a public matter really. It is a wonderful secret; it is a mystery. The assembly is a mystery, and Paul says he had the mystery of the assembly. So that we are not to speak about it in the ordinary sense at all, because man does not understand it. He simply does not understand it, and, as we have said before, the truth is to be hidden
{236}
sometimes and concealed from the natural mind. It only harms men if we instruct them beyond their spiritual ability. If they are not converted, they only spoil the truth, if they talk about it at all. We have to leave the truth as it is presented to us in the Scriptures, and leave it to be brought out by the ministry of the Spirit; and we have that, for we have the Spirit by whom we can minister. So that we have the word, "He enjoined on his disciples that they should say to no man that he was the Christ". So we had better just deny the natural mind information about the things of God, because it only builds up Christendom, which is to be destroyed, according to Revelation.
Ques. Is the silence enjoined in verse 20 in keeping with the sovereignty of the revelation to which you have referred?
J.T. It is. It is in keeping with the truth, and the truth is that spiritual matters should not be exposed or opened up to the natural mind; it just spoils them.
Rem. "Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, lest they trample them with their feet, and turning round rend you", @Matthew 7: 6.
J.T. I think that is a very good word.
A.J.G. I suppose if the Lord had been made known as the Christ before He had died, people would have thought that He had come in to improve the world and set up man in the flesh.
J.T. That is what they intended to do, according to John's gospel.
Ques. Ought anything to be said as to the terrible attack on the truth of the Rock, that has been made by the Jezebel system? I was wondering if hades gates had made a tremendous attack on the truth of the Rock, in asserting that the rock is Peter.
{237}
J.T. Quite so. We know what the system that we have already alluded to has made of it; they make Peter the foundation of the assembly, and there could not be anything more false.
A.P.B. Is it noteworthy that the Lord Jesus here does not use a parable or a type, but for the first time says, "My assembly", bringing it into great prominence.
J.T. The Lord is claiming it for Himself. It is wonderful, and we all should cherish it. We have it in the service of God every Lord's day morning professedly, but it is wonderful that the Lord can say of the assembly, "My assembly".
A.B. Would it suggest how precious it is to Him and how He will protect it?
J.T. I am sure He does protect it.
P.H.H. We may expect that the service in the assembly will go on till the end?
J.T. I think so. It will go on until the Lord is pleased to take us up. He has definitely told us that we are going to be taken up, in the passage, "The Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then *we*, the living who remain, shall be caught up". Not till that happens will the Spirit depart. The Spirit is here now and He is helping us.
A.J.G. When you say that Christ is Himself the Rock on which the assembly is built, do you mean that it is the Person of Christ as presented in ministry or the Person of Christ as held in the affections of the saints, or both?
J.T. Well, of course, the Lord's own instruction, "On this rock I will build my assembly", is an anticipative thing. It is a thing which He is going to do, but it would all depend on His death and resurrection and ascension to heaven and the Spirit's coming down, before you could have the real building
{238}
going on. I mean to say, we must have truth; we must have ministry, and the ministry lies in the Spirit; it is going on all the time.
P.H.H. Would it be right to say that it is Christ subjectively formed in the saints?
J.T. Well, it is. It is brought down from heaven really, in a certain sense, but it is ministry by the Spirit, and ministry by gift too. He has given gifts to men, and gifts are being used. So that it says, "some apostles, and some prophets, ... and some shepherds and teachers"; and so forth. The Lord did that. The work is going on, in the power of gift, which is a most important thing, and it should be made room for.
J.T.Jr. On the first day of the week the Lord would come to us and He would have something to say to us every time He came in?
J.T. Just so, and we greet Him. When He comes in, there is a change in our attitude, and normally there is a stir too in our affections, because we are gradually coming up to the idea of the oneness of the body, the actual fact of the body of Christ and the brethren of Christ.
R.B. Was the sovereign revelation of the Father to Peter peculiar to him or is that extended to us now?
J.T. It has come in because the Spirit has come in, on the ground of redemption, the word 'redemption' there implying that He has gone into heaven and angels and principalities are subject to Him, and so the work proceeds. It is a thing that has happened once; that is to say, the Lord Jesus has been raised from the dead and has ascended into heaven, and angels and principalities are subject to Him, and the work proceeds because the Spirit is here. The gifts are going on in their work; so that this is not a matter that takes place in every soul, it is light for every soul to come into. This chapter involves
{239}
the light, and that light is maintained by the Spirit. I would again repeat that this chapter is light. To say that every believer gets such a revelation as this is not right, but the light is here, and the Holy Spirit is here to shed the light and make it effective.
Rem. So that in the passage you have already quoted in Ephesians, the operations of the gifts are "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God".
J.T. Just so. That is what is going on; it is going on today.
W.C. Might not this truth be described as church property? It has come out and now it is the property of the church.
J.T. It is church property; not church property in the sense that it is in the *Collected Writings* or any other writings of man, but the Spirit of God has put it into our hearts and maintains it in our hearts, so that it will remain there eternally. The building is thus secured permanently, and that is, I believe, what the word 'stone' involves. It implies the permanency of the building, the rock, of course, being the foundation. The Lord says, "And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens". And then we have already quoted verse 20, where all is protected. We are not to spread things abroad, as it says, "Then he enjoined on his disciples that they should say to no man that he was the Christ". Verse 19 is the administration given to Peter. It was given to Peter by One who has authority to give. Only One could give the keys; that is to say, the Lord has the authority to do it. He has the authority of the kingdom of the heavens, and He has given that authority to Peter.
{240}
S.B. Would it be right to say that those keys could not be used until Peter, to whom they were entrusted, had been himself brought into the truth of what was involved in them as opening the door and speaking of Jesus as the Christ, to the Jew on the day of Pentecost, and to the gentile in Cornelius house?
J.T. Yes, that is the truth, and Peter was the man that we are dealing with here. Then in @Acts 2 we see he is fitted now to open the door, and there were three thousand people opened to. Peter stood up with the eleven; all the apostles were recognised. It was a question of apostleship, persons who could do things, and Peter was the leader of it all. So they said, "What shall we do, brethren?" and Peter said, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit". That had to come about and they were suitable persons to bring it about. The vessel was there.
S.B. And then he has to be instructed as to Cornelius and the gentiles by means of the vision of the sheet and its contents.
J.T. Peter is fitted to be the vessel for opening the door to the gentiles as well as to the Jews, the Jews first and also the gentiles. We want to get that one point that Peter is established to open the door. "I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens", and so forth. Peter is established in that position. Nobody else but Peter had the keys of the kingdom.
P.H.H. Could a word be said about the mention of Satan in verse 23. "He said to Peter, Get away behind me, Satan". Is that concentration of hostility, his name means 'the adversary'?
J.T. It shows, I think, what material we are, to which the Lord puts His hand, what unfaithful material we are. It is remarkable that the Lord
{241}
allows this to happen in Peter's case, just after he had been wonderfully honoured in being enabled to make the confession as to the Son of God. Immediately after that happened he becomes Satan. It is very remarkable and very terrible, and very humbling, that it should happen.
A.J.G. Does it show how unspirituality exposes us to Satan?
J.T. It does indeed. It just shows even with a person who is a real Christian, a real spiritual man, how the devil can get in. It reminds us of David too, and how a similar thing happened. We have thus to challenge our own hearts and find out what they are capable of. I often think of it, even at the Lord's supper, what am I capable of, and refer to it, too. It says, "the same night in which he was betrayed ..." Well, who betrayed Him? It was Judas, one of the apostles.
Ques. Did Moses have to learn that, in putting his hand into his bosom after he was commissioned?
J.T. Quite so. It was to prepare him for the great service that was being opened up to him.
Eu.R. Would you say something as to the connection of the mind with this? The Lord says, "Thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men". Does not the mind come in very much in relation to the Lord's supper?
J.T. It does, but it shows what we are all capable of, and how we have to keep our hearts, according to the word, "Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded; for out of it are the issues of life", @Proverbs 4: 23.
P.L. Is this how the mystery of iniquity would work in opposition to the truth? The things that are of men will culminate in the man of sin, will they not?
J.T. Just so. We have the word in that connection. "There is he who restrains now until he be
{242}
gone". That is a great comfort. But then it goes on "and then the lawless one shall be revealed". As soon as the hand of God is lifted, the wicked one will be revealed. The Spirit of God is now standing in the way, and the government of God is also standing in the way, and the powers that be are standing in the way. But when these are removed, then we shall have the apostasy; it is a terrible thought.
Ques. Do you link that with hades gates?
J.T. Just so. The devil is not showing himself all the time. The word 'hades' implies that he is hidden, but he is operating, nevertheless.
Rem. He would attack those nearest to the Lord, if he could.
P.H.H. The antidote in us being denying ourselves and taking up the cross?
J.T. That is just what we should touch on, and close.
P.H.H. "If any one desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me". That keeps Satan out, I suppose?
J.T. Yes, quite so. Then it goes on: "For what does a man profit, if he should gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to each according to his doings. Verily I say unto you, There are some of those standing here" (a very wonderful thing would happen here), "that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom". That is the end of chapter 16.
{243}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (9)
@Matthew 17:1 - 27
J.T. The line of truth still before us is the assembly, and what is immediately before us now is the mount of transfiguration. It may be remarked that the idea of the mountain is very prominent in Matthew, beginning in chapter 5 and going on to the last chapter. This has some bearing on the whole gospel, for it implies the idea of elevation. It has a bearing on the truth of the assembly because the epistle to the Ephesians has moral elevation in mind. In the Acts it speaks about Paul coming to Ephesus by the upper districts. The truth of the assembly and its service God-ward involves elevation. I suppose the bearing would be moral, although the literal side is seen here. "After six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart. And he was transfigured before them". The thought now would be to apprehend the meaning of the transfiguration; why it should be. Luke says that the Lord was transfigured *as He prayed*. Prayer enters into it therefore in that gospel, so that the attitude of the Lord, in these cases, must be taken as meaning something. Here it is just that He was "transfigured before them", but Luke says, "He went up into a mountain to pray", and He was transfigured in prayer, so that the service of God would evidently involve prayer.
P.H.H. Does the idea of sovereignty continue in this passage? That is, the Lord sovereignly selecting Peter, and James, and John his brother, not all the disciples.
J.T. I suppose that would point to the divine selection in service, service committed to certain persons. Things have to be done, and certain brothers
{244}
or servants are particularly fitted to do them. No doubt it will appear in this meeting that certain ones are doing certain things.
A.J.G. I wondered if the Lord in taking Peter, James and John with Him, indicated that they were equal to being in that elevated position. Would that be right?
J.T. Quite so; they were equal to the position. The selection would correspond with the equality. Clearly the divine selection in the inauguration of Christianity as seen in the selection of the apostles must come into view in that sense. Therefore Peter comes first for he is the leading one as it says in @Matthew 10, "first, Simon, who was called Peter". Paul was evidently selected later and taken out of a sinful condition, and yet, you might say, he is made the chief servant of the assembly.
A.J.G. We know something of the distinct place that Peter and John had in service, but is it not remarkable that James was favoured in this way, and yet the Lord allowed Herod to put him to death early so that we have no record of any specific service by James.
Rem. Might that be, do you think, because we only have the record of the end of these three, as far as I know? John, in the island of Patmos; Peter who was to be martyred, and James slain by the sword.
J.T.Jr. The apostles at the beginning had to take on a lead, I suppose, as the Lord had left them. He was no longer amongst them, and so it would be a question of what they could do. Peter shows what he could do as giving the ministry at the beginning of the Acts.
E.T.S. Does Peter show how qualified he was by the record he gave in his second epistle of this very incident?
{245}
A.J.G. That is an interesting example of how we may arrive at the spiritual gain of a matter, although we may not be fully equal to it at the time. In that account he eliminates his own unspiritual suggestion as to three tabernacles but concentrates on the glory of the position, and that they were with Christ in it.
R.W. Would you say a little more about being equal to it?
A.J.G. I suppose we are all equal to it by divine workmanship, and as having the Spirit. Of course, here Peter, James and John had not yet the Spirit, but I thought perhaps it was intended to convey the idea of what the saints of the assembly arc equal to in the way of privilege. At the end of the chapter they are sons.
M.A.W. Would @Galatians 4 suggest the moral elevation? It says "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother". Are we to be drawn to recognise that kinship?
A.J.G. I suppose the liberty of sonship is the great distinction of the assembly.
P.H.H. Does John make a concentrated reference to this in his first chapter? "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", @John 1: 14.
J.T. It says, "We have contemplated his glory", does it not? Of course, that was true here.
P.H.H. Would that be an apostolic reference?
J.T. I think it would in the sense in which John gives it. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". So that the contemplation of His glory would be concentrated. "The law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ". So that although we might touch on John, the chapter before us brings in sonship, and we do not get sonship in John, except once, save as applying to the Lord Himself. The Lord is presented as the "beloved Son" in John and so it is here, but we do
{246}
not get the sonship of the saints in John. We only get it once in his writings and that is in @Revelation 21: 7. So that the matter before us now is sonship. The Lord is said to have taken "Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart. And he was transfigured before them". And then we have the voice from heaven.
Ques. Is it not to become a principle in the assembly that we are to listen to Christ, "hear him"?
J.T. That is undoubtedly the main point; that the saints were to hear Christ. The voice uttered its word immediately. It says, "While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him". That they were to hear Him is undoubtedly the main point, but at the same time we have the word as to the Son: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". Then what corresponds with all this is the incident spoken of in verse 22: "While they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and the third day he shall be raised up. And they were greatly grieved. And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the didrachmas came to Peter and said, Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas? He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him". So that the question now comes up as to sonship, and it continues, "saying, What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers? Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free. But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened
{247}
its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee". I think this thought of association has to be taken into account in relation to the whole chapter. The Lord is associating His people with Himself. "Take that and give it to them for me and thee". So the Lord associates us with Himself in such circumstances.
Ques. It says, He "brings them up into a high mountain apart". Is that the Lord taking them into His circumstances?
J.T. I think He places them in a position where they could see what He had in His mind for them; what the divine mind was. It is in keeping with Matthew, as I was saying, for there are seven mountains spoken of in the book, and this one is one of them. So that the idea is elevation, but elevation in order that there should be observation.
A.J.G. Would it be right to say that the result of His being transfigured was that they were permitted to see Him in the glory that is proper to sonship in heaven?
J.T. That is what I thought, because we are dealing now with Matthew, and we come into the idea of the assembly after chapter 13, which we had yesterday. The assembly comes into view and then we have these chapters involving association, because we must have association if we are to have part with Him. The Lord said to Peter in @John 13, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me", and this chapter involves part with Him too. But the first thing here is observation, observation occasioned and given an opportunity for by elevation. Why should we not be elevated morally to see things, because seeing is an immense feature of the scriptural records?
A.J.G. So that the Father's voice here is not presented as spoken to Christ, but as addressed to Peter, James and John.
{248}
J.T. Just so. That was the idea. The Lord intended that too, because it says He told them not to tell the vision, "Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one, until the Son of man be risen up from among the dead". That must happen before this is spread abroad. The Father's voice is heard immediately Peter speaks about the tabernacles. Peter is foolish, really, to say, "Let us make here three tabernacles". It was a foolish remark and the voice from heaven comes immediately. So that Peter's idea is simply drowned, which is a good thing where people are foolish in what they say. So that it says, "While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, *This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him. And the disciples hearing it fell upon their faces, and were greatly terrified. And Jesus coming to them touched them, and said, Rise up, and be not terrified. And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus alone". And then they descended. After they get their view the Lord comes down to the plain.
Wm.H. In referring to the word 'eye-witnesses' in his second epistle, Peter uses an expression implying not only a person who views a thing afar off, but a participator in it.
J.T. Just so. He says, "Being with him on the holy mountain" and he speaks of "the excellent glory", so that by that time he had got right; and he had got right in the light of the fact that he is to be martyred. It is his last letter, and it is the only place where you get Peter mentioning sonship as to the saints, for that is involved in "being with him".
P.H.H. Is the "excellent glory" in the chapter quoted a kind of title of God, such a voice being uttered to him "by the excellent glory"? Would that be a reference to God?
{249}
J.T. I would say it would be Deity as we see it in the expression, "the fulness" of the Godhead. So that in @Colossians 2 you have the idea of the personal deity of Christ, but in chapter 1 "the fulness" is mentioned by itself. It is mentioned as a noun; it is a name pointing to Deity.
R.B. I would like some help as to the distinction between this voice out of the cloud and the revelation to Peter. He says, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God", but here it is, "This is my beloved Son".
J.T. Well, of course, it was a revelation, and the Lord interpreted what Peter said as coming from the Father, but we have not got the Father's voice in chapter 16. It is not a question of voice there; it is a revelation. The Lord explains: "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". It is the Father's revelation. It is not a voice but a revelation that is made to someone, which is a very different thing. Here there is no revelation; it is a voice declaring that the Son is there: "*This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". The Father's voice is identifiable, but in chapter 16 it is a revelation; there is no voice. In chapter 16, the speaking is by Christ Himself to Peter, but here there is a voice from heaven. It says: "While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them". It was not a darkening cloud; as the note says, it was bright -- the excellent glory. It means that it did not darken. The note goes on to say, 'The word is used in the Septuagint for the cloud which took possession of the tabernacle and filled it with glory, @Exodus 40: 34, 35'. Now that is to be noticed, that the cloud was a brightening cloud. It was not a darkening or confusing cloud; it was a brightening cloud, and the question raised in this is the frequency of the use of the word 'cloud' in regard of
{250}
divine Persons. The Lord Jesus is to come with clouds, and every eye shall see Him, and so forth, so that the bright cloud here is remarkable. It is the presence of divine Persons, we might say. The voice comes out of the cloud.
Ques. It is only in this gospel that we get the statement "in whom I have found my delight". Does that suggest that the personnel of the assembly are peculiarly fitted to share the Father's pleasure in His beloved Son?
J.T. Exactly, very good. 'Personnel' is a good word to refer to the members of the assembly.
H.H. How do you understand Moses and Elias being present? *They* were talking with Him.
J.T. Well, they represent certain earlier ministries. The stress is on them. It does not say Jesus talking with them, but they talking with Him, showing the distinction they had. "And lo, Moses and Elias appeared to them talking with him", meaning that they were speaking with the Lord. These men are distinguished, as God loves to do with His people, if it is necessary to emphasise the truth. They were talking with Him; a very precious thing to be allowed to talk *with* the Lord Jesus. It is not *to* Him but *with* Him; so that association is in the chapter.
A.J.G. Do you think Moses and Elias were on the mount and talking with Jesus in order that, in them God might set out what Peter, James and John were to take on?
J.T. I suppose so; they would be examples. That is to say, it is bringing the Old Testament into the New and giving it full distinction; for Moses and Elias acquire full distinction in this wonderful scene. So that at a time like this, even now among ourselves, if the Lord is pleased to give anyone distinction we ought to recognise it. There were two here recognised in distinction, and then three are
{251}
brought up to the mountain. These are distinguished too, only they fail in it, whereas Moses and Elias do not fail in their distinction. Presently we have to reckon with Peter again because Peter alludes to this same scene in his second epistle. He said to the saints that he thought it right to write to them because the Lord had shown him that he was about to die. "As also", he says, "our Lord Jesus Christ has manifested to me". So that he was fully brought into it in his own epistle.
Rem. He does not mention Moses and Elias in that account. He says "*We* ... being with him on the holy mountain".
J.T. Quite so; it was an apostolic pre-eminence, and Peter shared in it. The "*we*" are the apostles.
J.S.E. May I ask a question relative to our reading on Lord's day afternoon, in this connection? Does this appearing of Moses and Elias illustrate the right of heaven to assert itself at any given time to reach a certain end?
J.T. That is very good. I would like to hear further what you have in mind as regards this point.
J.S.E. I think we were all powerfully impressed with the reading on Lord's day, and I wondered if this coming forward of Moses and Elias represents to us this right of heaven to assert itself in bringing two such persons forward, known to us in a previous dispensation, but to augment the position so that these three brothers go forward from now in the power of what they had seen there.
J.T. Quite so, and then another thing that comes into the mind in this gospel is the statement in chapter 27, "many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and ... entered into the holy city and appeared unto many". We do not know where they are. We do not know just who they were, or where they are, but they came from the Old Testament time, and it indicates to us how the Old Testament
{252}
merges into the New and how the rights of divine Persons are seen in that they can bring forward the Old Testament if necessary, and so Elias is brought forward many times, and so is Moses. God has the right to bring these men forward, because of their distinction in His service. Moses is the author of the Pentateuch, and Elias, we might say, is equally great and glorious in his service in seeking to bring back the ten tribes from their departure. That is the great service that Elijah rendered, but he went back to Horeb, as dear Mr. Revell once said about sixty years ago, to resign his commission -- a very remarkable statement, but God accepted it and in due time called him up to heaven. So God did not at all reduce His valuation of Elijah, nor did He in the least degree reduce His valuation of Moses. They are two of the greatest servants in Old Testament times, and we do well to take notice of distinctions that God is pleased to make in His sovereign ways. He brings the Old Testament into the New and the New Testament into the Old. It is quite right that we should use the Old Testament in ministry because the types are of immense importance in the ministry of the Spirit.
Rem. Although Elijah's garments are mentioned, they were not comparable with these garments that became "white as the light". He is eclipsed by the Lord. Elijah resigned his commission, but the Lord never did.
J.T. It would be impossible for the Lord to resign His commission. He began early by saying, "Lo, I come ... to do, O God, thy will". It would be morally impossible for Him to do anything of the kind, but it was not impossible for Elijah. He went back to Horeb, and Jehovah said, 'What are you doing here', and then he pleads against the people of God, according to the epistle to the Romans. He pleads against them, but the Lord never does that;
{253}
the Lord is always doing the will of God in love to the assembly. He laid down His life for the assembly.
R.W.S. How is it that Peter recognises Moses and Elias? Of all the Old Testament worthies, he knows who they are, and yet he does not really know who was there in the Person of the Lord Jesus. There must have been something identifiable about them for him to name them.
J.T. Quite so, and so the Lord brought them up for further observation, and they would be equal to it, as we already said.
P.H.H. Is there something in the way of intimacy in the way the Father speaks here? Although Peter is being adjusted, yet he is not being driven away; the bright cloud is there.
J.T. And the Lord comes down quietly and appeals to them. It says in verse 8, "Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus alone". Elsewhere it is "Jesus alone with themselves" (@Mark 9: 8) but here it is just "Jesus alone". So that He comes down to be with them as He had been. He resumes His holy, precious, loving relations with His disciples. There is no change in His valuation of them. They are the same three that the Lord selected to bring up. "After six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart. And he was transfigured before them". Evidently it was an intended thing, for it is not simply transfigured, but transfigured *before them*. Their eyes were to see Him. It was an anticipated testimony to what He is now above in heavenly glory. We have not seen Him yet but we shall see Him there in heaven; for we are going to be taken up. As they were taken up, so we shall be taken up, but taken up for ever, to stay there. Just as the sheet was taken up to stay, so it is that the assembly will be taken up to *stay*, because it belongs to heaven.
{254}
F.C.H. Would the "hear him" involve not only what He would say to us, but how He would address Himself to the Father? When we come to @Hebrews 2 we have, according to the prophetic scripture, the Lord speaking to the Father: "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".
J.T. Quite so. It is just what you expect; it is what the Lord does in the service of God in the assembly. That is where He is and His praises go on there: that is where the service of God goes on every Lord's day, and He is in the midst of the assembly. We do not simply carry on the service of God individually; it is in the midst of the assembly, the Lord is there, and He praises the Father there. What a glorious position it is, showing what the service of God is, and how it begins in the assembly.
Ques. You have several times called attention to the thought of change taking place in the service of God. Would this come out here, in that they noticed the change in the Lord, His face shining as the sun? That should have regulated their behaviour.
J.T. Showing that it is just change for the moment; it is just instantaneous, we might say.
Rem. I was thinking of the way the Lord appears to us as a principle connected with the service of God; the way He presents Himself would regulate the service.
J.T. So that we get change. First of all we come from our houses and we come to the place of meeting and each takes his place. We see each other; it is the meeting time, because I do not apprehend that the saints come in and ignore each other, but there is the idea of meeting one another, the word *meeting* fits in there. Then there is a change in the whole position, and the change implies that the saints themselves take on change because immediately the Spirit of God has His place. Something
{255}
happens, and that happening continues on until we come to the leadership of the Lord Jesus as the Minister of the sanctuary, and then the brothers and sisters are no longer to be regarded as brothers and sisters but as sons. They are approaching the Father; they are approaching Him as sons, and so the service goes on. We do not go out from the room as we came in, we go up, and we go up in glory. We go up properly in dignity; not as we came in, because we came in as brothers and sisters, but we go up in dignity. In the book of Ezekiel the worshippers do not go out as they came in, and that applies to the Christian assembly in the service of God. We do not go out as we came in, because a great thing happens. There is great gain every Lord's day, every first day of the week, because of the change that happens.
P.H.H. Is it significant that the word used here "transfigured" is the same word as in @2 Corinthians 3? It says "transformed" or "changed".
J.T. The second epistle to the Corinthians suits the idea of change in the Lord. It says there, "transformed according to the same image from glory to glory". You have that in mind?
P.H.H. Yes. I was going to ask whether that is not the change in the saints as accompanying change in the Lord. It says: "But *we* all ... are transformed ... as by the Lord the Spirit". Your point is that the change is not only in the Lord, but in the saints too?
J.T. Quite so; in fact, the sexes disappear. We are all sons, and the idea of sonship is the point in this chapter.
A.J.G. Does the Father's voice to the disciples give them the capacity to enter into His own affections for the Son? "*This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight".
{256}
J.T. You would expect that the saints or apostles would be affected by that voice. The voice was heard, because Peter says in his epistle, "This voice we heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain". It was when they were with Him.
A.J.G. The Lord in @John 17 says: "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them". Does that fit in here?
J.T. Just so, "and I in them". So that I think we would do well to get the full bearing of this chapter, beginning with the first verse. We have the glory and then the voice from heaven, and then what happens, and then the catching of the fish, to bring in association. The ending implies association, as He said to Peter elsewhere: "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". The service of God carries the idea of part with Christ, and this chapter brings that out.
W.S.S. Would the taking on of change, of which we have been speaking, also regulate us in matters of administration?
J.T. Quite so, if we are happy with each other in, administration, but if we have difficulties they may be very adverse, but in administration we have the word 'twelve'. That is usually the sign of administrative authority or power, and it implies, too, that we love one another: "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves". We must have love amongst ourselves and that is the great power of change. Love is the great power of change among the disciples. But then the Lord comes in and greatly enhances the whole matter, so that as we proceed in the Lord's supper we come to the idea of "My brethren" -- according to @John 20, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". All that enters
{257}
into the idea of the service of God, which begins with the Lord's supper; indeed it begins primarily as the saints come together and sit down together. Love for one another begins to permeate, and then we have the great idea of the Lord's coming in.
Ques. It is only in Matthew's gospel that you get "John his brother". Would that be to emphasise the brotherly relations in these settings?
J.T. It means that they are both the sons of Zebedee, but John is the one that Jesus loved. James was slain with the sword, but John his brother is the great matter, as you say, because John is the one that Jesus loved, and the writer of the great gospel of John. That is a peculiar gospel which brings in the idea of eternal life and all else that goes with it. But I would like to hear further what you have in mind as to "John his brother".
Rem. I was wondering whether, in the working out of the truth and the love that you have referred to, everything should be done in brotherly love, on the line of the verse you have quoted: "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves".
J.T. Quite so, and another thing comes up there; I would not say sisterly love because it is not right, for the sisters become, as you might say, brothers, because when the Lord says "Go to my brethren" He would mean the sisters too. God has helped us on those lines, and I think we are being helped today, and yesterday. We are delighted to have the sisters coming amongst us as the brothers are, not to speak, of course, but to be there to feel things with us and to love one another.
P.H.H. It was a sister to whom the Lord gave the message.
J.T. Quite so. Mary was the great leader. It was Mary Magdalene, not Mary the Lord's mother. On the other hand, referring to Mary the Lord's
{258}
mother, a very striking matter about her is that the Lord says to her, pointing to John, "Behold thy son". That was pointing to John, and implying that John was to be her son, and then she was to be John's mother; that is a matter of change. A sister is capable of that; the sister is capable of being the mother of a son like John. I hope the brethren will understand what I am saying.
P.H.H. Would you say a little more about that, please. We would like to get the benefit of it.
J.T. Well, that is the way the matter stands. The Lord sees the disciple whom He loved, John, and then He says to His mother (although He does not call her 'mother'), "Behold thy son". Some might think that He referred to Himself; but He did not, He referred to John. He placed Mary, His own mother, in the position of being John's mother, and from that time John took Mary, the Lord's mother, to his own home, showing that he took the matter fully up, and I am speaking of it now to show what sisters can do; how the idea of change may come in. A sister can be motherly; although she may not have a husband she can be motherly, and she can love the brethren and care for them. So that I think the Lord is greatly helping us on the line of sisters coming into things and having right feelings; having feelings as the brothers have them.
Ques. Do we come together at the Supper in the wilderness in the spirit of a disciple or in the spirit of sonship?
J.T. It might be as a brother. I mean to say, you might be there as one of the Lord's brethren in the wilderness. Sonship really belongs to the holiest or to the land, so to speak. We are sons in the land. God is leading many sons to glory, not brothers and sisters, but sons. Sonship implies that the sisters as well as brothers are all sons, because they have the Spirit.
{259}
H.F.N. Would you say a word in regard to @Acts 1 as bearing on what you said about Mary? It says: "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren".
J.T. Of course, we cannot say that that was an assembly meeting. They were staying, or abiding, there. It was a sort of rendezvous for the apostles, and the saints of God at that time, at the beginning of Christianity. They met together, and they selected an apostle there, but they were staying there. It was the sort of place, as you might say, that was an abode for them.
Ques. Has the incident of the lunatic son any bearing on the mount of transfiguration by way of contrast?
J.T. It is contrast. It is a very solemn and humbling thing that the Lord said what He did here, "And when they came to the crowd, a man came to him, falling on his knees before him, and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic, and suffers sorely; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water. And I brought him to thy disciples", notice this, "and they were not able to heal him. And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted generation ..." Now let us challenge our hearts as to why the Lord should speak of the disciples like that. He says, "O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you?" How do we understand that the disciples are so designated; the Lord using that ejaculation "O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you?" and then the next thing is: "Bring him here to me". That is to say, His mercy comes out in the midst of all that, but there was something wrong with the disciples. How serious it is that there should be something wrong
{260}
and very wrong, so that the Lord should be obliged to speak of them in this way. Now I would say, dear brethren, that we ought just to face this; why it is that the Lord speaks in this solemn way to the disciples.
P.H.H. Do we sometimes find in a case of difficulty amongst us that the Lord has as much to say to us by way of adjustment as in the case itself?
J.T. Just so, and we need correction oftentimes. We need more correction than we think we need.
P.H.H. It does say that the Lord rebuked him, but before that He had very severely rebuked the disciples, according to verse 17.
J.T. "And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out from him". It was the demon He was dealing with, although He did not speak to the demon, but He said to the disciples, "O unbelieving and perverted generation". He rebuked the demon and cast him out, but I again repeat that verse 17 is a most serious one, and has to be faced. Why should He speak in that stern way to persons who are said to be the disciples?
W.S.S. I was wondering if you would say a word about the kingdom aspect. The end of the previous chapter speaks of the Son of man coming in His kingdom.
J.T. It is a question of the authority of the kingdom. The Lord is presently coming in the authority of the kingdom; He is coming. It is remarkable, it says: "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom". I should think that would point on to Christianity. What do you say?
W.S.S. I was thinking about the two words "with him" which you have stressed already, and how the apprehension of the Lord in this way would make good administrators.
{261}
Wm.H. Would the glory on the mount have to be accompanied with the features of prayer and fasting?
J.T. That is another good remark. One has often spoken of the fact that we do not hear much of fasting and, less, do we see anyone who fasts. It constantly comes up, and it seems as if we have something to learn about it, as to dealing with matters. "This kind", the Lord says, "does not go out but by prayer and fasting". That is, the very demon that He cast out, could only be cast out by prayer and fasting. They were not able to cast him out, and the Lord admits that, because He points out to them that prayer and fasting were a necessity for that. I should think there is a weakness on that point, and probably there is a great weakness amongst the brethren at the present time as to prayer and fasting, because we do not resort much to it. In the book of Esther, for instance, because of the great crisis, Esther asked for fasting and she got it.
H.F.N. In @Acts 13 it was as they were praying and fasting that the Holy Spirit's voice was heard saying: "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul". Would we know more of the Spirit's voice if we were really marked by prayer and fasting?
J.T. Especially when it is a question of the gifts and the exercise of gift of ministry. We might lay our hands on people and pray for them and fast in regard of them, because the power, according to the Lord's word here, only comes that way in certain cases. In certain extreme cases, power only comes in by way of fasting.
Ques. Would prayer and fasting be made most attractive to us as it is said: "Nothing shall be impossible to you"? The Lord does not say 'to Me' but "to you".
J.T. Just so.
{262}
J.P. Matthew is the only gospel that presents the son here as 'lunatic'. Does that indicate the necessity of the mind being adjusted in view of the assembly?
J.T. That is right. That is a matter that humbles many of us. There is so much weakness of mind, as we might say lunacy, in our families. We may as well accept it, and the answer to it is the thought of fasting.
J.P.H. We would like some more help as to how fasting might work out amongst us.
J.T. Well, just fast -- fast for twenty-four hours. See whether you will not have any more power in a crisis if you fast twenty-four hours. I am certain you will have more power if it is a crisis; God will come in for us. I am sure we should resort to it in crises, and difficulties. Thank God, we have not got many of them, but they are apt to come and we ought to be prepared for them, and remember that the Lord says this, prayer and fasting bring power.
Ques. And during the fasting time, you are praying all the while; would that be right?
J.T. Just so. Praying and fasting, praying is preceding fasting, although in the book of Esther there is no praying at all, only fasting.
P.L. "In fastings often", Paul says.
P.H.H. Esther does say: "If I perish, I perish". Was she prepared to go to the limits of the needs of the occasion?
J.T. Quite so, she reached it, and she and Mordecai acquired great power in the kingdom.
Ques. There are many difficulties and sorrowful cases in the families of the brethren. Is this a special word for us, as claiming them for the assembly?
J.T. I feel it for myself because one has this experience. Perhaps you have more to say about it.
{263}
Rem. Only that it comes in this assembly setting, as though the Lord would look for special conditions in difficult cases which God would honour.
J.T. I think that is quite true, and I would urge the brethren to try it; to resort to it. They fasted and prayed, as we have had it just now, and there are the "fastings often" as referred to by Paul. In the book of Acts we have it resorted to, and evidently the result was there.
E.S.H. Would you include in this the abstaining from material food?
J.T. I should; that is, rightly understood. Whatever is mentioned in Scripture, if we do not understand it, ask the Lord about it and He will give you understanding, "The Lord will give thee understanding in all things", @2 Timothy 2: 7.
A.J.G. Could we have a word on liberty, because the last paragraph seems to stress the liberty of sonship as well as association with Christ in sonship. "Then are the sons free", the Lord says.
J.T. They are free from penalty or tax. This was a tax imposed to support the temple, as I understand it, and the liberty would be that we are not obliged to support the modern temples or religious houses. That is the liberty, I would say. But, thank God, we are not mourning because we have to pay tax to the government, but at the same time we do not want to pay it to a religious institution.
E.A.L. Would the paying a trade union subscription come in, too?
J.T. No, that is not a governmental tax; it is a lawless tax, that is what I would say. It is absolutely wrong -- it is absolutely lawless.
Ques. What about people coming to the door to collect for the Salvation Army and such like things?
J.T. I do not pay that, certainly. You would help a poor man who came to the door, but not 'Jehovah's Witnesses', for instance. 'Jehovah's Witnesses'
{264}
are just now assembled together in New York, and they come to our houses and ask for accommodation for their people as they come to carry on their meetings; they are apostate people. We do not allow them in; we refuse to allow them into the house. Anything like that is what is in mind here, that the sons are free; we are free of all that.
Ques. Would you just say why the Lord uses the fish to meet the matter?
J.T. It is to show, I think, His rights over the creation. He is the Creator of everything. According to @Revelation 10, He sets His right foot on the sea and His left on the land. He has rights, and He can use the sea if He wishes, and the fishes in the sea, too. So He directs Peter to go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up; that is to say, it was a sovereign action. It was a creatorial action too, for He alone had power to do that.
Ques. Would the fact that he uses a hook and not a net emphasise his sovereign power?
J.T. Yes, I would think so.
E.C.B. Would you say a word as to not causing offence? "That we may not be an offence to them".
J.T. Well, I suppose the Lord was gracious in giving way. The Lord says, 'The sons are free', but nevertheless He gave way, as it were, which we often do and which we have a right to do. We change our minds rather than have a bad conscience or the like, or cause complaint among neighbours. The Lord says: "That we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater", which is a piece of money, which is remarkable, you might say a miracle. The piece of money was there in the mouth of the fish, and the Lord says, "Take that and give it to them for me and thee". The Lord is associating Peter, therefore, with Himself in that action. That
{265}
is to say, the Lord is on the same level as the disciples.
Rem. It is a remarkable thing that the one coin contained the two didrachmas; one for the Lord and one for Peter.
J.T. Very good; I often notice that. "Take that", He says, as though the identical coin must be in mind.
P.H.H. In giving this liberty the Lord is not giving any licence for giving to a morally evil association, such as some we have mentioned this morning?
J.T. Quite so. Therefore the sorrowful evil of brethren being in trade unionism, actually in the thing, in the system. We are having to do with this in New York, too, finding alas! that some of our brethren were in the system.
R.W.S. Would you distinguish between that and contributing towards the local hospital or the Red Cross, for instance?
J.T. Oh! that is benefit to the public; I would not mind that at all.
W.C. Would the principle of latitude come in, in order not to give offence?
J.T. I think so; the Lord would leave it to us.
A.J.G. Peter had already answered those who came to him and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?" Peter said, "Yes".
J.T. The Lord anticipated Peter, so that He had everything in His hand; He did everything right, so that there was no trouble. The saints should not create offence if they can avoid it.
{266}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (10)
@Matthew 18: 1 - 35
J.T. We come here to authority vested in the assembly. We have had it vested in Peter in chapter 16, but now it is vested in the assembly. Again, we have here power vested in two or three gathered to the Lord's name. Thus we have come to what has been enjoyed for many years in the assemblies as regards power; then another thing is that there is power vested not merely in two or three, but in "two of you" as it says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter ... it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". So that the chapter affords remarkable help, and thus we need not be driven to the wall in any circumstances. There is a way out for us in the number of the persons mentioned.
Ques. Is the thought of authority in Matthew's gospel first connected with the Lord? It speaks of Him having authority, and then in chapter 10 He gives authority to the apostles. Is this chapter authority in the assembly?
J.T. That is right. An authority that has been used much of late and blessed of God. That is, the whole assembly is in mind, even though there be twenty or ten or less sub-divisions. The whole assembly is in mind for the exercise of this authority. No one of the assembly, or two, or even all the brothers, have the authority committed to them; it is assembly authority, including the brothers and sisters.
Ques. That would be vested in each local meeting?
J.T. Quite so. You mean local as distinct from sub-division? However few there may be, even if there are only two or three in the meeting.
{267}
Ques. Would the two or three of necessity include a brother, or might it be two or three sisters?
J.T. Well, it might be two or three sisters. In Esthonia, for instance, there were only a few sisters and one brother, and the brother misbehaved and the sisters acted in discipline upon him and withdrew from him, and God owned it. So that as I was saying, we are never driven to the wall, so to speak. There is power amongst the brethren, even a few sisters, two or three, in fact "two of you", it says. So that there is a great power vested in the assembly and in the two or three, even if it be only two or three, or two by themselves, of the assembly.
Ques. Is that why the chapter opens with the reference to the little child?
J.T. Before that is said, the disciples wanted to know who was the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens; a very unbecoming remark or enquiry. They say "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?" And the Lord answers that by calling a little child and He says, "Verily I say to you, Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens". In the second verse it says that Jesus having called a little child to Him "set it in their midst". That is to say, it is set up in their midst, not exactly as standing by Him, as called to Him, but He set it in their midst. The force of the words "in their midst" has a great place in this gospel.
W.S.S. Is there a relationship between the little child in the beginning of this chapter and the thought of sonship at the end of the previous chapter, and are we to be in the conscious dignity and liberty of sonship, but serve in the spirit of little children?
J.T. Just so, because if we carry the thought into saintship, the saint has the Spirit, and that is the
{268}
foundation of everything. The gift of the Spirit in the believer is power underlying all these things.
W.S.S. I think the Lord Jesus is called "the little child" eight times in the beginning of the gospel.
J.T. Quite so. He is never called 'a babe' in Matthew; it is in Luke He is called 'a babe'.
Rem. Herod called Him "the child", but eight times after that, in the second chapter, the Spirit calls Him "the little child". "Take to thee the little child". I was thinking of the affecting and attractive way in which the Lord Jesus is thus spoken of as "the little child", wholly at the disposal of another.
J.T. But wholly under the care of another, too -- His mother. "Take to thee the little child and his mother". That is, the mother is supposed to be immediately in care of Him. But then as regards chapter 18, the position is that of a little child. It is literally a little child and then it develops into a saint, that is a believer. I mean to say there is elasticity in the divine way at times that is not to be overlooked, and that affords much latitude, in a certain sense, and rightly so. A person may thus act with a good conscience within the latitude implied. The Spirit of God Himself brings in latitude, affording latitude to the saints.
Ques. Is it important that a little child is so available to be called and to be set up amongst the brethren?
J.T. The little child is callable, the Lord can call him. That is to say, he is supposed to be available to the Lord at His call, and if you develop that into a saint, it brings out the same thought, namely that you are subject to the Lord, according to what the Lord said of Himself, that He was that with the Father. "Lo, I come (in the roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will". That all
{269}
develops into little children, first, little children literally, and then little children viewed morally as saints. They are viewed as little children, meaning that they are exposed to the devil but they are protected.
A.D.T. Had the apostle Paul this feature in mind in sending Timotheus to Corinth? It says: "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ", @1 Corinthians 4: 17.
J.T. That is, Timothy was an apostolic delegate; he is representative of Paul. Paul could send him as his delegate at any time, and he often did so too.
A.B. Would you say a little more in regard of the question of latitude, to which you were referring?
J.T. God is God, and He would have us to understand that man was made in the image of God, and we should regard ourselves in that light, as representative of God. He can thus use us at His pleasure, and, of course, what underlies that is subjection on the part of the saints. Even in the case of a little child literally the principle must be there because of his parents; the parents have control over him; he is always under orders; and so the sisters too are under orders.
Ques. Does not the thought here run on to representation, for the Lord says: "Whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receives me"?
J.T. Exactly. Then, moreover, little children have angels. It is a very remarkable thing that angels are allocated to little children. But then that would also work up to the thought of little children morally. There is the protection of angels, for we are always under divine protection.
A.H. Does verse 4 suggest that inward power is required?
{270}
J.T. "Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child", not any little child, but *this* little child, "*he* is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens; and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receives me. But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones ...". That is, he is unprotected from the human point of view, but he is protected spiritually, and therefore we come to the thought of angels; he is protected under the angels. It says they behold the face of the Father. These are wonderful thoughts and practical thoughts, too, and ought to be valued and used and counted on. It says of the angels, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?"
P.H.H. What is the force of the expression: "Behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens"?
J.T. Just what we were saying, that the little ones have angels. I suppose each one has an angel allotted to him.
R.W.S. Do you suggest little ones physically as well as morally?
J.T. I think so; both thoughts are here in this chapter.
Ques. Would Samuel answer to this point of being called?
J.T. Just so. Jehovah called Samuel, and he answered the divine call. Samuel is representative of all that we have been saying as to a child. He was a peculiar child, and in connection with him we get the desires of his mother, Hannah, so that he was watched over according to his growth every year. A little coat was brought to him every year, meaning that she would have to take his measure. The mother knew his measure; she knew what be would need as a coat, and so we have brought out in Samuel the full thought of what we are talking
{271}
of as to little ones. Then as he grew up into manhood, he answered fully to it.
Ques. Would Joseph be an example of one who was available? He was 17 years of age, we are told in @Genesis 37, and his father said "Come, that I may send thee to ... thy brethren".
J.T. Yes, and he was opposed and hated by his brethren, showing that the principle of all that we are saying would appear in Joseph, as also in Samuel. They are two remarkable children, or young people, in the Old Testament. The New Testament is, in a sense, full of them, because the brethren now, who have children, baptise them. It was not the practice always to baptise children, but the brethren nearly always now do baptise their children and so they become endeared to them, and valuable to them, because they are committed to the Lord in baptism.
Ques. Does Solomon help as to the moral thought of a little child? He says in his prayer to God asking for help in matters of judgment, "I am but a little child".
J.T. That is good, because he was subject, of course. He was particularly lovable to his father because of his history, and because of his mother too -- Bathsheba.
W.S.S. Are you thinking of Solomon as giving us the two thoughts together of sonship and the little child? He thanks Jehovah that a son has been provided to sit on David's throne, and then he says in regard of the kingdom: "I am but a little child".
J.T. That shows that he was humble and that is just what is needed in the little children. But then in view of this, they ought to be protected, and no doubt Samuel and Solomon and Joseph are particularly in the mind of the Spirit of God as to little children. When you come to Solomon, it is a question
{272}
not of a little child literally, but of a subject child; he was subject to his father.
Rem. The angel comes in in @Matthew 2 to protect the little Child.
J.T. Just so. The little child, I suppose, is mentioned in Matthew because the thought there is that He is not simply a babe; He is developed. There is some sort of development implied in the expression "little child", rather than in Luke who uses the word "babe". I think the terms "the little child" or "the boy" as mentioned in @Acts 20, imply growth or development. I think it implies that the Lord Himself has developed in the fact that He is called "the little child". Then He is called "the little child with Mary his mother", and then He is worshipped as with His mother.
Ques. The Lord says in verse 4: "Whoever therefore shall humble himself". Does that not remind us of @Philippians 2, where it says of the Lord, "having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself". Is not that the Model?
J.T. Quite so, and it is very suggestive, as we have remarked already, that it is "this little child". It is not any little child, but "this" one. It is a distinctive one, that the Lord selects. He does not call any little child, but it is whom He selects. He calls him, and sets him in the midst. That is to say, he is to be observed by the brothers and the sisters as in the midst.
Ques. Verse 20 reads, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". Is there a link in the way the Lord Jesus puts the little child in the midst, as though to indicate that that is the kind of spirit that needs to mark the saints if He is to come in?
J.T. We must go by this passage here: "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name". He is One who has a fame, and a name to be respected,
{273}
"Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". It is the full heavenly divine thought. He is a divine Person.
A.B. Would their prime concern be the glory of His holy name?
J.T. Quite so. "My name" is distinctive, and it involves power.
P.H.H. Is this matter of protection to be practised by the brethren in regard of one another?
J.T. That is what the chapter implies, unquestionably, as we shall see, as we go on. First of all there is this question of the little child, and then the next thing is "But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea". That is to say, he is under protection. See what is said of him! The little one is under protection, and woe be to him who interferes or damages him. We can all thus count on being under divine protection in that sense.
S.B. Is the true beginning of this matter of the spirit of the little child the recognition of Jesus as Lord? I was thinking of Saul of Tarsus, who says, "Who art thou, Lord?" and then he says, "What shall I do, Lord?" and then he is led by the hand into Damascus.
J.T. Quite so. He is led by the hand; he became blind and he had to be led, so he is rendered powerless first in order that he may be made strong.
M.B. Is it seen primarily in @Revelation 5, verse 6, in relation to the Lamb -- a diminutive expression? Is that the supreme thought of a little one in relation to authority?
J.T. It is a sacrificial thought. The little one is unprotected. The word is a diminutive. The lamb is a word that denotes what is little, showing that
{274}
he is unprotected. It is the little lamb as compared with a ram, such as might attack with his horns. He is a little lamb, he would not attack with his horns; still, he is seen as powerful, for the Lamb shall overcome them. These are wonderful facts!
R.W.S. Even as Paul was amongst the Thessalonians. He speaks of his nursing service towards them, so that there should be no Mephibosheths damaged at Thessalonica.
J.T. Quite so. He was a nursing father, as it were, amongst them, which is very touching. He was peculiarly attached to the Thessalonian saints; the two epistles indicate that. Even in the second epistle instead of speaking about putting away or withdrawing, he says that one is to shrink from every brother walking disorderly; not to use violence or putting away, but withdraw from in the sense of shrinking. He is not being dealt with punitively at all in the second epistle any more than in the first. If we have to deal with a brother in discipline, if he is not very seriously offensive, we are to be careful and tender with him; we are to seek to encourage him to be right. That is the way the epistle is employed in the way of discipline.
A.B. Would the shrinking involve a measure of reserve?
J.T. It does. You can see that. If such a man invites you to dinner, you would hesitate to go. At the same time I would give him to understand there is some little thing that he has offended in; in some little way he has offended the brethren, and something has to be done. That is what I would think it means.
P.H.H. But it would not go as far as assembly action?
J.T. No. That is right.
A.J.G. It says: "Do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother".
{275}
J.T. Quite so. That final word is most exquisite because his brotherly relation is recognised.
P.H.H. Does Paul's call for fathers enter into this matter? He speaks to the Corinthians about there being not many fathers. Would the fatherly element amongst the saints provide this protection?
J.T. That is what he meant. Paul was that to them. They had not many fathers, but he was one anyway. They had him, and he explains how it was so.
P.H.H. So would there have to be that fatherly care amongst us alongside of the instruction in the truth?
J.T. Quite so, and I think fatherly qualities are very scarce in the sense of protection among the brethren. At the same time I believe the care manifest has made up the loss, although eldership should make it up. Primarily there was no care meeting enjoined, as far as I see, but it has come in modernly, and God has blessed the idea of care. The word care is connected with the thought of the elder in the epistle to Timothy.
Ques. Is the principle of care exemplified in the Lord's parable in regard of the lost sheep and leaving the ninety and nine?
J.T. Quite so, we will come to that, but we ought to dwell a little more on the matter of 'woe'. In verse 7 we have "Woe to the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; yet woe to that man by whom the offence comes!" and so it goes on further, "If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire". We have now come to one of the most solemn things we get in Matthew, and we get it peculiarly in Matthew. That is to say, the idea of judgment by eternal fire. It is the lake of fire,
{276}
really. It is enlarged on in the book of Revelation and is a question of a lake, meaning that it is confined or limited. It is terrible destruction, terrible suffering, a lake of fire; there is no way out.
A.J.G. So that we have to be drastic with ourselves so that we do not stumble any of these little ones by our actions or movements.
J.T. "If thy hand or thy foot offend thee", it is yourself. If you are offending yourself, or damaging yourself, or doing harm to yourself, then you are told what to do here.
Ques. What would be the force of not only cutting it off, but *casting* it from you?
J.T. To show your abhorrence of it. The thing that develops sometimes in us, what the flesh is as working in us, you show your abhorrence of it.
Rem. I wondered whether perhaps we come to a partial judgment about a thing and cut it off, but the thing is not drastically dealt with and it may recur.
J.T. If it is cast from you, it does not recur; it does not come back, so to speak.
Rem. Yes, if it is drastically dealt with and cast where it cannot be found again, then we may be safe.
J.T. Yes, and that agrees pretty much with what you have when you come to an offending brother. He is to be as a heathen and a publican, which shows the severity of the discipline that you exert toward him. It is very different from the one we have been mentioning in the second epistle to the Thessalonians.
Ques. Would you say what is involved in the expression "enter into life"? Verse 8: "it is good for thee to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire", and in the next verse, "it is good for thee to enter into life one-eyed ..."
{277}
J.T. I think it is unfolded in the epistle to the Romans, in chapter 5. I think you will find there what life means and how you get into life.
P.H.H. You are referring to the end of the chapter. It speaks first of all about justification of life, and then at the end, "as sin has reigned in the power of death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".
J.T. Do you not think that indicates how we enter into life? The gospel implies it, so that instead of damaging men or persons you are concerned about their entering into life, you will not damage people there.
P.H.H. Entering into life must involve a sphere.
J.T. Just so; very good. Eternal life is a sphere. It has often been mentioned, especially through the ministry of Mr. Raven, that eternal life is a sphere.
P.H.H. Would you say it is different from the Spirit as life and power within us?
J.T. Quite so. Life is within you by the Spirit, of course, but we were referring to entering into a sphere called eternal life. It is a sphere and you come into it. "Lay hold", it says, "of eternal life". That means that it is available to you.
H.H. I believe Mr. Raven's expression was 'a state or sphere of blessing prepared by God for men'.
J.T. Mr. Darby gave the definition of eternal life, and Mr. Raven enlarged on it.
J.T.Jr. Mr. Darby said 'An out-of-the-world heavenly condition of relationship and being'.
J.T. That is the one -- very good -- I am glad you remembered it. I forgot it, but I knew it very well.
Ques. Does it not suggest the sphere in which the truth is worked out in contrast to all the hostility around? Does the assembly come into life in that
{278}
sphere in contrast to all the deadness of mere religion around?
J.T. So that the assembly may be used as a synonym of the sphere we are talking about. The assembly is a sphere of eternal life, because the Spirit of God is in it and the fellowship is in it.
J.T.Jr. Would that be in mind in Corinth, that the assembly was there -- "the assembly of God which is in Corinth"?
J.T. Just so.
J.T.Jr. Would you think that the leadership in Corinth might have been of such character that young people might have been damaged?
J.T. It did undoubtedly damage them, but there is this to be said about Corinth, that the incestuous person referred to in the first epistle was recovered, or restored, quicker than the apostle expected, which was very cheering; he was restored quicker than the apostle expected. So it is well to see a recovery happen quicker than the brethren could expect.
Ques. Do we see the right spirit of this in regard of Paul discoursing? It says, "A certain youth, by name Eutychus ... fell from the third story down to the bottom", and then it says, "Paul descending fell upon him, and enfolding him in his arms, said, Be not troubled, for his life is in him".
J.T. You are referring to Eutychus and the affections of Paul descending. He had gone up, but he is now descending. He had been discoursing with the saints at Troas, but now he has descended, and he enfolds Eutychus in his arms, and eventually he went up, and they broke bread, and they brought the boy away alive. He is called a boy there.
H.H. Is there not a kind of Philadelphian touch about that? Things had gone to the bottom, but then you have "they brought away the boy alive, and were no little comforted".
{279}
J.T. The Lord promises to Philadelphia: "*I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth". That is one of the most comforting things that I know of, because the Lord is not going to allow us to go through the apostasy. He is going to save us out of it.
P.H.H. In this parable of the shepherd, are we right in supposing that the sheep may not be found? It says, in verse 13, "If it should come to pass that he find it".
J.T. I would apply the word *latitude* there; the latitude that enters into divine language, '*If* he find it' -- let us assume that he does find it. The Lord speaks the parable in that sense, and He would not speak of a thing that did not happen, I would say.
P.H.H. In Luke he makes it quite definite -- "having found it". You think that the same spirit really lies behind this?
J.T. I do.
Ques. But is not recovery of persons in mind here? It says, "the Son of man has come to save that which was lost", and then the man seeks the sheep, and then "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother".
J.T. Just so. As we were saying at the beginning, we are never forced to the wall. God does not allow it to be that way; He makes a way out for us; however critical the position may be, there is a way out made for us. That I believe, is what is implied in this chapter. Because the assembly is enlarged upon in this chapter; it is a great vessel and available for divine purposes. The chapter contemplates that the assembly takes the place of the Lord Jesus, who has now gone to heaven. There is something here in His stead, and that is the assembly, the great vessel that is here available to Him for His own
{280}
purposes, and especially for the salvation of His people, because we learnt some years past that salvation is in the assembly. It used to be just salvation as a gift, and that is true, but there is a sphere for it, and that sphere is in the assembly. So we must bring in the assembly in our preaching in connection with salvation.
J.P. The Lord says: "Tell it to the assembly". He does not say tell it to Me.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. In verse 10 it says: "See that ye do not despise one of these little ones". Do you think that in actuality we may despise the young ones in not encouraging them to come into the assembly livingly?
J.T. Just so. They might seem to you to be defenceless, you would not mind damaging them, but they are not defenceless because the Lord has protected them in what He is saying here. Even if they are little ones, even if they are unable to protect themselves, the Lord is implying here that He is affording protection for them, and the assembly is that protection, and therefore the assembly should be brought forward in the gospel properly. It ought to be brought forward because it affords protection. It is not simply that a man is saved if he believes in the Lord Jesus, but why and how is he saved? We are supposed to learn things, and so in @Acts 16 the man brings his house into things, and lays the table, and so forth.
Rem. At the beginning of the Acts we are told the Lord added daily to the assembly such as were to be saved.
J.T. Just so. The only trouble there is that the word 'assembly' may not be there, but still it is the idea. It just says that the Lord added, but He added to something.
{281}
P.H.H. We should be very thankful for some help about this hearing and listening. It says: "If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother", and then: "If he will not listen to them", that is the two or three, and then: "If also he will not listen to the assembly". Would you mind saying something for our help about that, especially the listening to the assembly?
J.T. I think it is just what we said at the beginning. The assembly is a vessel of protection and salvation. That was stressed some years back, and God has blessed it, and we ought to bring forward the idea of the assembly in the gospel. To preach the gospel properly, we should go so far as the assembly, and say 'Come into fellowship', because you will get salvation there; you will get protection there; you will get love there; that is the basis of it. These are all important matters for those who preach the gospel.
H.H. Would it be right to say that salvation is in the house of God?
J.T. Quite, but I prefer the assembly because the assembly is the vessel which God has provided. You know how these thoughts came in as regards the gospel, and have been developed during the last fifty years. That is, the assembly is a vessel of protection, a vessel of salvation, and should be added to the idea of the gospel.
H.H. There was quite a discussion about it some years ago, whether salvation was in the house of God or not. I thought we got help at that time that it was so, it was in the house of God, and the house of God and the assembly are one and the same thing, are they not?
J.T. It is called that. "God's house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth". That is what it is called.
{282}
Ques. Does Noah's ark suggest the idea of a sphere of salvation?
J.T. Surely. He prepared it for that purpose; he prepared an ark for the saving of his house.
G.H.M. I should like to ask what is the link between the protection there is in the assembly and the protection that comes in the confession of Jesus as Lord.
J.T. Well, of course, confession comes in according to the word in @Romans 10: "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved". That is quite true, but then that is not the whole truth. The whole truth is that the assembly is the sphere for that purpose, and although the word 'assembly' is doubtful in the passage in @Acts 2: "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved", the Lord added them to something, and that was undoubtedly the assembly or the Christian circle, as it used to be called.
H.H. Is it not a very serious thing that we are surrounded by a lot of young people who take the ground of having their sins forgiven, but there is no moving forward to break bread?
J.T. I will tell you something about the young people, and that is, that you often find them diverted by linking on with others of their own age, instead of staying by those who are experienced and who can help them. That is why the idea of the assembly as a sphere of salvation is so evident and so important. Children just go off by themselves, with persons of their own age and they get no help at all. They talk about things that are of no value to them.
Rem. Elisha did not keep the company of the fifty valiant men; he kept the company of an older brother, Elijah, until the very end. Would that be an example?
{283}
J.T. Very good. Elijah told him if he saw him when he went up all that he wanted would come to pass, but he had to see Elijah go up.
G.W.B. Does the inn in @Luke 10 refer to the assembly?
J.T. I think so. But it is not like a house, it is a hotel. You never get the comforts in a hotel that you get in your own house; although we have to be thankful for them. That is to say, it is something, it is some protection or some comfort for the one who seeks it on a journey.
E.C.B. What should we look for in those seeking to take their place in the breaking of bread?
J.T. That they love the brethren, I would say. Of course, they would have life; they believe in the truth; they come to the readings and the like, and get instruction, and they have life, but then if they want to come into fellowship they would show the fact by seeking the company of the Lord's people.
G.C.S. Are we not to be encouraged that there *are* quite a number of young people who know their sins forgiven and *have* come forward to break bread, and many of them were here last night, most of them children of the saints; would that encourage us too?
J.T. Very good. I get letters from Mr. S. very often, and he never sends a letter without there being some encouragement in it. I would like to be able to tell the brethren the facts that Mr. S. has written to me about persons coming into fellowship, so as to encourage every young person here.
W.C. Would you say a word as to authority that you commenced with in this section from verse 15 onwards? When it says "if he hear thee" it implies that the brother has some authority with his brother, is that right? Then we have the two and finally, the assembly.
{284}
J.T. Verse 15 says: "If thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone. If he hear thee", that means if he listens to what you are saying and is ready to receive it, "thou hast gained thy brother. But if he do not hear thee, take with thee" -- that is companionship -- "take with thee one or two besides, that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three. But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly; and if he also will not listen to the assembly ..." the word 'listen' implies the person attending to what is being said at any time, "and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer. Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven". Well now, these are most important facts because we have to deal with them constantly in our gatherings, and we do refer to this scripture constantly and God helps us in it. It is therefore a means of correction amongst the brethren, a means of peace, a means of happy fellowship.
W.C. I was wondering whether it would be helpful to us to realise that each brother or sister has an authority in love over their brothers and sisters. Would not that be the first thing? Ought we to recognise authority in love in one another?
J.T. Quite so; I would say that. And so love is the greater. It says, "Now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and the greater of these is love". If a person has love he has moral authority with his brethren. But I wonder if I am answering you fully.
W.C. I thought that was helpful to bring love in. "Thy brother" is the family idea and I wondered whether it would prevent many further difficulties if we listened to one another on that line.
{285}
J.T. It works out in the thought of the assembly, too, because the assembly is the sphere of love, but it is the sphere of eternal life too.
F. W. Is this matter of reproving a brother optional, or is it the Lord's commandment when there is something that calls for it?
J.T. Do you not think this is the Lord's commandment that we are dealing with?
F.W. Sometimes people say, Why should I bother about the matter, and therefore many cases of recovery of a brother are not brought about and the matter comes to the assembly.
J.T. It is preceded by this: "If therefore thou ... shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother", @Matthew 5: 23, 24. That is a great commandment, is it not? It is available to us at all times. "Leave there thy gift before the altar". You have gone to offer something, but you leave the gift there and go and be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer the gift. So that God's heart is met and the brother is gained, according to chapter 5 of this gospel.
F.W. Has not this sort of reproving in mind the recovery of a brother?
J.T. Assuredly. But then, as I have said before, do you not think that is important too, to leave your gift? You have got a gift and you have come to offer it, and you remember that your brother has something against you, and you leave the gift there and go away to your brother and be reconciled to him. It does not say try and be reconciled to him, but be reconciled to him. I think that is most important.
J.P. You have said elsewhere that these two scriptures would provide for every difficulty that can possibly arise amongst the saints.
{286}
J.T. That is just what I would say. God would never allow us to be driven to the wall, because He has got a way open for us. God is God and He loves His people, and He will do His best for them. Therefore we can count on Him as we draw upon Him according to this chapter.
P.L. Does the expression, "If also he will not listen to the assembly" suggest that the delinquent is addressed and appealed to in the assembly?
J.T. Quite so. "If also he will not listen to the assembly". The assembly clearly is saying something to him, and he will not listen. Then the next thing is "let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer". In other words, he is not fit for fellowship.
V.C.L. Is there not the thought of elevation brought in in the voice of the assembly, so that it is like a voice from the mountain, that would be most appealing to anyone who could be appealed to, in view of repentance?
J.T. Very good.
P.H.H. We heard you had a case in New York where two sisters were concerned, and when the case was outlined, you or somebody else, appealed to these two sisters as to whether they would consider what was said, and repent. Is it fair to ask you about that?
J.T. Well, as far as I remember they did not respond. But we have had one person in a similar case, and she did respond, and remained in fellowship, and it brought up the idea as to how recovery could be brought about when the assembly is convened for discipline.
P.H.H. Does that mean, then, that when the matter is actually before the assembly as convened, you would be free to appeal to the person who was the subject of the case?
{287}
J.T. Certainly I would.
P.H.H. Ask them there and then what they think about it?
J.T. Quite so; appeal to them.
J.T.Jr. It was done just as you say; the persons were appealed to.
P.H.H. And if they said we would like time to think about it, would you grant it to them?
J.T. Well, to grant time to them would be another matter, because the matter would be left open then. But if the assembly is convened for discipline then that is a good time to appeal, but if you let the thing go then nothing is done and the enemy would get some advantage. If they do not respond, I would say then we would have to carry through with the discipline which we intend to do.
P.H.H. That is, it depends on the nature of the case.
J.T. Quite so; but God is God, as I was saying, and the assembly is God's assembly, and the Spirit of God is there. It is a vessel for the Spirit of God, and it is a vessel for eternal life, too, so that it is a place where love is, and where grace is, and it is all available to be used in the Spirit.
E.C.M. It would be a question of discernment at the time as to any confession that might be made.
J.T. Just so; it is a question of discernment.
E.C.M. I was thinking of the scripture: "the spiritual discerns all things, and he is discerned of no one".
J.T. Just so. We often refer to what David says to Abigail, "Blessed be thy discernment". That is characteristic of the assembly.
Ques. Do we gather that in the case referred to they were sisters who were appealed to?
J.T.Jr. There were two sisters that were appealed to.
Ques. Did they speak?
{288}
J.T.Jr. They whispered that they did not change their minds. That is the way it was handled.
E.A.L. Both the sisters concerned, who were natural sisters, separately said "No".
J.T. What was intended to be inflicted was inflicted, that is to say, they were shut out from fellowship; in fact they left it.
W.S.S. Does it mean that in meetings of this character, that is meetings that you have spoken of as for discipline, we should be more expectant that there might be repentance at the time?
J.T. Just so. At the beginning of the Acts it was a time of great liberty, so that there were three thousand brought in and added, as it says. It was a time of grace; a time of mercy too, but a time of grace, and there were three thousand persons added. That is the greatest number spoken of in the Acts as at one time.
Ques. And was not Saul of Tarsus converted much quicker than Ananias expected?
J.T. Well, I would say that, too.
G.C.S. Would there not always be in our hearts the sense that we ourselves have been forgiven of God?
J.T. Just so. If we proceed in our chapter we shall get something like that, for the last section of the chapter (from verse 21) answers all these questions as regards grace and mercy as learned in the gospel. Then the added word is very conclusive: "Thus also my heavenly Father ..." that is the Lord Jesus saying that, it is the Father as peculiarly presented in Matthew, "my heavenly Father shall do to you if ye forgive not from your hearts every one his brother". That is all worked out in this chapter, which is most conclusive, and most helpful for assembly matters. We are never shut up; there is a way open for us in every case.
{289}
R.W.S. Would you say a word as to shaking hands with those under discipline as they begin to be recovered?
J.T. Well, I have heard that certain gatherings have come to the 'shaking-hands time', and not to the restoring time. People come to the meetings and participate in them, and they are still regarded as out of fellowship, and then it is reported that the brethren have come to the 'shaking-hands time', which I do not understand. If a man cannot be restored to fellowship I do not see how I can shake hands with him.
Ques. Would you say that they should be prayed for in the public prayer meeting?
J.T. Surely. "Prayers ... for all men". The assembly is the place of prayer for all these things. Hence on the Monday night we have a meeting for prayer, and in that meeting we may pray for anybody who might be a concern as to whether they could be restored.
H.F.N. Does the assembly know anything of the nature of a partial forgiveness? If the brother is restored is he not thoroughly forgiven? Can you bring in a partial forgiveness?
J.T. I must confess I do not understand the word 'partial'.
H.F.N. One has known cases, in this country, where a brother has been forgiven and is restored, but an embargo is put upon him taking certain part in the assembly.
J.T. Would that not mean that the assembly is short of grace? There is no ground for the gospel in that assembly. There is surely some way out; God would find a way if a man is at all repentant and that he is developing in repentance.
Ques. Does not assembly forgiveness take character from God's own forgiveness?
{290}
J.T. Just so: "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning", @James 1: 17.
E.A.L. What Mr. Nunnerley has mentioned lowers the thought of the breaking of bread. If we have felt that a brother is fit to break bread, he is fit to act in any other way in the assembly.
J.T. I would say that.
Ques. Could we have one more word as to confession in an assembly meeting? We have always felt free for a brother to confess, but are you saying that the way is open also for a sister?
J.T. Yes, surely. The brother and sister are on the same basis, in that sense. But I do not understand how the sisters should be excluded in anybody's mind.
Rem. Because of the passage, "Let your women be silent in the assemblies".
J.T. The meaning there is that she is not to minister, and the like of that. But you might ask her something actually in the room; that would be quite simple. You ask a question which would be quite simple and that would not transgress Paul's injunction at all. There is latitude, as we have often said, in these meetings; there is certain latitude in the divine things that ought to be observed. We ought to be sensible that God is not unreasonable, and we should not be unreasonable or insensible to what is right.
M.B. Does the case of Ananias and Sapphira support what is being said?
J.T. I think so, but one very important thing I would say about Ananias and Sapphira is that I think they were real Christians; they were buried. They are in the period of grace, and although they had sinned, yet both the wife and the husband were
{291}
buried. The book of Ecclesiastes speaks of persons who are not buried (@Ecclesiastes 6: 3).
Ques. It says in @Acts 5, "Peter answered her, Tell me if ye gave the estate for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much". Does that mean that she answered him publicly?
J.T. She lied, and tempted the Spirit of the Lord, we are told. There was no confession there.
Ques. But I mean with regard to the suggestion as to a sister confessing. When Peter asked her the question she appears to answer him audibly and publicly on that occasion. Might that illustrate how a sister could give expression to a confession publicly?
J.T. I do not see why she could not.
J.S.E. Would it be legitimate to view the assembly in this setting as convened for a particular matter, the matter of discipline, and not for teaching. Would it therefore be suitable for a sister, if necessary, to speak publicly in confession when answering a question?
J.T. Well, in a very seemly way, I would say. I am glad you brought that up because I think it is well to recognise that it is convened for a certain purpose. It is not for teaching, it is for discipline, and discipline has to be carried out, and if a sister is guilty and is willing to confess that she is wrong, why should she not be heard if she speaks in a seemly way? Everything is to be done in order, for God is a God of order, but still a sister is quite right to confess a sin if she is ready to do it, if she is ready to save her place in the assembly.
V.C.L. Is not the assembly thus fully representative of what Peter says, that "the Lord ... is long-suffering towards you, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance".
J.T. Very good.
{292}
W.C. Would it not be right and suitable to encourage all such persons to come? In many cases they are absent when the matter is taken up.
J.T. Just so. Sometimes they do not come because they expect to be disciplined, but if they do come and are ready to intimate their confession and their sorrow for their sin, why should they not be heard? I should certainly say they should be heard, if they speak in a seemly way.
P.L. Grace giving them their last opportunity under the most favourable circumstances, and in the presence of the most powerful influence available on earth.
J.T. Quite so, the most powerful influence, that is the Spirit of God in the assembly.
P.L. And if that is rejected it is in principle apostasy.
A.W.R. Would the case of the matter of jealousy in @Numbers 5 have any bearing on this? It says there, "And the woman shall say, Amen, amen".
J.T. Quite so. @Numbers 5 deals with the matter of the assumption of the wife being unfaithful to her husband, and she says "Amen" to what is said against her.
{293}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (11)
@Matthew 26: 1 - 75
J.T. I suppose we may say that none of us here can fail to be affected by the reading of this chapter, dealing as it does with the death, the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. One almost hesitates to attempt to interpret or to teach as to it, but there is most important teaching in it as to the full significance of the death of Christ, the crucifixion of Christ. It is also to be noted that certain ones are mentioned by the Lord Himself, and it is intended that we should be touched by it. First we have "He said to his disciples, Ye know that after two days the passover takes place, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified. Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together to the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas, and took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by subtlety and kill him". Such is the wickedness that is presented to us at the outset. Then on the other hand we have the action of the woman at Bethany, who would doubtless be Mary of Bethany. The place that women have is to be noticed; first in regard of the sister at Bethany, and then in the next chapter Pilate's wife, who was apparently another one touched by grace. These chapters therefore afford much bearing on the position of sisters, or women, in the testimony. God has helped us as to this, and, I believe we have been helped in these meetings because of the presence of the sisters. We can only hope that great increase in intelligence will come about through all these things that have been said, bearing on the sisters, because the Lord would have them get their full distinction. On the other hand, we have, as I said, the wickedness of the high priest. But then there is also Peter, that has to be remembered, coming in peculiarly in denying the
{294}
Lord. It is another very sorrowful suggestion that one of our number should tend to such wickedness as to deny the Lord Jesus. On the other hand, how the Lord Himself brings him forward because "the gifts and the calling of God are not subject to repentance", and that would work out in the Lord's own selection of the apostles, particularly Peter, because, as we have often noticed in this book, he has the first place. I think it is worth while calling attention to these facts, in view of it being the last day of these meetings, and to say further that the next reading, God willing, will be on chapter 28 to bring out the full truth of redemption involving resurrection. It is not ascension. We have no ascension in Matthew; it is the full thought of redemption in the sense of the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ and the power implied in the resurrection.
E.A.L. Is this triple denial of the Lord by Peter connected with what we have seen already on the mount of transfiguration, when he was putting Him on the same level as Moses and Elias, and then when the Lord said to him, "Get away behind me, Satan"?
J.T. Yes, it tills out what we have been saying, as to how we should search our hearts as to the possibility that *may* be there of such wickedness as is indicated in Peter's conduct. Yet Peter is secured for the testimony; he is never given up. The Lord held to him. So that, in principle, "the gifts and the calling of God are not subject to repentance", for there is no chance in divine Persons.
Ques. Do you think it would have given the Lord peculiar joy that that very precious ointment should have been put upon His head by a woman, before men put a crown of thorns upon it?
J.T. Quite so. Undoubtedly it was Mary of Bethany. We have mentioned her case as coming in immediately
{295}
and what you say is, of course, true. The Lord must have been greatly touched by the fact that Mary's devotedness comes in so quickly. Then we are told as to her that "what *she* could she has done", and that is a very great privilege to anyone.
A.J.G. What is in mind in the Lord's saying that wherever the glad tidings are preached, what this woman has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her?
J.T. I thought it would be to bring out the devotedness that is suitable to the preaching of the gospel. It is not simply a question of grace, but of love, the devotedness of love, and especially the devotedness of this remarkable woman. It is said of dear Mr. Pellatt, one whom God greatly used in the gospel, that he never failed to mention this woman, and the Lord refers to it when He says in verse 13, "that also which this woman has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her". So that the memorial of Mary runs well with the Lord's supper; it is the memorial of a Christian, and in principle a memorial of the assembly.
Rem. So that the gospel is preached to secure more material of this character.
J.T. That is the idea; the very best material and the most suitable for this structure, because it is a great structure. Solomon's structure is nothing compared to it! The assembly is the greatest family, but the building is the greatest structure.
J.S.E. Is that why in this gospel the Lord says, "more than Solomon is here"?
J.T. Just so.
G.C.S. It says that the woman poured the ointment on the Lord's head, but the Spirit records that the Lord says, "in pouring out this ointment on my body". Is there a connection in that sense with "This is my body, which is for you"?
{296}
J.T. Just so. It is the Lord's own body; whether it is His head, or His feet, or His hands, it is the Lord's own body.
J.P.H. What is intended to be conveyed in it being in Simon the leper's house?
J.T. I suppose it was a testimony to grace, not exactly love but grace, that a leper should have a house and that the Lord should come into it. This leper was in Bethany; surely Bethany was honoured in the Lord being in this house.
Ques. Is it in contrast to the palace of the high priest?
J.T. Quite so. The palace would be no mean structure outwardly, but nothing to be compared with what is in the assembly. Everything is to be taken out of the way to stress what the assembly is. The apostle says "*I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly". The 'and' must be there. Christ *and* the assembly.
Ques. Is the very precious ointment an element of the pearl of great value?
J.T. Quite so, only what is peculiarly emphasized here is that it is a woman. It is not Mary, but a woman. It is to signalise the saints in that character; and the assembly, of course, is viewed as a feminine thought.
V.C.L. Was not what Mary did an indication that the voice from heaven on the mount of transfiguration was being subjectively taken on before the Lord's death? I was thinking of the way the Lord was called attention to by the voice, "*This* is my beloved Son", and that the love which shone out in this woman was a subjective answer to what had been heard from heaven.
J.T. Yes, quite. It is a reflex in the woman, of the love of Christ, because there must be some full correspondence in the assembly to Christ. It is not that the assembly is anything more than a creature,
{297}
but still it is remarkable that a creature should be allied to Christ as His bride.
P.H.H. Is there something in the opposition in the first part of the chapter which corresponds with religious hostility now?
J.T. I would say so. One hesitates to say much about the system that is referred to from time to time, but I think it is particularly in the Roman Catholic system.
P.H.H. It looks as if Judas had entrance later into a kind of innermost position in the temple, when he threw down the money in the shrine. Is that a significant matter?
J.T. Quite so. John had access too, in a certain sense, to the high priest's palace.
A.J.G. Is the action of the woman in pouring out the precious ointment on the Lord's head really a repudiation by her of the chief priest as the anointed priest and all his system?
J.T. I would think so. Her instincts would refer to it. She would know something about it instinctively, and instinctive knowledge is the most valuable knowledge.
Ques. Over against the action of the woman, the disciples are said to have been indignant. Would you say something about that?
J.T. That shows what we are, what any one of us is capable of, but indignation is not quite as bad as what is done elsewhere in the chapter by men. The disciples indignation is to be set over against the devotedness of the woman, and the Lord's own commendation of her. We should take great comfort, especially sisters, from the Lord's commendation of this woman's action.
Ques. Has Simon the leper's house any bearing on our coming together for the Supper, in that the position in which we come together is a testimony
{298}
publicly to the fact that we love Christ but are the subjects of mercy?
J.T. Quite so, although, I would say, we are the subjects of grace more than mercy, because the gospel is the gospel of the grace of God. Grace is a distinct thought from mercy.
F.V.W. Would you mind saying something as to the Lord's words, "she has done it for my burying". What is involved in that?
J.T. It shows that the Lord was anticipating all that would happen, in view of redemption. The teaching of Corinthians shows that Christ died and that He was buried. The idea of burial must go with death. So the Lord says, "Wheresoever these glad tiding may be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her". I do not know that we can get anything better than such a statement as this, that cannot be excelled as to importance and tenderness and devotedness.
Rem. In reading the Scriptures you would look for what the Spirit of God might impress upon us at this moment, with the Scriptures before us.
J.T. That is what I am hoping, that the brethren will go all the way in this chapter. It is a long chapter, but it is such a chapter that I have good hope that the brethren will go all the way in it. Then in the next chapter that is to be read - chapter 28 -- I hope we shall go all the way in the account of the resurrection, not the ascension, because it is not given, but the account of the resurrection and the power that is in it.
J.A. Is that why attention is drawn by the Lord to the fact that she has wrought a good work towards Him? Is it that we might go the full length?
J.T. Quite so. But the reference to His body is most touching.
{299}
L.H.B.P. With regard to your reference to burying, is cremation the enemy's work? It speaks in @Amos 2: 1 of burning the bones into lime.
J.T. I would say that fully. In the book of Ecclesiastes there is a reference to a person being without a burial. "If a man beget a hundred sons, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, but his soul be not filled with good, and also he have no burial, I say an untimely birth is better than he", @Ecclesiastes 6: 3. I think it is very touching that the Lord refers to his burial here, and what this woman has done.
A.J.G. You had something in mind in alluding a moment ago to the Lord's speaking of His body being very touching.
J.T. Well, in the night in which the Lord was betrayed He took bread, and said, "This is my body, which is for you". That enters into the Lord's supper, for it is what we appropriate; it is for us. We have it here, but Luke and Corinthians go further.
J.T.Jr. We can rightly think of the Lord's body in which He bore our sins on the tree.
J.T. Quite so. It says "who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree".
H.H. With regard to resurrection, is it not important to admit that there is a link between the body that now is and the body that will be raised?
J.T. Of course there is. It is the same body but, of course, it is changed. But the identity of the body that is raised with the body that died must be held fast, the body that lay in death. The Lord said that the Son of man should be in the heart of the earth "three days and three nights". We must remember the strong word, "in the heart of the earth", we might say, the very middle of it, and yet the earth is a round ball, but it is in the very heart of the
{300}
earth, showing how the Spirit of God uses figures in presenting the truth.
W.F. Would you say something further as to the Lord connecting the memorial with the woman and not with the institution of the Supper, in this gospel?
J.T. I suppose it is to stress the devotedness of the woman.
W.S.S. I was wondering whether the reference to the woman and Bethany here might suggest continuity; so that against the dark background of religious opposition the Spirit has carried this through the dispensation.
J.T. The Spirit has carried it through, as you say, and, of course, we have had it here today, brought down to us, and we are reading it, and commenting upon it, and feeding upon it.
W.S.S. It just occurred to me while we have been speaking together, that there is a very beautiful suggestion, if I understand it rightly, in what is recorded as indicating to us not only what happened historically but what would be found throughout the dispensation, that there would be this response in affection to the Lord Jesus.
J.T. We have the Supper here, but not so fully as we have it in Luke, and we shall come to it presently, and I might remind the brethren that Luther quoted from this chapter in contending with Zwingli in relation to the Lord's supper. Luther quoted from this chapter, and wrote the thing down on to paper so that it could be read, but he was wrong for all that, and Zwingli was right, and we are right now in dealing with it.
R.W.S. Is there not a dignity in verse 12, "For in pouring out this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burying"? I am thinking of the terms we sometimes use, religious terms possibly, as to those who depart to be with Christ, such as 'passing away', but this is "my burying". In this
{301}
day of refinement in our language I wondered if we should ever use, as to a saint, the expression 'passing away', or 'passing on'.
J.T. I think it is spiritually a very poor expression.
P.H.H. You would rather say they had gone to be *with the Lord*?
J.T. I should, that is the word of Scripture; "to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better".
P.H.H. The burying is not the end.
J.T. Quite so. We have to be raised up and quickened, and caught up to be with the Lord, to be with Christ, for ever. We have to go the whole way to get the truth, because the truth has a beginning and an end, and the end of all these things that we are speaking of now is in heaven. The end is in heaven, but the idea of resurrection is stressed peculiarly because of the power involved in it. Then too there is what we have been considering as to this woman's devotedness, and that love for Christ was behind it. The Lord would tell those of us who love Him, that He values our love.
P.H.H. Referring to the Lord's supper, what is meant in Corinthians when it says "not distinguishing the body"?
J.T. I do not know much, except that it refers to the Lord's body.
P.H.H. It says, "for the eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body".
J.T. It means he has not got reverence enough; he has not right feelings, as regards the matter he is dealing with.
P.H.H. You take it to be a reference to the body of the Lord?
J.T. I do.
P.H.H. That is, it would be in contrast to this woman.
{302}
J.T. Just so. So the Lord says, "This is my body, which is for you" -- which is for you. It is our portion, and we value it because it is so precious and enters into the Lord's supper.
A.J.G. Just before the verse quoted in Corinthians it says "So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord". That seems to confirm what you have said.
J.T. Quite so. Does that help? What is your thought?
P.H.H. Yes, thank you very much. I thought it meant the body of the Lord, but sometimes one has heard it said (not often) that it might refer to the saints, that is, the assembly, not distinguishing the assembly.
J.T. No. That would not do at all.
Ques. Is there some special significance in the introduction of the days of unleavened bread and the passover?
J.T. It is a question of the significance of the unleavened bread, and why unleavened bread is mentioned. Some use it in regard to the Lord's supper, but I think it is very doubtful if we should follow literally what we have here. What do you say about that?
Rem. I was thinking there would be some link with the way in which Paul brings it forward as preceding the Supper in the first epistle to the Corinthians, making way for the occasion of love that the Supper is intended to be, as setting us free from things that would hinder at that time.
J.T. Are you stressing the word *unleavened*?
Rem. Yes.
J.T. Quite so. I would not have any sympathy with the use actually of unleavened bread for the Lord's supper. I think it is pure religious literality.
{303}
Ques. Does not Paul's word, "unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" indicate the significance of it for us?
J.T. Well, there it is. It is not literal. It is "sincerity and truth".
J.T.Jr. That is @1 Corinthians 5, which precedes, by a good many chapters, the eleventh, so that there a good deal in what is in the apostle's mind, I suppose, as to sincerity and truth.
J.T. Of course there is. It is one of the greatest things, "sincerity and truth". We want to be sincere in everything that we do and say, and it is striking that the actual wording "unleavened bread", is translated into the spirit of it, "sincerity and truth". It is something that belongs to Christianity practically, as to our own selves in a practical sense. I would say taking Christendom as a whole, they have nothing of these things, and the people there, even if they are brethren, do not get the truth. That shows that separation is so important, in view of getting at the truth; we want to be separate and holy in order to get at the truth. We want to get at the real truth and nothing but the truth. The Lord says in @John 8, "ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free".
G.H.M. May I ask if that precious body of Christ has not been the demonstration of love, but the Lord intends that we should understand what is in the expression, "My soul" (verse 38). Does not the intensity of feeling that was involved in the accomplishment of redemption that you have mentioned, enter into that?
J.T. Very good. When we come to the latter part of the chapter, we shall see what the Lord had in His mind before He died.
P.H.H. What scripture would you have in mind when you come to the breaking of bread, and the
{304}
actual partaking of the Lord's supper? Do you have the gospels in mind, or first Corinthians?
J.T. I take first Corinthians. I would take Paul. He had a mission to the assembly; it was committed to him, and the Lord has used him for it. The Lord took him up for that purpose. He is the minister of the assembly.
Rem. Had we only Matthew's account, we should not have known that the Supper was a recurring occasion. We must have Paul to fill it out assembly-wise!
J.T. That is what I am thinking of. Paul is the minister of the assembly.
P.H.H. Does the Supper then, in the gospels, give us some features of the Supper by itself, whereas in Corinthians it is set in the assembly?
J.T. Well, the Spirit of God has a right to set things as He pleases. If they are put down accurately we accept them as accurate, as from the Spirit of God, so that I would say that it is a question of teaching, and we are trying to get at the teaching now in this whole matter.
A.J.G. Would you mind saying what is the import of our eating the bread, according to this gospel, in contrast with breaking it for a remembrance according to Corinthians.
J.T. That is good. I am glad you mentioned that, because eating is one thing and breaking is another. We have to break in order to eat, so that the Lord broke the bread; He did not eat it Himself, but He broke it. That is to say, there is importance in the word 'breaking', and it is given attention to in the Scriptures peculiarly. But then the eating must come in, or we could not have the Lord's supper.
Rem. Whilst the breaking is in view of our eating, I suppose it is right to say that the memorial is connected with the breaking rather than the eating.
{305}
J.T. Let us look at @1 Corinthians 11. We ought to read what it says about it there, because that is where we get the actual truth of the Lord's supper. (Verses 17 - 26 read). It is perfectly clear that the eating and the drinking are one thing, and the breaking of the bread is another thing, so that we eat *and* drink; but then the breaking could not refer to drinking; it refers to the eating, and that refers to the bread; so that the breaking of the bread is initial. The Lord did not eat the bread; He broke it. The breaking has therefore a very important place in the institution.
Eu.R. Is it that act in itself that recalls the Lord? 'This do for a calling of me to mind'. Is it the breaking?
J.T. That is what I would say. The breaking is the thing; the word *break* signifies the Lord's death.
A.J.G. Then what is the moral import of the eating?
J.T. Oh, appropriation. It has to be assimilated, to be made part of yourself, as it were, to give you a constitution. That is one idea in the Lord's supper, it is to give us a constitution.
J.S.E. Does the word 'partake' in @1 Corinthians 10 give force to that remark of yours? "Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf". I am stressing the word 'partake' in relation to what you have just said as to assimilation, and appropriation.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. Verse 26 of @1 Corinthians 11 says, "For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come". Would you say something as to the difference between the announcement and the memorial.
J.T. The memorial is kept by itself, 'for the calling me to mind' would be equivalent to the
{306}
memorial. As regards what follows, it is a question of the meaning of the word 'announce'. The words 'show forth' would do just as well.
E.C.M. In @Luke 24 it speaks of how the Lord was made known unto them in the breaking of bread. Do we understand that the Lord comes in at that point?
J.T. I would say that fully.
Eu.R. Would the announcement be the testimonial side of the matter?
J.T. Just so. The word 'announce' would be the equivalent of the word 'show'. The idea is showing it, making it to appear, in the memorial.
Ques. In contrast to the announcing, which has the testimony in view, is the memorial side a matter between the Lord and the assembly, something between the Lord and our hearts, which is not exactly observable to those outside?
J.T. Quite so, but I suppose the Lord takes account of the fact that we are carrying out His directions, it is called a memorial. He wanted to have that memorial to continue on throughout the dispensation, and that is just what we are doing, and the Lord is helping us, and much has been added in the way of correction as to the whole matter. I do not think there is anything that has been said now that is different from what has been understood for many years.
Ques. Does that mean that the announcing or showing is done by those who are substantially affected by the eating?
J.T. Just so. But the fact of the matter is, it is all one matter. The Lord's supper is all one matter. There are certain features that have been peculiarly accentuated in recent times, but I do not think there is anything being said here today that would change what we have been doing. I think
{307}
what is being done is correct, and the Lord comes in accordingly.
J.P. The Supper being all one matter, do we understand that the cup carries the same force and significance as the bread?
J.T. You could not have the Supper at all without both; so it is one matter in that sense. And I would say it again, that what the brethren are doing is right, and the Lord is with us in doing it. God is never brought into the Supper, nor the Spirit either, formally, but the Spirit is here to support us in it, so that we might do it in power.
Ques. Is the point here that the service of God flows out of that?
J.T. It does. The Lord's supper is the beginning of the service of God.
V.C.L. Is it not fitting that the view we get of the Supper from Paul being the clearest is because he saw not only the Lord Jesus, but also he saw the assembly, in what was revealed to him. The whole mystery of the assembly was revealed to him, and he also says, "Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?"
J.T. I would say that fully, although I would not deny at all that Peter and all the apostles had the thing too. They preceded Paul, but, as you say, Paul had the thing finally from the Lord.
E.A.L. I think we have been helped to see the truth in @1 Corinthians 11: 26, "For as often as ye shall cat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord". It is not '*this* bread and *this* cup'. We have come to see that "the cup" is one thing.
J.T. It is one thing. The Lord's supper is one thing. It says earlier in @1 Corinthians 11 "it is not to eat the Lord's supper", but he is showing to them that they were neglectful, they were careless, and what they were doing was wrong. But then he goes on to show what the Lord's supper is, and that is
{308}
one thing. It is the *Lord's* supper, and it includes the bread and the cup. It is one thing. It is not ever presented in two ways. It is presented as one thing.
Eu.R. It is partaken of as together in assembly. Does that not bring into our minds elevation?
J.T. Just so. The word *assembly* is found in verse 18. "When ye come together in assembly". They are recognised as coming together in assembly, but the thing that they were doing was not accurate, it was not quite right, but it is corrected in the chapter.
H.H. Could a word be said in regard to the new covenant in relation to the cup?
J.T. I would like to know what the word should be. @Matthew 26: 27 says "And having taken the cup and given thanks, he gave it to them saying, Drink ye all of it. For this is my blood, that of the new covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins". And then again, "But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father". And then it goes on further to show how this matter was finished, "And having sung a hymn they went out to the mount of Olives". Well now, Mr. H., will you say what you thought I should say, or is that enough?
H.H. I would like to get a fresh thought from you as to the new covenant, and what the connection would be with the cup.
J.T. We will read it again. First He says, "Take, eat: this is my body" (verse 26), "and having taken the cup and given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it. For this is my blood, that of the new covenant, that shed for many". The only thing that I would say is that "Drink ye all of it" refers to the saints, whether young people or old people, we all are to drink it. It belongs to the saints. It
{309}
belongs to those who are members of Christ's body. It belongs to them. I do not know that that is new, but I do not think the word *all* is perhaps stressed very much. Some have said it is the whole of the cup; that, of course, would be a very ignorant thing. What is meant is that the word *all* refers to the saints who drink it.
A.J.G. Has it in mind that all are to be completely liberated?
J.T. I think the chapter is doing that for us now, and what our brother's inquiry refers to, I believe, is to be noted, and the young people particularly may not have noticed that the "all" refers to those who drink; but then those who drink should be the saints. That is to say, *they* should do it; and if they do not do it they are failing in the truth; and many do not do it, therefore they are failing in the truth.
P.H.H. Does the "all" link on with "we all" in @2 Corinthians 3, "we all, looking on the glory of the Lord"?
J.T. Just so. "We all" is the same idea, showing that we all should come into this matter of the Lord's supper. How important it is that nobody should exclude himself from it. It is a most serious thing for people who are real Christians to exclude themselves from this great privilege.
R.W.S. Where it says "that shed for many for remission of sins", might that expression have a place in the service, or not?
J.T. It is somewhat awkward. It is really to show that the Lord actually shed His blood. The word *shed* means the flowing of the blood out of the veins.
F.W. The Corinthians were eating to self-gratification. Would that be a hindrance to distinguishing the body?
J.T. Very good. There were selfish desires there. Evidently there was a serious low state of things in the Corinthian assembly, and that is why he speaks
{310}
so strongly to them, and we thank God that we have the whole matter set out so fully in the gospel of Matthew, which is an assembly book.
Ques. In verse 28 of our chapter it says, "For this is my blood, that of the new covenant", whilst in @1 Corinthians 11: 25 it says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood". Is there a difference between the two expressions?
J.T. There is no real difference in the meaning. It is all intelligible to the spiritual mind.
J.T.Jr. Would it be right to connect the Spirit with the drinking here? We have "all been given to drink of one Spirit"?
J.T. Just so. That is in @1 Corinthians 12, and the Lord's supper is in chapter 11. If you read verse 13 in chapter 12 you will see what is meant. "For also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit". Well, that is the allusion to the cup in the Lord's supper; but then the real thing is the Spirit. The Spirit of God is symbolised in it, and at the same time the actual facts of the Lord's supper ought to greatly stimulate us as to it.
P.H.H. So what has just been said would enable us to think of a unifying in drinking of the cup.
J.T. Quite so, and so in the same chapter we have "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", showing that the Spirit is stressed in all that.
A.J.G. And do you not think the Spirit would give a fresh touch as to the import of it every Lord's day?
J.T. Just so.
H.H. I think the bringing in of the Spirit is a very helpful thought, but would you say the drinking of the cup is extremely suggestive of the love of Christ?
{311}
J.T. I would think so. It is peculiarly stressed; it is "the cup of blessing which we bless". It is referred to in chapter 10 before the bread, whereas the bread and the cup are referred to in chapter 11, which gives us the actual Supper, and the Spirit is referred to in chapter 12. That is the order of the truth in Corinthians.
H.H. I quite agree with what you say about the young people. I would advise them to ask to break bread as soon as possible, and not wait until they feel ready. They will find as they go on and grow up that they are still liable to do what is wrong, but they had better come to it, the Lord has given us the Supper, they can get divine help in the Spirit, and the love of Christ will keep them away from what is idolatrous.
J.T. And if they are young, they would do well to keep with elder brethren, with elder brothers and sisters, because they get the right thoughts from them whereas they do not get them from keeping company only with the young people. They ought to go with the old brothers or sisters, to get the right thoughts as to the Lord's supper and as to all truth.
W.S.S. Had you in mind to say a word about verse 30? "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives".
J.T. Well, it is very precious. One has often thought of it, and the place the hymn has, and we might remark that the selection of hymns in relation to the Lord's supper as compared with the selection in relation to the Father is now maintained. It was not maintained in earlier days, but now God has helped us, and the importance of hymns has come into evidence, and the Lord has blessed them, and we have selections that can be used, first for the Lord's supper and then for the worship of the Father. We have hymns that are suitable for both these purposes, and we do well to use them rightly.
{312}
P.H.H. There is a good deal of inquiry as to the comeliness of introducing hymns to the Spirit.
J.T. There is, but we have not got many. We have something of the kind in No. 126 (in the 1932 Hymn Book), which was intended to be addressed to the three divine Persons, but I do not know of one hymn written fully to be sung to the Spirit, and I think the Lord may help us to add such hymns. He will undoubtedly give guidance as to this.
No. 126 in the 1932 Hymn Book (composed by J. Montgomery):
<blockquote>Praise we to the Father give, <br>God in whom we move and live; <br>Children's praise He loves to hear, <br>Children's songs delight His ear.
Praise we to the Firstborn bring, <br>Christ the Prophet, Priest, and King; <br>Glad we raise our sweetest strain <br>To the Lamb that once was slain.
Praises for the Holy Ghost <br>Sent from heav'n at Pentecost; <br>Tis through Him that now we live, And the precious truth receive.
Blest our portion, thus to be  <br>Glorying in the Trinity; <br>For the gospel from above, <br>For the word that "God is love". </blockquote>
P.H.H. What do you think we had better do? You would encourage us to inquire about revision?
J.T. I would. If the service of God requires it, I would say 'Amen'. If the Lord seems to guide us and make it plain to us, I would say that we should do it.
Eu.R. Would you favour hymns addressed only to the Spirit?
J.T. Yes, I would, but I do not think the idea of an appendix, or a separate book, will do. I would rather see the full book including hymns to the Spirit.
P.L. @Numbers 21 would justify that. It is a hymn entirely to the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so. Very good.
Ques. You were stressing the *Lord's* supper, would there be a time in the Supper when we could speak to the Spirit?
J.T. I think we can, as we can use hymns to the Father and to the Son, too. I am sure it is right that there are opportunities to address the Spirit, and if the hymn book is revised, of course there will be.
Rem. I think the time has come to seek help from the Lord to fill out the service of God by singing to the Spirit. I think most of the brethren feel that.
J.T. Yes. I believe that the Lord will help us, and I would say 'Amen' to it all.
{313}
READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (12)
@Matthew 28: 1 - 20
J.T. It is thought that we should go through with our subject by reading this last chapter. It is needed to complete the subject as affording the truth of the resurrection. The ascension is not recorded in this book, which has to be noted and understood. There is a certain *severity* in the instruction in the gospel of Matthew, beginning, as it does, with forty-two generations of previous history; now it is thought we should be able to look together at the facts of the resurrection. It is evident that the Spirit of God intended to stress the power of the resurrection in the book, in order to give effect to the truth of the assembly.
P.H.H. Would you say another word about *severity*, please.
J.T. I do not know that I could deal with it lengthily, but it struck me that the word is suitable to use, divine severity, of course. There are many instances in the New Testament of severity which the Lord used in His language, and this gospel affords much of them.
Ques. Is that feature present here in the angel? "His look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men".
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Is it comforting to think that the same angel that causes the guards to tremble and be as dead men, is the one who says to the women, "Fear not ye"?
J.T. Quite so. They were to be encouraged not to fear. It says, "behold, there was a great earthquake", and no doubt that was the cause of the fear; "for an angel of the Lord, descending out of
{314}
heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it". It is a remarkable evidence of authority and power. He "came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it". Remarkable evidence that he was a commissioned person! We have said that the ascension is not mentioned, but here we have the angel descending *out* of heaven, so that it is the very opposite of ascension. There is power too and, of course, that is needed in view of the fact that the earth is in mind.
A.J.G. Was his action in rolling away the stone intended to establish the fact of the resurrection?
J.T. I suppose so. There was evidence that there was power for it. But we should be glad to hear what you have to say.
A.J.G. I am inquiring because you have stressed resurrection, and I was hoping you would say what is the bearing of it in relation to the assembly.
J.T. I thought it would be well to notice the fact that the angel has to do with the earth and all that has to be encountered in an earthly position, because it goes on to say, "for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men. And the angel answering said to the women, Fear not *ye*" -- the *ye* is emphatic, that is to say, *you* are not to fear; whatever happens, *you* are not to fear -- "for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one. He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay". And then again, "And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him. Behold, I have told you". So there is clear evidence of authority in the angel here; and that raises the question of angelic service, because clearly angels were created before men. Humanity is more recent in the creation than angels, but they are said to be "ministering spirits,
{315}
sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation".
Ques. Does the expression, "Behold, I have told you", not only suggest authority, but authority not to be reasoned or argued against?
J.T. Quite so. "Behold, I have told you". He is a *commissioned person*, as the Lord Himself was.
A.B. Would the angel rolling the stone away be the way that God would defeat the opposition against Christ? They sealed the stone, but the stone is rolled away.
J.T. There is no possibility of overcoming this commissioned person; it is a divine commission, and God is behind all that. We are thus to be assured of the position of the assembly, and how secure it is, and how we may rely on God supporting us at all times; so that we are not to be afraid.
Ques. You were linking this morning the thought of resurrection with redemption. Could you say another word about that?
J.T. You must have resurrection in order that the assembly should be supported. The idea of resurrection is in the assembly. He "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", and again we have in Colossians a similar thought as to resurrection. It says of the women in the last chapter of Mark that they "went out, and fled from the sepulchre. And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. Now when He had risen very early, the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons. She went and brought word to those that had been with him, who were grieving and weeping. And when these heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, they disbelieved it. And after these
{316}
things he was manifested in another form". That is to say, there is great evidence of unbelief in Mark; but here we have, "And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men. And the angel answering said to the women, Fear not *ye*, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one. He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay". I thought it would be well to call attention to Mark as to the thought of unbelief of the resurrection at the outset. The resurrection was denied at Corinth, so that Paul says: "How say some among you that there is not a resurrection of those that are dead? ... but if Christ is not raised, then indeed vain is our preaching, and vain also your faith ... ye are yet in your sins".
J.McK. Does the thought of demonstration come into this chapter, not only the power but the demonstration of the matter? I was thinking of the matter of the stone rolled away and the angel sitting upon it. There is clear demonstration from heaven of what has transpired, and the power to carry things forward.
J.T. Just so. That is what is stressed, the power in resurrection. "If Christ is not raised ... vain also your faith ... ye are yet in your sins". And that, of course, came up at Corinth, showing that this evidence of unbelief came out among the gentiles, and the unbelief that we find in our hearts is almost constant from time to time, but we have full evidence of what is true and right in the Scriptures.
E.A.L. In @John 20 we have, "Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed; for they had not yet known the scripture, that he must rise from among the dead". Is the rolling away of the stone just God's mercy to them, that they should believe? The stone did not need to be rolled away for the Lord to rise from the dead.
{317}
J.T. It was a testimony to the power, that the power was there on their behalf, and there is plenty of that sort of thing in testimony amongst us at all times.
H.H. Mr. Pellatt once stated, in relation to this incident, What are you going to do with the Roman Empire now, if an angel sits on the stone that has been put there?
J.T. Well, it is not what we are going to do; it is what God will do, and the Roman Empire still exists in principle, for the laws of the Roman Empire have come down to us, both in America and in the British Empire generally and in Europe.
Ques. Is it very encouraging that in spite of our unbelief the Lord goes on with us? When He reproached them for their unbelief in Mark, He immediately says, "Go into all the world".
P.H.H. Will you say something about the rising. Sometimes it is said in the Scripture, as here, "He is risen", as if it were His own act. In another place it says, "Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father". Is it His own act in this setting? "He is not here, for he is risen".
J.T. It is a simple statement of fact, but the power behind it is from heaven. An angel of God came down from heaven. But perhaps you will say more.
P.H.H. I was thinking, for instance, of the Lord's word in John's gospel, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up". It is viewed there as His own action. In other cases, as, for instance, in @Romans 6, He is raised from the dead by the glory of the Father.
J.T. It is a question there of divine Persons acting, and the power that is available. Sometimes you cannot be sure who the divine Person may be, but usually we can find out which divine Person does a thing or says a thing. So that it seems to be that
{318}
the principle behind all Scripture is faith, but then what is behind faith is power. In @Romans 10, for instance, we get, "So faith then is by a report, but the report by God's word". So that there is hearing, but then there must be power in the sense of all that God is doing to assert and to confirm the truth of His purposes, and He is active here for the accomplishment of all His designs and thoughts.
A.J.G. So is your thought that this statement, "He is risen", is simply the statement of fact that He was risen from the dead, in order to assure the disciples that power was on their behalf to carry through to the end, without regard to whether the Lord raised Himself or whether the Father raised Him?
J.T. Quite so. I think that is good. It just confirms what I have been thinking.
Ques. Would @Matthew 27: 63 help in that connection? When the chief priests came to Pilate, they say that He said, "After three days I arise". Does that confirm the fact that sometimes the resurrection is presented as His own act?
J.T. Quite so. So it is. He says it definitely in the 2nd chapter of John.
E.C.M. Why is it the women are prominent at the sepulchre at the resurrection?
J.T. Well, we have spoken of the women in chapter 26, and now here the Spirit brings in Mary Magdalene. Mary Magdalene is particularly important at the resurrection, especially because she carried the message from the Lord to the disciples as to His going into heaven. She becomes a messenger to carry through the divine thoughts as to Christ risen and the effect of His resurrection, because @John 20 is to bring out the full thought of the resurrection and the ascension. "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". The idea of the ascension is peculiarly stressed in
{319}
John, but it is not even mentioned here in Matthew. In Matthew it does not say the Lord went to heaven; it just stresses the resurrection. Then as to the women, the same thing is evident, as in chapter 26, that love was behind it all, so that we have quite a little said about them. It says, "And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men. And the angel answering said to the women, Fear not ye", that is, the women were not to fear, the Lord was specially concerned about them, "for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one. He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him. Behold, I have told you. And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy", a remarkable combination, fear and great joy, "they ran", women running is remarkable, "to bring his disciples word. And as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail! And they coming up took him by the feet", a remarkable thing too, because it would hinder Him walking, "and did him homage. Then Jesus says to them, Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me".
E.T.S. It is very encouraging to the sisters that these women should have had a special interview with the Lord.
J.T. I think it is a word for our sisters. I have been trying, since the beginning of these meetings, to bring in something that would help the sisters, and I think we have it here, and the Lord is showing that they are particularly in His mind. I believe
{320}
the brethren have done right to open the door to the sisters to these special three-day meetings.
P.L. Are they honoured as being the first witnesses to this glorious event?
J.T. Quite so. It was a glorious event, and they are the witnesses to it.
Ques. Were they not seeking Jesus, the crucified One? Was not that their special honour at that time?
J.T. Well, they were somewhat defective, and I had thought of mentioning that we have noticed several times as we have gone through this gospel, the evidences of the want of faith. "O thou of little faith", the Lord says to Peter.
Ques. Why do you think the angel refers to Jesus as "the crucified one"?
J.T. I suppose it would be to set out the thought of suffering, at the outset of the truth of the assembly. It is a time of suffering. "To you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also", @Philippians 1: 29.
W.S.S. Is there not a note of triumph in the words, "Come, see the place were the Lord lay"? In Mark's gospel it is, "Behold the place where they had put him", but "where the Lord lay" is the word here.
J.T. "Where the Lord lay". It is very touching.
W.S.S. I was thinking too of His lordly power in harmony with the other evidences of power.
J.T. Lordly power -- quite so; authority vested in lordship. The Lord Jesus is the only One made Lord. The Father is called Lord, and the Spirit is called Lord, but the Lord Jesus is the only One made Lord. He is made "Lord and Christ" (@Acts 2: 36) and that is a very important matter, too.
J.S.E. And does that stand immediately over against the crucifixion in @Acts 2?
J.T. Quite so.
{321}
A.J.G. Is it not striking that in all the early preachings in the Acts, the apostle always pointed out that it was the One who had been crucified that they were to believe in?
J.T. That is to say, crucifixion is not simply the killing, but it brings out the peculiar hostility that was in the heart of man at the time that the Lord Jesus was put to death.
Ques. Are we not reminded of Paul's bringing in the thought of the cross at the beginning of the epistle to the Corinthians? I was just thinking how completely the wisdom of this world was set aside in the cross of Christ. Burial is brought in much later in the epistle, but the cross is insisted upon right at the start.
J.T. Very good.
Ques. Would you say something as to angelic help for our minds? The angel said, "I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one". There was a defective thought in their minds, which he knew, and he was helping them in it.
J.T. Well now, it is very remarkable that angels are said to have so much knowledge, and apparently it is just given to them specially, as augmenting the divine system, the divine workmanship. Angels are specially instructed, but they have not got the full instruction that those who form the assembly have, because we precede all families in the sense of light and instruction and distinction. The assembly has the first place in all the families in the universe.
P.L. Have they not special instruction for a special mission, but the assembly has the mind of Christ?
J.T. Just so. "We have the mind of Christ". It is *that kind* of a mind. We have it, it says in 1 Corinthians.
R.W.S. An angel in Revelation placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land. Would
{322}
that give us the assurance today that from the public side assembly service is to go on until the end?
J.T. I would say that. Assembly service is to go on to the end; but I want to know just what you mean by the end.
R.W.S. Well, I mean until the rapture. Some of us may be disturbed about conditions which occur in the world publicly, such as war clouds, but are we not reassured that the public side and the inward side will be maintained until the rapture?
J.T. Well, just so, but the end comes later than that. Daniel takes up what the end is to be before the introduction of eternal conditions. I wanted just to get your mind as to the end, and what else you had in mind too, because this is of very great importance that we are dealing with, as to the practical working out of the truth.
R.W.S. In my mind, I was going on only until the saints are raptured, but would you say something about what follows and the end.
J.T. It says in @1 Corinthians 15 "Then cometh the end", and in Daniel we have "Do thou go thy way until the end".
W.C. In that statement, "Do thou go thy way", is the idea that we are to go on assured of the end?
J.T. Yes, and the rapture is before that; the coming of the Lord *for us*.
Ques. Had you any thought of referring to @1 Corinthians 15, "Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him who is God and Father"?
J.T. That confirms all that we have said. It is the New Testament, and we have referred to the Old Testament, because it is the same idea.
Eu.R. @1 Corinthians 15 seems to link on with our chapter, because of the way the burial of the Lord Jesus is referred to at the beginning of it, and
{323}
then the great triumph of the resurrection, all leading forward to that great end.
J.T. Quite so. I would say that fully.
A.B. Would the thought of "the completion of the age" be similar in the last verse of this chapter?
J.T. Just so. That is just what it is, "until the completion of the age". That word *age* has its own significance. It is not the coming of the Lord for the saints; it goes further than that, it goes into millennial conditions. It is not simply that the Lord comes for *us*, but there are other things to take place too, towards the end, to complete the thought of "the completion of the age".
H.H. Is all that viewed in connection with the earth?
J.T. We have to think of what is in heaven too, because the Lord comes out of heaven; but I do not know just what you mean.
H.H. I was thinking of "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". All that is what takes place on the resurrection platform. It does not add ascension, does it?
J.T. It does not add ascension, but that does not in any way set aside what is said in John, or in Mark, or in Revelation.
P.H.H. Referring to the matter of the angels again for a moment, there is a remarkable word in @1 Corinthians 11 about the woman. "Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head, on account of the angels". What is exactly the bearing of bringing in the angels there?
J.T. I suppose it is that they are the custodians of God's operations, and that the women are to be subdued and in every way subject. They are to have authority on the head, because of the angels, so that they should be in every way suitable in view
{324}
of the order of God in the creation, and this should work out in the assembly.
A.J.G. In @1 Peter 1 we read, "which angels desire to look into", as though angels have a great interest in all that God is doing in the assembly.
J.T. That is just what I would think. Evidently they are onlookers, but they have great honour. At the same time they are ministers; they are our ministers. They are not heirs of salvation, as we are. So that the saints of the assembly have great distinction.
A.H. Are angels involved in @Ephesians 3: "The mystery hidden throughout the ages in God, who has created all things, in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God"?
J.T. That only confirms all that we have said, as to the great place that the assembly has. Light comes to angels, and all authorities, through the assembly; all families get light through the assembly. Wonderful, I think! We should take it to heart and rejoice in it, because we are now coming to the end of Matthew, which stresses the resurrection, not the ascension but the resurrection. It implies the unqualified power of God.
M.B.B. Does God give to the women a dual testimony to resurrection, first, in an angelic way, and then personally by the Lord Jesus? In verse 7 it speaks of the angelic testimony, and in verse 9 the Lord Himself speaks to the sisters.
J.T. Just so.
S.S.M. Why is it that they were to go into Galilee? It does not say that the Lord led them there, but it says, when they were there, "Jesus coming up spoke to them".
J.T. I suppose it was to test their faith. "Some doubted", it says. I suppose it would bring out
{325}
what faith there was and how the work of God had taken effect in them, and that it should be brought out. So He says, "Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me". And then it says, in verse 16, "The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted". I suppose the Lord would bring out the faith, the work of God that had been effected in them, and evidently it was needed to do that, because some of them were doubting. So that everything now that is coming before us is to help us. It is not now them, but us. We are the ones that are to be helped.
P.H.H. Does that open up the question of reaching the Lord where He is at any time, in order to have power? In Luke's gospel He told them to stay where they were, but in Matthew's gospel He tells them to go to Galilee. I was wondering whether this great thought of power means that we must reach the Lord in order to bring Him into a situation, if it is a question of ministry, for instance.
J.T. Well, but you pray. You do not have to reach the Lord physically, to ask Him to come and do things for us.
P.H.H. Would this allow for the exercise of reaching Him in prayer?
J.T. That is good. You add the words "in prayer", and I think it is very good to think of that, because He will do anything for us, for the saints.
Ques. Is not power all the more necessary because of the systematised error that is suggested in the paragraph from verses 11 - 15, which resulted in a lie being current to this day?
J.T. I think it is just what we were saying already, as to a certain system that we have often
{326}
alluded to, for that is where the lie is really located. It has come into Christianity, with great pretension. The work of the devil, as a liar, is in that system.
Ques. Is that why it is Galilee and not Jerusalem?
J.T. Just so. It is reproach, reproach is attached to Galilee.
Ques. What is the bearing of the word *quickly* in regard to all this? The angel says "go quickly", and then it says "going out quickly ... they ran".
J.T. Some of us are slow, and negligent or careless too, but of themselves they went quickly, and they ran, accentuating their speed. I think it is a good thing to have in our minds that things are to be done quickly.
V.C.L. Would you say a word as to why every one in this chapter receives a commission and whether that has a bearing today? The angel is commissioned, the sisters are commissioned, and the disciples are commissioned.
J.T. That is good. The Lord is ready to give a commission to anyone who is capable of taking it. He will take on anyone who is capable of doing things, and carrying out the work of God. The Lord is ready to give a commission, which involves giving him power to do it. The real difficulty is that there are not enough of that kind; there is too much slothfulness and carelessness in the service of God.
P.L. "Abounding always in the work of the Lord".
J.T. Yes, "knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord".
L.H.B.P. Would you say that the sisters with their superior sensibilities are particularly fitted to write the hymns referred to this morning?
J.T. Well, there are very good hymns written by sisters, but the best hymns we have are Mr. Darby's. That is without question. At the same time, sisters
{327}
can well count on the Lord to help them, if they want to write hymns.
Ques. Is there not some particular inference in the fact that the last paragraph is specific to the eleven disciples?
J.T. It is a broken number too. Do you mean that?
Rem. Yes. But it was not a commission to all and sundry, it was to the eleven disciples. Although it was a broken position, I thought it left room for what was specific by way of commission.
J.T. Well, indeed. Quite so. They carried it out, even if they had a broken number. Sometimes a broken number is a humbling and distressing number, but they were not distressed. They were humbled, no doubt, but they were not distressed. "But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them". They were diligent too, in carrying out what He had appointed. "And when they saw him, they did homage to him" -- that is, they worshipped Him -- "but some doubted".
Eu.R. In verse 10 He designates them "my brethren". Would that involve dignity although in the place of reproach?
J.T. Oh! I think so. I think it would involve dignity. It is "my brethren", not '*the* brethren' but "my brethren", and that is more dignified, and more glorious too.
Ques. The mountain position seems to remain. They do not seem to come down. The Lord says, "I am with you" there. Does that show the elevated level on which the testimony is to be maintained?
J.T. Just so. I think it will be noticed that there are seven mountains mentioned in the book; so that the idea is one of elevation, and it stays till the very end.
{328}
P.H.H. "The mountain which Jesus had appointed them". Does that open up the way for the Lord's commandments to be maintained, even in reproach? Would that help us to go into Corinthians, for instance, in our assembly position?
J.T. Quite so, and too the sense of suffering often that goes with it. The commandments sometimes involve suffering, and it is well to face that too.
A.J.G. Does the fact that the Lord says "There they shall see me" involve that we are to gain an apprehension of the Lord as with us in this testimonial position?
J.T. Quite so. He has appointed the place, He means that there should be some suitable effect of the acceptance of it.
Ques. Is there not a touch of dignity about the thought of *appointed*? It is not merely a mountain that is commanded, but a mountain that was appointed. It seems to suggest a suitable place.
J.T. Quite so. We all know, in a military sense, how important positions are, and that is the idea here, so that the Lord directs to certain positions. The position is Galilee, which implies reproach.
Ques. It says that "some doubted". Having in mind the footnote: 'Or were at a loss [what to think], hesitated', would that be the opposite to the quick movement of these women and would work to the retarding of our hearts in the necessary rapid learning?
J.T. Just so. There are many like that. We wonder why it should be, so much teaching among the Lord's people and yet such poor understanding of the truth. We often speak about persons who are quick learners, but quick learners are apt to be inaccurate learners, apt to be. At the same time there is such a thing as quick learning.
{329}
P.H.H. Is not this position in itself very encouraging, referring to what you said earlier as to the full furnishings here? It is a broken position outwardly, but the Lord Himself is there and His commandments and all power.
J.T. That is just our own position now, here today. It is broken, for all the brethren are not with us, but we go on nevertheless. I think it is a great matter to go on in spite of a broken position.
W.C. Would the seven mountains merge into the one great thought of "the mountain of God" in @Exodus 3?
J.T. I think it is a general idea of elevation in Matthew.
H.H. The thought of power comes in. I was thinking not only of the power that raised Christ from the dead, which has been said to be the greatest display of God's power, but it says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth", so that there is support right on to the end.
J.T. Just so. I suppose the idea of "in heaven and upon earth", is just to bring out that it is general, and that the saints should know it. They should understand that it is capable of being known.
H.H. Do you not think it will be more obvious as we go on to the end? With the enemy so busy, shall we not need to be more conscious of this power?
J.T. That may be so, but I am not so sure that things will increase very much. I think we are still in limitations, but I never like to use the word 'remnant' to anything attached to the assembly. The *whole* idea is before us, in what we have even today. We can speak of things as a whole, without any hesitation.
G.C.S. "Jerusalem! -- mountains are round about her, and Jehovah is round about his people". "Behold, *I* am with you all the days". Would that fit in?
{330}
J.T. Very good. That is just what we are talking about. "Behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age".
G.C.S. Would that fit in with "Emmanuel ... 'God with us'" of chapter 1?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Could a word be said with regard to the chief priests 'buying off' the soldiers? Are we to learn from that that there is organised opposition by the religious elements in the world as allied with the political?
J.T. We have just spoken about that a few minutes ago. Verses 12 to the end of verse 14, refer to a certain system which is characterised, from the very beginning, with lying and deceitfulness, and it still exists. I always hesitate to mention it, because the enemy might make use of the information, but I am sure it is true. This particular system is characterised by these verses; that is to say, deceitfulness and satanic lying.
Ques. Are these verses an illustration of the working of the gates of hades, the fact that they took counsel and deliberated about it together?
J.T. Quite so; the gates of hades. The gates are the places of administration, but they might be administering lies or telling untruthfulness.
Rem. But the truth makes its way in spite of it all.
J.T. Just so; that is the point of the gospels and the epistles. The truth is in the Scriptures. They are the Scriptures of truth.
Ques. Would you say something about the power to *make* disciples? After the Lord has said "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth", He says, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations". I was wondering whether there would be divinely given power in the Spirit to produce disciples through the instruction of the truth. It
{331}
says of Paul and Barnabas in @Acts 14 that they *made* disciples.
J.T. I think what you say is right. I think too what has been said about untruthfulness or lying is also right and very important to observe. The system we have been talking about is modifying itself and pretending to be sympathetic to Protestantism, but it is deceit and an endeavour to meet the real difficulty, that communism is spreading too fast for them.
Ques. Does Galilee answer to Gilgal? @Joshua 5 speaks of circumcision by stone knives and the reproach of Egypt being rolled away. Then the place was called Gilgal to this day, and then the passover was eaten there.
A.J.G. The reproach of Egypt is not the same thing as the reproach of the name of Christ with which we are to be identified, is it? The reproach of Egypt is something we have to get rid of, but the reproach of Christ is something we have to embrace.
J.T. Yes, quite so. There is glory in it.
Rem. "Not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also".
J.T. That is right. Just so.
P.H.H. How does the economy stand here? What is the setting of it -- "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"?
J.T. Well, you could not reverse the order, could you?
P.H.H. No. I think we see that.
J.T. That is one thing to help us, for you cannot reverse this order. The Father has the first place, and the Son has the second place, and the Spirit has the third place. That is, it is the order of one, two, three. It is a very wonderful thing, that the divine Persons are pleased to take up this attitude in order to instruct us.
{332}
A.J.G. Do you mean that the Father is the supreme thought, and that the Son and the Spirit are to be recognised as serving mediatorially in relation to it?
J.T. Just so. Mediatorially is the word. The Spirit and the Son are pleased to take that up, and They do it, of course, perfectly, and They are doing it because of the assembly. Everything has the assembly in mind just now.
J.T.Jr. Would the Lord Jesus being *made* Lord involve that everything is under His hands and that He is the great Administrator of everything?
J.T. That is said definitely in @John 3. "The Father ... has given all things to be in his hand". But, at the same time, in the order of one, two, three, the Father is first, the Father is before Him, and so He says Himself, "My Father is greater than I".
J.T.Jr. I was thinking of the reference in verse 18 of our chapter. He says, "All power has been given me". That is, what has been given to Him is mediatorial, involving His lordship.
J.T. Well, just so. It is mediatorial, but still the Father is before and the Father has power too, you know. You cannot say therefore that the Father has not a part in the power, because He has, and certain references throughout this gospel speak of that. It says, "Be *ye* therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect".
H.H. How many divine Persons are in this thought of what is mediatorial?
J.T. Two. Two Persons.
H.H. You include the Holy Spirit in that?
J.T. Certainly.
H.H. You do not include the Father?
J.T. No.
Ques. Is that not proved in @1 Corinthians 15, "For he has put all things in subjection under his
{333}
feet. But when he says that all things are put in subjection, it is evident that it is except him who put all things in subjection to him".
J.T. Good. That helps. The Father is excepted there. I mean the Father is supreme. At the same time, what existed before what we call the economy, into which They have now come, is wonderful and mysterious. We have to recognise there is something beyond our knowledge, and God has decreed that it should be so. We do not know everything.
P.H.H. When it says in @Romans 11: 36, "of him, and through him", would the "through him" involve Christ and the Spirit?
J.T. "Through"? Yes.
P.H.H. That is, it is God who has done it all, but He has done it by way of Christ and the Spirit?
J.T. Very good. I think it is a sort of doxology, is it not?
P.H.H. Yes. @Romans 11: 33, "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor? or who has first given to him, and it shall be rendered to him? For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen".
J.T. Just so. Well, that is God Himself. So that all mediatorial actions are not simply attributable to the Son and the Spirit, although it might seem so, but the Father too, takes on things of Himself.
J.P.H. Would you say something as to "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". It is one name, but there are three Persons involved. I was wondering about the perfect oneness that exists in the Godhead, though there are three Persons. I was wondering if you would say
{334}
something about it -- one name, one fame and so on.
J.T. A very good question. I am glad you asked it, because it stresses the idea that God is One. It says in @1 Timothy 2: "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus". It is one name, and it involves the infinite unity in the Godhead. We must not speak of it as we would speak of ordinary things, or ordinary unity; it is infinite. We cannot compass it, it is just beyond us, and we bow to that, and it is our wisdom to do so. God is telling us all we should know, but there are things that we do not know, which He reserves to Himself.
J.P.H. Is that all confirmed by the Greek word translated "to" in @Matthew 28: 19, "Make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit", which directs the mind to the point to be reached. Are we to come to an understanding by the Spirit of the great matter that is before us in this verse?
J.T. Quite so. It is the Deity included in the three Persons. Just as I was saying, we cannot get around it, we cannot understand it. God gives us to know that it is His own matter. He gives us to know too that He is saying all that is necessary to us.
Ques. Does not the oft-repeated word 'inscrutable' really cover it?
J.T. That is right.
E.A.L. When we speak of the thought of unity with regard to divine Persons, we cannot think of any possibility of disunity.
J.T. Well, quite so. There is no possibility of disunity in Them. Everything is *infinitely* perfect.
Eu.R. Would oneness be a better word than unity?
J.T. I think it would.
{335}
Eu.R. It has been said we may distinguish but we cannot separate.
J.T. Well, that is quite good.
J.S.E. Is there something very attractive and touching in the fact that all this is committed to persons in the surroundings of the appointed mountain?
J.T. Good. That is the truth clearly.
J.S.E. And does not this, by extension, throw some light for us on the inability of persons not accepting the reproach of Christ to come at the truth?
J.T. I would say that. They cannot come into the truth; and yet how many there are in that position, myriads who have no thought of coming into the truth. But we thank God that *we* are in it. It is what God has brought about.
{336}
WHAT GOD IS FOR HIS PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY ARE FOR HIM
@Numbers 1: 1 - 19; @Numbers 2: 1 - 17
J.T. In order to reduce the time spent in reading, it will be observed that paragraphs relating to certain of the standards have been omitted. In order to fill out the whole section, we should have to read down to the end of chapter 2, but what has been read is sufficient to bring out the thoughts that are in mind, first as to the individual believer, which is in the first part of chapter 1; secondly, as to the local position, which we have in chapter 2; and thirdly, as to the universal position, which is typified in the tent of meeting. The general thought, of course, is to bring out what God is for His people and what they are for Him, but much is said to emphasise the personal dignity of the saints, including priestly dignity. Then in the second chapter it is in mind to bring out the local position, such as London, and then to bring out the universal position which is centred in the tent of meeting, *including the Levites*, because they were in charge of the tent of meeting, and their position was universal. The first thing therefore is the idea of pedigree, and, in order to bring out the thoughts as to it, the early sections of chapter 1 are to be noted. It says that Moses and Aaron were to take "the sum of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, after their families, according to their fathers houses, by the number of the names, every male, according to their polls; from twenty years and upward, all that go forth to military service in Israel: ye shall number them according to their hosts, thou and Aaron. And with you there shall be a man for every tribe, a man who is the head" -- notice this -- "the head of his father's house". And the names are given after that. Then we have in
{337}
chapter 2, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, The children of Israel shall encamp every one by his standard", -- pointing to local position, "with the ensign of their father's house; round about the tent of meeting, afar off, opposite to it shall they encamp". Finally, in verse 17, as we have already remarked, we have "And the tent of meeting shall set forth, the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; as they encamp, so shall they set forth, every man in his place, according to their standards". It is thought that stress should be laid on the pedigree; that is to say, the line of descent, and whether the work of the Spirit has its place amongst us, and then the Holy Spirit being, of course, the basis typically, the Holy Spirit is seen in "the whole assembly of the children of Israel, after their families, according to their father's houses, by the number of the names, every male, according to their polls; from twenty years and upwards", and so forth. It is thought that the pedigree comes first, and then that the idea of the age, "from twenty years old and upward", implies the indwelling Holy Spirit, in the names.
J.J.T. "Expressed by their names"; is that the work of the Holy Spirit coming to light in each individual?
J.T. That, of course, refers to the princes or leaders, but we have the families, and first each person, and the princes numbering them, the princes being associated with Moses and Aaron. If a person has not got the Spirit he is not in the assembly; if he has not got the Spirit he is not born again really, so as to be identifiable, we might say, although he might be born again without having the Spirit, but the new birth has to be identified. Of course, we have to deal with the types as augmenting the New Testament, because we cannot build up things on the Old Testament wholly, we must bring in the
{338}
New, because the word is "things new and old". It is not 'old and new'.
A.B. Could you say a little more about pedigree, please?
J.T. It is the line of descent which brings in birth, ancestry. Paul spoke about his father's house, and so forth, from his outset.
P.H.H. It says a good deal in the beginning of John's gospel about birth, "who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God".
J.T. Then the 3rd chapter follows on that and should be connected with it clearly.
P.H.H. I was going to ask as to that. The Lord Jesus says, "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God".
J.T. And then we get "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God". That is, he is shut out if the work of God has not begun in him, and if it is not being completed too by the presence of the Holy Spirit received into the heart. The love of God is shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit.
Ques. Is it in your mind that the expression "from twenty years old" suggests a certain stage arrived at experimentally in the recognition of the Spirit?
J.T. I think so. It is the idea of manhood. It is not simply that a child is born, but it is any one being born anew, and manhood develops out of that, of course. I believe the "twenty years old and upward" refers to manhood, manhood in the full sense of the word; that is, involving redemption and the reception of the Spirit.
P.H.H. So would the name in chapter 1, as it says, "by the number of the names, every male", be in line with that thought of twenty years old and upwards?
{339}
J.T. That is what I thought, because twenty years old and upward implies full manhood. It is not a child, but full manhood, and that implies redemption and the Spirit; that is to say, the intelligence is involved in it.
A.B. Would the man in @John 9 suggest one who had reached manhood?
J.T. I think so. His parents said, "*He* is of age: ask *him*". I think the whole section, chapters 9 and 10, would imply manhood, because the Spirit is implied in it.
A.B. I was thinking of the expression to which you have referred. "*He* is of age: ask *him*". It is a man who can state things for himself.
J.T. That is right. Very good. That is what his parents said.
Ques. Would @Romans 8 bring in manhood, in one who can say, "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death", @Romans 8: 2.
J.T. Very good. "Free from the law of sin and death"; that one is in liberty. Romans opens up the whole subject of the Spirit. The Spirit is mentioned eighteen times in that chapter, so that we should be well versed in the thought of the Spirit, involving manhood.
P.L. Are "the princes" suggested in the salutations at the end of Romans?
J.T. I would think so. Very good. There are twenty salutations.
Ques. Is there a certain progression suggested in what you have outlined; first the pedigree, birth, and then a certain arrival experimentally in the gain of the Spirit at the age of twenty, and, following that, distinctiveness in the princes that are named? So that in the end of Romans you have persons that are worthy of mention by name.
{340}
J.T. Very good: Then the Levites come in, I suppose, for they surround the tabernacle. They look after the interests of God on earth, indeed in His house. That is the great point, that God's interests are looked after. The tabernacle is surrounded by the Levites.
Ques. By persons capacitated for what they have to do?
A.M. And they all would go forth for military service. Is that the end of @Romans 12? "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good". Is that the kind of conflict?
J.T. Very good. But then we are trying to get at the point of these salutations, the "salutes" to the brethren, before we go further. We are to salute the brethren, and to kiss the brethren with a holy kiss.
H.H. Would not the names mentioned at the end of Romans indicate good church material?
J.T. Quite so. I would say that fully. And the mystery is spoken of at the end, too.
A.M. And is not a sister brought forward first, as representative of the thought of manhood according to Romans, Phoebe?
J.T. Well, quite. She looked after the interests of the Lord, too, peculiarly. We have something similar in Philippians in those women who contended along with Paul in the glad tidings.
Rem. The salutations seem to progress in @Romans 16. There are the apostle's personal salutations, are there not? Then he says, "Salute one another with a holy kiss", which would be the local position, and then "All the assemblies of Christ salute you", which would be the universal thought.
J.T. Very good. And now we must get on with the beginning of Numbers, so as to enlarge on the individual thought, the individual believer who has the Spirit, and who has a pedigree. After that we
{341}
can proceed further, to the groups that are formed, the universal idea is suggested in the four distinct groups of three tribes each. We have east, south, west and north; so that every point of the compass is touched on, and including the military idea specially in the tribe of Dan, standing out to guard everything; see @Numbers 10: 25. The four points of the compass are included in these four distinct groups of tribes.
P.H.H. It says in the very beginning of Numbers that "Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness ... in the tent of meeting". Are you suggesting that the wilderness is the place where this spiritual manhood is developed?
J.T. I think so. In fact, I believe in the early days 'In the Wilderness' was the name of the book of Numbers, meaning that it is the position we are in every day of the week; not the first day of the week, but all the other days of the week are the wilderness days.
P.H.H. Actually the other portions too, both the local position and the universal outlook, come to light in the wilderness, do they not? We suffer no lack in the position where we are.
J.T. Every necessary provision is made, but still it is the wilderness. We have to wait for the land. We have to go across the Jordan. The Jordan really separates the wilderness. The part between the Dead Sea and the Great Sea is the land, the land of promise. It is a small territory but it is the land promised by God to His people. He said He espied it for them (@Ezekiel 20: 6), as though from a distance.
H.H. Is it not to be appreciated that Leviticus comes before Numbers? That is, their approach to God has to be in mind in treading the wilderness?
J.T. Quite so. We have to get the tabernacle properly located first, and then the position of it in
{342}
the wilderness. Then finally we get the position in the land, which involves the book of Joshua. Joshua refers to the entrance into the land of Canaan.
C.W. Why is it that both on the individual side, and in the local position, the thought of military service is so stressed?
J.T. Because we are in the enemy's territory and are exposed to enemies. Romans really involves that, although Ephesians is the great book that deals with the warfare in the heavenlies, Joshua, of course, terminating that. Joshua is the great war book, in a true military sense. Joshua is the leader.
Ques. This being the wilderness, is there any particular stress on both Moses and Aaron being addressed?
J.T. Well, there is, and Aaron even at one time in the book is addressed *before* Moses; see chapter 18. He is addressed *before* Moses; so that the priesthood sometimes takes precedence of the leader, of the military man. Moses is the mediator. Moses is the great leader. It says in @Galatians 3, "ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator", but the priesthood goes with him. The priesthood comes in after Moses generally, but Aaron sometimes precedes Moses, and that has to be noted too. Every item has to be noted.
P.L. Moses standing more for light in authority, and Aaron for love and grace?
J.T. That is right. Of course, Moses represents the mediator. There is only one Mediator; the Man Christ Jesus is the only one Mediator there is. Mediator service may be found in any one of us, in a subordinate sense, but the Lord Jesus is the real Mediator. It says "the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus", @1 Timothy 2: 5. It is "man".
A.B. Would the military service be called for to protect the dwelling-place of God in the wilderness?
{343}
J.T. Quite so. That is just what it is, and hence the Levites are all round about it. But then the military position is also pointed out here, in those that are able to go forth to war, meaning persons who are twenty years old and upward; but a Levite is to be thirty years old, meaning that he requires more intelligence and experience than the ordinary military man.
P.H.H. Do you think Paul's insisting on "the Lord" in Corinthians stands somewhat for the military position? He speaks about the fellowship of God's Son, Jesus Christ *our Lord*, and then he speaks about our labour being in the Lord, and being married in the Lord. Do you think that would stand for a kind of military position that has to be guarded?
J.T. I think so. Very good. Will you say more about it?
P.H.H. I was thinking of the title; it is not merely the Person, "Jesus", and not only the anointing as suggested in "Christ", but the authoritative position of power, which is implied, is it not, in the title "Lord". Did not Paul take up the truth from that point of view, in using the phrase "in the Lord"?
J.T. Very good, and that brings up another point, and that is, the only One of the divine Persons who is said to be *made* Lord is Christ. The Father is Lord, and the Spirit is Lord, for they are both called Lord, but there is only One that is *made* Lord, and that is Christ, "the man Christ Jesus". He is said to be made Lord and Christ.
P.H.H. Would you say, therefore, that when we normally use the word *Lord* in assembly service, we mean Jesus? If we are speaking of the Father as Lord or the Spirit as Lord, we should have to make it plain?
{344}
J.T. Quite so, make it plain. But, at the same time, James speaks of the Father as Lord, and the Spirit is spoken of elsewhere in that way, but Christ is said to be *made* Lord. So that the three divine Persons are to be always taken account of, only One has become a Sufferer; One who died, it is Christ that died. There is only One of the divine Persons who has died, and He is the One to lead in everything, except the Father in regard of dignity, according to the economy, Father, Son and Holy Spirit; but the divine Persons in the abstract are evidently all on the same level.
F.C.H. He is the only One that is spoken of as being "made sin", is He not?
J.T. "Made sin". It is very touching.
F.C.H. And *made* "some little inferior to angels".
J.T. Just so. That is to say, He suffered; He is a Sufferer. We are always touched by the fact that it is Christ that died. He is the One that suffered. He lay three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. It should touch every heart, that the Lord should lie in death.
C.H. Referring back to the reference to Corinthians, Paul exhorts them to "be vigilant; stand fast in the faith, quit yourselves like men, be strong". The position seems to require manhood, does it not?
J.T. Very good. It is manhood, exactly. "Quit yourselves like men". It is manhood, not boyhood, although boyhood is attached to believers too, in @Acts 20, where it says "they brought away, the boy alive". The Lord is said to be a boy, too, in Luke, while in Matthew He is spoken of as "the little child".
E.C.M. Does confessing Jesus as Lord, with the mouth, link up with the military thought?
J.T. That is right. Every one that goes forth to military service confesses with the mouth the Lord
{345}
Jesus, and believes in the heart that God raised Him from the dead. That is the ground of salvation.
A.D.T. Would the word of the apostle Paul to Timothy, "*Thou*, O man of God ... strive earnestly in the good conflict of faith", enter into this matter of military service?
J.T. Well, there are certain things that are said in the Old Testament on that point. Daniel is spoken of as a 'man', and Elijah and Elisha are each spoken of as a 'man of God', and Ezekiel especially is spoken of as 'son of man'. These are titles which, in a certain sense, belong to Christ, especially the 'Son of man'. The Lord uses that of Himself almost constantly, but 'a man of God' is not spoken of much in the New Testament. I think Timothy is the only one that is called 'a man of God' in the New Testament. But clearly the idea is one who cares for the interests of God. He is a lover of God. He is a man of God. "*Thou*, O man of God", is a distinct title given to Timotheus.
Ques. Would that involve not only the twenty years old, but the thirty years?
J.T. Quite so; the Levites would come under that heading.
P.H.H. Does manhood begin earlier nowadays?
J.T. It is for the young men to say. I think the young men ought to aspire to it, and that would mean that they ought to keep to the elder brethren as much as they can, so as to take on their character.
Rem. There is such a thing as learning by observation as well as by experience. The man of God in 2 Kings has a peculiar place, and I think it well worth while to mention it. Elisha is given a great place, and he was characterised by companying with Elijah.
W.C. Would you say something about the names of the men that are actually mentioned. "These
{346}
are the names of the men that shall stand with you". What place would they come in today?
J.T. They are princes, I think. The point is dignity, and perhaps we are very slow in according the respect that should be accorded to those who are serving the Lord in this sense, because they require respect. They are not to be reduced to smallness, but they require respect.
W.C. You were speaking of the older brethren, and the young ones moving with them. I wondered whether this fitted in with what you were saying?
J.T. Well, I think it does, because they are princes.
Ques. Referring to the remark as to learning by observation as well as by experience, had you that in mind in referring to Elisha and the wealthy woman of Shunem? She said, "I perceive that this is a holy man of God".
J.T. Just so. That is what I was thinking of.
Ques. I was going to ask you, in that connection, did not Elisha learn that the staff was not enough? In @2 Kings 4 you have Elisha, and the boy that was given to the Shunammite dies, and the prophet sends Gehazi with his staff, but nothing happened on that score until he came, and then he identified himself wholly with the condition he had to meet, and God came in and there was life given.
J.T. Are you not intending also to include the fact that Elisha walked about the house?
Rem. That is said as well, of course.
J.T. Perhaps many of us do not understand why he should walk about the house. Elijah stretched himself on the boy, but Elisha walked about the house, as if there were bad books lying about that young people could read and be defiled by. Now, please continue.
Rem. I was only trying to emphasise what you were already saying, in regard of the prophet being
{347}
called "the man of God". Elisha constantly through that chapter is styled "man of God", and I wondered whether it showed the lesson we have to learn, that it was not mere authority that affected the resuscitation of the boy, but the substance was in the man of God.
J.T. Well, now, I think we might as well touch on what Elijah did too in regard of stretching himself on the boy.
Rem. In verse 29 of @2 Kings 4 Elisha said, "lay my staff upon the face of the lad", and then in verse 31, "And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the lad; but there was neither voice, nor sign of attention. And he returned to meet him, and told him saying, The lad is not awaked. And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. And he went in and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to Jehovah. And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, and bent over him; and the flesh of the child grew warm. And he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and bent over him. And the lad sneezed seven times, and the lad opened his eyes. And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. And he called her; and she came to him. And he said, Take up thy son".
J.T. Well now, would you mind touching on Elijah, and the same sort of thing happening.
Rem. It says in @1 Kings 17: 17, "And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to me to call mine iniquity to remembrance, and to slay my son?
{348}
And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. And he cried to Jehovah and said,, Jehovah, my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to Jehovah and said, Jehovah, my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again!"
J.T. Now, notice that, "child's soul". That is something to be noted. I think what we may remark is the connection between these two prophets, and the similar things that happened in their histories. It is a reminder for us, I think, of how brethren should move together, and even imitate one another if necessary. If one brother has something particularly good, not to be ashamed to bring it forward in ministry, even if another has said it.
P.H.H. Would the fact that we have a brother linked up with Paul, and sometimes more than one, when he writes his epistles, be somewhat similar? It says, "these are the names of the men that shall stand with you". So we have Paul and Sosthenes, and Paul and Timothy, and Paul and Silas.
J.T. Just so. You might say they were particularly Paul's children; they were begotten by Paul, and that involved that Paul had a certain authority over them, that he did not have over others, not even over Apollos. They were peculiarly under Paul, and such a thing as that must be existent amongst us as to the service of God.
Rem. So that Elijah and Elisha are linked together in a peculiarly intimate way.
J.T. That is what I thought. It serves to illustrate that brethren should associate with each other. Sometimes the disciples are sent out two and two, and then again singly, and again in Matthew it says,
{349}
"two of you". To get the truth according to Matthew you must get two, two disciples. So that we ought to be linked up with one another in association and in love one towards another.
P.L. "The same steps" -- Paul and Titus.
J.T. Just so. "Have we not walked ... in the same steps?"
J.S.E. Could we have a word as to the four camps, involving three tribes in each?
J.T. It is to bring out the thought of what is threefold, and four times three would be twelve, which is the administrative side. Then the Levites are in between, abiding by the tabernacle. A three-fold cord is not quickly broken, it says, and I think the idea of three has a great place in association with one another in the divine service.
Ques. Is there the basic idea of meetings associating with one another in the three?
J.T. Not unless in a local sense. That is the only sense in which they could be grouped together. Maybe you have twenty meetings in London, but you cannot go beyond what is actually within the bounds of the city. We should not go beyond that.
H.H. And the whole twenty is to be called the locality, not just one of the twenty; that is not the locality really, is it?
J.T. You mean the whole twenty in London? Quite so, but not more than that. No meeting should be called London, unless it is within the boundaries. The boundaries are ordered by the authorities; they are not our boundaries, but what the authorities limit, because the city is not established by us, it is established by the authorities.
E.C.M. So it is "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".
J.T. That is right. That is just it.
E.C.M. That establishes the local position.
J.T. Quite so.
{350}
Ques. Is the point here in the four points of the compass being mentioned, that every possible avenue of attack is protected?
J.T. I should think that is the idea. Take, for instance, Paul himself, his nephew covered him at one time, his sister's son. That shows how even relatives, whatever they may be otherwise, may be used to help the testimony in that sense.
Rem. Then the brethren let him down through a window in a basket on another occasion, so that many extraordinary means may be used, but every point of attack is met.
J.T. Quite so, and that is why you get the three fours here, surrounding the tabernacle, but the Levites immediately round about it. They represent the universal idea, spiritually, not physically but spiritually. If we talk of London, that is physical, but if we talk of universality in regard to fellowship and the like, that is spiritual. Universal fellowship is spiritual. I hope I am not saying what is not intelligible, but I would say that we should make a distinction between physical position and boundaries, and spiritual boundaries, because what is spiritual leads up to heaven. We have the idea of the Lord going up, and we cannot tell how far He went. It says, "A cloud received him out of their sight". But He went up, and there would be a link in the word up between what is in heaven and what is down here, in a physical sense.
P.H.H. When Paul writes to a local company like the Corinthians, he seems to have the universal outlook in his mind, and something exceedingly elevated on the line of what is 'up', would you say?
J.T. Just so. So that, the expression "with all that in every place" implies the universal position as over against the local position. "The assembly of God which is in Corinth" is the one local position.
{351}
Rem. And he does not overlook the personal side, because he adds, not only "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth", but "to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints". So that he includes the personal, the local and the universal position in the letter.
J.T. Yes. Just so.
G.W.B. Would the reference in @1 Corinthians 11 to "the assemblies of God" be the universal? It says, "We have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God".
J.T. That is the universal thought. Quite so. "If any one think to be contentious, we have no such custom". There was no custom such as that acknowledged by Paul.
C.H. So that none of these tribes and their standards and dispositions would be centres to themselves. The central thought would be the tent of meeting?
J.T. That is right. The tent of meeting is properly called the tabernacle. It is where God is, as John says, the Lord Jesus tabernacled amongst us. That is the great spiritual thought of being in the midst.
F.C.H. The Levites live together and move together, yet every one is in his place.
J.T. That is the idea, and hence the many things that have been raised in years past in regard to the local positions, and brethren being in localities. They have their relation to the universal position, but they have a local relation as well. That has been much canvassed during the past fifty years, and God has greatly helped us as to the local idea and the universal idea, and the brethren would do well to keep to that, and I think Numbers is intended to help us to keep to it.
J.O.S. Is the local idea maintained in the four rows of three on the breastplate?
{352}
J.T. We would have to go back, of course, to the Old Testament, but I think you are right. The priest's garments must have something to do with all this.
P.H.H. Say some more about the Levites, please. It says, "The tent of meeting shall set forth, the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps" (verse 17).
J.T. That is what I was thinking of at the beginning, and now I would be glad if the brethren would touch on it because the tent of meeting is the great central thought in the service of God. That is to say, the tabernacle is where God is, and the Lord Jesus Himself takes up that attitude in the first chapter of the gospel of John. It says, "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt" (or tabernacled) "among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth". That is the central and wonderful thought for us, to keep always in our minds. It gives character to the gospel of John, because it works out into eternal life.
A.M. Why is the tent of meeting in the middle between the two camps in front of it and the two behind?
J.T. Oh, it is just the idea of it being central. By Christ we have access by one Spirit to the Father, but the Father is the great thought. We draw near to the Father. It says in Ephesians, "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".
Ques. Would that not help the levites to maintain a universal outlook?
J.T. Quite so. It means that we are touching on the priesthood. The priesthood is a great thought, spiritually, but the levites are the attendants on the priesthood, and then the common people are an outer circle in relation to that.
{353}
Rem. A levite has a location in a local setting, but his outlook must not be local, because the more he is with God in the centre of things the more he has a universal outlook on the saints and the interests of God.
J.T. Quite so, and so we should not go away too much from our localities. We should be at home sometimes, some Lord's Days, anyway.
A.M. I was going to ask in that connection as to the difference between the stationary position in the four points of the compass and the moving position as when they were setting forth, the two in front and two behind, whether that applies to the testimony today?
J.T. I am not so sure that the word 'behind' is properly used.
A.M. It says of the camp of Dan on the northward that when the camp set forward "They shall set forth last".
J.T. Well, it was the order that God gave them. We have the order of the encampment, but then it is a question of movement from the encampment. The encampment is a place for some changing of thought, or taking advice, and so forth, but when it is a question of movement, Dan, of course, is the last. He is spiritually the last. Four is the number covering the whole matter, corresponding to the four points of the compass. The west is, what I might say, a somewhat difficult, dark position, whereas Dan's position on the north was a dangerous position. It was a cold region, a suffering region.
W.C. Is the idea of the camp of Judah moving forward first a spiritual lead which could be followed universally?
J.T. That is the idea, and gift comes in immediately to strengthen the position, in the Levites, and therefore they are nearest to the tabernacle, where the spiritual idea is, indeed where God is. God
{354}
dwells there, and that is the place to be, because the strength and the liberty and the joy come out from God Himself. As we have just quoted, "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". That is the greatest place of privilege.
P.H.H. Does the term "one Spirit" refer not only to what we enjoy in privilege, but all the truth that comes out in the testimony? There are not two lines of truth working at one time.
J.T. Quite so, but the Holy Spirit is in mind in that passage.
P.H.H. Yes. I meant that. These positions round the tent of meeting would save us from becoming too local and hanging on local customs.
J.T. Quite so. That is right.
C.W. We have the individual side, and then the locality, and then the Levites, but then it comes back to "every man in his place". Is that to be maintained right through?
J.T. Quite so; maintaining each man's position, so that each man has his place and service, and he ought to be always ready to be found, because he is a travelling man; he is a Levite and a hard-working man. That is the word that comes in, in regard to the Levites later on in the book. It is hard work.
R.S.W. Is that the work of God? It says in @1 Corinthians 12, "God has set certain in the assembly".
J.T. Just so, "certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets"; and so forth.
Rem. Paul seems to bring the whole of the Corinthians into the thought of toil, "abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord". That involves hard work, does it not?
J.T. Just so.
P.L. Is it service to which one is subjected, as it says elsewhere, involving labour, suffering, military service and so on?
{355}
J.T. Just so. I am glad you said that, because it is hard work. The sisters and brothers should all know that, and those who are not engaged in it should realise that it is hard work. Even going about and staying in houses, sometimes it is quite irksome. So we have to be patient, and then respectful as to those who are serving, for they have hard work to do.
E.C.M. The Lord speaks about the harvest being great, but the workmen are few. Would the idea of 'workmen' link on with your thought?
J.T. Just so. So that we have the word in the Scriptures that God helped the Levites.
Ques. Is it not interesting that in the passage you quote, where it speaks of God helping the Levites, it was at their work of bringing the ark into the midst of the tent?
J.T. That was in David's day. Quite so.
Rem. It was particular work to exalt the Person of Christ as the Centre of the divine realm.
P.L. The Levites throwing their full weight into what is distinctive in the divine movement at the moment.
J.T. Quite so -- their full weight.
A.B. Would the movement of the Levites be dependent on the movement of the cloud?
J.T. You get that in chapter 9.
A.B. I was thinking of the lead the Spirit of God is giving, and the service of the Levites following on the movement of the Spirit of God universally.
J.T. Just so.
C.H. The word of Haggai to Zerubbabel and to the high priest and to the people is to be strong and to work, and does it not seem to be specially called for in days of smallness, when so much has to be done and when there are so few to do it?
J.T. Quite so.
{356}
P.H.H. And the Lord's appraisal in the addresses to the assemblies, "I know thy works", as if He is watching what is being done everywhere.
J.T. Very good.
Rem. Do we get that in @Acts 20? "I have showed you all things, that thus labouring we ought to come in aid of the weak".
J.T. That is very good. "Thus labouring". Then we have "knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord". That is another word to be thought of.
{357}
THE RIGHTS OF DIVINE PERSONS
@Acts 1: 1 - 5, 9; @Acts 2: 1 - 4; @Acts 9: 1 - 10; @Acts 10: 1 - 16
J.T. I think the passages read serve to show that divine Persons reserve rights at all times to come in on the earth or to go out into heaven, and even to stay there. There is a certain mystery attached to all this, but perhaps it is not much discerned by us, especially the fact that divine Persons, or divine messengers, indicate their rights. They have certain rights as to heavenly places and the extent even of heaven itself. The plural is much used in referring to heaven, and there is a certain mystery, as, for instance, the Lord Himself going up and the cloud receiving Him out of the sight of the disciples, so that it cannot be said how far He goes. It cannot be said with definiteness how far the Lord went, and how He went or where He went after the cloud received Him. Then we have the fact that before He went up He remained forty days with the disciples, and then He went up, and although there were certain indications that He would come back again, yet it is all left open. It is for faith to lay hold of it and expect things to happen. All will culminate in the age to come, so that completely new movements from heaven will take place and these movements may occur at any time now because we have no prophetic testimony, as to literality requiring fulfilment. We are left, therefore, in the faith period. We have to trust God as to it, and count on Him to act from His own point of view, and be ready for the actions. There are evidently worlds that are not given account of in the Scriptures, and yet God is using them. We cannot say much as to them, but we read in Hebrews of "worlds" in the plural and that God made the *worlds* by the Lord Jesus. We cannot say how many there are, or when God may
{358}
use them; they clearly go beyond the present earth where we are, and since they are in the plural, there must be more than one world. At the same time we are left to mystery, so that we just have to bow and humble ourselves as to it, but as we wait on God things happen that give some clues as to what exists, and what will happen. So that faith is left to trust in God and to leave things with Him. It says in verse 6: "They therefore, being come together, asked him saying, Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel? And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of their sight". So that clearly the position is left vague. Then the next question is whether the Lord will not come down corporeally on the earth in the interim. He comes, certainly, on the first day of the week in connection with the service of God, in the Spirit, but at the beginning He came down corporeally, as well, and this has to be taken account of. Presently He will come and, as it says in @Revelation 1, "every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him". That is when He ushers in the millennial day, but then, in the interim, faith is left to expect the Lord to come. That is to say, "The Lord Himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first". All these things are to be kept in mind, and we are not to assume that we know the things literally until the time comes for them, until the time comes when God acts. We are
{359}
therefore left in faith, for faith is the principle, namely waiting upon God.
A.J.G. Does this position of our being left in faith make the abiding presence with us of the Holy Spirit all the more valuable and important?
J.T. Very good. I should have mentioned something about that, but the fact is that the Spirit was sent down, and He remains on earth, He is not said to have gone up. He remains on earth, although He is not on earth literally, but in the assembly. He remains in the assembly, and He is here to look after things for the assembly, and act for the assembly.
A.J.G. I was thinking of how Simeon, as moving in the Spirit, came into the temple just at the right time, when things were happening. Does that fall in with your thought at all?
J.T. Just so. He is introduced as "a man in Jerusalem" -- that is characteristic of him. He was about to leave too, for the word was, "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation".
Rem. What occurred in @Acts 2 is said to be "suddenly".
J.T. And then it is a mysterious thing that happened. It says "And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing" -- all that is mysterious -- "and filled all the house" -- that should be noticed too; it was not external, abroad in the air, but it filled all the house. The house is in mind, where the disciples were.
P.H.H. Are you thinking that the coming of the sound out of heaven is one of the assertions of heaven's right to come in on the earth?
J.T. Just so. It is a sound, and then there is a light from heaven, as well. The sound is very distinctive because the word 'sound' is referred to in @1 Corinthians 14.
{360}
P.H.H. And the sound here is connected with the word 'blowing' and the note links it on with the thought of breathing, 'blowing, as of hard breathing'. Would that mean, in some way, that the inwards of God were concerned in this?
J.T. That is just what I have often thought of. You have to be careful in using the word 'inwards' but, at the same time, that is the idea. Evidently the affections of God were involved in it, which is a very touching thing to my mind, and then the sound attaching to it. Impetuous blowing would imply that the lungs would be involved. We have to be reverential in regard of God, but the idea of lungs would be involved.
Ques. Is the indication that all this took place in relation to a company that were, in a certain sense, equal to it?
J.T. Very good, that is right. The number, too, is given, about one hundred and twenty. The crowd of names refers to life.
Rem. I was thinking of the product of the Lord's own work, and His instruction to them during the forty days, resulting in a company that were together, and ready, in a certain sense, for this remarkable new movement on the part of heaven.
J.T. Just so, and then all that enters into that in a mysterious sense as in the gospel of Matthew. It says "many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many". Well, that is all we know, we can say no more about it, but at the same time it is something to be thought of, and shows that believers have access, or those of us who have faith have some access to the mysteries of God, which perhaps we do not think of very much. The very words are used -- "the mysteries of God", and then again the word 'mystery' is referred
{361}
to in connection with the assembly. Paul has that mystery, he is the minister of the assembly.
Ques. In chapter 2 it is a sound out of heaven, in chapter 9 it is a light out of heaven, in chapter 10 there is a vessel descending out of heaven. Is that a sort of culmination?
J.T. Very good, that is just what is in mind -- the sound, and the light and the sheet, too. The sheet went up and came down and went up and came down and went up to stay. It is all mystery, but we just have to bow to it, and think over it, and we become mysterious ourselves; so that we are not like ordinary people, if we are really believers, we are mysterious. If we have the Holy Spirit we are mysterious ourselves, and we are going up too, according to the passage we have just quoted, "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout". The service of God, too, in itself is mysterious, because change takes place almost constantly as we come together counting on the Spirit. The Spirit being present and the Lord coming in amongst us, a change is bound to take place. Change takes place in the Lord, and then change takes place in us. It is all mysterious, but at the same time it is instructive and solemn, and ought to direct us to heaven itself, because the idea is that we are going into heaven. We are not going beyond the heavens; we do not go outside of the realm of creation, but, at the same time, we are going into the heavens. Paul went into the heavens; he was caught up to the third heaven, and we do not know just what happened; in fact he says he did not know whether he was in the body or out of it, but there it is. He was conscious of unseen things.
Ques. Are you thinking of the expression "caught up" in the passage just quoted? "Then we, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air".
{362}
J.T. "In the air", it is remarkable, and then there is a word that follows which really concludes the idea there, "and thus we shall be always with the Lord". We cannot say how deep the air is, but still there it is, "in the air". The Lord Himself went up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight, but then how far did He go, and what realm did He go into? What can be understood as to it? These are facts, and mysterious facts, but they are spiritual facts, and they are intended to impress us, and make us spiritual.
P.L. Was that pre-figured in relation to Manoah and his wife -- the angel of Jehovah said that his name was wonderful, and then it says, after he wrought wondrously, that "as the flame went up from off the altar towards the heavens, that the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar". Manoah and his wife then worshipped.
J.T. That is an additional thought, that only adds to what we are saying. One is speaking of it because one feels that we all ought to take it to heart, as to whether we are becoming spiritual, because we are going into a spiritual realm, and God intends us to be spiritual.
P.H.H. You were speaking just now of change. There was evidently a change came about with these men, because it says in verse 7, "And all were amazed and wondered, saying, Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?" But that did not cover all the truth, did it?
J.T. Far otherwise.
P.H.H. And are you suggesting that change, therefore, is constantly going on with the saints?
J.T. I think so, and especially on the first day of the week, because the first day of the week (the Lord's day as it can be called) is a mysterious day. It is the day on which the disciples came together to
{363}
break bread, and then they had a remarkable time according to @Acts 20.
C.H. Is that indicated in @2 Corinthians 3? It speaks there of our being transformed.
J.T. Just so. That chapter contemplates the Spirit called "the Lord". The Spirit is addressed as the Lord, "the Lord the Spirit", and then we come into change because it says definitely, we are "transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit". Well, now, these are wonderful facts, and one wonders whether the brethren are being affected by them, because we ought to be prepared for heaven itself.
Ques. Is the matter of mystery, seen in the verse in @1 Corinthians 2, "the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God"? Then at the end of that chapter you have "the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one". Is that the believer, mysterious?
J.T. Quite so, "the spiritual discerns all things", a remarkable thing -- *all things*, and nobody else does, and he is not known by others; he is a mysterious man. It is more or less like the Lord Himself, of whom it is said that He went beyond all heavens. Nobody else went there as far as we know, but He must have gone into an uncreated condition. The point is mystery, and it is intended to affect us. All these facts are intended to affect us spiritually.
C.H. In the passage just quoted the apostle says, "We speak God's wisdom in a mystery", as though it is enveloped, so to speak.
J.T. Quite so.
A.J.G. Would not all this shut out the natural mind, and make us realise how entirely dependent we are on the Spirit to enter into the things of God.
J.T. We have access to them in the sense in which we have just heard read and the question is now especially about young people, whether they
{364}
are becoming sobered by it, and thus fitted for heavenly places.
G.W.B. Was the Lord's coming in @John 20, when the doors were closed, a sort of model of what you have in mind?
J.T. Just so. They were closed for fear of the Jews; it was to keep the Jews out, but the Lord Himself appeared in the midst, nevertheless. "In the midst" is the word, and that is an expression that in earlier days we had considerable conflict about. It is a phrase which ought to be kept treasured in our hearts, because it says the Lord appeared in the *midst*. Some might say, well, He is here permanently, but that is not the thought. The gospel of John shows that He comes, and comes and goes, too.
Ques. Is that why it is said that He stood -- "stood in the midst", as though there was further movement in view?
J.T. Quite so.
P.H.H. The passage in @2 Corinthians 3 was quoted. We are not told what the changes are; it says, "Transformed ... from glory to glory". Would that lead us to be constantly expectant as to any change that may come in?
J.T. I think it ought to. Then the word 'change' of course, applies to the Lord Himself. He says, "I am ... the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages". He says He *became* dead, meaning that He changed from a state of life into a state of death. Then again He is *raised* from the dead.
P.H.H. With regard to the Lord's day morning, this thought of change would stop us from thinking of the meeting as being always the same.
J.T. Quite so. I am glad you mention that, because the Lord's supper *is* the Lord's supper; it is not the Father's supper, as we often say, nor the
{365}
Spirit's supper, but the Lord's supper. Then it has a termination; it passes on to something else. The Lord becomes the Minister of the sanctuary, and He leads on to the Father, to His Father and our Father, and to His God and our God, so that God is the ultimate of everything -- we go to God.
Ques. Does that not involve a change from the local position into what is universal spiritually?
J.T. Very good, and not only that but it involves the sexes too. We begin when we come together as brothers and sisters, but then the power of the Spirit implies that there is a change, and the idea is that we are all sons eventually, because God is bringing many sons to glory. So the idea of sex no longer enters into the matter, and what we appropriate in the service of God is that we are all sons. It is a wholly spiritual thought; God is bringing many sons to glory, and sonship includes the sisters, as well as the brothers. All these things are just mentioned to show that we are dealing with spiritual things and change, change, you might say, almost constantly.
W.C. Would that be suggested in the type of Joseph giving changes of clothing to his brethren, and five changes to Benjamin?
J.T. Well, just so.
W.C. So that we may appear in accord with the way the Lord manifests Himself.
J.T. Just so. The idea of change is constantly in mind; even an individual may be changed. Paul was changed. He says: "I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago". He did not have anything of the kind before -- it was fourteen years before, and then he tells us that he was caught up to the third heaven. He did not know whether he was in the body or out of it. All these things are mysterious, and then he says he had "a thorn for the flesh",
{366}
because the Lord would preserve him from being inflated. "There was given to me", he says, "a thorn for the flesh". The flesh is to be held in check.
R.W.S. So is it quite normal for our faces and ourselves to take on a change? If there is an inward change, is there not some corresponding physical change in the faces of the saints?
J.T. Well, there is. Take Peter in the passage we read in chapter 10. He went to the house-top to pray, and became hungry, but then an ecstasy came upon him. Well, now, that was change. He had a vision, and the sheet was let down from heaven three times and then it went up to stay, so that it indicates clearly what may happen at any time. Who can say whether persons have changes or not? We do not always tell people what we go through, but we become habituated to it, habituated to change, and the service of God on the first day of the week above all brings about change. It really leads to the idea of our becoming sons in our approach to God the Father.
A.J.G. There was a change came about in Stephen even in the testimonial position. It says that "all who sat in the council, looking fixedly on him, saw his face as the face of an angel".
J.T. Quite so; very good.
H.H. Would the thought of change carry with it the thought of condition sometimes? Is there a distinction between the Lord Jesus as on earth and the Lord in resurrection? Would that indicate a change?
J.T. Quite so. He says, "a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having". That is a physical change in the Lord Himself as He died and rose again.
E.C.M. It says in @Philippians 3: "Who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity
{367}
to his body of glory". Does that suggest the final thought of change?
J.T. Just so. We shall be like Him, for He will make us like Himself. Then another thing (we have already remarked on it elsewhere) in connection with the idea of change, is quickening. That is another word that can be applied, and @Romans 8: 11 shows that we are quickened by the Spirit.
Rem. It is the mortal body you have in mind there.
J.T. Just so. The quickening by the Spirit is of what is mortal. It says "shall quicken your mortal bodies". The dead bodies are another thing, for it says, "the dead in Christ shall rise first".
Ques. Does the passage in @1 Corinthians 15 shows that all are changed. "Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed, in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye". Does it show that radical change is necessary with all?
J.T. Quite so. Then there is the matter of Peter's experience, an ecstasy, he came back to his natural state. He had an ecstasy, and had a vision of a sheet coming down from heaven knit at the four corners. Well, that is all wonderful mystery, but Peter had it, and it was that he might be prepared for further service. Things of that kind may happen to us, in order to enhance our service.
A.B. Would it be seen in Moses in that having been in the presence of God his face shone?
J.T. Just so.
Rem. What impresses me in your remarks is that definite relationships have now been established from heaven with the assembly, and hence we can be watchful for what must be a heavenly movement.
J.T. Just so, and what I am endeavouring to say really means that the appearing of the Lord is probably very imminent, and we are entitled to think
{368}
of its imminency. He is apt to come at any time, and nobody can question it, and that is just what I am endeavouring to speak of from these scriptures that we have read. He has right of way to come here even in a corporeal sense, if He wishes, and when He comes eventually for the saints, of course, He will come in a corporeal way, because the Lord Himself will appear; the Spirit will change our mortal bodies, but the dead saints will be raised, "the dead in Christ shall rise first".
J.McK. Would that be the import of the verse in John's first epistle, chapter 3: "What we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is". There would be no suggestion of delay in being like Him on the manifestation.
J.T. Just so. And then again, the transfiguration recorded in the gospels is a real matter. The Lord being transfigured, a real change came over Him. But then He came back again to His ordinary condition. So that all these things point in the same direction; that they are open to us and we ought to be ready for them, and to be different from ordinary people and even mysterious, not like ordinary people.
A.J.G. Were you suggesting that in @Acts 9 the Lord came out of heaven corporeally in order to speak to Saul. Is that what you had in mind?
J.T. Very good, and that illustrates another thing -- He came into suffering, for He says, "Why dost thou persecute me?" That is to say, the Lord does not come directly from heaven, as far as I can understand, He comes to us from other parts of the earth where He may be. He met Paul, and He said to Paul, "Why dost thou persecute me?" He was in a place of persecution, not that He was literally persecuted physically, but He was in a place of persecution, and I gather therefore, that when the
{369}
Lord comes to us according to the word in @John 14, "I am coming to you", He comes out of the place of persecution. So that He comes to us on the first day of the week, and He gives us to know that we are His friends. He establishes spiritual conditions with us, and there is no reason why any of us, if we are spiritual, may not come into these conditions to some extent. I mean to say the change that may come over us in view of the service of God, and the change from the ordinary conditions in which we are, including sex, to spiritual conditions, and then sonship conditions, for God is bringing many sons to glory. It does not say He has brought them, but He is bringing them.
P.H.H. Does that mean to say that every change except the final one when our bodies will be changed, is possible to us now, by the Spirit?
J.T. I think so, that is the idea. The Spirit is here to do all these things, if necessary, for the sake of the testimony. He is down here all the time; not openly, as it were in the air, but in the assembly, wherever the saints are. That is the idea of the dwelling. It says of the Lord, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth". The Spirit dwells among His people, among us, and that must involve spirituality.
G.W.B. Paul says in @Acts 22 that they that were with him beheld the light, but heard not the voice.
J.T. Just so. That might be added to what we have had already; it is one of the things that bears out what we have been saying.
Ques. Had Solomon typically a very wonderful sense of the greatness of God? He says, "Will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot
{370}
contain thee", @2 Chronicles 6: 18. Does that bring about in our souls a wonderful sense of the wonder of the economy into which God has come, so that He may dwell with man on the earth?
J.T. So that God is God and we are told that no one has seen Him at any time, yet, in another sense, certain ones do see Him. We have thus to compare spiritual with spiritual, especially chapter 5 of Matthew where there are nine things said about the saints and they are remarkable, including that the pure in heart shall see God. These nine things imply change.
H.H. Would you agree with Mr. Stoney (J.B.S., volume 2, page 223 and volume 8 page 52) that we are to be like Him to see Him, morally like Him now to see Him when He appears?
J.T. Well, that would be a spiritual thought, too. I would also say, referring to Mr. Stoney, although I did not know him, I believe he was a peculiarly spiritual man. It may be there is a slackness about us, that we are not like a man like that.
C.H. Whilst the Lord appeared to Saul personally, he appears to Ananias in a vision, but it was none the less real, was it? Ananias says to him, Lord. I was thinking of what you have said about the Lord moving in relation to what He was down here.
J.T. Surely, He spoke to Ananias and told him to go to a certain place, to a street called Straight, and so forth. The familiarity between the Lord and His people is remarkable.
R.W.S. Is the Lord's corporeal appearing to Paul to point to the greatness of our dispensation, because we hardly look for the Lord's corporeal appearing now, do we, but did it not happen in our dispensation?
J.T. I do not think it is happening. I have not seen anybody that has seen the Lord. The only
{371}
thing is, that there is such a thing as spirituality, excess of spirituality, and there is no telling what may be reached on those lines.
J.S.E. Does that emphasise the necessity of being "in the Spirit"?
J.T. John says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day". That was a special occasion, not indeed to imply that it did not happen before, because I am sure it did, but he mentions that there as something special. "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", and then he tells us what happened, in the first chapter of Revelation.
Ques. Have you in mind that we should habituate ourselves to the distinctiveness of the Lord's day and hold ourselves ready for what may occur?
J.T. Just so. The Lord Himself said, "Are there not twelve hours in the day?" and I think the Lord's day has twelve hours, and it ought to be given to the service of God, if possible. It ought to be given to the service of God and I think the service of God will be more precious to us than it has been, or is.
P.H.H. Is there a danger of these things going on and our not discerning them? Going back to the voice in @Acts 9, it says that Saul heard the voice and apparently he retained the voice before his mind, whereas the others heard a voice in a general way but it meant nothing to them. Does that raise the question again of our sensitiveness in these matters?
J.T. Just so. In chapter 22, Paul says "as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy, and saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me". That was evidently a corporeal appearing, though a mysterious thing. And then again we have in @Mark 16 that He appeared "in another form", after He rose. It does not say what the form was, but it was another one.
{372}
J.T.Jr. In @Luke 24 it says He disappeared from the two at Emmaus. Would that awaken in them concern as to what happened?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Does not Paul refer touchingly to his personal interview with the Lord when he says, "Have I not seen Jesus our Lord"? Was not that a word to the Corinthians?
J.T. That would be a literal transaction. I suppose these appearings must have been intended to implement the services and the work of the apostles, and others that followed after them.
P.H.H. In our day, does not the Spirit help us to prepare for such appearings and manifestations?
J.T. I do not think we sufficiently make use of the Spirit, speaking reverently; there is a lot of contention on the point. But why not make use of Him? Scriptures show that Peter, for instance, in the 10th chapter here, spoke to the Spirit. Why not use the Spirit in that sense, and commune with Him even in the quiet hours, or at any time, why not commune with the Spirit? It tends greatly to enhance our spirituality to do that.
P.H.H. It says of Simeon in @Luke 2 that he had had a communication directly from the Spirit.
J.T. Just so.
Rem. It says of Peter that as he "continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him ..." as though it may involve a certain continuance in abstraction.
J.T. Just so. What an experience; going up on the house-top and then being hungry. It may be there is something in that, that hunger may help anything of this kind, and perhaps fasting is not taken on as it should be, because the Lord says "this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting". Now why is there not any fasting? As far as I know there is hardly any; we do not hear of
{373}
it much and yet in the early days there was a great deal of it.
P.H.H. Do you take that to mean literal fasting?
J.T. I do. It tends to power. Abstraction from ordinary affairs in fasting. It tends to power.
C.B.S. Does that bring about the spiritual impressions in the soul that result in change?
J.T. Just so.
Rem. I think you once told us of an actual situation of great difficulty in which you gained power in fasting.
J.T. Yes, in regard to the conflict as to eternal life, because there was great opposition in New York at the time and we got together in prayer and fasting, quite a few of us, and we were helped by it.
Rem. So that fasting itself is not alone sufficient, it is what is being done in the time that would have been occupied with the legitimate things of life.
J.T. Yes, quite so.
E.C.M. Is your thought that fasting gives the Spirit greater scope to operate in us?
J.T. It does, I am certain. Something in the denial of mere physical things we would wish to do, and would deny ourselves of, God honours that. It says expressly, "This kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting", and that refers to lunacy.
J.P. In chapter 13 when the Spirit of God says "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" it says "they were ministering to the Lord and fasting". That seems to be somewhat habitual, and then again it says, "Then, having fasted", as though that was something specific.
J.T. That is an excellent illustration of what we are talking about.
Rem. Perhaps you would say something about the vessel that came down out of heaven like a sheet.
{374}
J.T. I think we ought to say something about that because it is remarkable too that it should happen. It took place thrice and the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven. It was held by four corners, so that evidently it was a typical thing, held up, we might say, in a mysterious way, and taken up into heaven, and apparently the thing must be there. There must be some allusion to the assembly, in the sense in which it is said to come down from God out of heaven. The assembly has to come down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God. It, therefore, refers to what we were saying, heaven's right to come down, or go up, or stay up. All this enters into the rights of God in what He is doing, in heaven.
J.T.Jr. Does the voice coming the second time suggest that there is the need of stressing the matter again?
J.T. It is to convey a permanent idea. Therefore the sheet must refer to something that is to remain permanently in heaven, and, of course, that points to what we are looking for. We are looking for the Lord Himself to come down from heaven and the assembly to go up and to stay up, because the assembly stays up. It comes down from God out of heaven, as if it was indigenous to heaven; the assembly is indigenous to heaven, it does not belong to the earth at all.
P.H.H. Would that be confirmed by the word 'descending'? It says "He beholds the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending". It is almost as if it were its own act.
J.T. Just so.
H.H. I would like to underline what you said that the assembly is indigenous to heaven.
J.T. Quite so, because it is a heavenly vessel. That is what is meant in the sheet, it is a vessel really. The vessel comes down three times and goes
{375}
up and stays there. That is to say heaven has a right to do those things.
R.W.S. So the expanse, and whatever power the enemy might have in it, is cancelled out, is it not, with heaven coming in in this way?
J.T. Quite. That is another word that ought to be kept in mind, because God called the expanse "Heavens", but it was an expanse. That is to say, it alludes to the sphere of divine operations and that there is plenty of room for them. That room is extended to earth, too, in our service, plenty of room.
Ques. Does the scripture in Ephesians "raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" link on with what you are saying?
J.T. Very good. He "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together". That is remarkable, we are not standing, as Stephen saw the Son of man standing, but we are made to sit down together, which is remarkable and points to privilege and distinction given to us.
P.H.H. What do you think Peter's difficulty was? He is told to rise, slay and eat, and apparently three times he had a difficulty about it. Does it point to the fact that we may have abstract truth in our minds, and yet not clothe the brethren with it?
J.T. Quite so. I think he was suffering from legality, Jewish legality. It is a common thing among Christians. Many questions arise as to things that ought to be done and yet the brethren have a real difficulty, and things are hindered by legal difficulties.
Rem. The fact that Peter had this ecstasy and saw this vision was a proof that heaven was unwilling for him to be out of what was coming in in Paul. Do you think we are conscious of the Lord's insistence with us, and His bringing us into what He
{376}
is doing? Peter would be likely to connect the thoughts of the assembly with what belonged to the remnant of Israel, whereas what was coming in with Paul was foreshadowed in this vision, and it showed heaven's insistence in bringing Peter into it.
J.T. Quite so. We can see in this first chapter here that that sort of thing could easily become common amongst the early Christians. It says in verse 6, "They therefore, being come together, asked him saying Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?" -- you see how they are pre-occupied with that -- "And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses", and so forth. So that He indicates clearly how they are to be saved from mere legality, Jewish legality, because the Father has sovereign rights in all these matters.
J.C.T. It was rather unlikely material, was it not? "Quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth". Would that test us?
J.T. Just so. The truth is that it refers to gentiles and how the Jews regarded gentiles. That is what is meant by these quadrupeds.
Rem. In @Revelation 21 in connection with the millennium, the city is said to come down out of heaven, and then in verse 2, in connection with the eternal state, is it presented as a characteristic idea? God has in heaven what will serve His purpose, either to be up there or to come down.
J.T. Quite so, very good.
{377}
THE SERVICE OF SONG
@Colossians 3: 16, 17; @Ephesians 5: 19, 20
J.T. It has come out distinctly that the light which, we might say, the Holy Spirit has given to us of Himself has led to much thought as to divine Persons and our ability to distinguish between them, and to discern which of them is specifically speaking at any time, or whether we say they all speak, which is also true. I believe it is important not only that we should discern what divine Persons are saying -- that is, the expression of the divine mind -- but we should be able to discern who says a thing, whether it is the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit. I believe it has been much in the minds of many as to who it is who speaks when there is a divine oracular statement made, whether it is in the Scriptures or at any time in ministry. The Spirit, as here sent down from heaven, is the power for all ministry, of which there is a good deal at the present time. So I believe we should all be concerned whether we can discern in ministry who it is that speaks, whether the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. I believe it is quite possible to discern and understand who speaks at any time, whether it is a record as in written ministry, or actual ministry such as at the so-called three-day meetings, which afford time for the development of a subject, or subjects. As regards divine Persons themselves and the way the Scriptures are written, much is being said and thought of as to the poetic part of Scripture, and there is much more that is poetic than is generally understood. The understanding of that is to have some influence with us because it is a question of right spiritual feelings, and these very often turn the whole matter in a meeting.
Scripture affords much material for that, beginning with the books of Moses and then passing on
{378}
to the Psalms. There are the same number of the books of Moses as there are of the Psalms -- five in each case. Moses had to do with the Pentateuch and David had to do with the Psalms, and David is said to be the sweet psalmist of Israel. There is good reason to bring up this whole matter now in view of the liberty that has been shown in recent times and in view of the end of the dispensation, so that we might go up on the proper note when the Lord comes, and that there should be readiness for it.
Rem. You would look for some expression in our hymns that would answer to the Spirit and the bride saying "Come".
J.T. Just so. The idea of which divine Person is speaking is to be kept in mind. How often it is mentioned in Scripture as to which Person speaks; as, for instance, in the word, "As says the Holy Spirit", @Hebrews 3: 7.
Ques. Does Scripture indicate that the Spirit is the principal Speaker at the present time?
J.T. I think so, but He is at all times. "Every scripture is divinely inspired", which would refer to the Spirit, "and profitable for teaching". Then there is the question of the poetic features, which might be particularly used in song; because we have the idea of song, as it says, "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding", @1 Corinthians 14: 15. The understanding is, perhaps, where we have been defective; because much fault has entered into hymns generally, and one of the things in mind in a revision would be to make corrections wherever this might be needed.
Rem. It would, of course, be in mind to correct any defects brought to our notice.
J.T. Then too we would have new hymns which would be suitable for the present time.
{379}
A.W.R. Is it of interest to note that where we have a reference to departure from the truth, it says, "But the Spirit speaks expressly", @1 Timothy 4: 1?
J.T. Just so. I wish to bring out the thought as to discerning the divine Person who speaks, and when we have a series of meetings -- what we call three-day meetings -- whether the ministry stands the test of Scripture.
W.M.B. I would like to ask what bearing the speaking of divine Persons to us has on our response to them, especially in song.
J.T. I should think chiefly to convey intelligence. The word is, "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding". So that an editor of a magazine (as you are) would be much concerned as to the accuracy of everything he receives for publication.
W.M.B. I was thinking rather of the purpose of this meeting, as to how it would bear upon the Person to whom the song is addressed.
J.T. We have no hymns to the Holy Spirit directly, so far as I know. They have them in the systems around us, but we have none, and it seems that the Lord now is raising the matter. The Spirit is God Himself, and God as the Supreme One ought to be spoken to. But the first thing to see is that when we have a series of meetings for ministry there should be some exercise amongst us as to the accuracy of the ministry, that we do not allow it to pass if it is not correct. How do you look on things yourself in your own service?
W.M.B. I seek to follow that up in dependence on the Lord and the Spirit.
C.H. Whilst the ministry must be correct (the reference to the "understanding" bearing upon that) would the word, "I will sing with the spirit" involve the feelings of joy that may be in the heart? The
{380}
understanding is a question of another faculty that balances the man.
A.H. In view of the truth we are now enjoying of the Spirit Himself speaking, do you think we should be concerned to make response to Him personally?
J.T. That is right. There are no hymns addressed directly to the Spirit in our present book, and I think that the main defect lies there.
H.F.N. Would the word in Ephesians come in here, after it says, "But be filled with the Spirit", it goes on to say, "speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs" @Ephesians 5: 18, 19?
J.T. That is directly a reference to it. It says, "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs". The Psalms would refer to experience and therefore the book of Psalms is largely used in the epistle to the Hebrews, especially in the first chapter. The book of the Psalms is almost entirely used in that chapter, showing how experience must enter into response to the ministry.
H.F.N. In Colossians, too, the psalms, hymns and spiritual songs are the outcome of the word of the Christ dwelling in you richly.
J.T. Quite so. These are very good remarks. We should note where these things are mentioned in the Scriptures themselves.
Ques. Are the divine Persons distinguished for us in that scripture in @Ephesians 5? It says, "But be filled with the Spirit"; then "chanting with your heart to the Lord", and then "giving thanks at all times for all things to him who is God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ". We get all three Persons mentioned and it is in connection with singing.
J.T. In the service of song on the first day of the week, the question would be whether we have got material to answer, in the service, to the ministry
{381}
we have had during the previous week. Can we put our thoughts and exercises into song in the service that may appear on the first day of the week? So in @1 Corinthians 14 it says, "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding". I would say that the understanding is the main thought there. It is important because there is so much error in singing, and the danger comes in when ideas are being put together in poetry.
A.J.G. The Lord said as to the Comforter, "He shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak"; so that, from one point of view, it is the Spirit's voice but from another point of view it is the Father or the Lord. How would that enter into what we are saying?
J.T. You understand that that is all that the Spirit says?
A.J.G. I had assumed that the Spirit was here in that relatively subordinate capacity and therefore did not speak from Himself.
J.T. Now we have to compare spiritual things with spiritual, and the Lord speaks of Himself in a similar way in @John 12 where He says: "For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak". Now both these passages -- one referring to the Spirit and the other to the Lord Jesus -- have the same force, that is, they do not speak from themselves. It refers back to the Father and we have to understand that and look into the matter and understand what it means.
A.J.G. That is why l was raising the matter.
J.S.E. Have we to come to this point of distinction? There is what each of the Persons of the Godhead may say to us, but we have to be able to distinguish which One of them is speaking. Have
{382}
we not been taught that each of the Persons of the Godhead is now to be known and appreciated by us as an Object in Himself to be addressed, and can we limit the thought of singing to two of those Persons and leave the other out? May I ask further as to a remark in one of the three-day meetings in America as to the word, "The Lord is near", and you inferred that it might represent the nearness of the Spirit to us in lordship.
J.T. I would rather say that the Lord there is the Lord Jesus. The Spirit is not said to be made Lord, but Christ is said to be made Lord. The Father, of course, is Lord but is not said to be made Lord, because He would have to do it Himself. I only refer to that for accuracy and when it says in @Philippians 4, "The Lord is near", I think it is the Lord Jesus.
P.L. Referring to the Pentateuch, have we a distinctive song to God in the song of Moses in @Exodus 15; then a distinctive song to the Lord in @Numbers 10, "Rise up, Lord", and then a distinctive song to the Spirit in @Numbers 21?
J.T. Quite so. And another thing that might be added is that divine Persons Themselves are prior to anything that we have in the Scriptures. The economy in which they are now known is in time. It is a matter of *time*, but the actual condition of divine Persons is inscrutable and involves that They are all equal. We cannot just say that in revelation divine Persons are now on the same level, for They are not; They *were* at one time, as far as we can see, but in the economy which has come in in time the Father comes first, and the Son comes second, and the Spirit comes third. That is clearly the order, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The brethren might well take account of that in view of the thought in mind of improving our hymn book. There should be understanding in what we say in the morning
{383}
meeting (so-called). We are to understand what we are singing and why we are singing it.
E.L.M. I would like to ask whether you would be happy in the thought that in the blessing which follows on the truth of the nazarite, in @Numbers 6, the three Persons each appear under the title Jehovah. It says, "Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee; Jehovah make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace", @Numbers 6: 24 - 26.
J.T. That refers to Jehovah only. There was no other name given then to divine Persons.
E.L.M. I was thinking that the Jesus of the New Testament is the Jehovah of the Old, and wondered whether we could extend the thought that that title attaches to the Spirit equally, and that it attaches to all divine Persons?
J.T. I do not think you would be supported in saying that. The Old Testament had only Jehovah in mind and that name is given there expressly. The Spirit, of course, was spoken of as well; God by His Spirit garnished the heavens; but I think, as a matter of fact, the name Jehovah is only given incidentally in the New Testament. In the Old Testament the name Jehovah is given as the specific name of the divine Person then speaking.
E.L.M. I was thinking of @Luke 2; the word 'Lord' there, according to the footnote, is Jehovah.
J.T. The footnote is not exactly Scripture. I do not think it is intended in the New Testament to bring forward the names employed in the Old.
Rem. In the economy each divine Person has His own distinctive name.
J.T. That is what I thought. The names, Father, Son and Spirit, did not exist in Old Testament times, therefore it is a matter of the economy, and we have to go by what is given to us in the New Testament.
{384}
Rem. When we come to the New Testament we have the fulness of Christianity involving the names by which God is now known.
Rem. As to the matter of understanding in singing, I believe the brethren generally would like help as to the Spirit being in an objective position. We have generally thought of the Father and the Son as presented objectively to be worshipped but we hardly brought the Spirit into that. I think that is where help would be appreciated.
J.T. I think so too; and help will come, I believe, in the conversation we are engaged in now.
Ques. Do we begin with the thought that the Spirit is God and an Object of worship?
J.T. Exactly. The spirit of a man is the man himself, and that is the thought in the Spirit of God.
Rem. Deity is as full in the Spirit as in the Father or the Son or in the three Persons.
J.T. Quite so.
W.C. Is it largely a matter of understanding in the hearts and souls of the brethren, based upon the truth of the equality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son, that these desires to praise and worship the Holy Spirit are springing up amongst us without any definite scripture indicating that we should do so?
J.T. Well, there are definite scriptures, I think; for instance, @Numbers 21.
W.C. I was thinking of the New Testament.
J.T. In the New Testament we have persons who address the Spirit. Peter did, according to @Acts 10. The context would show that the actual Speaker there is the Spirit, and then that Peter spoke to Him. That is a direct statement in the Scriptures of address being to the Spirit.
W.C. I was thinking more definitely of actual praise and worship. You would extend it to that, praise and worship being due to the Spirit?
{385}
J.T. I certainly would.
P.L. Divine honours cannot be rightly ascribed to any One of the Persons of the Godhead short of praise.
J.T. So our hymn No. 126 does that. That hymn was accepted by J.N.D.
No. 126 in the 1932 Hymn Book (composed by J. Montgomery):
<blockquote>Praise we to the Father give, <br>God in whom we move and live; <br>Children's praise He loves to hear, <br>Children's songs delight His ear.
Praise we to the Firstborn bring, <br>Christ the Prophet, Priest, and King; <br>Glad we raise our sweetest strain <br>To the Lamb that once was slain.
Praises for the Holy Ghost <br>Sent from heav'n at Pentecost; <br>Tis through Him that now we live, And the precious truth receive.
Blest our portion, thus to be  <br>Glorying in the Trinity; <br>For the gospel from above, <br>For the word that "God is love". </blockquote>
Rem. It was written by one of the Moravian brethren.
J.T. It was included in the 1856 Hymn Book, was it not?
Rem. Just so, in its present form.
F.V.W. In the 1932 revision the word in Colossians, "singing with grace in your hearts to God" was thought to refer to the Father. Are you suggesting that may allude to the Spirit as well?
J.T. "God" would include all -- the three Persons, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is specific there, and "God" is a word covering the three Persons -- the Deity, as we call It.
Ques. Would there be justification in that verse for singing to the Spirit?
J.T. Only in the sense that He is God.
W.B.H. Does the end of @Ephesians 3 run in line with that? It says, "But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think, according to the power which works in us, to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". Is the word "Him" there in the last verse -- "to him be glory" -- inclusive of all the divine Persons?
J.T. "To him" -- that is God. It is God as ordinarily used in Scripture, as in @Genesis 1, "in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth". It is God Himself as supreme. In the New Testament we have the truth as to the three Persons, and in @Ephesians 3: 21 it is God Himself -- the three Persons.
{386}
W.B.H. I wondered if the word "him" in that sense would not be a basis upon which to render to the Spirit also what is due to Him?
J.T. I do not think we should go outside the ordinary usage of Scripture. If Scripture says "God" it is generally the three Persons, but we must keep all Scripture in mind and there is the word in @1 Corinthians 8 "to us there is one God, the Father", which has to be understood. But when it says "God" it is normally the three Persons. In @1 Corinthians 8 the Spirit is left out, but the Father is specifically mentioned. If God is mentioned it is the three Persons, and in @Matthew 28 the one name covers the three Persons.
A.J.G. Whilst we need certain hymns addressed specifically to the Spirit, should we have also a few more hymns addressed to God?
J.T. Quite so; though what we want now is hymns addressed to the Spirit, as such.
W.S.S. In one of Mr. Raven's letters, as brethren will generally know, he writes on the assumption that the Spirit is not viewed objectively and says if He were viewed objectively then He must be worshipped. I thought it was a helpful remark in view of what we understand of the truth now.
J.T. I do not see why the early brethren did not take on the thought of the Spirit of God as we have now. It was evidently not brought out at that time. I have no doubt, however, at all that if Mr. Raven had what we have now he would fully agree with it, and Mr. Darby as well. I fully believe that.
Rem. Peter in the Acts knew who was speaking to him, and answered that Person and no one else.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Practically all the references to the Spirit in the hymn book are incidental; is that sufficient?
{387}
J.T. It is *not* sufficient. Scripture warrants hymns addressed directly to the Spirit, hence the present occasion.
Rem. It would seem there is a real need for some adjustment in the book.
J.T. Quite so.
F.E.S. With reference to the thought of God covering all three divine Persons, should all three or more than one be addressed in one particular hymn?
J.T. I think so. In hymn No. 126 the three divine Persons are mentioned. There has been a change made in that hymn for it originally read, 'Glory *to* the Holy Ghost'.
F.E.S. In some of our hymns when there is a change over from addressing the Lord to addressing the Father we find the use of them tends to bring in a little confusion.
J.T. I do not know. There is much confusion but I am not sure if there is any confusion on that point.
F.E.S. Sometimes hymn No. 209 is given out and it may not be opportune to use the whole hymn.
No. 209 in the 1932 Hymn Book:
<blockquote>O Lord, it is Thyself; none, none but Thee <br>Could so call forth response from every heart; <br>The love that stood the test of Calv'ry's tree<br>Doth to our longing souls fresh joy impart.
Thou speakest, Lord, of Him Thou hast revealed, <br>Thy Father, whom Thou lov'st -- His glory, Thine. <br>Thou, His eternal joy, Thyself didst yield <br>To bring to pass His thoughts of love divine.
Thy heart, our God, made known -- all, all is told! <br>The glory of Thy love, all time before, <br>He to our raptured hearts doth now unfold, <br>And moves our souls to worship and adore.
O circle of affections all divine, <br>The foretaste of eternity's bright scene, <br>Where all the glories of His love shall shine<br>In everlasting joy and peace serene! </blockquote>
J.T. Hymns need to be carefully given out and at times certain verses only can be given out so as to avoid confusion.
C.H. In regard to the matter of understanding, I wondered whether we have not only to bear in mind that the Spirit is a divine Person, but also the particular place He has taken in the economy, and would not that enter into the intelligence of the brethren in using the hymns? There is the place the Spirit has in the economy and in the service of God, and His service can be referred to, not exactly in an incidental way, but in an accessory way. Would that govern the use of hymns addressed to the Spirit? We would be governed by the part the Spirit has in the service where He draws attention to the other divine Persons.
{388}
E.C.M. Would what has been said make us more selective in giving out hymns or verses of hymns?
J.T. Quite so, and that is constantly done. Certain verses are given out which are applicable to a certain time of the meeting.
Eu.R. It has been looked upon as retrogressive, after we have passed to the Father, in the service, to go back to the Lord. What about the Spirit? Would it be any retrogression to speak to the Spirit after having spoken to the Lord Jesus?
J.T. The same thing should apply as applies to the Lord Jesus, because the Spirit takes the third place in the economy; the Son takes second place. The Father has the last part of the service and at that point the Son is not addressed and the Spirit would not be, because He takes the third place in the economy. The Spirit would take the same kind of place in the service as the Lord does, whereas the Father is supreme.
Eu.R. Would the Spirit come in particularly in the Supper in the character of the nameless servant who brings the bride to Isaac?
J.T. Quite so. It is quite right to use the types as seen in that incident.
W.M.B. I would like to raise a question with a view to getting help. We are all happy and clear as to the worship of the Spirit as a divine Person. Would the place He has taken in the economy and the absence of any direct doxology to Him in the New Testament restrain us in any way in our approach to Him?
J.T. If you have one scripture to support a thought, that is enough, for the Scripture cannot be broken. The authority of Scripture is involved and therefore if we have one scripture to support any thought or principle it is quite right to use it.
A.J.G. Would what safeguards the position be the fact that the service of God can only be rightly
{389}
carried on in the liberty and intelligence that the Spirit affords and if we are subject He will not lead us to do anything out of place?
J.T. The Spirit of God is God and He permeates everything that refers to the service of God.
A.H. May I enquire about the expression in @Ephesians 3: "Strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man"? How would that come into the service? Would it be in order to address that blessed Person at the particular juncture of the meeting when we are before the Father?
J.T. He would come in in relation to whatever is referred to.
A.H. I would like to be clear that it would not be retrogression to refer to the Spirit as the service proceeds. Mr. Roberts referred to the thought of retrogression, but if I am addressing the Father, and the Spirit gives me to feel that He is strengthening me inwardly for that response, I could suitably speak to Him at that juncture?
J.T. We must remember another thing. We sometimes have the Spirit referred to as *the* Spirit and not as the Spirit of God or the Spirit of the Father, or the Spirit of Christ, but just as the Spirit. In that way He is viewed as a divine Person and takes third place in the economy -- not second place or first place -- and we must recognise that.
A.H. I fully recognise that but I was concerned as to the service. It is an exercise in the minds of many if we have addressed the Father on Lord's day morning whether it is in order to turn aside and thank the Holy Spirit for His inward support.
J.T. I would say it would be as the Spirit of the Father or as the Spirit of adoption in the last part of the service.
Eu.R. You think we might speak to Him as the Spirit of adoption at that time?
J.T. Yes.
{390}
Rem. It would be with a view to augmenting the service.
J.T. Just so.
Ques. In connection with the composing of hymns to the Spirit, would it be in keeping, or out of keeping, to employ names that are typical, or would the more holy language be to address Him in a personal way?
J.T. Typical teaching is quite right, if we understand it. The word says: "The Lord will give thee understanding in all things". Anything that the Lord gives us in the way of understanding would be proper to use at the given time.
Ques. You would be free about a hymn addressed wholly to the Spirit?
J.T. Yes; that is what we are hoping to have. We have not one now.
Ques. Assuming that we had one, at what moment of the service would it be in order to give it out?
J.T. I would say in the first part of the service.
H.F.N. If a hymn has been addressed to the Lord, would there be liberty to address the Spirit after that?
J.T. Certainly, but in the latter part of the meeting it would be as the Spirit of adoption or the Spirit of sonship, I would say. It says the Father is bringing many sons to glory.
Ques. Is it in your mind that a hymn such as Mr. Nunnerley has in mind should be on that line?
J.T. Quite so; even if it is in type.
A.P.B. Speaking again of the Spirit, just as the Spirit and not as the Spirit of adoption or the Spirit of Christ, would that have any particular place in the service?
J.T. It would be in keeping with His place in the economy -- He has third place in the economy and it would be in keeping with that.
{391}
A.P.B. It would then have to come in early in the meeting?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. How early would you say?
J.T. As a divine Person, there is liberty to address the Spirit at any time, but we must bear in mind that when the title "the Spirit" is used, it has in mind His place in the economy and that is a third place. We should not therefore address Him thus once we have moved to the Father.
Rem. You mean if we have begun to address the Father He would be in our minds as the Spirit of adoption but prior to that it would be suitable to have a worshipful hymn to the Spirit.
J.T. Certainly.
Ques. Could we do it immediately after the Supper?
J.T. I would say before or after the Supper but before we deal with the Father. The Father has the main place in the economy. It is a question of what divine Persons have decided to have and the incarnation is the turning point in everything.
Ques. Would hymns to the Spirit be proper for the opening of a meeting?
J.T. Quite so; for this meeting or at any time.
P.L. In ministry we would call upon the Comforter's help, and the title "Spirit of truth" would serve there.
W.H. Would the setting of the Spirit as in @2 Corinthians 3 come in immediately after the Supper?
J.T. Quite so; but there is one thing that bears upon that, and that is that the only One said to be made Lord is Christ.
A.M. Has the Spirit a special place in the matter of change, such as the change in the service from the Lord to the Father?
{392}
J.T. He comes in happily there.
Rem. In @Ephesians 2 we have: "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". The Spirit comes in there in connection with access to the Father.
Ques. In a hymn addressed to the Father might there be verses addressed to the Spirit as the Spirit of adoption?
J.T. That would be quite in order. No. 209 usually has to be divided and that illustrates what you say.
Ques. It would not be oscillation when addressing a hymn to the Father to use verses addressed to the Spirit as the Spirit of adoption?
J.T. It would be quite all right.
A.J.G. You have often pointed out that the Supper is the *Lord's* supper; it is not the Spirit's Supper nor the Father's. Do I understand you to say that it would be in order to commence the meeting with a hymn to the Spirit?
J.T. It would be quite suitable, if we are led that way. He is God. God is thinking of us and has us in mind, and He is valuing what our thoughts are at any time.
J.S.E. Would it all depend on our measure of spirituality at the time?
J.T. Quite so.
J.S.E. If the volume of hymns can be enriched, would it not provide more scope for the spiritual to draw upon?
J.T. That is what we are aiming at. We are here to that end, to improve the service of song.
C.H. Both in the composition of new hymns and in their use, the spirit and the understanding of the believer is intended to have a part, so that things will be maintained in true balance.
J.T. Sisters, of course, cannot take part audibly, and that has to be recognised and is taken care of
{393}
by other means. Nevertheless, the service of God requires that sisters are sons. We have to think of them as sons because they are such, and you have to come back to this, that ultimately the feminine idea is seen in the assembly.
Eu.R. As to hymn No. 126, could we have further hymns of that kind; one verse to the Father, another to the Son and another to the Holy Spirit? Would it be suitable towards the close of the occasion as recognising the deity of those Persons for such a hymn to be sung?
J.T. That hymn has often been sung.
Eu.R. We can then carry the three Persons in our minds in the one hymn?
J.T. We cannot make divine Persons too far away from us. They are thinking of us and the word comes in, "Of him are ye m Christ Jesus". We belong to the divine circle, and divine Persons are thinking of us accordingly and what we do is in their minds of importance.
{394}
THE CREATOR OF THE WORLDS
@Hebrews 1: 1, 2; @Acts 1: 1 - 9
The brethren, doubtless, will be aware that Paul is the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, which affords much as to the Person of Christ, the deity of Christ. The epistle treats much of the Psalms, and it has been pointed out too that the Psalms correspond in measure with the Pentateuch; that is to say, with the books of Moses. It might be easily pointed out that the deity of Christ, in a figurative way, in a forerunning way, is much treated of in the book of Psalms, and the hearts of the saints of old were cherished by the thought of the Messiah, their Messiah, being so beautifully spoken of therein; undoubtedly the saints of God, from of old, were all touched by their Messiah being thus spoken of. And many a saint in our own dispensation has found real joy in the food afforded in the book of Psalms for the nourishment of the believer's heart, as it is even today. Many today in this very hall have been affected, turning away from the world and its attractiveness, its glories, turning away from all that, to be with the Lord's people, as we are here today, as those whom they love.
The book of Hebrews therefore becomes a wide field for the enjoyment of the brethren, the enjoyment of their affections for Christ. How they admire Him, the glories of Christ, the death of Christ too, and the glory that should follow, as it is said. The book therefore is to be looked into even more than ever, recalling the great servant Paul as to his admiration for Christ. However much he presented the truth to the gentiles, he also presented it to the Hebrews, the Hebrew Christians of his day; but in our day we are not concerned so much about the Hebrews as we are about the saints of this dispensation, those who form the assembly, for the assembly
{395}
is the great theme of the Scriptures. I ventured to read from the first chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, to call attention to the expression 'worlds'. "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets" -- the allusion being to the Old Testament, "at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds"; that is the word I want to come to, to link it on with the book of Acts, showing how in that book the Spirit of God enlarges on the up-going of Christ, not the down-coming but His up-going.
It is recorded twice in the passage I read, that He was received up, or taken up, and, of course, it ought to appeal to our hearts, that ours is a going-up time. The going up belongs to us also, so that we are not concerned with the glory of this world or what it affords to the natural mind. We are referring to *that* world, "that world, and the resurrection". The Lord Himself spoke of those who are counted worthy to have part in *that* world, and the resurrection; but, as I said, I wanted to come to the word 'worlds' in this first chapter of Hebrews. As lovers of God, the brethren love to think of His word, the word of God. It is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and is a divider asunder of soul and spirit, and joints and marrow, and of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. Who is the Christian that is not exercised on these lines? and so it is, that I would say a word as to this word 'worlds'.
We are not much conversant with the idea of the worlds -- using the word in the plural, and that the worlds were made, or framed, by the word of God. "The worlds were framed by the word of God" (@Hebrews 11: 3); but here in chapter 1 it is said that the worlds are made by the Son, by the Lord Jesus.
{396}
They are made by the Lord Jesus, and the question is, how many worlds there are. It is a question really involving the Deity, the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, but particularly the deity of Christ; and the question is, how many of us know anything about this great subject of the 'worlds'. We know something of the present one, the one we are in. It can be measured geographically; the school-children often know something about it geographically, the solar system and all that, but the solar system does not include all the worlds. We are to be directed to the greatness of Christ; He is the Maker of all the worlds, as it says here, "by whom also he made the worlds". *He made*; that is, He is God. The "He" is God; therefore the making of the worlds is a creatorial, or rather, I should say, a mediatorial term. It is creatorial, of course, but I was rather thinking of the idea of mediatorship, of the Mediator. God has effected redemption through Christ, and many other things, but Christ is Mediator of creation. The idea of mediatorship was brought out largely in Moses, and so the study of Moses becomes of immense importance as to all these matters. But now I am speaking of the worlds. Moses did not speak of that; he did not speak of the mediatorship of the worlds; he spoke of the mediatorship of Moses, and we are told that the law was ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.
Moses did not speak of the worlds; it belongs to the many subjects treated by Paul in Hebrews. Many others are treated of in the first chapter; I have already alluded to how the Psalms are quoted in the first chapter, finishing up in the last verse of it with a reference to angels, it says, "Are they not all ministering spirits". They were made before men, but they are ministering spirits, they are subject to us; that is, to Christians, those who
{397}
are *heirs* of salvation. We are heirs of salvation, with the dignity and glory of that position, dear brethren. We can enlarge on this matter, that there are those who are heirs of salvation and angels are ministering to them. Angels are ministering to us, angels are creatures, they are not divine Persons. There are only three divine Persons, as far as Scripture shows; that is, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We read of other creatures, such as cherubim and seraphim, but these are not strictly creatures, they are just symbolical representatives of certain things. I do not know what I can say about them, or whether anybody here can say anything about their description, about seraphim. Seraphim are simply creatures of God, or rather, though symbolical, are spoken of thus in the Scriptures. The only divine Persons are the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and we need to be clear ourselves, to disabuse ourselves of any other thought as that there are any others outside of the Three -- the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Three exist, and They are all to be understood, and enjoyed and worshipped; every one of Them worshipped, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, all are to be worshipped. We cannot assume to minimise any one of the divine Persons, strictly; They are all equal, as one might say. In the abstract, They are all equal; the Father and the Son and the Spirit are equal. What They were before, in the equality of Their own proper relations, we cannot say; nobody can say. We can worship, and we do, thank God. We have learnt to worship. I hope every one here has learnt to worship. It is a time of learning, learning who the Father is, and learning who the Son is, and learning who the Spirit is; and then remember too that the Spirit has not died for us, nor has the Father died for us; the Son has died for us, and only the Son has died for us, and we
{398}
worship Him, we revere Him, and it is well that we should, that He should become everything to us. There is only one Person in the whole universe who died for us, and that is Christ. He is the great Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.
Well now, I am coming back to my subject, and that is the word 'worlds' -- whether we know anything about the worlds; that is to say, about *them*. We know something about the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and they are worlds, of course, in a certain sense, but they are not everything. There are worlds that we have never seen, or heard of in the ordinary way; we have heard of them, of course, because the scripture speaks of them, here in this very chapter, the Son made the worlds, for they were made mediatorially. In @John 1 it is said that "All things received being through him". That is the Son, the Lord Jesus, a divine Person. He is the Maker of everything. He is a divine Person. Not one thing, it says, received being without Him; and so now the question to be worked out a little is, What about these worlds? Are they anything to us? Are they anything to wonder at in our minds; anything to bring in reverence, seeing that God has made them, that Christ has made them? Think of the vastness of the idea! Of course, even the earth itself is a small thing relatively. The sun is small, larger than the earth, but still small; and the stars appear small, of course, but then they are all made by the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jesus made everything, not one thing was made without Him. We are not even told that angels had anything to do with it. Not one thing was made without Him -- incomparable, the magnitude of it! and yet it belongs to Christians. It is one of the things that belong to us, that we should revel in, that we have part in all this vast universe.
{399}
Now, in the passage I refer to here, in the second verse, this word 'worlds' is said to be a Jewish expression, though that is not in the scripture. In Scripture it is called 'worlds', it is a plural word. Possibly the word *cosmos* is involved, but that usually refers to the earth, things that are made that we know of; but it is not 'the universe' here, it is the word 'worlds' that is here; we do not know how many, and that is what I am saying, that there are so many, the things that we have to deal with are so immense, that they cause reverence and respect, and, we might say, joy as we think of what we are brought into, that the world in itself, that is, the earth, disappears, you might say, in its nothingness. I repeat, that we do not know, dear brethren, how many worlds there are, but we do know the Creator, we do know the Maker of them, and we worship Him. We love Him and we worship Him, and that is the great point at the moment. I would think that all ministry must reduce itself to that. All ministry must reduce itself to that, to what is in the Father, and what is in the Son, and what is in the Spirit; but, to come now to the point, God made the worlds, by the Son; that is to say, the Lord Jesus has made them, but He has made them mediatorially, in that sense. He wrought redemption too, mediatorially, but there are things beyond that, that we cannot fathom or reach in our minds, but we do well to ponder them and be worshipful, to think of their existence, and that we have part in them.
I hope the brethren will be patient with me, in trying to say what I am saying, because I think everybody will realise something of the magnitude of it, and however big the systems of the worlds are by themselves, they are God's creation and they cause worship in our hearts; and that is the whole point, dear brethren, what causes worship, for we
{400}
are to worship God. As the angel said to John, "Worship God". Whatever we may speak about, the first day of the week, and the Lord's supper, the result, the outcome, the thought in all is that we are to worship God. John bowed down to the angel, but he said, "Worship God"; and that is the word that I would say to every young person here today, 'Accustom yourself to the worship of God'. "Worship thou Him", it says elsewhere. And so I go back again to my text, and that is, "By whom also he made the worlds". I do not go beyond that, although there is much that could be said, that some of us have often spoken of, and that is about the Lord Jesus, "who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made by himself the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high, taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they". So now I pass on to the book of Acts, having spoken about the worlds. It is just, as I said before, that the brethren may begin to think of these things, and to think of the vastness that we are brought into; that we are to be worshipful because of it, that we have part in it.
So now I want to say a word about the first chapter of the Acts. The dear brethren will be aware that all one is endeavouring to do is *to help*, especially the young people who are here, and who perhaps have not much taken account of these great and glorious things. The book of Acts is the work of the Spirit of God, of course, we might in a way say, the acts of the Spirit of God. In a sense, the book comprises the works of the Spirit of God; and the thought now is just to call attention to what is going up, what going up means, because it implies what we have in the service of God the worship of
{401}
God, so that in @Ephesians 4 we have: "Wherefore he says, Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men. But that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things". And then again Paul's own remarks in the epistle to the Corinthians, that he said "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago ... such a one caught up to the third heaven. And I know such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows;) that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter".
Well now, that helps me to say a further word as to the passage in the Acts that we have read; that is to say, the service of God is in mind, and the epistle to the Ephesians exemplifies what it implies, that we have to with such a realm, a non-created realm, and perhaps someone would say it is impossible to know what that means, but it is a fact, it is a non-created realm, for the Lord Jesus has ascended up beyond all the heavens, it says, gone beyond *all* the heavens, and where are they? We must stop and think of these things, and become worshipful about it. Where are they? Where are these heavens, all the heavens? How many are there? We must inquire about these things. And so, as I said, in this verse, "having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up". He was taken up; that is, the Lord was taken up, and so when we take part in the service of God on the first day of the week, what do we understand about being taken up? What do we understand about the third heavens, "above all the heavens"? I am just endeavouring to say a word to the brethren to stir up our affections as to the magnificence of all
{402}
these things, and to be enjoying them constantly, that we ourselves have part in them.
Here, as I said, we have the word, "having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up". And then again we are told in Luke that He lifted up His hands and blessed them, and He was carried up into heaven. Well, who carried Him up? Where did He go? Where is He now? We might say, bringing the thoughts down to such as Moses, or Elijah. Where are they now? Are we inquiring about them? We belong to this wonderful system of things, even the creature system. There is the heavenly system of creatures, like the heavens, and we belong to it, we have part in it. We shall not ever enter into what belongs to divine Persons; at the same time, we are not far away from Them. They are not far from any one of us, it says; and so we read in John of the nearness of God, and yet the inscrutability of God, that no one has seen God at any time. No one has seen Him at any time. We may as well accept that, because it is a fact. And yet we read in Matthew, that certain ones see God (@Matthew 5: 8), but we have to understand. Philip said to the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" and that is a good question for everybody, as we read the Scriptures. "Understandest thou what thou readest?" And be in the things, that you see properly belong to you.
Now I am just going to say a word about the last verse of this paragraph, verses 1 - 9. It says, "And having said these things he was taken up", the same expression as in verse 2. In @Luke 24 we read that as He blessed the saints He was carried up. But where has He gone? How do we reckon where He has gone, because we only see what we call the sidereal heavens; we do not see everything. Many things are not visible; the visible and the
{403}
invisible are spoken of. And so here, "they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of their sight". He is taken out of their sight. We say, He is invisible. Well, He is taken out of their sight. That is the point. It does not say that even Moses, or Elijah, was taken out of their sight. We know they must be somewhere. In fact, it says in Matthew that many bodies of the saints that slept arose, and entered into the holy city and appeared unto many. That is all you can say. That is all I can say, but it is wonderful that we can even say those things, and be affected by them.
So it is that I now close with this thought, in the last verse here, "And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding him" -- they beholding Him -- "and a cloud received him out of their sight". They beheld Him for a short time, but He was received out of their sight. So that it is an invisible state of things, dear brethren, and yet we have part in it; though we are but creatures, we have part in it. We are going to be taken up to heaven, as the Lord was, but only to a point, not as fie was taken up. That is, He has gone beyond all the heavens, but we are to be taken up, and are going into heaven. That is what we are enjoying the thought of, that we are going into heaven, that heaven is our place, and the assembly knows that heaven is *its* place. In the book of Revelation the assembly of God is seen coming down out of heaven, having the glory of God. So I leave that with all the dear brethren, and the Lord may give a further word.
