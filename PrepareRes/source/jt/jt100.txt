LIVING WITH CHRIST
@Revelation 20: 4; @2 Timothy 2: 11, 12
J.T. The thought is to consider living with Christ. It says, "They lived and reigned with the Christ", living and reigning. In the passage in 2 Timothy we have how the living is reached, "For if we have died together with him, we shall also live together"; and how the reigning is reached: "If we endure, we shall also reign together". The dying is in view of living, and the enduring in view of reigning. The word 'endure' points to experience of a peculiar kind, and we are told in the note that it has a double sense in English, 'to last', and 'to go through suffering patiently'; it is the latter here. Reigning will thus apply to those who have endured down here. The hope is that while these passages have a prophetic bearing they may also have a practical, experimental bearing for us as we realise that if we are to administer in a governing sense, we must first learn how to live, to live with Christ, and then how to reign, to reign in the sense of influence and government in the assembly.
A.R. Are the things set out in these scriptures a reward for being faithful here?
J.T. Well, it is put that way: "They lived and reigned with the Christ". But what precedes that is, "And I saw thrones; and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them; and the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God; and those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand; and they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years", @Revelation 20: 4. It is clearly put in the sense of reward, that they are worthy of this honour.
A.R. The overcomer in Smyrna is given a crown of life. Would that be a reward?
{2}
J.T. The word is, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life" (chapter 2: 10). The lesson to us would be that what we go on with now in time in a moral way fits us to enter on official dignity; that is viewed or conferred as a reward. The apostle says, "Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing" (@2 Timothy 4: 8); so we are not coming into anything in this respect that is not already known in some sense. There may be, and doubtless will be, some surprises to us, but what we are coming into is already known normally. Living and reigning are already known.
Ques. Would the mighty men of David's reign who were given places in the kingdom of Solomon correspond with this?
J.T. I would think so.
Ques. It says of one that he was afflicted in all that in which David was afflicted. That would be like suffering with Christ.
J.T. Quite so; they had already experienced things with David that perhaps they could not have experienced fully with Solomon, but with Solomon they would be confirmed; and in the antitype, at least, we are in glory with Christ, glorified together with Him. There is a certain peacefulness with Solomon that the mighty men could not have had with David. The Lord says, "But ye are they who have persevered with me in my temptations", @Luke 22: 28.
C.A.M. The second clause in verse 4 says, "They sat upon them, and judgment was given to them"; that is one sentence, and then the next sentence speaks of "the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony". Would it be right to apply that first sentence to the saints in the present dispensation, and the second to those beheaded after we are gone?
J.T. I think so; it is a classified position. "And
{3}
I saw thrones"; that is a general position; "and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them", that is a certain class; then "the souls of those beheaded ...", that is another set or class but linked up with the former; then another group, "and those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their fore head and hand". It looks as if the Spirit has put them down here in a classified way, but all as one whole on the thrones. Some come in later. The first set would include, I understand, this present time. But it is the living and the reigning that is in mind to be stressed, how we are to learn to live so that we are not surprised, having already known something of it, when we come into the fulness of living and reigning with Christ.
A.A.T. Are these the same ones that are mentioned in the end of verse 6, "they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years"?
J.T. It goes on to say in verse 5, "The rest of the dead did not live till the thousand years had been completed. This is the first resurrection". That all fits in with what we have just read. And then, "Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no power; but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years". This is a further statement governing the previous passage, that is verses 4 and 5. I would say they are the same general class only they are said to be priests, priests of God and of the Christ; not simply priests unto God but of God, as if it is a sort of office they have, not simply a priestly service Godward, but priests of God and of the Christ as a general position of service. It may extend in help to others in the millennium. In chapter 1 it is that He has "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".
{4}
F.S.C. Would it show here that not all those in the first resurrection are raised simultaneously?
J.T. Well, that is a wonderful thing. It is all classed as one thing, indeed it is all one thing, but it is clear from the facts stated that it begins with ourselves according to 1 Thessalonians, although according to Matthew it had already begun as a testimony after the Lord rose from the dead. "Many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many", @Matthew 27: 52, 53. They had part in the first resurrection although they had part in it hundreds of years before ourselves. Then there are those who are raised according to @1 Thessalonians 4, including, I suppose, all the sleeping saints up to that time. But then others will die through persecutions, as we learn here; they will be beheaded: "The souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God; and those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand". These come in literally later, however short the time, but it is all one thing, nevertheless. The first resurrection covers them all. The rest of the dead are held in abeyance for one thousand years; they do not come into the liberty and glory of resurrection.
A.R. Will those that die be greater than those that go through the persecution? They will be reigning with Christ in that sense.
J.T. They have all part in the first resurrection. Of course there are those who are quickened; they do not die at all.
J.R. Would quickening in @Ephesians 2 help us to know how to live?
J.T. We will refer to that scripture: "You, being dead in your offences and sins ... God, being rich in
{5}
mercy, ... (we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us with the Christ, (ye are saved by grace,) and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". Your thought is that the quickening here and the raising enter into the idea of living with Christ?
J.R. Yes; living now.
J.T. Just so. We have also a passage in 1 Thessalonians: "Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has died for us, that whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him" (chapter 5:9, 10). So that it is a strong thought in the Scriptures. Colossians has it too: "You ... he has quickened together with him"; and then there is this side of the position in 2 Timothy, that dying precedes the idea of living; I think the passage really amplifies that in Revelation, "The word is faithful; for if we have died together with him, we shall also live together"; it is not only that we are "dead in trespasses and sins", as in Ephesians, but we do it as an act of our own, dying with Him having a moral force to it.
W.W.M. Is that the meaning in @Romans 6: "For if we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of His resurrection"?
J.T. That is the same thought. We have the word 'if' in these various scriptures. "Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him". "If", so that it is a sort of hypothesis for us to face. It is open to us to die and the question is whether we have taken it up. "The word is faithful; for if we have died together with him ...".
It is a state reached. We have reached that. "If we have died"-that is our side; it is our action.
C.A.M. It would not be merely the solution of the moral question, but that we are going to enter into life because Christ has died, and that we pass through
{6}
death to do it. It is a sort of moral necessity, but there is also the idea of affection for Christ.
J.T. Quite so, "Where thou diest, will I die". It is your action.
C.N. Would it be right to say that life is involved in the idea of being beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and in not doing homage to the beast, and so on? Would the kind of life they lived necessitate these things?
J.T. Yes; they are honoured because in time they have stood out against the evil even unto death, because beheading is a very positive idea of death. The allusion would be, I suppose, to antichrist or the man of sin, getting rid of them, getting rid of persons like that who had such intelligence. Beheading is to remove the intelligence that would be in the enemy's way. We know that Goliath was beheaded. It alludes to Satan's resentment of any whom God has used in intelligence in the testimony. Such a man knows what he is doing and he is, dying for it.
W.W.M. It is important to see that the 'if' is connected with identification with Him in the likeness of His death, but it says, "So also we shall be of his resurrection". There is no 'if' about the latter statement.
J.T. The 'if' is what you have taken on, whether you have died with Him deliberately, because the idea of dying of yourself is very strongly pronounced in the Scriptures. We have learned to lay down our lives. We lay down our lives for the brethren as He has laid down His life for us. But here it is, "If we have died together with him". The "together", I suppose, would allude to us and Christ.
A.R. Paul says, "I die daily".
J.T. That shows how he used the commodity of death. He tells us elsewhere that death is ours. But what good is it if we do not use it? So that David says of Goliath's sword, "There is none like that".
{7}
It is the kind of sword to use; that is, it is real death; but it is not to be wrapped up behind the ephod, it is to be used. David said he could use it, and in the government of God he was forced to use it, but he knew what its value was.
R.W.S. Do the 'if' here and the several 'ifs' in Colossians suggest that there may not be many who are prepared to go this way? "Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him", @Romans 6: 8.
J.T. It is open to us. It would have no force at all unless the opportunity of dying is open to us. In that scripture in Colossians it is already done, "If ye have died". That is already done, so that we are in that status, that class of people who have reached a point through dying. And then we go on into living with Christ, so that it is not a new thing; it will be no surprise that we have such distinction, because we have already gone through the process.
F.H.L. Is the practical working out of it seen in "Always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus", @2 Corinthians 4: 10?
J.T. Quite so; it would be that kind of thing, the dying of Jesus. It is not simply to see Him as dead, as in @John 6, as food, but He is dying. It is the dying of Jesus, "that the life also of Jesus may be manifested". That is the way it works out.
A.B.P. Is it distinct from the idea of putting him to death?
J.T. I think it is; that is, putting to death the body of sin. It is something that is deserving of that at your hands; is that what you mean? It deserves it at your hands because you know the thing you are dealing with, how provocative it is and how obnoxious to God. It ought to be dealt with by your hands.
A.B.P. Is this dying more in relation to the order of man, not necessarily a question of the active
{8}
opposition against what is of God, but the character of man that has been ended in the death of Christ?
J.T. Yes; he deserves to be put to death; the word is, "Put to death therefore".
A.B.P. "Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, vile passions, evil lust, and unbridled desire, which is idolatry", @Colossians 3: 5.
J.T. They are very deserving of it! The word 'therefore' shows it is a sequential thing, the chapter begins with it: "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ" (that refers to chapter 2), "seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God ... . Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth", that is, the moral features of the natural in us that we are well aware of in their character and offensiveness to God, and in the damage they do. There ought to be no hesitation about it; there is even a certain amount of happiness in doing it according to @Psalm 137; even the little ones of Babylon are put to death. It is a sort of pleasure, if one may use the word, to terminate the thing that is so awful, that is so disturbing, so objectionable to God.
F.S.C. Do you think the Lord's teaching on the mount laid the basis for the apostles¬ teaching?
J.T. Do you mean @Matthew 5? Just so. It is a long chapter, in fact there are three chapters, authoritative words; you might call it the Mount of Legislation, but it is legislation against things that are so offensive and the establishment of what is right as over against them.
Ques. Is it right to say that in David's reign Joab, Shimei and Abiathar never learned to live and reign with David, because they allowed certain features of the flesh they did not judge?
J.T. That is good. He would have put them to death himself, and rightly, and perhaps have had a
{9}
certain satisfaction in doing it, but in the government of God he had to leave it for Solomon to do. You can see that in his mind they were deserving of death, that they could not five and reign with him. They might in a certain sense outwardly five and reign, but not in the true sense, because living involves affection.
D.P. Would Abraham in circumcising himself and his household go as far as that of which you are speaking?
J.T. That is the idea, I am sure. Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!" (@Genesis 17: 18); but that is putting a man in the presence of God that God did not care for. Ishmael was circumcised like the rest; circumcision goes a certain way to it, but Colossians makes the thing thorough. It is the circumcision of Christ; it is the real thing, what He endured in the way of suffering.
C.A.M. I was thinking of Jacob somewhat in that connection. It says in @Genesis 49: 28, 29, "Every one according to his blessing he blessed them. And he charged them, and said to them, I am gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave". He must have faced an immensity in that as he thought of all those sons. Was he not stressing to them the necessity of burial, the great meaning there was in it? There was a history really that went into burial.
J.T. He wanted to be buried himself and to be buried in a certain place, where resurrection would take place; so that we can well afford to accept burial in view of resurrection, "For if we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of his resurrection". I am not sure that I would connect Jacob's instructions as to his burial with any evil-doing. What we are speaking of now in Colossians, the putting to death and the putting off, is dealing with evil-doing. But then there is such a thing as dying by the will of God in the light of resurrection, and there is nothing attached to that,
{10}
nothing blameworthy. It is a question of Machpelah, a burial ground that belongs to the Lord, a place in which He keeps His own, "the dead in Christ", until the time of the resurrection.
C.A.M. That is just what I thought. Would it be right to say it was not so much a moral question as a matter of privilege?
J.T. Yes. It was at the threshing-floor of Atad that they stopped as they came round into Canaan to bury Jacob. It is a place of fruitfulness, like the threshing of the corn. @1 Corinthians 15: 44 links with it. Whatever it is, it is all in the light of resurrection, of sowing to be raised. "It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body". So that I think our burials in that way become precious. Our baptisms, of course, are too, but usually baptism comes in to deal with what was objectionable. "Why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name", @Acts 22: 16. It is burial in both cases but Jacob's burial was according to the will of God; burial to be raised.
R.W.S. Is there not a peculiar sweetness about this word 'together' in 2 Timothy? All that believed were together in the pristine days, but as we move on these moral lines that thought is not lost, is it?
J.T. I think not. Ephesians, as we have already said, points to our being raised up together, not with Christ, but with one another. God has raised us up together, not with Christ but in Christ. But "together" refers to one another which, as you say, began at Pentecost and is going on to eternity. Here it is together with Christ that is in mind, I think. It seems to be the teaching of the word; not that we are raised with one another but with Christ. We, together, are unitedly raised with Christ, that is the force of the word. "The word is faithful; for if we have died together with him", that is, all of us viewed
{11}
as taking on the thing; what Ruth took on, "Where thou diest will I die". We have all taken that on, and the Lord is telling us it will be that way always: 'You are to be living with Me, going all of you together, all of you with Me together'. That is the force of the passage, because there is a moral bearing to it. The "if" is hypothetical, and it reverts back to me personally, whether I have faced that matter; whether I have accepted with the brethren this great thought of dying with Christ, dying together with Him. These meetings ought to lead to that. We are speaking to one another unitedly and we are enjoying something, but have we faced this matter together of Christ's death? If we have, the word is, "We shall also live together". It is a precious thought, all of us, every one of us. We are here together now today, but we want that "together" to go on for ever, and it really does in our unitedly coming to the point of dying, laying down our lives in the testimony for Him, the kind of way He laid down His life.
A.B.P. Does this synchronise with the apostle's judgment when he says, "Having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died", @2 Corinthians 5: 14? Is that the process of arriving at this?
J.T. That is good. We judge; it is a judgment. "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died". That is a fact as before God, but I think this goes a bit further. It is a decision to which we have come unitedly, all together, the brethren in fellowship. I think that being in the fellowship we ought to come to this, doing things together. It is our time to die, it is a time of dying for the Lord Jesus. He has done it and we are deciding to do it together.
A.B.P. Does it refer to His death, not as under guilt, but as the One who in every movement was pleasurable to God, for the purpose of terminating one order of man to bring in another?
{12}
J.T. Just so. And you feel that in joining in with this as in these meetings and in our fellowship, it is something to come to, to unite in together. It settles everything, really, if you unite in this point: to die together with Christ; you and I and all of us to join in this. The "if" leads on to the fact that we shall live together too. There will be no separation.
Ques. One of the apostles had this in mind, do you think? Thomas said, "Let us also go, that we may die with him", @John 11: 16.
J.T. That is good. That is one of the assets he has to his credit. He has some debits, but that one is mentioned in John ii, when they were going to Judaea, as if he felt there was opposition to the Lord in Judaea, and he was taking it on himself, and he was ready to die. He was going to join in. I believe that is the idea.
Rem. He says, "Let us also go". The "us" is emphatic. It is remarkable.
J.T. Yes, the "us" is emphatic, so that Thomas is seeking to draw them all into it.
C.N. Does verse 10 of our chapter show that the apostle is labouring to this very end, to bring the saints into the truth of what we are speaking about?
J.T. Yes, I think so. It is what Paul could say, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things. Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my glad tidings, in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evil-doer" (verses 7 - 9). Then he says, "For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain", showing how near he was to Christ in this matter and how his mind was running along the Lord's way as He entered into death for the elects¬ sake. Why should we not all join in this matter, not simply in the fellowship, but in this great matter of identification with Christ in death? Because it is a time of danger, just as Thomas
{13}
said, "Let us ... die with him". It is a time when we are called upon for that sort of thing.
F.N.W. Is there a certain leverage toward going this way in "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead"?
J.T. That is good; it is something to have in your mind. There is a title in the Psalms we have often noted, "To bring to remembrance"; and of course the Lord's supper involves it.
C.A.M. I suppose it would help us in our viewpoint as to those that are suffering on the continent of Europe and our young brothers. You really face the thing with them. You do not just hope there will be some turn that will bring in peaceful conditions, you face what it really means.
J.T. That has often come up during the past four years, what our brethren have been suffering. "Remember prisoners, as bound with them", @Hebrews 13: 3. The Spirit of God would draw us into what is going on. We are immune to it in actuality because of certain physical and political conditions, but the thing is there, and if you are not there physically, at any rate you want to be in it thoroughly in your heart and mind. It is the time for this, that we are to die and then proceed into life.
J.S. Do you think the Lord is stressing the fact of making the assembly ready to cross over?
J.T. It looks that way. It seems as if the Jordan stresses that. There is so much detail in the book of Joshua so that they should go into the land in a suitable spirit and way. The ark has gone in before us, as it were for us. It is there holding the judgment back, holding death back, and we want to join in that rightly, not in any disorganised way when we cross the Jordan, but in order.
Ques. What is the meaning of the word in @Matthew 16: 24, 25: "If any one desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow
{14}
me. For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it"?
J.T. It is not the Lord's cross there, it is your own cross; that is, God in His way has put in your way the means of dying, and it is really a painful thing. As it was to Christ, so it is to us, but it is your matter; it is your death; it is your cross. It is a painful thing as Christ's was. I think that is what is meant, so that if you lose your life you will save it; that is the way it works out.
A.A.T. Does this suffering qualify one for reigning? This verse also speaks of reigning together.
J.T. That is the point we should now go on to. We have already dealt with the word, "If we have died together with him, we shall also live together". The next thing is, "If we endure, we shall also reign together". As already remarked, the word 'endure' means that you go through, go to the end of the war, for the duration, as we say, and do the best possible, but that you really go through it triumphantly. The word is that. 'Endure' has a double sense in English. 'To last' is the first idea, that whatever may come, you do your best to go through. Ungodly men have to do that and they are doing it. But the other meaning is that you go through suffering patiently; that is, you go through according to heaven, according to the example set by the Lord, and that qualifies you for reigning; "If we endure, we shall also reign together".
A.A.T. Job is a sample of endurance.
J.T. James says, "Ye have heard of the endurance of Job, and seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is full of tender compassion and pitiful", @James 5: 11. Job helps us, but you really want Christ for the example of endurance. Take a man like Jonah: he endured too, but he made rather a poor hand of it, though he did fairly well in being cast into the depths.
{15}
"Cast me forth", he says; that meant that he was going to face the thing because others were suffering on account of him.
A.R. How do we get the benefits Paul speaks of? He says, "For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory". Are we getting the benefits of somebody else's enduring? That is how Paul puts it here.
J.T. That is how Paul acted. What a noble thing that was! that they might obtain something because of what he does, that they might gain something from what he endures. Now that is brought down to ourselves in verse 12: "If we endure, we shall also reign together". It is not just as Paul endured but as Christ endured, the way the thing was gone through by Him.
F.N.W. Would you say something about the matter of boasting according to @Romans 5? "We boast in hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance" (verses 2, 3).
J.T. Just so; "Tribulation works endurance", so that experience is stretched out for you. There are many things you have to go through, but you are learning through them. There are certain things that work out results, and the thing that works endurance in you makes you a man like this, that you go through the thing according to God.
J.R. Have we not the power of God to do it "Strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy; giving thanks to the Father", @Colossians 1: 11, 12?
J.T. That is a very good word. I hope the brethren will notice it. It is a Colossian touch. It is divine power that is needed for going through things in this way as Christ did.
{16}
F.H.L. Would not the apostle have been affected by Stephen's ministry and martyrdom?
J.T. Just so; it would be a lesson to him that was never to be forgotten. He was bearing the clothes of them that stoned him, and he afterward called Stephen, a martyr. He tells the Lord he was His martyr, as if he was the representative of martyrdom.
F.H.L. It says in @Acts 9: 31, "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit". Would that not be in measure an outflowing of the result seen in Stephen?
J.T. Just so; I think God had greatly advantaged the testimony at that time in bringing in a man like Stephen. It is the idea of the acacia wood, the humanity of Christ expressed in Stephen, so like the Lord Jesus.
A.B.P. The sisters will be included in this reigning, will they not? The brothers have the most active part in administrative matters now, but it would not be right to exclude the sisters from having part in the reigning in the day to come.
J.T. So that they can ask their husbands at home what happened in the care meeting, so that they can join in and carry things in prayer. Not that one would suggest that the care meeting is a reigning time; it is really more agonising, so as to reach an end in due time in assembly authority. But it certainly needs this endurance.
D.P. Would the difficulties we encounter every day all be used of God to help us, to bring out this feature of endurance?
J.T. I think so. We have already referred to it in @Romans 5; we might look at it again so as to have it clearly in our minds. There are certain workers that God gives us in verses 3 - 5: "Knowing that tribulation works endurance; and endurance, experience;
{17}
and experience, hope; and hope does not make ashamed". The idea of the workers runs through all these things, that is, the idea of what works, meaning what helps us. Peter enlarges on this, showing how one christian quality works out another christian quality, so that there is a continual sequence: that in our faith we are to have virtue, and in our virtue knowledge, and so forth (@2 Peter 1: 5).
W.W.M. Is that why James suggests this line? He says, "Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various temptations" (chapter 1: 2).
J.T. That is just what he means-all joy. That is, he triumphs. If a depressing thing is gone through in this way it is triumph. It is really the exhibiting of christianity, Christ's life in adversity.
W.W.M. In @Romans 8 it says, "We are more than conquerors".
J.T. Quite so, "Through him that has loved us".
R.W.S. The disciples at the Supper have reigning in mind. Then the Lord in the garden a little later on, being in conflict, prays more earnestly; and then there is the awful pressure, sweat as great drops of blood falling down to the ground. Then He goes to the disciples and speaks to them, saying, "Why sleep ye? rise up and pray", @Luke 22: 46. I wondered if that would help as to what we are saying now, the way the Lord comes to them and is so tender with them.
J.T. There you really reach the acme of the Lord's path of suffering. The cross, of course, is the fulness of it, Gethsemane being the place of pressure. The Lord made disposition of the disciples in that place so that they might be fully in the position and get the gain of it. He was pressed; the devil was there to do it; he was a sort of servant to do it, and to work the thing out in the winepress of Gethsemane, and the disciples were to be brought into it. We know how they felt, how they came short, but still, in due
{18}
time, they were all brought into it. The Lord says to Peter, Some day you will come into it. "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire", @John 21: 18. So that we do not go through anything very well. That is what is meant in the awkwardness of the disciples with the Lord, but the Spirit brought them into it in due time.
W.W.M. Do you think that shows us the difference between Joshua and Caleb and the mass of the people going through the wilderness? The others rebel at it, but they had the joy of what was on the other side. They really would represent life in that way.
J.T. They had much better times than the others. Caleb said he had not lost anything; I am just as strong, he said, as I was forty-five years ago. He had lost nothing; he had gained.
A.R. He said he had wholly followed the Lord.
A.A.T. Did you say reigning is influence?
J.T. It is. A brother has just remarked about the sisters coming into this: it is an open door to go into. It is a time of suffering, and if we have died with Him, we shall live with Him, together; it is all of us coming into it together. At the care meeting we will say we have agonising things and we go through them together on the Saturday night, and the Lord's day is the time of living together with Him. Then when the time of action comes in assembly dignity it is a sort of reigning. Things are done in heavenly dignity, and the assembly is really reigning with Christ in the thing. Everything is to be done in order, but there is dignity attaching to it. I believe it works out just that way. That is, those that live with Him are glorified to reign with Him.
C.A.M. It puts a great meaning on what we are doing now in a small way.
J.T. I am sure it does. It is right that we should have it in our minds that things are great. Assembly
{19}
action will be fully displayed in the millennium, but it is taken on now with a measure of understanding. Then we shall have the rule over certain cities, but really we have already come to it now.
Ques. Does this reigning time you are speaking about apply now, or has it only a future bearing?
J.T. It has a future bearing; but we are just trying to apply this passage in Timothy at the present time in a moral way.
Rem. We need strength to endure. A child cannot endure much; the thought of endurance involves strength.
J.R. It says, "Strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy; giving thanks to the Father", @Colossians 1: 11, 12.
J.T. That is it; it is how you go through it according to Colossians. That is not a child's way. Children do not come into this; it is men. Colossians contemplates that.
Ques. Is the writer of the Hebrews stressing that when he says they were not able to take meat? They were like children in a way, and yet he tells them to call to mind what they had endured earlier.
J.T. Just so. They had dropped, I should think.
A.Pf. Speaking of the care meetings, are they more exercising to you than other meetings?
J.T. I do not know; they certainly should be exercising to us all, because so many things have to be dealt with, and it is agonising really as to how to get through them and maintain the rights of God in them, so many things arise to cause real sorrow. They do not come up at the readings or the prayer meetings, and you have to go through them at the time of care. We are to care with genuine feeling how the brethren get on.
Ques. Solomon must have agonised in @1 Kings 3 over those two women with the child. Do you not
{20}
think that is the way it should be? The queen of Sheba suggests the happy side, but there is that agonising side.
J.T. I am sure that is right. Solomon must have had real anxiety and sorrow that he should have to exercise such action on Joab and others, but he had real joy when the queen of Sheba came up. It was a time of joy and victory, the way he went up to the house of the Lord. That was not the care meeting; it was how he went up.
F.H.L. Is there instruction in the Lord's endurance for forty days in the wilderness, with the climax of endurance in the garden at the end of Luke?
J.T. Yes. In Luke it is said He was led in the wilderness by the Spirit-not into. It might appear that He was led into it, but He is led in it. That is the way Luke presents it, showing that He was in victory in it by the Spirit. Luke does not mention the name Gethsemane, He does not enlarge on the sufferings of the Lord so much, but still you can see what was there-how the Lord felt things. He was led of the Spirit in the wilderness, that is, He is presented as moving there by the Spirit, or rather the Spirit is taking the lead, as it should be with us "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God", @Romans 8: 14. That is what marked the Lord. So when you come to Gethsemane-although in Luke it is not mentioned by name-the same principle was there and the Lord went through it in that sense, that He was led by the Spirit. The Spirit had to do with Gethsemane and with the cross too "Who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God", @Hebrews 9:14.
F.H.L. I was thinking of assembly exercises worked out in the wilderness as seen in @Luke 4, corresponding to the Lord's experience there; and then the exercise at the close of the church's history. It speaks in Luke of the Lord's going to the mount
{21}
of Olives, that He endured the pressure there. It is in the garden in Matthew and Mark, but it is at the mount of Olives in Luke. I was wondering whether that is the type or character of exercise the assembly is passing through at the present time.
J.T. Quite so; there is something in that, in the mount of Olives, and the Spirit being linked up with it. It is a time for us to come to this matter of the Spirit and doing things by the Spirit, that the Spirit is doing things by us, for that is what is seen really in @Luke 4.
Ques. Is the thought of reigning entirely future?
J.T. It is a prophetic thought, of course. In our scripture it says, "If we endure, we shall also reign together". That is a future thought, but there can be no doubt that there is a present bearing to it. The actual prophetic thought is fully in @Revelation 20.
R.W.S. There are gradations in reigning, are there not, according to the number of cities? Is that just for the thousand years?
J.T. A thousand years, that is the word there; they live and reign a thousand years.
R.W.S. Is this reigning with Him in Timothy more than a thousand years? Does it apply to the millennium only or does it go into the eternal state?
J.T. It is a question whether it does. We would have to work that out through other scriptures. Here the great point is that you do reign as a consequence of knowing how to suffer now in patience and endurance. That is what accrues. It will be no surprise because you have been through the thing already.
A.R. The twenty-four elders are reigning before this.
J.T. They are seated on thrones around the throne in relation to the course of things in the book; they are throned elders and crowned elders. There is a good deal that we could work out on these lines; but living and reigning a thousand years is remarkable, as
{22}
if it were singled out as a time when these things will be seen peculiarly, the time for seeing the thing and working it out. I would not make much of the thousand years except that it is a time period. We are still in time, a long time of course, but still it is in time, and it is to bring out certain things in a practical or concrete way, what God can reach in the millennium.
C.A.M. With the Lord it is one triumphal day.
J.T. Quite; God has picked out these years, as it were, and put them away for a purpose, to work out some thing or things, so that it shall be fully seen as worked out.
A.R. There is a time period after the millennium, too, is there not?
J.T. According to this chapter there is. Whatever there may be after or before, God would say, I want these thousand years for a purpose. So they are a very important thousand years; they have to be measured and taken as they are, the thousand working something out. There are a great many, periods of time that Scripture contemplates in the numerical way of dealing with things. This matter is a great point with God, and He has ordained the idea of numbers and the use of them. They show how He works out certain things. This is the longest period He has ordained for that purpose. These people in verse 4 are greatly honoured as to what they are, and how God signalises what they are by causing them to live and reign with Christ a thousand years! God has singled out these thousand years to bring about certain things, and these people are involved. In verse 6 we have an addition to the matter: "They shall be priests of God and of the Christ", not to God, but of; that the whole universe may see that God has these people for priests. It will be a great priestly time with such men as these. God will use them in a priestly sense.
{23}
TIME
@Luke 22: 14; @Mark 16: 19
The link one had in mind in reading these scriptures is the great thought of time. Abroad in the world, there is a great shortage of manpower, but this is governed by shortage of time; and shortage of time is evident in our gatherings, so that we are enjoined to redeem the time. One feels that considerable time is lost in our gatherings for want of readiness, for want of preparation. The first scripture contemplates that the Lord, when the hour was come, placed Himself at table, the twelve apostles with Him. "And when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him" (verse 14)- It is clear enough that there was no time lost. The Lord being on time, those who might join with Him administratively were also there. They are with Him. We are together with each other, and each is to function as opportunity affords, but the time is not to wait for us. So the hour was come, and what an hour it was! It could not but be the beginning of the hour, clearly. The scripture implies this, that the hour was there and that this is the very beginning of it. They did not have to remain idle. The Lord placed Himself, we are told. That was an action entering into the service.
It belonged to the service. The idea of place enters into assembly matters as well as time, but time is mentioned first. It did not have to wait. The Lord is active in placing Himself. He was not placed or directed to His place. It was an action that belonged to the service; otherwise, the seat and the time would remain idle, but neither happened, and what thoughts for us, dear brethren, entered into the meaning of the hour and the place, in view of Him who now moved in the service. He had acted Himself in placing
{24}
Himself at table. It was the passover, but it was a great matter involving these points which enter into what has come down to us, what belongs to assembly activity or service; so, dear brethren, what I am remarking cannot fail to have some effect upon us in regard to lateness and irregularity in assembly matters.
The assembly is the greatest thing in the universe outside of divine Persons. They are, of course, Persons, but the assembly is the greatest thing and has the first place in the universe; so that it is to be observed by those who are of it, and they will not fail to observe what belongs to it; so it should not be interfered with, for each person in it, included in it, is to function, and if we are absent or late, we fail; so, dear brethren, I need not enlarge on what I have said. These remarks have no hidden meaning, but they bear on us here particularly in this great city where there is considerable want of observation of what is proper to assembly order in service. So the Lord is in His place, and the twelve apostles are with Him. He selected them, and they were selected by Him in view of this very position, as were other disciples like them, in view of the greatest position in the whole universe. They were selected in view of that, and it is said they, the twelve apostles, were with Him. It is just the apostles, in the original, and the twelve are implied evidently, because even Judas is said to be there. They were with Him, and the hour, the functioning time had arrived; it arrived here some minutes ago, a good few minutes ago, and they wait for us. Others who were here on time had to wait, too, and maybe, I may say, the Lord had to wait, for we are not exactly in assembly as when we are assembled at the Supper, for He then comes to us as the bread is broken. Here we are more conscious that He is with us on the principle of where "two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". So that an assembly position
{25}
such as this implies that the Lord is here and here as we are here, however few it is. I do not say He comes first. He makes His presence known in the midst of them, not in the midst of chairs but in the midst of persons, and being in the midst, it is to do something or influence those who do something. It is a time of functioning, and the Lord is ready to support us in what we do, a very precious suggestion. Those who take part as I am seeking to do now would count on the Lord to support them. He said, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you" (verse 15). No one surely would want to arrive after that, for he or she would be late or miss it. Clearly He could not have done it by Himself, nor is any assembly function done by any person by himself; I mean, he is doing it in relation to others. So here the Lord says, "With you". The apostles were with Him, but now He says, 'I desire to eat this passover with *you*' -- what a thought!
Well now, Mark enlarges on the way of this. Administration was in mind in the position in Luke; the twelve are with Him. They were there in relation to Him, and what He says applies to those with whom He is in relation: "With you", He says. And I may say, dear brethren, that those two words in the verses read, imply the whole dispensation, what the Lord has in mind, what things were in His mind, what feelings! How soon He gave expression to them, to His desires and to His own inward feelings. We cannot miss any of these; they go down the ages. The twelve apostles, indicating the administrative principle, were in His mind. They would carry on, and they did carry on. The opening chapters of the Acts show they did, and how well they did it, too, and how they would call for others coming after them.
Now Mark says, "The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God". The writer of the Hebrews tells us that He entered in, but this is a levitical matter
{26}
and He is taken up. We are told elsewhere that He was received up in glory. Luke says of Him, "And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven" (chapter 24: 51). He had spoken but Mark says He was taken up into heaven and as there He acted, "and sat at the right hand of God". There is no suggestion of an invitation extended, dear brethren. We have to learn how to think of divine Persons and their relation to One Another, but it is clear enough that the Lord had personal liberty in entering the place. He was taken up. That was one thing, but He sat at the right hand of God. There is no suggestion of any aid extended to Him, or proposal or invitation. It is the liberty He had too, but the taking of this position is another thing. It is not His own position. He had a position, and had it there no doubt, His throne would be there. The Lord knew what seat to take. He is going to take another seat later-His own throne, but He is now on His Father's throne. We are not told that here: we are told that He took a place at the right hand. He sat at the right hand of God. Its very meaning is that the position is a fixed one. It is not merely a temporary one, although it would be in another sense, but it is now unoccupied for centuries -- His own throne. We cannot assume anything in a material way, but we cannot assume that it was not there. The Lord knew exactly the position there, and He knew the seat He should take. It was at the right hand. He understood perfectly as He entered there that the service henceforth would be the very best. The young man was at the right hand, too, and the Lord takes the right-hand position, and that is the position that anyone that says anything here tonight is to understand; that he is to take the right-hand position. It is an out-and-out matter. It is not a weak matter, it is in power, and the speaker is to be at the right hand, wholly conscious of power, in what
{27}
is said, and in whatever is said or done afterwards. They are not called apostles here. "And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it" (verse 20). Only a few words that enter into the position of the next speaker (and I hope there will be one or two, not more) but the position is opened as one sits down, or even if he does not, the Holy Spirit may anticipate his sitting down and give a word to another. This enters into the position, and the position views us as being ready, so that the thing goes on, "the Lord working with them". It is now a question of another time, and the Lord had spoken to them. "And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it". The word is to be confirmed. I hope the few words I am venturing to say will be confirmed, because it is urgent, and this thought should have a place with us, that the assembly should function as the time comes, and we should be respectful as to it and all that enters into it, that no time is lost, for it is very scarce. Assembly time is very scarce, so I trust the Lord will confirm and help.
{28}
THE ASSEMBLY AS SEEN IN THE REVELATION (1)
@Revelation 1: 1 - 20
J.T. This chapter is suggested because of its preliminary and introductory relation to our subject. It is thought that we should first consider the personnel used of the Spirit in the inauguration of the assembly, and then the particular servant, John, who is used in connection with it in this book. The idea of the persons employed will perhaps help us to compare the early chapters of Acts with the gospels as to the inauguration of the assembly. Then we should take account of the breakdown and of the parting of the ways between what is real and what is unreal in the profession, and, in view of that, consider why John should be the one taken up and stressed throughout the book of Revelation. Finally we might see how we come into and remain in assembly service and testimony, the moral basis of it being seen in this book, namely that of overcoming.
Therefore we should think first of @Acts 1, 2 and 3 as presenting the persons more particularly used in the inauguration of the assembly. Then we might refer to the person employed to write the assembly gospel, as we may call it, that is Matthew, comparing him with John. It is thought that we should specially consider this because the cleavage in the history of the assembly requires stringency. We must see that the burden of maintaining assembly service has been increased, and Matthew suggests this. He speaks of distances to be covered in view of having part in it, for instance, the distance that the magi had to come in order to worship at Jerusalem, and that in the end of the gospel the disciples had to go to Galilee to meet the Lord. Then the callings of the servants are
{29}
mentioned. Peter was a fisherman; so were John and James, and the Lord spoke of making them fishers of men. Matthew was a publican; there is no doubt his calling, too, would make demands. The suggestion is that of demand in maintaining assembly service, that we must give up the idea of ease. If we have to do with the Lord and His administration we must learn to travel and to suffer. Even in the exercise of local responsibility we must learn to suffer to maintain principles. What is in mind involves that the Lord is calling us to suffer, not so much in the sense of persecution but through physical demand and physical endurance.
C.H.H. You said that we have arrived at the parting of the ways. Just what do you refer to?
J.T. The idea of separation. The change occurs in the addresses to the assemblies in @Revelation 2 and 3, in the idea of overcoming, because in Thyatira overcoming comes in as a necessity for hearing what the Spirit says. There is a change. In order to hear what the Spirit is saying we have to be overcomers, and that would include physical difficulties.
H.H. These last four assemblies are extant at the present time.
J.T. Quite so; therefore there is the necessity for laying ourselves out to suffer in the sense of endurance and labour. Paul enlarges on travel and the like.
W.F.K. You spoke of the personnel of the assembly. Peter was given the keys of the kingdom, not of the assembly, yet it was on Peter's confession that the assembly was to be built. Do you see a difference between Peter and John in that?
J.T. Matthew must be kept in mind too in contrast to John; but, as you say, Peter had the keys, he represents administration. John is a man that loves and is loved; but in his own gospel he is not said to have a distinctive commission. He was an apostle, of course, but the Lord refers to him in a mysterious
{30}
sense, to be kept under His own hand to be used as exigencies require: "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me", @John 21: 22. I think this book of the Revelation illustrates what the Lord meant, that John is a man who is under His hand at any time for an emergency.
R.W.S. When the Lord says in @Matthew 18: 19, "Again I say to you", does that allude to what you are speaking of as the parting of the ways?
J.T. That is what I thought. @Matthew 18 will, I hope, come into the matter. The first part of that particular section which commences at verse 15 refers to what existed at the beginning, the inaugural constitution of the assembly. Verse 16 has regard to the witnesses, two or three, and verse 18 to the assembly which represents God on earth, so that it is to be told things: "Tell it to the assembly". Verse 18, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven", also refers to the primary position, but verse 19, "Again I say to you", refers to fresh conditions that had arisen and had to be met, the "again" meaning that there is a change in circumstances, and the Lord brings down the responsibility to two: "two of you", not any two, for persons nominally in the assembly have to be weighed. It is "two of you", they are particular ones. So the Lord says, "if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". It is "my Father", not yours. "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (verses 19, 20). This latter part, after the word 'again', alludes to the time when there would be a parting of the ways, a reduction in numbers of the persons able to meet the difficulties, coming down to "two of you", and what heaven would do for them.
{31}
-.C. The book opens with the words, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen ..."; so that there is evidently something additional in mind. Then in @Matthew 18: 19 it is, "Again I say to you". Are they similar lines of thought?
J.T. That is what is in mind, that this book contemplates the time of the parting of the ways, as we take the liberty of saying. You can see that it is a new position altogether opened up: It is the "Revelation [or apocalypse] of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John". It does not say, His apostle John. You might say, His prophet, but it is "His bondman John". All the other apostles are omitted, although some of them must have been alive at the time. We may be guided as to time by historical mention. This book was written after Paul's service had taken wide effect. The seven assemblies were really, you might say, Paul's assemblies, because they were all in the province of Asia, where Paul had laboured. Luke tells us that "all that inhabited Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks",
@Acts 19: 10. That was what Paul was ministering, particularly at Ephesus. So we have there the historical facts as to the time that this revelation was made to John. There is no allusion to the assembly at Jerusalem; it is a matter of the seven assemblies in Asia; therefore it is Paul's assembly that is in mind particularly, but John is the one called upon under the Lord's hand in the emergency, evidently because he is a loved and trusted one.
H.H. Does the thought enter into it that "all who are in Asia, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes, have turned away from me", @2 Timothy 1: 15?
J.T. It does enter in because it shows how early the defection began, even in Timothy's time.
{32}
A.A.T. Would you distinguish between John's personal love for the Lord and the love of the assembly for the Lord? He seems to be singled out as a servant, and distinguished.
J.T. What is stressed in regard to John is not his personal love for Christ, but Christ's personal love for him. But surely his personal love for Christ is included, and the Lord can trust him. So this book illustrates what the Lord said to Peter, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?". He is a man held in reserve, and the secret is that the Lord loved him. His own name is not mentioned in John, his own gospel, it is just "the disciple whom Jesus loved". But his own personal name is here, meaning that he has a history as to what his character is. His character is known historically. He is a reliable man; that is the point. It is reliability that is needed; we have light, but reliability is needed and readiness to suffer, even if it be physically, to maintain the principles of the assembly.
S.J.H. Would you say a little more as to what is involved in the parting of the ways? Then there is an angel mentioned here. Is it on account of all Asia having left him?
J.T. That is right. 2 Timothy shows what the facts were. Paul mentions certain ones specifically, but all Asia had turned away; not forsaken exactly, but turned away, which would not mean an open schism but rather a secret condition. So that when we come to the examination of Ephesus and the other assemblies we find there was more or less loyalty to Christ in all of them; but the disloyalty began early, even in Timothy's time.
H.B. It appears that the turning away would be in the leadership; Paul mentions Phygellus and Hermogenes, who were doubtless leaders. Is this the way the Lord acts in recovery, through these qualities seen in John?
{33}
J.T. Demas is spoken of too among those who had deflected. No doubt the Lord will help us as we proceed with the account of each church; in chapters 2 and 3 we shall see that leadership is at fault.
R.H. You alluded to the link between Matthew and John, the way John is presented in Revelation. Would you say a little more about that?
J.T. Well, I thought that as John is taken up here by the Lord as a bondman he would link on with Matthew. He stresses the idea of obedience right through, of overcoming on that principle. Matthew's line would be that too, stressing the idea of a command. So that the Lord says to the women, "Go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee",
@Matthew 28: 10. The angel had said the same thing, "Go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him. Behold, I have told you", @Matthew 28: 7. I stress that point; they have been told to do something and they do it. "Going out quickly ... they ran to bring his disciples word", we are told, pointing to the suggestion that we must lay ourselves out to serve and serve quickly and well, for it is a command. "As they went to bring his disciples word"-notice it is not now a 'command' but a 'word'-"behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail!", meaning that He is respectful to them. He looks to them to be respectful too, as if to encourage them. "And they coming up took him by the feet", which is not a good thought. They would hold Him back, and that is not to be admitted; there is to be no holding back when a command is involved. Now in order to make the truth clear it is said in verse 16, "But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them". There again it is a command or authority; they had to go there, to Galilee, to where Jesus had appointed them. "And when they saw him, they did homage to him
{34}
but some doubted. And Jesus coming up spoke to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth". Now He is speaking to them in Galilee. He continues, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations"-this is a command again, 'Go and do it'-"baptising them to the name Of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you" (verses 18 - 20). I thought we should have these verses before us to make the position clear, that Matthew links on with John, or rather, that in the Apocalypse John links On with Matthew really in stressing these principles: that things have to be done, and that overcoming implies that they are done. And so the Lord says to Philadelphia, "Thou ... hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name", @Revelation 3: 8. The women had gone out quickly from the tomb, but when the Lord meets them He does not say, "Behold, I have told you", but "Go, bring word to my brethren", bring them word.
J.J. What is the distinction between 'command' and 'word'?
J.T. Well, 'word' conveys what is in the mind. A command may be anything in the sense of authority, but 'word' conveys intelligence in what is being said. There is a reason for it, a good reason for it, a thought which always goes with the idea Of 'the word' or 'logos'. It is not only what is said, but that behind it there is good reason for it.
R.W.S. So that this whole matter Of ordering and enjoining would militate against the independence which might mark us On this continent, and which we need to overcome to be assembly persons.
J.T. I think the Lord has helped us there too in the parting of the ways, to withdraw from iniquity "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", @2 Timothy 2: 19. Naming
{35}
the name of the Lord would be authority, but withdrawing or departing from iniquity is doing something more; it is the positive side. I think in view of the assembly the Lord has greatly helped the brethren all these years not to carry the leaven with us as withdrawing from iniquity. What is said about it in @Matthew 16: 4 greatly helps: "He left them and went away"; that is, He left the Pharisees. Then He enjoins His disciples about the leaven of the Pharisees, not only to leave them but to leave their leaven; that we are to judge it and not to carry it with us, and in judging it we are able to carry something positive with us.
R.H. Do these thoughts of the parting of the ways and of suffering link On with the Lord's charge to the disciples in Matthew as to the sword and the cross? As He sends out the twelve it says (chapter 10: 5), "When he had charged them", and then in verse 34, "Do not think that I have come to send peace upon the earth I have not come to send peace, but a sword".
J.T. Just so, and then in His leaving those who are disloyal, war is implied. So the sword is used in the sense Of "the word of God" which is "sharper than any two-edged sword". With the great volume of ministry that we have on paper, and also what there is in the hearts and intelligences Of the brethren it is a question of the word of God being used in warfare.
R.H. I was struck by the difference between the Lord's charge in Matthew and in Luke. In Luke it is the idea of a son of peace, but in Matthew it is worthy persons and a worthy house; and then He speaks of the idea of a sword and of accepting the cross.
J.T. I think all that is apropos Of what we are saying in linking On Matthew with John, John being the lover and the one whom Jesus loved. He is now called a bondman; that is what he is characteristically.
He is one ready to do what he is told to do. I think that is what is meant in the word 'bondman', and
{36}
the first great Bondman represented in Scripture is a lover. So that bondmen are lovers, as the Lord says in John's gospel, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (chapter 14: 15). So the link between Matthew and John is seen, I think, in that John here in Revelation is working out the idea, especially in what he says to the assemblies; he is working out the principles of obedience and overcoming, and overcoming involves keeping the Lord's word and not denying His name.
H.H. Do you get the lover in @John 13, in His bosom and on His breast?
J.T. Just so; I think that is where the link lies between Matthew and John. Matthew makes a good deal of obedience. The change-over in chapter 18 is, "Again I say to you", and it brings in two of the assembly; they pray about things, there is the burden of prayer. Then two or three are gathered together, the power of gathering being recognised, so that independence is simply shut out.
W.F.K. Must we be subjects in the kingdom before we can be assembly material? I was thinking that here in Matthew they would do Him homage; that would be as the King.
J.T. Just so; that is the point with the women and the apostles; they both did him homage; but the kingdom hardly carries with it the deity of the Lord, I mean it is not stressed. The kingdom is a question of authority, but the idea of worshipping Him involves His Person. So the first mention in Matthew as to worshippers is when the magi came a long way to worship and do homage to Jesus.
W.F.K. The chapter we read brings in a kingdom of priests unto God. I was thinking that we have to come into the kingdom before becoming assembly material.
R.W.S. Is there anything in the occupations of these two apostles? You alluded to one being a tax-gatherer and the other a fisherman.
{37}
J.T. I think the government of God enters into the matter of our calling. We are enjoined to continue in it whatever it be. Undoubtedly in the government of God our calling is calculated to affect us as taken up in God's kingdom. The Lord may use it in the sense in which it has trained you and affected you in a constitutional way. After all, as persons born into the world we all need ordinary education. But God oversees everything and knows everything beforehand and He intends that there shall be something in our calling that will affect us and be useful in His service. Hence He says to Peter and Andrew, "I will make you fishers of men". The Lord used the word 'fishers' there to link on with their natural occupation. That thought was to attach to them in what they were to be spiritually.
A.R.C. If I understood you rightly, you said it was wrong for the women to hold the feet of Jesus. Would you point out the defect?
J.T. I should not want to hold the Lord's feet. He is on a journey. Why should my wife or my children hold my feet if I have to go and serve the Lord? That is what enters into it.
A.R.C. I suppose the joy and the affection they felt at seeing the Lord risen was more on natural lines.
J.T. It might be an Israelitish thought. They sought to hold Him for their own purpose. Not that you would limit them exactly, but they held Him by the feet when He was on a journey to go into Galilee.
S.J.H. You spoke about physical suffering: do you think that is one way our affection is shown in overcoming? The Lord helps us in long journeys and other taxing matters.
J.T. Just so; you lay yourself out to suffer. It is remarkable how many journeys are being made now, how much application has to be made to the railroads for transportation and for gas to drive our cars, all in faith, so as to attend these meetings. I am sure God
{38}
has great regard for that. But to refer again to our brother's remark as to our calling, and how much it may enter into our usefulness in the divine service, I would say that Matthew was a tax-gatherer and we know what that means-much that is objectionable; but at the same time it had something to do with Matthew's education and how he would view things, not in a wrong sense but in a right sense, and undoubtedly God has that in mind in what persons are called to do in working with their hands.
J. W. Paul was a bondman. Would he represent a journeying brother and John be more stationary?
J.T. I think that is good. The Lord in His parabolic teaching spoke about a man on a journey, how he would get all the loaves he needed by prayer. Paul had a circuit of journeyings: "In journeyings often", he says; and again in @Romans 15: 19 he speaks of travelling "from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum", which was a very very long journey, involving much territory to be crossed. He says, "I ... have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ"; that is, he did not diminish his skill and zeal and workman's ability because of the journey.
"I ... have fully preached": the thing was well done, however great the journey he had to make.
W.W.M. Might we sacrifice to make a journey to a meeting such as this, yet be careless in attending our local meeting if we are tired, and not be prepared to sacrifice to be there?
J.T. I am sure that is a good thing to suggest. We have spoken of it before in our locality. Many brethren are ready for a journey to preach or to give an address at a distance, but the question is whether the local position is taken care of in my journeyings.
Am I neglecting my local responsibility? Because, after all, local positions are involved in the Apocalypse; several local positions are mentioned. Ephesus is one. There are seven of them, and they have to be
{39}
attended to. Take the matter of the Nicolaitanes, for instance, persons who bring in bad doctrine and teaching and influence: if those who have the truth and love it are away all the time we are exposing our local gatherings to these Nicolaitanes. So that I believe the Lord would help the brothers who have gift not to make everything of it, because leadership is also important. Teaching and leadership generally go together, and if I am away all the time, or most of the time, I cannot be a leader locally.
R.W.S. The bride in the Canticles says, "Mine own vineyard have I not kept" (chapter 1: 6); but when the exercise has been gone through she says at the end of the book, "My vineyard, which is mine, is before me" (chapter 8: 12).
J.T. That helps. In our section there is great weakness, because most of the brothers cannot preach, and the few brothers who are gifted are invited to preach so constantly that the local positions are in danger of being neglected. So I think Matthew's gospel would say, 'Look after the vineyard, look after the administration as well as the preaching'. In fact Matthew does not stress the preaching, though Mark does. It is administration and building that he would stress and the order of the assembly; that is, if there is a difficulty that we should "tell it to the assembly"; is there anybody there to speak to? We have to look out for brethren who can be told and who should be told about the thing.
A.A.T. How do you regard Paul in this connection? Did he have a local position? I know that he had a universal position and that he travelled oft; but how would these remarks apply to him?
J.T. They do apply to him. According to @Acts 14 he and Barnabas went to Antioch of Pisidia and elsewhere and when they had fulfilled their mission they returned to Antioch and were there certain days "Having arrived, and having brought together the
{40}
assembly, they related to them all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations. And they stayed no little time with the disciples" (verses 27, 28). That is, they were for a while local men: "They stayed no little time". We are told, in chapter 11, "that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd" (verse 26). This was at Antioch, and then he tells us himself that for the space of three years he laboured at Ephesus, and for eighteen months he worked at Corinth. So in those instances the saints certainly had a local brother in Paul.
Ques. It says in @Mark 2: 1, "He entered again into Capernaum after several days, and it was reported that he was at the house". The note says, 'At home', in the sense of 'not away on a journey'. Is that anticipative of local conditions?
J.T. Just so. The Lord Himself clearly had a central position in Capernaum. He deliberately went down from Nazareth and dwelt at Capernaum. That would mean that He would be there as a local Person. It is called, "His own city", @Matthew 9: 1.
R.H. It says in @Matthew 2, "Having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee, and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazaraean".
J.T. There is the local idea in that. It also says, "He came to Nazareth, where he was brought up" (@Luke 4: 16), and that "He went and dwelt at Capernaum" (@Matthew 4: 13), so that He could be found there. I think this is a matter of importance, because the Lord is concerned about what there is to be seen in the way of testimony. It is not simply what is to be heard, but what is to be seen. If a brother is often away preaching, you do not see him much at his local meeting; that is a weakness. What is to be seen in the local position is part of the testimony.
{41}
E.A.L. What you are saying is making evangelism much broader than one's being merely a speaker. A more important thing is to be a model.
J.T. Just so; it is what the example may be. So the first two who acted in moving together in the service were Peter and John, seen in @Acts 3, and the word is, "Look on us"; not simply, Listen to what we are saying, but "Look on us". And so in John's gospel the two who are seeking the Lord call Him 'Rabbi' and say, "Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou? He says to them, Come and see"; not,'Come and hear'. "They went therefore, and saw where he abode". They would see that the Lord had a home.
H.B. Paul says, "Corinthians" (@2 Corinthians 6: 11); and "O Philippians", @Philippians 4: 15. Does that show that our locality should mark us?
J.T. If you look at the persons that accompanied Paul in @Acts 20 you will see how they are called according to the places they come from. It says in verse 4, "And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater ... a Berean"; notice that-he belonged to the place; "and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus"; they belonged to the place; "and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus". They are all referred to in relation to their localities. It seems as if this is a point of importance, that the testimony is not simply what is heard by mouth from a gifted person in preaching and teaching, but that it is also what is seen in him, and that involves his position in his house and in his local gathering.
Ques. Does Samuel illustrate that? It says of him, "He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpah ... and his return was to Ramah; for there was his house", @1 Samuel 7: 16, 17.
J.T. That is right.
{42}
S.J.H. What would you say about brethren in a foreign country who cannot return home on account of war and the like; are they local there?
J.T. It is a question of getting the principle and seeing how it can be worked out. Under the present circumstances, of course, many of the Lord's servants cannot get to their local positions and others have to stay at home. Then there are brothers who are held as prisoners of war. All these are counting on a change in the circumstances and their prayers are going up constantly for this. God is hearing them, too, and presently He will make a change.
S.J.H. But for the time being are they local somewhere in the country where they are?
J.T. That is so. Some of us are a poor testimony to that. It is a question of whether in travelling you can be a local man as effectively as you can be a preacher.
Ques. Is the question of inviting a brother important? How are his local responsibilities taken care of?
J.T. That is a matter I am sure that requires attention, as to what is to be seen as the testimony is developed; whether it is neglected or whether it has been cared for. What is there to be seen in this city?
J.L.P. Would it be in the apostle's mind that the saints at Philippi were to take that on? "What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you", @Philippians 4: 9.
J.T. That is true; so he sent Timotheus to Corinth, as has been often remarked: "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ", @1 Corinthians 4: 17. Timothy would read this to the Corinthians. Paul kept in mind that they still needed to have him before them as a model.
{43}
C.H.H. Would the exercise of David enter into this as having a keeper for the sheep? He would not leave them unattended.
J.T. Just so. So in the beginning of Acts we have reference to "All things which Jesus began both to do and to teach", @Acts 1: 1. The doing is what is at home, what is local, what is in one's walk.
Ques. As to the other side, the servant's side, is there any principle involved in @1 Corinthians 16: 12? "Now concerning the brother Apollos, I begged him much that he would go to you with the brethren; but it was not at all his will to go now; but he will come when he shall have good opportunity". It would not be right to say, No, would it?
J.T. The apostle did not condemn the attitude of Apollos. I judge it lay in the state of the saints there. An element adverse to Paul existed there and Apollos sympathised with the apostle and would evade any appearance otherwise. But as to the point we are considering, the danger of neglecting local responsibility, if you are invited to go a long way to serve the saints, you must calculate as to the time needed and whether local needs admit of it, and decide before the Lord accordingly.
R.H. You referred to doing and teaching. In @Matthew 4 and 9 the Lord is seen preaching first, and then teaching and then healing. What would you say about that?
J.T. I was thinking of that. Matthew itemises what the Lord did in chapter 4 and again in chapter 9, to show what a Minister He was: "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!", @Isaiah 42: 1. Heaven was thinking of His general service, not of what He was locally as in @Luke 4. Matthew has come to the time of enlarging on what the Lord did, the immensity of what He did, and all the kinds of things that He did are mentioned. In Matthew you have even lunacy.
{44}
But now returning to our subject as to Matthew and John, we get John in this first chapter of Revelation in a peculiar and special way. We are told, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ". John is here called a "bondman", and the angel is sent to him, and then we are told what he did: he "testified the word of God"; the word 'testified' here would mean the way in which he brought the word of God to bear in this book, "The testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw". The Lord signified what He received from His Father, "sending by his angel, to his bondman John". That is, certain signs had been used to indicate the revelation to John who testified the word of God. It continues, "John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth". This is John's address to the seven assemblies. Then he says, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages. Amen". That is what John says to the seven assemblies, what the Spirit of God is now saying. This introduction indicates what a servant he was, and the moral power he has to address the seven assemblies. Had he been in each of them? It would appear so. It would look as though he had some knowledge of them. He had not been used to form the assemblies; apparently that was Paul's work. But he evidently knew them and knew what to say; and what he says involves the peculiar character of this book, that the Lord "loves
{45}
us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father". Then in verse 9 he tells us, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus". What an experience he had had! a "fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus". These features, as the note tells us, 'are intimately connected, being brought together under one head by one article in the Greek'. John was a thoroughly balanced brother in his experience. The brethren will have noticed, no doubt, that these qualities, "tribulation", "kingdom" and "patience", are intimately connected; that is, the brother John is presented to us as marked by partaking in the tribulation and kingdom and patience in Jesus. The preposition used indicates being in these things in power, that is, he was affected by them. Then he goes on to say that he "was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus". He then says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet". What he heard was about the assembly under seven heads. Then he says, "And I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden lamps"; that is, he speaks of seeing the assembly before he saw Christ; "And in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man". It is well to note what he sees, because it brings out the character of the work of the brother or minister; and then he is able to describe the Lord, not as by Himself, but in the midst of the seven golden lamps; that is to say, it is the Lord in relation to the assembly and it is an assembly man speaking about it with feeling. We can see the Lord is setting out the situation fully about the assemblies, and He is seen in their midst.
A.R.C. Is that why the official side is not seen here? John is a bondman.
{46}
J.T. He is not mentioned as an apostle, but as a bondman, and then as a brother.
A.R.C. He is a valued brother.
J.T. Quite so; he is a bondman, and what underlies bondmanship according to the type in Exodus is love. The bondman loves his master, his wife and his children, three features of love. He is balanced in his love. And so here John is balanced in his character. Of course, that is inspired; but nevertheless it is important to see that the assembly is kept in mind from the very beginning and mentioned here even before the Lord, who is mentioned then as seen in the midst of it. Therefore the dispensation is Christ in the midst of the assembly, and it goes right on to the end.
H.B. At the end He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", @Revelation 22: 16. Have you that in mind?
J.T. Quite so; the last reference is that. We have hardly covered the ground as intended, but I think there is some idea of what was in mind, that is, to bring out John as over against Matthew and the others, that he is the only one of the assembly servants that is seen operating in this book, and doing so to the end. The assemblies are kept in mind right through according to what they were when the Lord was in their midst.
C.H.H. Would you say that the positions in which John had been relative to the Lord when He was here are carried along in their meaning into this book? Only one who had been in the bosom of Jesus and on His breast could occupy this position at Patmos. Would that be so?
J.T. Quite so. How much more there is in all this if we only had time to go into it! I am sure the Lord would have us keep in mind the position in which John sees Him. He is seen in the midst of the seven golden lamps. Those who have love are still viewed
{47}
as light-bearers in God's kingdom to keep that functioning. The Lord is in the midst of them and in judicial robes, so that everything is discerned and dealt with. That is our position.
Rem. It says that John saw the voice.
J.T. That is remarkable, that the voice is identified with the Person.
{48}
THE ASSEMBLY AS SEEN IN THE REVELATION (2)
@Revelation 2: 1 - 29
J.T. To complete the introduction to our subject a few remarks are required on verses 17 to 20 of the first chapter of Revelation. John says, "And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades", @Revelation 1: 17, 18. And then the Lord says, "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these. The mystery of the seven stars which thou hast seen on my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. -- The seven stars are angels of the seven assemblies; and the seven lamps are seven assemblies". The adjustment that the servant needed is indicated here, an important matter as to service and those who are bondmen. John is affected by what he saw. The Lord brings certain facts before him with a view to his complete adjustment for the service. So He says, "Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". So that the Lord sets him up in view of the service He was committing to him and tells him the order in which he is to write, which is applicable in principle to what we say as well as to what we write, that is, the order in which we set out our subject matter. First, He says, "What thou hast seen", then "The things that are", and then "The things that are about to be after these". The order of the writing is made plain, as if the Spirit of God would have the truth ministered in a certain order
{49}
the order of one, two, three. And then there is this matter of the mystery (verse 20); if one is to be initiated into that, it would be number one. The seven stars are the angels of the assemblies, and the seven lamps are the seven assemblies, so that the servant is now set up in view of his service. The book bears in mind too, that as servants we are just creatures and liable to error or failure, even though commissioned. A very solemn thing! At the end of what he saw in chapter 22: 8, John says, "And when I heard and saw, I fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who shewed me these things", showing how one may be mistaken in one's understanding and outlook even although commissioned and in actual service; therefore we are reminded that we are to be in constant dependence. Even in the exercise of our service we may begin well and get through well and yet finish ill. The book contemplates the perfect Servant, which Mark also presents, but it warns us of our creature limitations and creature liabilities, so at the end of chapter 1 John is set out on his service to write messages to the seven assemblies severally.
C.H.H. Would this dependence be secured in the knowledge that the Lord holds the seven stars in His right hand? Would that be our security?
J.T. That is a good suggestion. In the danger attaching to us it is establishing to know that we are held in the Lord's right hand. It says, "These things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand"; it is not simply that they are under control, though He has them under control, but that He maintains them, too.
H.H. How would the thought of His having the stars in His right hand fit in with decline in the assemblies?
J.T. In the general position of man if the servant were upheld absolutely it would mean almost complete disregard of responsibility, that is, if he were held in
{50}
immaculateness. The Pope, for instance, is held to be infallible under certain circumstances; that is, if he takes a certain attitude. He does not assume to be infallible absolutely; it is only under certain circumstances. But that is going beyond creature liabilities, because a creature is liable to fail at any time; although there is the side, for instance, of the inspiration of the Scriptures which is infallible. Then too in the ministry of certain persons like the apostles, servants have been preserved; yet there is in all of them the evidence of liability to fail, for "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us", @1 John 1: 8. We shall be in a state of perfection ultimately, and that is what God has in mind, that abstractly the saints are in a state of perfection now because Scripture says, "We know that every one begotten of God does not sin", @1 John 5: 18. But that is abstract, assuming what will be, and what can be in a certain relation even now; but whilst we are in a state of flesh and blood there is no guarantee against failure, even though it be only in a small sense. Yet the holding of the seven stars implies that that is the general position of the dispensation; the Lord has taken up this attitude of holding. Later, in chapter 3, He says that He has the seven stars "These things saith he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars" (verse 1). The word 'has' there is not 'holds'. Holding them is more active and definite. Having them is just the fact of possession, and I suppose when we come to the conditions of Sardis there will even be the suggestion that ministry is not being preserved and supported.
S.J.H. Is it a good indication that at the start, having seen the Lord in this way, John falls at His feet as dead?
J.T. The Lord does not reprove it, but He says to John, "Fear not". You could hardly think of John in his ordinary service as taking up this attitude.
{51}
I think while it is not reproved exactly, yet it is a little out of accord with the position of the servant as set up in the Spirit. In fact he says he was "in the Spirit", "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".
S.J.H. I wondered if it was in the presence of what is judicial.
J.T. Quite; I would not like to say much, but the Lord says, "Fear not", which might be interpreted that he might be justified in fearing; but really I think the Lord meant there was nothing to fear. He intended that John should know Him. John's own gospel shows how the truth of life works out, as the Lord says to Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life: he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live; and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die", @John 11: 25, 26. I mean to say, the truth of life in Christ implies that there is really nothing to fear; the full apprehension of the truth would lead to that.
C.H.H. Is it an essential thing in the servant to feel his weakness in the presence of this? David says in @Psalm 39: 4, "Make me to know, Jehovah, mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: I shall know how frail I am". Would that be a wholesome exercise?
J.T. Well, you get illustrations of commendable lowly attitudes. Daniel, for instance, was very weak in the presence of the angel or minister from God; he describes his gradual recovery and finally he is made to stand by the angel, who says, "Fear not, Daniel". Later he says, "Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me", @Daniel 10: 19. But christianity certainly supposes a perfect condition, that is, that on the principle of life in Christ one is made perfect.
S.J.H. And the knowledge that "perfect love casts out fear", @1 John 4: 18.
J.T. Quite so, and chapter 1:7 of the same epistle says, "But if we walk in the light as he is in
{52}
the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin". It is admitted that we are weak, but we know the priesthood of Christ preserves us. At the same time christianity involves what is perfect, abstractly anyway.
A.A.T. Would you make a distinction in your mind between John's failure and that of Barnabas and Mark, in that the two latter acted in self-will? They did not go on with Paul in the service.
J.T. At the juncture you refer to Barnabas and Mark were morally wrong. They were acting somewhat on partisan lines. But that is not the same as a brother like John in the presence of such a vision. You may say you cannot wonder at his being affected. It is true you cannot attach any wrong moral element to John here; at the same time the question is whether he is in the full sense of what christianity implies. Abraham had a vision and he was not in this state, and others too had visions. But John is recording what happened to him and the Lord said, "Fear not". It is therefore for us to judge, and I would say that the full thought of christianity should have supported him. The Lord intended to support him in the presence of the vision.
C.H.H. Would Mary's attitude in the presence of the angel be a good example?
J.T. Quite so; she was not abashed at all. That is a good illustration.
H.H. John had never seen the Lord in this attitude before.
J.T. Did he not see Him when He took a whip of small cords and drove the sheep-dealers out of the temple? What would he have seen in the Lord then? He would have been in similar garb then, would He not?
H.H. I had not thought of that; this is a very full-sized picture, is it not?
{53}
J.T. Quite so; at the same time christianity is involved, it implies a perfect state. John knew what it was to be in the power that is available to the believer; he says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".
C.H.H. So he would have seen the Lord in both aspects: on the mount of transfiguration he would have seen Him as glorified, and then as acting judicially in the temple.
J.T. Just so; the Lord would have been seen by the apostles in many ways, so that in some sense this garb would have been seen in His dealing with evil, and with good too. It is very beautiful, as if the Lord would say to John, There is nothing to cause you fear. There was much to cause others to fear in their delinquencies that He was about to speak of; He spoke only to make them fear, but I think the Lord meant that for John there was nothing to fear. Surely christianity implies that!
H.B. Is there a suggestion of all that in Daniel, where it is one like to the appearance of a man who touches him and says, "Fear not"?
J.T. Just so, Daniel had a similar experience, as we have already noted.
C.H.H. It would link on with the angel's words, "Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one", @Matthew 28:5.
H.H. Is the thought in your mind that we need not fear in seeking to go on with the testimony in these days?
J.T. That is what we should gather. The Lord knows how to approve and He knows how to disapprove. If a person is not going on well and comes into the Lord's presence, the Lord would not say to him, There is nothing to fear! But with John it was different, he was going on well. In fact the description he gives of himself would show he was fully in accord with the truth.
{54}
M.W.A. John himself says in his epistle that "perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment, and he that fears has not been made perfect in love". Does that have a bearing?
J.T. It does indeed. I think God would perfect the apostle in all that christianity means. Christianity is absolutely perfect in the abstract; when we can eliminate all else we have an absolutely perfect thing; and the Holy Spirit is capable of maintaining us now in that abstract state.
R.H. Is there a link between the emphatic "I" here and the "I" in the end of Matthew? "And behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", @Matthew 28: 20. Would the perfection of the position you are speaking of be linked with that?
J.T. You have the emphatic "I" here, you mean, in verse 17. Quite so; "I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". That comes in after He says, "Fear not". All that is really to emphasise the idea that there is nothing to fear at all in John's case.
S.J.H. Is there a suggestion that if any one will take up these issues which the Lord is taking up with the seven assemblies, the Lord will hold him in His right hand and support him?
J.T. I think that is His attitude, the attitude of holding the seven stars, and any one under commission should be strengthened by it. John is actually under commission and the Lord is saying to him, There is nothing in this position to fear. It will not do if I am capable of cowering before anything; if I am under commission I must be strong, as was said to Joshua, "Only be strong and very courageous", @Joshua 1: 7. So when the man with the drawn sword appeared to him he did not cower, but he said, "Art thou for us, or for our enemies?", @Joshua 5: 13. He carried on the partisan idea in the presence of the Lord and the
{55}
Lord has to adjust that. When Joshua asked, "Art thou for us, or for our enemies?", He said, "No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come".
Ques. Why is the appellation, "Son of man" used here?
J.T. It is another element in the position; it is what He is in His universal attitude, what belongs to christianity as over against judaism in this book. Although it recognises Israel in many ways, yet it is in the midst of christianity. Its setting is in the time of christianity, just as the wrath that came out at the fall of Jerusalem happened in the period of christianity. We are never to forget that we are here in christianity, and that it is a perfect state that God has set up.
C.H.H. What would Paul mean when he says, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling", @1 Corinthians 2: 3?
J.T. That is a question of the state he had to deal with, and the Lord made him realise that he had such a state to deal with. It was really governmental. The persons he had to deal with were the cause of it. He had not the same fear with others, it was the state he was in the midst of. And so it is in ministry, if you are dealing with unspiritual people God in faithfulness will have to deal with them as unspiritual, and you may not get the same support because of their state.
C.H.H. Would it depend on you to define the assembly state before you in ministry?
J.T. Quite so; and you have to be faithful, and bow to what God may do in view of persons who are unspiritual.
W.F.K. "I am ... the living one"; is that a statement to encourage the servant?
J.T. First he hears the statement, "Fear not". That is a clause in the sentence and what follows is to
{56}
strengthen the exhortation conveyed in those two words. It goes on, "I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". Well, what is there to fear? If John has a good conscience-and he has according to what comes out here-what is there to fear? The Lord is not against a man like John, He is against evil. The Man that supports a man like John has the keys of death and of hades.
R.H. Was Timothy needing adjustment on this line when Paul wrote to him, "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise discretion", @2 Timothy 1: 7?
J.T. Just so; he was likely to be nervous in his service, as often young brothers are, and that word is just to strengthen such, to strengthen Timothy.
Now these verses in the end of chapter 1 are necessary to complete what we are saying about John, because we are comparing John with Matthew in affecting the personnel at the inauguration of the assembly. These verses give the full position of John as set up in himself. There is nothing morally out of the way with him, evidently, but he needed strengthening; he needed to be reassured that all was well in his dealings with the Lord. There is nothing in His appearing to cause John fear. And now he is set up at the end of chapter 1 for his service; but as we were saying, the order of his writing is emphasised. It is not only that I am to be set free and in power, but that I am to minister according to order and as governed by the primary apprehension I may have of the mind of God in any given circumstance. If I have that apprehension I am to proceed according to order; and the order is one, two, three. If it be only one, keep to it; or two, keep to two, but in the order of one and two, because God, even in ministry, is the God of order, and of measure too.
{57}
Ques. In chapter 1: 20 the Lord speaks of the seven stars as on His right hand; and in verse 1 of the next chapter, He speaks of them as in His right hand. Would there be any difference?
J.T. The first would be, you might say, the ornamental position of the stars; the second is that He is dealing with them, using them: "He that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamps". They are actually in function in the second instance.
R.W.S. The right hand is a very comforting thought in apostate days. The stars are on it and they are in it. John also says, "And he laid his right hand upon me" (verse 17).
J.T. As in it they are more immediately functioning, in fact they are in function. They are available to Him in that sense; they are actually there.
W.W.M. Would that represent the responsible element in the assembly?
J.T. Yes; that is what is meant, I think.
A.A.T. If I get your thought, you do not recommend that a brother giving an address should present six or seven points, but just one, two or three in order?
J.T. I should much prefer to keep it to one, two, three, than to go to six. In prophecy it is also very important. I think brevity is one important matter in ministry but one would not limit or criticise any. But the Lord's order here is very significant; it is one, two, three.
R.W.S. Would that apply to the number of scriptures read?
J.T. I think so. You want to make things clear, to be concise. The Lord has given you your thoughts and now He is telling you how to use them, how to subdivide them. Do not put number three first; begin with what you are seeing, as He says here, "Write therefore what thou hast seen". He begins with that. Then, "The things that are, and the
{58}
things that are about to be after these". So "what thou hast seen" is first.
Ques. Are you suggesting John as a pattern to be followed under present conditions assembly-wise in view of the public breakdown, but now in regard to recovery?
J.T. I think so. He is the one servant before us, a commissioned one, and he certainly is a model, particularly in the use of Scripture and the subdivision of the subject that you wish to present. You do not make it any more difficult than necessary for your audience. Of course if you are speaking parabolically, you might be hiding the truth; that would be judicially. But the principle of ministry generally is to open up the truth, "opening and laying down", it is said of Paul. You bring the thing out, and then lay it down so that the saints can take it in.
C.H.H. If you had the order of one, two, three, definitely before you, these points might be sub divided to bring in other scriptures.
J.T. Well, we do too much of it. I shall probably be under fire myself this evening.
C.H.H. It used to be said that you could have four points, having a universal bearing on the subject.
J.T. Quite so, but the use of the numeral three is more frequent in Scripture.
Rem. In chapter 1 this morning you referred to "the tribulation and kingdom and patience", all three under one head; then the numeral three is emphasised again in these closing verses of the first chapter; and you connected it also with @Exodus 21: 5, "I love my master, my wife, and my children". You have the order of one, two, three, there too. I was wondering whether that in itself does not cover the whole divine scheme.
J.T. Very likely, because things emanate from God, really from the Trinity, we might say. There is
{59}
much more in the Scriptures than we think in that respect, the voice of God being heard, not always spoken in words, but very often implied.
R.H. The Lord refers to the law of Moses, the prophets and the Psalms.
J.T. He spoke of only two divisions, you remember, when He talked with the two disciples on the way to Emmaus; He brought up just the law of Moses and the prophets. But when He is speaking in the assembly He adds the Psalms, the completion of the divine way in the Scriptures.
W.F.K. Are these first three churches past history?
J.T. Yes. The four others, the second division of the seven referred to, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea run concurrently and exist today. But first it is a question of Ephesus, then Smyrna and then Pergamos. In Ephesus what is stressed is the fall. She fell; not absolutely, as Satan fell or as Babylon falls; the word 'fallen' does not imply that it is absolute, that there is not some hope of recovery. It is relative: "Remember therefore whence thou art fallen", that is, Remember the extent of the fall; that is what is stressed in the word to Ephesus. And the Lord says, "but if not", if you do not remember that and do the first works and repent, "I am coming to thee, and I will remove thy lamp out of its place, except thou shalt repent". Then He adds, "But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate". The Lord brings that in as reducing somewhat what He had against her. So the position is that there is hope of Ephesus, not for a complete recovery, but there is hope on the ground of repentance and doing the first works; otherwise the fight, the candlestick, is to be removed, that is, she is to cease even having the commission to shine. She is not regarded as any more usable for shining. This would happen unless she repents.
{60}
W.F.K. Is love the only thing for us today, love among the brethren? I was thinking of @1 Corinthians 13 and that Ephesus had fallen from love.
J.T. Yes, the first love. You can hardly say that she had left love altogether, but she had left her first love, which was the greatest. The idea of grade is very important in Scripture, and she has left the highest grade here, first love.
W.F.K. Is that love for the Lord as well as for the brethren?
J.T. It is love for Christ by the assembly. It is collective love responding to His love. It is really the greatest presentation of love in the sense of what is indicated here.
C.H.H. Would there be any indication of this in the fall of the young man at Troas? There is no suggestion that he had love but there is restoration from the fall.
J.T. There is the suggestion I think, but of course the thing was yet in prospect; it had not yet happened. That chapter does not say it had happened at all, because it is a great love chapter. It begins with love, love is in the middle of it and it ends with love, how the elders fell upon the neck of the apostle and kissed him. Nevertheless the apostle is indicating the possibility of it, as he tells the elders, but there is no sign that it had yet happened. If the danger or the reason of it was immediate, as suggested in Eutychus, well, it is curable, it is remediable, because the boy is alive and is taken away by the saints; they have not lost. They are better off I would say.
H.H. Do you connect that incident with church recovery as under Paul?
J.T. I would think so. I think that is what is suggested and it is complete so far as it goes. It is a successful action because Paul went down; it is the love in him that is stressed. Paul's position is in mind, how far he was ready to go: if a young person
{61}
is tripped up and falls, he is ready to go that distance. As the Lord goes after two, Paul is ready to go after one, to go down from the third floor and enfold him in his arms. And he is able to say, not as Elijah said of the child whom he restored, that the life had gone out of him, but that "his life is in him", showing that he was in some sense in christianity. Life was there, the condition was remediable, and in fact was restored. The boy is said to have been taken away; he is worthwhile, "They brought away the boy alive, and were no little comforted", @Acts 20: 12. It is all in connection with the Lord's supper.
F.K.C. Do you think the effect would be to turn their minds to Paul's teaching, especially to the words he said when he called the elders over to Miletus?
J.T. They were affected by the fact that they should see his face no more, you mean? Quite so. The chapter is devoted to active affection in the saints, especially in Paul himself, the peculiar kind of affection he had and how he himself was the object of affection.
R.W.S. Paul says in writing to Timothy, "Even as I begged thee to remain in Ephesus, when I was going to Macedonia, that thou mightest enjoin some not to teach other doctrines", @1 Timothy 1: 3. I was wondering whether he was living when this epistle reached the assembly at Ephesus. He was to enjoin some not to teach wrong doctrine.
J.T. Just so; he was left there to set things in order, so that there would be a perfecting of the work through him, which is remarkable. Order is the thought. Paul left him there to attend to that.
A.A.T. In speaking to Ephesus the Lord says many good things about them before He speaks of what He has against them. Is there a principle in that?
J.T. Quite so; that is very evident. Say all the good things you can. See what Paul said of the
{62}
Corinthians, "Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men", @2 Corinthians 3: 2. What was it that was "known and read of all men"? It was the good things that Paul was saying about them. He says, You are my letter; when I am among the saints I delight to talk about you Corinthians, because you are my letter. So they were. Who, that knew Corinth, could question his apostolic commission? That is what he means. "Examine your own selves if ye be in the faith", he says (@2 Corinthians 13: 5), so that his apostleship is attested in them. If I do not speak well of the saints my ministry is questionable; not what I am saying but what I am personally. I am not entitled to minister unless I can speak well of the saints.
E.I.E. The Spirit of God seems to stress the idea of repentance in every instance here.
J.T. Quite so; christianity is therefore the basis of much joy in heaven. The question arises how much repentance there is. Every one of us is to repent; surely none of us but would say, That is true, I have to learn to repent and to cause joy in heaven. There is one of whom the Lord says, "She will not repent", @Revelation 2:21. Her will is in it! That is a terrible thing: if one is not repentant when there is a cause for it. The Lord has to say of Jezebel, "She will not repent". But here it is, "Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to thee, and I will remove thy lamp out of its place, except thou shalt repent". He repeats the need for repentance. Then He adds the word, "Thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitanes". It is "works" here, not the doctrine, that had not come in yet, the destructive doctrine of Rome, the great feature of Babylon. They had not begun to promulgate their doctrine yet, showing that the Nicolaitanes may have works among the brethren even without the statement of doctrine. The doctrine
{63}
appears in the third church; they had it and that is really where the evil is entrenched. If you have the doctrine of an evil, if it has turned into doctrine, then it is positive wickedness.
A.A.T. Is it clericalism?
J.T. Well, that sort of thing, and it is legalised by doctrine. That is what has built up christendom. They had not the doctrine at Ephesus and they hated the works, showing that they were in a comparatively good state, and that explains these things we are saying of them. But when we come to Pergamos it is said, "So thou also hast those who hold the doctrine of Nicolaitanes in like manner".
Now in verse 8 we come to the second assembly, that is, Smyrna. We can look only at the main features of it and how they may be brought into our own times. This is an assembly affected by tribulation, and in our own times, at this very moment, certain conditions of tribulation which God has manifestly ordered have arisen on certain saints. It is no accident; it is to bring out what there is of the work of God. What has been transpiring in the last four or five years is to test out the work of God in His people, especially in certain parts of the earth. How much can you stand? What is needed? Why is it needed? So it says, "I know thy tribulation and thy poverty; but thou art rich; and the railing of those who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but a synagogue of Satan. Fear nothing of what thou art about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life" (verses 9, 10). It seems to me that God in His governmental ways with us in our own times has allowed this to come about. It is speaking here of ten persecutions and how the devil directly was ordering these persecutions; but what we are dealing with today is
{64}
actually what God has permitted, and we may say, ordered. Certain conditions have arisen in certain sections of the earth where there are more of His people than in any other section of the same size, and it is not simply that they are persecuted in a spiritual sense but they are suffering physically to bring out what the work of God in them is capable of. It is to show the extent of His work, and to purify the saints and make them fit for more testimony. I believe that is the present moment.
W.W.M. Is that the meaning of the words, "That ye may be tried"?
J.T. That is the divine thought. Satan is the instrument. Notice the word 'Satan' in verse 9 is changed to "devil" in verse 10. There it is, "Fear nothing of what thou art about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life". "That ye may be tried" is in the government of God. The devil is working as if he would overpower the brethren; I believe that is his aim. He would just overpower the brethren with trial, but they have not been overpowered, and that is the triumph, the work of God triumphing in such circumstances. It is the direct aim of the devil to crush the saints by the terrible physical attacks that have been made.
C.H.H. What a testimony to the triumph of the work of God we have in Daniel! How Satan worked so that he should be cast into the lions¬ den! Yet that act became a testimony, as also with the three in the fiery furnace.
J.T. Daniel brings out clearly what the work of God is capable of standing in the most distressing and trying circumstances.
W.W.M. Do the ten days give us encouragement in seeing that there is to be an end to the trial?
{65}
J.T. Just so; it is only for a certain number of days. Satan has not a free hand and he has not a very long time in which to act. Still, God may use him and does use him though his own furious attitude against the saints comes out. He says, as it were, If all these bombings keep on they will be overwhelmed; but they are not overwhelmed. It is a question of God and His work in His people.
H.B. Why should all this apply to an assembly for which the Lord does not seem to have any reproach?
J.T. It is a remarkable thing that the present extraordinary effort of the devil should take place. In truth a wonderful thing is happening to the people of God before our eyes. But nevertheless they meet together to worship God and to carry on His service in a general way. The trial goes on and on, and yet they are there, and they go on with the service of God.
I think it is a wonderful triumph. But to God be all the praise! Without Him who could stand?
R.W.S. You spoke of a further testimony as a result of this purging. Just what have you in mind?
J.T. The Lord may do something, something in the way of freshness perhaps, bringing about freshness and a little more light and clarity; but above all a little more love for God and for Christ and for one another. Satan is the adversary. "The devil" is accuser-he is called "the accuser of our brethren", @Revelation 12: 10.
H.H. It is important that God orders things, He does not just allow them, and He uses Satan (@1 Corinthians 5: 5).
J.T. That is very solemn indeed, and yet it is limited. Yet we often quote, "If those days had not been cut short, no flesh had been saved; but on account of the elect those days shall be cut short".
R.W.S. Is the testimony more in your mind than the rapture?
{66}
J.T. Yes, I would think that the amount of youth coming along, the number of persons, young brothers and young sisters too, would mean that another generation is in view and the Lord will be in it.
J.L.P. He will utilise those who have been faithful in these conditions in our day.
J.T. Yes; it is to bring out the work of God in its moral features; including what the saints are developing in the way of loyalty to Christ and care for one another.
Ques. Would Habakkuk fit in? God would make him to walk upon his high places.
J.T. Yes. He would continue on although certain things should happen that were adverse (@Habakkuk 3: 17 - 19).
R.H. Would "the crown of life" answer to Samson's hair growing again at the end?
J.T. You mean his hair beginning to grow: it was not a matter of grey hairs. Grey hairs would be a sign of old age, but hair beginning to grow would be an evidence of life. White hair is a guide in determining the beginning of leprosy, it is a sign of decline in life. But the recovery of Samson's hair-whatever his age, he would not have been very old when he died -- would look like the suggestion of life.
C.H.H. Would you say that God does not test His work until it is established that the work is there? In Abraham's case it was not until he had recovered from denying his wife that it says God would prove him.
J.T. I think that is good. It comes out in God's way with His people Israel. He did not lead them in the way of the Philistines because they had not known war and He would not have them exposed to it at first. I think that is very touching! God is considerate of us; He does not allow us to be tempted beyond our capability.
{67}
S.J.H. Does the fact that the Lord is causing the breaking of bread to continue even in Europe and the occupied countries lead you to expect to see results in this way?
J.T. I am sure all that is very encouraging. We do receive some letters from northern Europe, Switzer land and Italy. It is remarkable how the brethren go on. I am sure that is what God is aiming at, that at the end there will be something answering to the beginning, able to go on even in suffering.
Rem. The ministry of verse 8 seems suggestive, "These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived". That would be something special for the brethren at Smyrna. I suppose that idea would enter into our services too, the ability to touch a note that would apply to the particular need of the brethren at the moment. Then one notices that to every one of these assemblies we have the word, "Write". That service is still open, to minister to the brethren by writing, bringing in Christ in that way.
C.H.H. Though historically these three churches have passed away, yet the divine principles involved would still remain good for us.
J.T. Quite so; none of such things are just for a moment. It involves the matter of contributions, the collections among the brethren for the saints. Sometimes it is said the "special" one mentioned in a Corinthians was for a special occasion, whereas the principle governing that special occasion applies to special collections under any circumstances. It is a question of love working out and that cannot be limited at all. In fact these letters contemplate not only what is local either in time or place, but what is universal both in time and in place, that the principles that refer to Ephesus, for instance, can be applied universally wherever you have like circumstances. So if it is a matter of persecution, as we have here in Smyrna, we can transfer that thought to today. There
{68}
are ten days of persecution, and the Spirit of God enables us to face them. It may be more physical than religious, but nevertheless it is Satan's work and it is his effort to overwhelm the brethren. But God is saying, I have ordered this to bring out what the brethren are capable of. It is His own work and so we do not say, 'What has the devil wrought', but "What hath God wrought!". It is what He is doing to overcome what the devil is doing.
A.A.T. So do we give support financially?
J.T. Quite so; it is to aid what God is doing.
J.L.P. I understand that these expressions that come in earlier in this book, "the word of God" and "the testimony of Jesus", relate to John's commission. Are they two governing features that run right through the seven assemblies?
J.T. Just so, I am sure that is right; even the use of the seven assemblies of Asia is for convenience sake, to bring out other things, not simply to confine what is said to the province of Asia Minor. It is to govern the whole dispensation from that time onwards. "The scope of no prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation", @2 Peter 1: 20.
R.D.G. Is the expression, "The synagogue of Satan", a suggestion that the opposition is combined, something organised? It is not something incidental.
J.T. I would say that. Organised opposition is the most potent; therefore a well-known religion, so prevalent in this very province, is organised first, last, and all the time. It is the very acme of organisation, probably sixteen centuries old. There is nothing else like it at all.
C.H.H. Is that what is spoken of in Ephesians as "systematized error"?
J.T. That is just what it is. The assembly at Ephesus would know that.
R.W.S. Is the synagogue a local thought as over against the assembly?
{69}
J.T. It would be, I think, to stress the idea of religion. It is a local thought but universal in its bearing. Of course Rome talks about the universal holy Catholic church, but it is not that, it is a local idea spread abroad. The Vatican is an organisation locally but its tentacles are gone abroad; it governs the Catholic system.
Ques. What about the next church, Pergamos, "where the throne of Satan is", and "where Satan dwells"? And then the next one, Thyatira, which speaks of "the depths of Satan"?
J.T. It is remarkable the way Satan is brought into these churches; the depths are in Thyatira, but the throne and the dwelling place are in Pergamos. Both of them refer to what was just mentioned, that it is a local idea only become universal. It cannot in itself, in its essential position, become universal, because the essential thing is in a locality; otherwise the Pope might live in Montreal or New York. There is something in the local idea: his throne and dwelling place are in Pergamos. That is what the Lord refers to as to the saints there, that they are peculiarly exposed. "I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan is; and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness was, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells" (verse 13). It is a local position but became spread out and out on the principle of organisation, but not to strengthen the outer edges but the centre. It is a matter of the centre and circumference. The circumference may be weak in some cases, very weak, but the centre is always kept strong; that is the point: keep it strong. Hence the last great effort was to strengthen the central position by according infallibility to the Pope under certain conditions.
C.H.H. Would that indicate progressive evil, against which Timothy is to be strong in the faith?
{70}
J.T. Just so; the progressive iniquity begins, that is, the mystery of iniquity. I believe it can be traced in these letters. We are to understand mysteries, but we are not to dig into the depths of Satan; we are not capable of that; besides, there is danger in it. We know it is there and can name things without prying into them. The Colossians were in danger of entering into things they had not seen in the worship of angels; things that are beyond us. The devil works on these lines and we are to keep out of it, but at the same time we are to name things, even if evil; and in a certain way we can know them afar off.
Rem. Isaiah helps when he says, "Ye shall not say, Conspiracy, of everything of which this people saith, Conspiracy; and fear ye not their fear, and be not in dread", @Isaiah 8: 12.
J.T. Just so.
C.H.H. Would @Ephesians 6 help us to contend against these powers of darkness?
J.T. "Against the universal lords of this darkness"; it is a spiritual matter. The devil is not concerned about mere local positions; he is aiming at the whole world. He is the god of this world, and he is the prince of it too. He is not concerned about leading men as such, he is concerned about himself, but he would support certain things and persons. He supports the beast, for instance. The dragon is the devil; he is only using other creatures for his own ends, nothing else.
W.W.M. Would it be necessary to be an overcomer at Ephesus in order to become an overcomer in Smyrna? In other words, is it requisite to return to first love in order to stand in Smyrna against the terrible onslaughts of Satan?
J.T. I think it is cumulative; that is, the overcomer in Ephesus ought to be able to go through. The same principles ought to go through in all the overcomers, only different features arise; but I would
{71}
say the overcomer in Ephesus would be equal to any combination of the devil.
H.H. Does Pergamos represent the idea of worldliness instead of tribulation?
J.T. Clearly; so we have the thought of Satan's throne and Satan's dwelling, and of the saints there too. They are in that position. Well now, what will the devil do if the saints are there? One of them is out-and-out, he is Antipas. He is thoroughly against the thing that the devil is working in and he is killed. He is not a young man, you may be sure. I mean that the devil cannot overcome him by worldliness. John says to the young men, "Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him", @1 John 2: 15. So the devil would endeavour to overcome young people by the world. He is the god and prince of it and he has the means if he dwells there and his throne is there. He has all the means to bring in pleasures, plenty of arenas and plenty of things to keep young people going. He would aim to draw the young into the cinemas and theatres. He aims at that, he has the means of doing it in the various sources of pleasure in the world, as indeed the prodigal experienced. If possible the devil will overcome our youth by the world. He wants them; he does not want them to be slain but he wants them under the influence of the world. But Antipas, he did not want him! Antipas is against the father. Who is the father? Well, it is a fatherly system of wickedness and that thing has come into the locality, the idea of the father; and because Antipas is against it they put him to death. So the Lord says in regard to that: "Thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith". Notice that: My name and My faith. "Even in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness was, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells". Satan would not tolerate an Antipas. Satan represents the father, the
{72}
father of the system, and if there is anyone against him, as Antipas was, he must die! That is the devil's way: he will either corrupt us or destroy us. So the Lord is speaking here of Antipas as being out-and-out, representing what He is looking for.
C.H.H. You mean he was against the devil in the sense of father?
J.T. Yes, whatever he would be in a fatherly sense.
C.H.H. I was thinking of Barabbas; is that the same thing?
J.T. Quite so.
R.H. Why does it say, "Slain among you"? Has it any connection with the Lamb in chapter S?
J.T. "Slain among you", I should think it is a reflection on them. Why should he be there? It looks as if they were under those circumstances themselves. "Slain among you, where Satan dwells"; it is a suspicious combination of words, "Among you", and "Where Satan dwells".
M.W.A. It speaks of those "who hold the doctrine of Nicolaitanes"; do you think that would stand in contrast to "Antipas my faithful witness"?
J.T. Quite so, and "the doctrine of Balaam", these two go together. What Balaam would bring in would be out-and-out worldliness, of the worst kind. "Who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel, to eat of idol sacrifices and commit fornication". That is out-and-out wickedness. It is the doctrine, not simply that the thing is there. It was there at Corinth but it was not taught as a doctrine; here it is taught as a doctrine. Then the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes would be the clerical system as doctrinising and allowing these things as running along with the doctrine of Balaam.
W.W.W. Would 2 Timothy be the outlet from this? "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity" (chapter 2: 19).
{73}
J.T. It would be, because the Lord speaks here of the sword He had, that it was the sword of His mouth (verse 16). It is not simply what was written but what had been said against the evil. It is the word of God spoken in the mouth, ministry, not simply writing but in the mouth; and that is what He would use: faithful men like Antipas to speak to people. Antipas had stood as a faithful witness.
C.H.H. Would you say that people who hold bad doctrine will ultimately teach it? Do you not think when people seek fellowship amongst us they should be challenged as to certain things: for instance, household baptism and sonship? I have known people seeking the fellowship who do not hold the truth as to household baptism. Do you think it should be a test of the fellowship to challenge people as to what they hold?
J.T. I am sure that is right. If we find one who refuses household baptism it is very questionable if he is in fellowship. If he is 'in' formally you would allow him to be there as in it; but the truth of that matter has been clear for years and years and has been followed generally by the brethren. How could you regard anyone refusing it as suitable for fellowship? But the word, "With the sword of my mouth" is very important. Let us have the thing clear ourselves by our mouths; the things we speak of. That is what is spoken, that is the sure antidote to all this that is described in verses 12 to 16.
R.W.S. It speaks in verse 12 of the "two-edged sword". Would the minister use that on himself first? He will examine himself.
R.H. Would this work out in a ministry meeting?
J.T. I think that is right. The Lord is helping us on these lines. Since ministry meetings became customary, God has used them to call attention to current things that are wrong, bringing in the positive truth to correct what is not right.
{74}
C.H.H. Would not these addresses to the churches be a true indication of what the prophetic subject is? "The spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus", @Revelation 19: 10. It is what Jesus has to say to conditions that are abnormal.
J.T. It is really illustrative of ministry meetings. The Lord is blessing them in the meetings.
J.L.P. The Lord constantly says here, "I know". Following up our brother's remark, what we know would help us in ministering a word to the saints.
J.T. Just so.
R.D.G. Is there any significance in the fact that Balaam's activities in the Old Testament are made so clear in this scripture? We do not get so definitely there that he was as evil as the New Testament points him out to be.
J.T. It shows that the New Testament is essential to the right understanding of the Old. But they slew Balaam. He was found in the last battle with the Midianites; he was slain, showing he had links with them. The New Testament explains it; that he taught them what to do. The Old Testament tells us what they did, the outcome of his doctrine, and also that he was slain in the battle.
R.H. Do you make a difference between going on with a man who is not fully with us on every point and receiving one into fellowship in the same position?
J.T. I do. If we receive such an one we are allowing in through the gates someone we know is not right and that is not commendable. If he is already inside the gates, that is another matter. Then we have to be sure as to what he holds, whether it is a root condition or a leprous condition in him. That would all have to come up. Certainly if the thing is there at all before he is inside it will never do to let him in, because the wrong doctrine he holds is coming through the gates. No gate-keepers who are gate
{75}
keepers according to the figure in this book of Revelation will let a man in unless he is in accord with what is inside. He could not eat of the tree of life unless he has washed his robes, and that applies to what he holds in doctrine.
{76}
THE ASSEMBLY AS SEEN IN THE REVELATION (3)
@Revelation 3: 1 - 22
J.T. The address to the assembly at Thyatira must be included in what comes before us at this time, beginning with verse 18 of chapter 2. That address was read yesterday afternoon but not touched in our remarks, so that we have four assemblies to consider now. We shall have to be more or less brief in our remarks so that all may be covered. The assemblies especially before us now are Thyatira and Philadelphia. The errors in Thyatira may be counteracted by the virtues indicated in Philadelphia, for the two assemblies run together; they are prophetically contemporary. There is a peculiar kind of responsibility attached to angels in Thyatira, as indicated in what is said to the angel there. The Lord says, "But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and leads astray my servants", @Revelation 2: 20. The brethren no doubt have noticed that the word 'woman' may be translated 'wife', so that we are reminded of a household situation in Thyatira, in which there is the wife and the one who is responsible in regard of her. Her conduct is terrible, but still it is a household situation that is in mind. It shows what christendom has become, a sort of administration contemplating a household, and the responsible element, that is, the angel, is neglectful. The Lord says, "Thou permittest the woman Jezebel", as if her husband were ignoring the officious conduct of his wife. He knew it, he was there and responsible, but he failed to check it, to have it corrected. He permitted it, the allusion being, as the teaching shows, to the situation in the reign of Ahab in which Elijah ministered. It was a
{77}
situation marked by conduct which was dreadful, Jezebel being the wife of the king who was responsible and who, to some extent, was amenable to reproof; indeed at one time he humbled himself and God owned it, but still negatively, and he went on to ruin, showing that where there is a neglect of household responsibility and restraint the end is sure to be ruinous.
C.H.H. It says in Kings that she urged Ahab on to sin. I was wondering whether she would be in contrast to Abigail, the true wife you might say. Does this woman really develop into Babylon?
J.T. That is what the teaching of the book brings out. She is seen more in a political relation later, that is, in chapters 16, 17 and 18, especially in 17, where she rides the beast. Then she is spoken of as saying in her heart that she sits a queen, not a wife, but a queen (chapter 18:7). Of course the queen Jezebel was a wife, but what is said is that she said in her heart, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow; and I shall in no wise see grief". Here it is the household position, hardly a kingdom position, but the household.
H.H. What do you mean as to the household?
J.T. A husband and wife and the children: they are all alluded to. Then there are those in the setting, the religious position, that are responsible as Ahab was. They are responsible for the house. It is not as the wife is responsible in Proverbs, one who is viewed as faithful, her husband being known in the gates. Jezebel is over against this; her husband is simply unable to deal with the situation, and this person or wife pursues her wicked ways unhindered.
Ques. Would John's second epistle indicate the right conditions prevailing in the elect lady and her children? She is found walking in the truth.
J.T. I think that is good; she is called the "elect lady", and she was faithful over against this wicked person. Peter has a similar expression: "She that
{78}
is elected with you in Babylon salutes you", @1 Peter 5: 13. The allusion would be either to his wife or to an assembly there, but in either case it is a matter of the husband's sense of responsibility.
R.W.S. Is the believer's household like an antechamber to the assembly? If Satan can secure something in the household he is attacking God's assembly.
J.T. I am sure that is the truth. Satan attacks our houses. He attacks the local assemblies, too, and the leaders, the brethren or elders who are responsible. The masculine side would be in the leaders, those who attend the care meetings or wherever rule is maintained. @1 Timothy 5 helps on this line, and indeed the whole teaching of Timothy helps as to how rule is maintained and how it bears on the assembly. So that as the sisters grow older they are not to be put on the list until they are sixty, showing that the assembly is not to be damaged in any way by persons for whom it cares financially. It shows too that youth is not an asset; it is a liability really. Younger women are enjoined to marry so that there should be children to be brought up for the Lord. Children are a sort of check in households, a sort of balance, a responsibility that helps to balance the position.
A.A.T. You were calling attention to the Nicolaitanes and the difference between their works and their doctrine. I notice here that Jezebel teaches; that would take in doctrine.
J.T. It is well to bring that up. It is said, "She teaches and leads astray my servants"; and then we are told in verse 24, "But to you I say, the rest" (that is, the remnant) "who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine ...". The allusion is to what she teaches, so that we have to watch the feminine power rising, attempting to teach in the profession and acquiring pre-eminence above the masculine feature. That is what has developed in Rome, because this paragraph in chapter 2 is early in the history of
{79}
the assembly. The later chapters deal with later conditions, more political conditions, but this is somewhat earlier in the history when she took root, not as a queen, but as a wife. She took root and acquired power and corrupted; she became the great corruptress of the earth.
W.F.K. She calls herself a prophetess. That is a false position, is it not?
J.T. Quite so; that is what the system we are alluding to does.
W.F.K. Jezebel had false prophets and maintained them.
J.T. She slew the prophets of the Lord. The following queen, Athaliah, would have slain and did slay the seed royal as far as she could; that is to say, the royalty of Christ and the prophetic ministry of Christ. These two women represent Satan's instruments to overcome by evil.
A.B. "She ... leads astray my servants", that is on the masculine side. The note says, 'bondmen'. They were led astray.
J.T. Quite so. It shows it was at an early stage of the history of the assembly, but that the system had already taken effect, and in a very subtle and powerful way that the masculine had failed to restrain. The corruption was allowed to go on.
A.B. Was that seen in Jezebel's writing a letter in the king's name and using his seal on it, taking the matter entirely out of Ahab's hand?
J.T. Just so, that helps. He was weak in all that. What develops in that section of z Kings is that God had great regard for royalty at the moment. Bad as Ahab was, the prophet had already come and spoken to him, and God says to him, You are going to lead Israel. And he did lead Israel and led victoriously, so that there is no excuse for him. He is man enough on those lines, man enough to make war, but not man enough on household lines to correct his wife and
{80}
children. So that here in Revelation Jezebel in the character of a wife becomes the great corruptress; and in later chapters branches out in a queenly way, a more royal way, you may say, bringing down the wrath of heaven. There is more exultation over her overthrow than over anything else in the book.
H.H. What you are saying is an important word for the home circle now.
J.T. The devil gets in in that way. He gets in with the fashions of the world and its pleasures, and the lack of restraint from the masculine side is what he is counting on. His ideas are positively operating in the feminine side, in the mothers and the sisters.
C.H.H. The prophet Ezekiel complained in chapter 43: 8 that there was only a wall between the houses of the kings and the temple, and that they were corrupting God's house by what was going on in their houses.
J.T. There is a great deal made in Ezekiel of Jehovah's love for Israel. That is, for Jerusalem really, because Jerusalem is taken up in the time of David. How God regarded her! what she was like when He found her, and how she developed in beauty and then failed Him utterly.
R.W.S. In the promise to the rest: "To you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden", who are "they" in the words, "they say"?
J.T. That is Rome, I would think. Rome would aver that the real ones were influenced by the devil; that is what I think is meant. The speakers were the enemy's instruments: "As many as .. have not known the depths of Satan, as they say". It is the kind of language that the professional people would use as to any work of God, because the time had come for the real separation. The remnant had begun to take form, and the enemy, through the leaders in
{81}
Rome, would attribute to them what really was attributable to the official class, the Jezebel class. That class began at Pergamos where Antipas was slain; it is on the lines of which we are speaking now. The opposition to what was of God was there. The remnant is not spoken of there; it is spoken of first in Thyatira, and the enemy is given to know that God is moving.
A.B. Is that like the great cry of heresy that Rome raised?
J.T. The word 'heresy' became emblazoned in their vocabulary, whereas Paul was the one who introduced it. Throughout the history it is applied to the real people of God and of course at the time of the Reformation it became a very far-flung thought. Heresy against the truth was charged against the christians, whereas in truth the heresy was in the public and leading class.
H.H. Would the attack be made on the overcomer by this class?
J.T. Just so. And therefore you would need to be an overcomer in view of this in order to make room for the Spirit. So the word is, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". The word to the assemblies comes in after that to the overcomer, so that no one will hear the Spirit's word unless he overcomes these things, these conditions.
F.K.C. In relation to, "her children will I kill with death"-is that a kind of doctrinal thing, such as the doctrine of transubstantiation and the worship of images, which Satan has introduced?
J.T. Just so. Possibly the Eastern elements are in mind and had something to do with the dead condition that ensued; but it spread over the whole of christendom and her children. The Lord says, I will kill them "with death". It would be moral death, not literal death. Satan would kill the saints in Smyrna with literal death, but now the Lord takes that weapon
{82}
over and uses it against the children of Jezebel. That is, they die morally; the doctrine is so deadly that they cease to have any life at all. Let anyone travel through Europe, southern Europe particularly, and he will be impressed with the deadness that there is.
A.A.T. I think you would be impressed with it in Montreal.
J.T. Well, there is probably more virus here; they are in touch more with Protestantism here, as in Ireland. The thing is kept going. But where you have masses of people without any opposition, without anything but the sort of thing that Jezebel has, there is lust deadness. And of course Rome flourishes in that darkness.
E.A.L. How far would you go in placing the responsibility of these false doctrines? Would you link them entirely with clericalism?
J.T. These elements that flourish in Thyatira are seen in the previous church: the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes and the doctrine of Balaam are there, and now we have Jezebel's doctrine: "She who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and leads astray my servants to commit fornication and eat of idol sacrifices". This has to be taken as pure out-and-out worldliness, shameful conduct. "And I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent of her fornication". Then follows the statement of the legal judicial action: "Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and her children will I kill with death; and all the assemblies shall know ...". It had not happened yet at this writing; the teaching was current but the penalty had not yet been enforced. It has been since.
Ques. What is the thought of the bed?
J.T. Well, it is the close association with evil, idolatry brought in, heathen practices brought in;
{83}
not only judaism, but heathendom taken on and practised.
-.M. What is the thought in "I will give to you each according to your works"?
J.T. It is to stress what He had against the main body, the whole body, as He said earlier: "I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel ...". Then comes, "I will give to you each according to your works"; that is, the Lord will deal with each one of them according to their works, to each one in the public body. Then verse 24 says, "But to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine"; this is where we get the real parting of the ways; the rest involves the remnant; the rest is over against the main body"who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come". So now the Lord is speaking to a class or a part of the whole body of believers, and He is marking them off as spoken to separately. He is marking them off as if He is leaving to the main body these words as to Jezebel, that "she will not repent", and what He will do to her and her children. It is true there is a word as to repentance, but it says, "She will not repent", so there is no hope at all for her. The book tells us later that she is to be destroyed root and branch, and the judgment will go on eternally, showing what heaven thinks about it, but the remnant is spoken of by itself, and the overcomer is put before the hearing of the Spirit, as if He is saying, I am not going to minister to the public body; I am going to minister to those who have overcome or who are in principle overcomers.
Ques. Did the parting of the ways take place in the Reformation?
J.T. It did historically; that is what happened.
C.H.H. Would you suggest that now there is no "rest", as referred to, in Thyatira?
{84}
J.T. No, unless you take the word Thyatira as a divisional word, as one of the seven divisions; in that case it involves the public body, which is yet responsible. But the Spirit of God has in mind that there is a system, and that the matter is settled in their case. In principle, the whole system is judged. It is only a matter of time till God will bring it up to remembrance for destruction.
F.C. Why does the Lord connect repentance at all with such a system?
J.T. It shows God's attitude; it is still the christian dispensation, and the Lord is true to that. That helps us, too, in our souls.
A.A.T. As to verse 21, "And I gave her time that she should repent", is there a principle in that that in connection with our handling of evil we should give time for repentance?
J.T. I think so; I think we ought to make the thing clear and then give time for repentance, because that gives time for the Spirit of God to operate. The dispensation may be said to be the dispensation of the Spirit, and that means that time must be given for Him to operate. But then, the Lord has said here authoritatively that she will not repent, so the system is doomed.
H.H. Is that not characteristic of persons who, so to say, secede from right fellowship, that you seldom hear of repentance? The thing goes on.
J.T. Usually when the system is connected with it, it becomes a systematised matter; there is judicial doom attached to it.
M.W.A. Does it suggest here that there is ministry that should bring about repentance when He says, "I gave her time that she should repent", ministry brought before them but not taken in and acted upon?
J.T. That usually goes with such circumstances. God never leaves Himself without a witness, and certainly there has been witness even up to the present
{85}
time. There has been testimony to this situation and the remnant is in mind, for the Lord has the remnant in mind. But this refusal to repent morally finishes the matter as far as the system is concerned; the general position is settled when the Lord says, "She will not repent". He continues, I will do so-and-so, and so-and-so, and when that begins to take place the matter is settled. But the idea of the remnant runs on, and we shall see it in Philadelphia.
R.H. What is the idea of "all the assemblies" in verse 23? "And all the assemblies shall know that I am he that searches the reins and the hearts".
J.T. I would take that to be just the general position of the profession. The Lord sees to it that the matter is closed. I suppose historically that came out at the Reformation; the whole general position became aware of what was current. Of course that period in church history is most interesting as to what the Spirit was doing, and what evidences there were of His work; also the principle of the whole becoming acquainted with the actual situation.
C.H.H. Would previous history enter into this matter of repentance, as in Esau's case? You were speaking in your address as to a certain fixity that would arise where one is already doomed.
J.T. That is true. It came about with the Amorites and with Esau. God did not say at the beginning that He hated Esau, He says it in Malachi, meaning that it was when the conduct of Esau became public. The time comes when God says, It is finished.
S.R.McC. God's dealings with Thyatira are to turn our eyes inward to see the kind of God we have, who searches the reins and the hearts.
J.T. "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". What the Spirit says is much wider than what the Lord says. What the Lord says is only the text of your address, but the address itself is much wider. Therefore it would mean
{86}
that in the address, in the full bearing of what He says, He searches the reins and hearts. The reins are the lower organs of the person; the heart is the upper and intelligent organ. The Lord does not deal with these any more simply in externals. That is what came out at the Reformation: the thoughts of many hearts were revealed. What a revelation there was of the state of christendom!
R.H. Why is it that the first feature of the remnant is connected with doctrine rather than with practice? "As many as have not this doctrine", it says.
J.T. It would be a question of whether they were really clear of the system. The Lord could hardly recognise them as a remnant unless they were clear of the system. People began to judge of it even down in Italy and in France; and in Bohemia too the Spirit of God raised exercises and they began to judge it. They judged the doctrine on which the system was built up.
C.DeB. Is this the first time the coming of the Lord is mentioned? In chapter 22 it says, "I come quickly". Is not this different?
J.T. Well, what it says in verse 25, "But what ye have hold fast till I shall come", is said to the remnant, not to the whole public system. It continues, "And he that overcomes"; as much as to say the Holy Spirit will keep on ministering, though on smaller lines, no doubt; but He will keep on ministering, and if He is doing that, then there must be overcomers. He is not going to keep on ministering to that system, He has dealt with it. So that He says, "And he that overcomes, and he that keeps unto the end my works, to him will I give authority over the nations, and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; as vessels of pottery are they broken in pieces, as I also have received from my Father; and I will give to him the morning star". That is the position. Then verse 29 shows that the ministry is going on but it is those
{87}
that are overcoming who will get the good of it. Hence there is the renewal of things, a change-over, the ministry continuing on, but on smaller lines. Nevertheless it is real, and in view, not of the past but of the future, the future kingdom when the Lord will come and rule the nations with a rod of iron. These devoted ones are under His eye and they will join Him and rule with Him. In the meantime they will get ministry. "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies"; not to one, but to all of them, so that the general position of the dispensation is maintained in the Spirit; for it is the dispensation of the Spirit.
W.F.K. The Roman system goes in for rule and authority, but here it is the overcomer that will rule and shepherd.
J.T. The overcomer has the light of that, that he is going to rule. Rome says she is still ruling, but in view of the continuance of the ministry, which is the last verse, I believe history shows that Rome set itself up in opposition to the Holy Spirit. Then the Bull of Infallibility was intended to check or overcome the actual ministry of the dispensation, which is that of the Spirit of God. We are coming under that at the present time.
Rem. She calls herself a prophetess.
J.T. She has done that. Of course, the Bull of Infallibility is the full expression of that. The Pope is said to be infallible under certain circumstances, a terrible thing. But we are finding out today, as the brethren have been doing for many years, that the dispensation of the Spirit still holds.
J.R.H. Is the searching of the reins and the hearts to fit us into the conditions of transparency found in the end of the book, as over against the secret side seen in the bed and the existence of holy orders and all that kind of thing?
{88}
J.T. Transparency is a word which applies to what we are saying; the system we are dealing with does not know it at all. They ignore it. It is darkness they maintain; they flourish in darkness. Our dispensation is a dispensation of light, but that means the dispensation of the Spirit. It is the day of the Spirit.
E.A.L. It is interesting to see the distinctions here. Jezebel calls herself a prophetess, a title for which she has no authority. Then the overcomer is on the masculine side. Is that right? There is no recognition of headship in her calling herself a prophetess.
J.T. She assumes that role of feminine rule; so that finally she becomes a queen. She moves over from the title of prophetess to become a queen: "I sit a queen, and am no widow". She has no felt need whether her husband be dead or alive. She is not a widow. It is a political position she has acquired, so that she is, as it were, self-contained. She came into very close quarters recently with destruction, because anyone can see how easily it could happen if God so ordered. She thinks she has a permanent tenure of life, but she has not.
Rem. "As I also have received from my Father". Is that not interesting as being the Lord's second mention in this book of the Father in relation to the assembly? There seems to be a suggestion of the way this system is set up, how the head of it receives this title, which is so foreign to it.
J.T. He is called 'Holy Father'. The Lord used that designation in addressing His Father. He refers to Him here: the overcomer "shall shepherd them with an iron rod; as vessels of pottery are they broken in pieces, as I also have received from my Father". That is the kingdom that He has received from His Father. We shall see more of it later; He will say to Laodicea that "he that overcomes, to him will I give to sit with me in my throne; as I also have
{89}
overcome, and have sat down with my Father in his throne". That is His present position, that He has sat down with His Father in His throne. But presently He is going to sit on His own throne, and He is telling the overcomer here that he is going to sit with Him on His throne, as He has received from His Father; that is to say, the Lord takes everything from His Father. He is going to have a throne of His own, and the overcomer will sit with Him there; so that all this is in prospect.
A.R.C. Why does the allusion to hearing the Spirit's voice precede that to the overcomer in the earlier assemblies, while in the latter ones you have the overcoming first and then the ear to hear?
J.T. It is to show that if you are in Rome and stay there you will not get the ministry of the Spirit; you have not an ear or you would not stay there. If you have an ear you will come out of it, you will be an overcomer and then you will hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. "Let him hear"; the responsibility still attaches to you, but you are to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. So we are on very wide ground, the dispensation of the Spirit.
W.W.W. Would the morning star bring us into the light of another day?
J.T. Quite so; it is another day coming in. We have to wait for that. It is a dark world around us, and no one can be conscious really of that coming day unless he sees that we are in darkness all around politically and religiously.
A.B. Would "the depths of God" be set over against "the depths of Satan"? An apprehension of them would have a great consolidating effect in our souls.
J.T. Quite so; the Spirit of God searches the depths of God and brings them into our souls.
{90}
A.B. Is the morning star connected with the principle of rule?
J.T. It refers to the coming day of glory. It is a gift-Christ Himself in this connection as said in chapter 22: 16.
C.H.H. Would the iron rod indicate the inflexibility of God's principles while on the other hand Thyatira has broken down all restraint?
J.T. Quite so; as applied to the nations it is inflexibility. In the coming day a sinner of a hundred years will be cut off, there is no hope; whereas today God is allowing things to go on because it is a dispensation of grace. So @Isaiah 26: 9 says that "when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness", that is, when they are shepherded with an iron rod. They are not learning it now.
C.H.H. Would you say that in the assembly there should be the recognition in a moral way of this iron rod, the maintaining of divine principles without any flexibility at all?
J.T. You need to be inflexible in order to use the rod. In our local positions today we have to learn to be patient, but in the millennium there will be the rule of Christ on His own throne. Of course Satan will be bound. It is the time in which God is setting out certain things, and He is going to take a long time to set them out, a thousand years. It will be a wonderful kingdom because it is the final issue, when God will show how He can control men in flesh and blood conditions. It has never been thus demonstrated in any dispensation. This is the dispensation of grace, and God is bearing with people, but He is not going to continue it indefinitely. He would say, as it were, I am going to have a time for Myself, one thousand years, in which I will show how principles can be set up by which men may be controlled. Then there will be no allowance of man's will; a sinner of
{91}
one hundred years will be cut off. But then it comes out when Satan is loosed that the flesh is still un changed. It had been held in check by the wonderful principles of Christ's kingdom. But the nations under Satan's leadership will come up on the breadth of the earth, and then fire comes down from heaven and destroys them all (@Revelation 20: 7 - 9).
H.H. The thought of recovery goes a long way in connection with what you have just been saying as to the millennium. I suppose you would allow that it is not new creation, but the recovery of things for God on earth under the rule of Christ.
J.T. It is recovery, not on the principle of new creation but on the principle of the old. The new principles that God will set up in that day will control sin, even although it be there; for it is there and will show itself when Satan is let loose. But during the millennium it is held in check. I think it is a great test, a great final exhibition of what God can do, an answer, as it were, to the suggestion that God cannot control man in the flesh. He can do it, He has means of doing it, and those means will be in the hands of Christ. But the matter will be terminated according to chapter 20; the nations will go up on the breadth of the earth, as if Satan acquires a free hand with no longer any international restrictions; as if he can interfere with any territory. God allows that, but only that he might come to his utter ruin and all that are with him.
W.W.W. Is it not a great victory that God has at the present moment those who are governed by divine principles before Satan is chained?
J.T. Quite; divine principles are being maintained in the assembly. It is the same thing now in the assembly as it will be in the millennium; it is a very great matter. We should see to it in our care meetings, in eldership, that things are searched out and dealt with according to these principles. It was
{92}
in accordance with this that the man in Corinth was handed over to Satan; the power of God did it: "I ... have already judged ... (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this: to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan". It will be the same thing in the millennium only in a more public and extended way.
But to go on, we cannot spend much time on Sardis, which is just Protestantism. There is not much in it, the Lord does not indicate anything much in that period. Nevertheless He has the seven Spirits of God, meaning that He has the same power as before; the seven Spirits allude to that. And He has the seven stars. It does not say He holds them but He has them. "I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. Be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain, which are about to die, for I have not found thy works complete before my God". So that there is nothing there, you might say, nothing that we can rest in. They are dead or about to die, but still He goes on at the end and says, "I will come upon thee as a thief". It is a distressing thing and ought to arouse anxiety that He will come as a thief. And then it says, "But thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy". So that there is not much to say. I suppose historically it would be the Reformation and what followed in the servants the Lord used before the idea of the assembly was thoroughly revived and began to function.
R.H. Why is the thought of watching stressed in Sardis?
J.T. I suppose the Lord would have whatever there is in that period kept alive by watchfulness. There were individuals. There is hardly anything you can speak of as the assembly, so that there is not
{93}
much in the account to rest in; still there were a few, which in itself has a peculiar voice: "a few names in Sardis".
H.H. I was noticing the footnote to verse 2: it reads, instead of "Be watchful", 'Become so'.
R.W.S. We have a few hymns from those few names.
J.T. We have a good many. One has noticed of late the number of hymns that we have from that period, though since the revival by the Spirit of the truth of the assembly one would not take on any hymns that disregard it. You will not find any such taken on after the Bethesda matter arose, after the truth of the assembly came out and was refused in Bethesda. We have some hymns by brethren that were with Bethesda, but written before they went there. I do not think any were accepted, or should be, from such authorship, or from any who remain outwardly in Thyatira. We have a great many from previous centuries and from the last century, up until about 1830, before the truth of the assembly came out; we have had none since from sources not in the truth, nor shall we have any more.
S.R.McC. Would you bring that exercise into the household: not to have hymn books in the house other than those in keeping with the truth?
J.T. It is a household matter in the true sense, that is, in the sense in which the Holy Spirit has part in it.
S.R.McC. I was thinking of such hymns as Moody's and Sankey's.
J.T. Well, of course, Moody and Sankey brought forward many of those earlier hymns of which we were speaking, but none of our own that I know of, because they came in after the truth was revived. But those who wrote hymns that were right, we will say, before that, were accepted, such as Charles Wesley's and others like them. What I am saying is,
{94}
I think, right, and the Lord's hand was over it too. These extraneous hymns will never be permitted if the Lord has His way.
W.W.W. Those hymns that we have from past centuries were written in the light that existed at that time.
J.T. The authors wrote simply in the light they had, but things changed after the Spirit began to function in the assembly. A person's product now must be tested by whether the Spirit of God has had His way with the author.
J.S. Do you think that those not walking in the truth could write hymns suitable for the assembly?
J.T. I do not think they could. They might write them verbally, but I do not think they would be in keeping with the idea of this dispensation. It is the dispensation of the Spirit. Of course it is the Lord's dispensation, but it is the dispensation of the Spirit and the dispensation of grace.
H.H. We have hymns in our book written by brethren who at one time walked with us but do not now.
J.T. Some by Tregelles are very good; he was with us when he wrote those hymns, but he did not remain with us. Many earlier hymns that were verbally right are being used.
Rem. Those words of a hymn in our previous book: 'Thy death has brought to light the Father's heart' sound very plausible, but they are not in line with the truth as taught by the Holy Spirit.
J.T. That was written by James Boyd, a brother in fellowship when he wrote it. The hymn would have been accepted but for that very line.
C.H.H. What about literature written by people who are not walking in the truth, children's books and the like?
J.T. I do not think they should be taken on at all. We have to bear in mind the honour due to the Spirit of God. The Lord says that anyone who says a word
{95}
against the Spirit of God shall never be forgiven either in this world or in the world to come.
W.W.M. Do you not think if we took on more the ministry of those that were walking in the truth at any time in question, we should have very little time to read other ministry?
J.T. Quite so; there is plenty of food. The Lord thought of the matter of food when He said of those providing it, "Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus", @Matthew 24: 46.
L.R. What has been said would include such works as the Schofield Bible?
J.T. Quite so; that is a work that has come in since the Holy Spirit has been disregarded. I could not take on that. Of course you might take on things for the sake of examination; there are things you might learn from many by comparison; but as regards positive things that belong to the saints we must recognise the Spirit.
C.H.H. Would that apply to the mothers in connection with the religious books they buy for their children from other sources than our tract depot?
J.T. I know there is likely to be a good deal of looseness in that line and what we are saying now is intended to check it, that we are to honour the Spirit of God. The Lord stresses it that if any one shall say a word against the Spirit, it shall never be forgiven either in this age or in that which is to come.
R.H. What about those words of hymn 234: 'Who, by His wondrous dying, Revealed, O God, thy heart'? That statement is addressed to the Father.
J.T. You do not think that is incorrect, do you? The heart of the Father was revealed in the Son before He died, but it is the heart of God that was revealed in the death of Christ. The revelation of the Father was before that.
R.H. It is a little ambiguous, for the hymn is praise to the Father.
{96}
J.T. What has been said clarifies it. The revelation is said to be of God's heart. I think the hymn was examined carefully before insertion.
W.W.M. Should we not make ourselves more familiar with the New Translation as we think of the service of the brother that put it into our hands? There are his hymns too in the book we have been speaking of, the help he has given us in this way in the service of God.
J.T. The Spirit of God raised up that brother in a special way. He spent many years in translating the Bible into German, French and English, and it is the best translation unquestionably that there is in any of these languages. He spent much time in Elberfeld, Germany, in France, and of course in England, so that we have the best there is in those three languages and in Italian, too, I think. And alongside of that are his hymns. They stand alongside of the Scriptures, not of course on the same level, but I believe they stand alongside for enhancing the ministry that God gave. We have all that and recently we have a concordance of this translation which is very useful to any who wish to get the truth. The Lord would, I am sure, lay it upon us that there is plenty for us directly from the Spirit to carry us through.
Rem. The Lord says to Philadelphia, "Hold fast what thou hast". The Lord has given us much.
J.T. Quite so. We have to look now at Philadelphia and Laodicea, and then tomorrow at the assembly as coming down out of heaven as a bride. That will be on more positive lines than these two chapters but Philadelphia leads on to it. Really we might say that what has developed spiritually during the last one hundred and twenty years is what is alluded to in Philadelphia, and we are in it now. It will go on to the end. Laodicea is a sort of outlet for the effort of the devil over against that, but Philadelphia
{97}
is very close to the ministry of the Spirit in this dispensation of the Spirit.
R.H. Is the Laodicean condition what we are peculiarly exposed to now?
J.T. That is what I would think, that is the thing to watch now. Sardis is running on, you might say, but it is a dead thing, there is not much to say about it. What is there today that you can find of any value in the merely external profession of christendom? What you get by the Spirit is the only thing of value and that stands connected with Philadelphia. Laodicea is a sort of pretension that has arisen in that connection.
C.H.H. Would you place the companies that have seceded from the truth in that class?
J.T. I think in principle they are there. If you get a systematised thing, as in all these bodies to which we often allude, it has to be watched and refused. I believe the Lord is helping us to refuse these imitations. Sardis is not a form of imitation; Laodicea is.
R.H. In connection with what you say as to what is systematised, J.N.D. refers to Bethesda in that way.
H.H. I suppose you could not quite understand the true nature of Laodicea if there were not a Philadelphian side also.
J.T. I think that is true. God has graciously given us the positive, and the dispensation as revived involves Christ in heaven and the Spirit here with the assembly formed and functioning. Therefore the dispensation in principle stands. Laodicea in its characteristics is an effort of the enemy on the principle of imitation. So in a Timothy Jannes and Jambres are brought down to us from the Old Testament. Their names had not been spoken of before; they are imitators and they withstood Moses on that principle.
Rem. These features of Laodicea may be amongst us.
{98}
J.T. Only that what you have amongst people that are in the main right is not systematised, whereas they are systematised, and the systematisation is where the evil lies.
R.W.S. Where do you see it systematised? Have you in mind something special?
J.T. It is systematised error, that is the phrase in @Ephesians 4: 14.
H.B. In Philadelphia the Lord speaks of the synagogue of Satan. Would that not be a system?
J.T. Quite so; it is a local suggestion. The synagogue is a local thought. I think Rome is never anything else but local.
C.H.H. Systematised error is in connection with teaching: "In unprincipled cunning, with a view to systematized error", @Ephesians 4: 14.
J.T. That is the thing that we have to deal with all around us. All the sects are systematised, but we are now dealing, not simply with ordinary Protestant sects, but with imitations of the truth, of the true thing; the name of 'brethren' attaching to them all.
F.K.C. Would you say that the Lord's words to Laodicea, "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot", express the position Bethesda took as regards the Person of Christ?
J.T. That sort of thing has spread wider too, in Protestantism. But our subject now is what is said about Philadelphia. The Lord says, "And to the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write: These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open: I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut, because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name". Then He goes on to say, "I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet". That is remarkable, that is, before the assembly's feet. "And shall know that *I*
{99}
have loved thee. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown". Well, these are the things we are to take on and understand and develop in ourselves. And then what the overcomer comes into-for there must be overcomers in Philadelphia or there will be no ministry, no hearing of the word, "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name". This surely would all allude in the main to ministry that has come out particularly in the past thirty to forty years. I do not say the past one hundred years, but more recently, what has come out in the ministry bearing on the service of God, such as the matter of the temple and the assembly itself; the assembly being "the temple of my God". Then too the relation of Christ to God: "My Father and your Father ... my God and your God". I believe the Lord has honoured all that ministry and the results of it, and He is telling us that as overcoming He will write on us these wonderful things.
A.A.T. What does that mean, to write on us?
J.T. It shows that we are writing material; we are capable of being written upon. The apostle Paul alludes to the Corinthians as being his epistle, "Known and read of all men", "written", he says, by "the Spirit of the living God". @2 Corinthians 3 helps as to this matter of writing: "Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some, commendatory letters to you, or commendatory from you? Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, being manifested to be Christ's
{100}
epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of the heart" (verses 1 - 3). I think we get there clearly the clue to the matter of writing material and how the writing proceeds. Paul is alluding to the place the saints had with him, "written in our hearts". But then, they were written on too; they were manifestly "Christ's epistle ... written, not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of the heart". That is Christ's writing.
R.W.S. Is this the crowning promise of all the promises to the seven churches?
J.T. It would seem to be. What a place these thoughts should have with us; how they should become indelibly stamped on us! We are known to be thus. So that Matthew helps us when he says, "two of you"; that is, persons of that kind.
Ques. Would you connect what comes out in verse 12 in regard of Christ, with what God says at the close of the previous dispensation in @Malachi 3: 16? "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name". Is there a connection, do you think?
J.T. The book of remembrance was written, just so, and He speaks of them as "mine". "They shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare" (verse 17).
Ques. What would be the thought of "my new name"?
J.T. I think if we understand @John 20 we shall understand what the Lord is speaking of here. How intimately He links the message through Mary with Himself: "my brethren", "my Father" and "my God"; and then the addition of "your"-"my Father and your Father ... my God and your God".
{101}
I think @John 20 really helps us to understand what is promised here to the overcomer. What we have had all these years, to which we have been alluding is, I believe, bound up with John's ministry, especially in chapter 20, the message through Mary.
C.DeB. "Thou hast a little power". How would that be manifested?
J.T. Maybe what we have here today. These meetings are growing in importance and likability. The brethren seem to like them, and the Lord likes them; I believe He sees that there is a little power. They are growing in value. They began in the early movement of perhaps one hundred and twenty years ago, but they have grown. These so-called 'readings' have grown in importance and likability and the Lord has definitely taken them on.
A.A.T. Is it not remarkable that this type of meeting is found only among the brethren with whom we walk? They are the only ones who hold readings like this.
J.T. Others could hardly do it. That in itself shows that they have drifted away from the dispensation because it is bound up with this sort of thing. We have often alluded to @Acts 20, the love chapter; in the middle of it Eutychus is raised up by love; he is called a "boy", and is "brought away", representing the youthful work of the Spirit that is brought away, by which the brethren are comforted. But after Eutychus¬ recovery there was a conversation until daybreak. It is conversation. It is not like the clerical system, depending on discourses, but it is reading and conversational intercourse so that personality comes into view and we speak to each other on personal lines. They carried on this sort of thing until the break of day. And so Paul went away and the brethren were comforted.
S.R.McC. "The temple of my God" becomes
{102}
prominent in Philadelphia. Would that link on with meetings such as these?
J.T. I believe @John 20 is a sort of basic chapter as to all that has come out in these years, so that the Spirit of God has effected better conditions in the service of God, for we know what to do; we know the conditions in which the glory shines; we may say, "from glory to glory".
F.C. Do you think the words, "He shall go no more at all out" would refer to the position we have taken up, that it is never to be given up to the end; God helping us to maintain it?
J.T. Yes, I would connect it with what is said in chapter 21, which is really an eternal thought. "Go no more ... out". There is a great deal of going out now! If anything is to be effected ministerially we have to go out and travel, and suffer in travelling, too. The devil has been allowed to succeed in closing our way to some extent, but the going out implies that the Lord is taking account of suffering more or less; "journeyings often", as Paul said. Now I would take this word, "Go no more ... out", and link it up with eternal conditions. Chapter 21:3 - 7 says, "And God himself shall be with them, their God. And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall not exist any more, nor grief, nor cry, nor distress shall exist any more, for the former things have passed away. And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son". I would link on that word in chapter 3 with this as a part of our eternal position, that we go no more out.
C.H.H. That would be confirmed by the use of
{103}
the term, "new Jerusalem", which occurs in those two places only. It is a question of eternal conditions.
T.L.S. Is it right to think of both David and Solomon in the matter of Philadelphia? I was thinking of the expansion of what is proposed to the overcomer, how he receives an expansion in the way of service to God.
J.T. Quite so; Solomon, of course, is a counterpart of David. David represents refinement and excellency in this book and Solomon is just an expansion of David, so you might connect the idea of pillar with Solomon, and all that enters into the new Jerusalem in the way of glory; it is what the queen of Sheba saw, the ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord. I think that would be quite admissible. Solomon is there because it is a question of David expanding, Christ at the present time in that light in the grandeur of the system of new creation.
{104}
THE ASSEMBLY AS SEEN IN THE REVELATION (4)
@Revelation 19: 6 - 9; @Revelation 21:1 - 3
J.T. It is thought that we should finish today with these closing chapters, 19, 21 and 22, so as to see the assembly as it shall be. These passages that we have read belong to "the things that are about to be after" what we have been considering, the third phase of the book as the Lord divided it in chapter 1: 19
"What thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these". The assembly is, of course, the same, whether in the early or the closing chapters of the book, only that it is the heavenly side in these latter chapters. The first passage read involves more the moral side of the assembly; it records what has been, that is, the righteousnesses of the saints. These are in mind as seen here: the clothing in which the Lamb's wife is arrayed. But in order to have a clear view we should perhaps look a little at the earlier part of the chapter which tells of the judgment of the corrupted professing system. We noted earlier that, in chapter 2, "the woman Jezebel" may be rendered, 'the wife Jezebel', involving a household situation; whereas the view we get of her in the end of the book, in chapters 17, 18 and the early verses of 19, involves more what is political, the idea of her relation with the responsible element. It is said in chapter 16: "And the great city was divided into three parts; and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath".
Then chapter 17 says, "And one of the seven angels, which had the seven bowls, came and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the
{105}
sentence of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters; with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication; and they that dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication". So we have there the description of her in political relations. The passage goes on, "And he carried me away in spirit to a desert; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and had ornaments of gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication; and upon her forehead a name written, Mystery, great Babylon, the mother of the harlots, and of the abominations of the earth. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I wondered, seeing her, with great wonder. And the angel said to me, Why hast thou wondered? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast which carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. The beast which thou sawest was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction: and they who dwell on the earth, whose names are not written from the founding of the world in the book of life, shall wonder, seeing the beast, that it was, and is not, and shall be present. Here is the mind that has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains, whereon the woman sits. And there are seven kings five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes he must remain only a little while. And the beast that was and is not, he also is an eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into destruction. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have not yet received a kingdom, but receive authority as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and give their power and authority to the beast".
{106}
Then verses 15 to 18 say, "And he says to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire; for God has given to their hearts to do his mind, and to act with one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, which has kingship over the kings of the earth". Then chapter 18 is her destruction and the beginning of chapter 19 is the celebration of the event "After these things I heard as a loud voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah: the salvation and the glory and the power of our God for true and righteous are his judgments; for he has judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his bondmen at her hand. And a second time they said, Hallelujah. And her smoke goes up to the ages of ages. And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah. And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his bondmen, and ye that fear him, small and great". I thought we should have these facts before us, dear brethren, in considering the assembly in its heavenly relations, and how the wisdom of God and the righteousness of God require that the false assembly or church should be destroyed, and destroyed in such a way that the bearing of her destruction is eternal; it goes on for ever and ever.
C.H.H. Is it instructive that the first exposure of Babylon and the announcement of its fall occurs in chapter 14 immediately after the securing of the one hundred and forty-four thousand?
J.T. Just so, that is important too.
They would
{107}
represent a company on earth in the millennium, the Jewish position indeed; so that the bearing of her destruction is seen in relation to them too. We ought to become accustomed to the divine system. "God has judged your judgment upon her", we are told in chapter 18, it is the judgment of the brethren. We ought to have a right estimate of that system, its antiquity and its character and relations down the ages, and how heaven has taken account of it as its sins are mounting up to heaven.
Rem. In view of the evidence of this great system in this city where we are meeting, we are clear in our minds as to God's judgment and our judgment upon it. We see what God's thought of it all is and we are restful and content that it will all be brought down in time.
J.T. The grandeur of it comes out in detail, and the wealth of it, and then the description of its destruction. Chapter 17 brings out its political setting, how it has grasped after a universal status and yet in spite of itself it has to be local. It cannot afford to spread itself out: as to its essential existence it has to be local. So it is shrouded with darkness to conceal the wickedness.
R.W.S. Does Babylon primarily allude to a certain system, or to the christian profession?
J.T. Well, it says "the mother", she is "the mother of the harlots". I think it would mean that the whole christian profession as corrupted is in mind, and the whole system is corrupted now.
R.W.S. Is it just the Romish system or would it embrace Protestantism, as we had yesterday in Sardis?
J.T. I would think that the expression, "the mother of the harlots, and of the abominations of the earth", includes the whole profession as corrupted. What we had as to the dispensation of the Spirit bears on all that, that we must refuse all that belongs to
{108}
this system and maintain what belongs to the realm of the Spirit. If the Spirit's dispensation is to be maintained, that system has to be judged, and we have to learn to regard it as an eternal judgment: not simply in time, but an eternal matter because it says that "her smoke goes up to the ages of ages", as if God is telling us how to judge sin and how He judges sin; how the lake of fire stands in relation to His judgment. That is, the judgment of God about certain persons and things is eternal. There are judgments that are local in time and place, but there are also judgments that are eternal.
H.H. Babylon in Nebuchadnezzar's day was imperial, and yet in the ways of God it was allowed to capture Judah. Would you say a word as to the military side and the capturing of the people of God?
J.T. Well, that is what happened historically. Babylon captured what God had as it were publicly, so that the movement as Christ came into the world was to deliver from that. What we are dealing with now is future yet, but the deliverance from it in a moral sense is in christianity.
H.H. "Come out of her, my people" would apply to the present time.
J.T. It would. Joshua would have that in mind too; the garment taken by Achan was Babylonish, it refers to christendom in antitype.
C.H.H. Would it have its root in Nimrod in @Genesis 10?
J.T. Quite so. He, however, was from Ham. The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, which is confusion; that is the beginning of Babylon and it has come down to us in the moral sense in christendom. The world has taken that form, the Babylonish garment alludes to it, and the wickedness of anyone wishing to have it. These chapters refer to what is yet future in her history-Babylon in its coming, future character again taking on the political.
{109}
A.A.T. To whom do the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures refer? They seem to be in accord with God.
J.T. Well, they come down through the course of time. They are all a part of what we are saying. They are not simply christianity, the twenty-four elders include a previous dispensation. They refer to eldership, that is, experience with God. God's mind was understood, for instance, by Abraham of whom God said, "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him ... to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him". That is the principle of the twenty-four. As to actual number, they refer to the regularity of David's kingdom in view of Solomon, and they culminate here. They run through these chapters as sympathetic with God in His government of the world from the very beginning; because the twenty-four extend back to the beginning of God's government and come down to christianity and to this position. So God has had sympathy from the beginning. There have been experienced persons with Him throughout and they celebrate here. It says in verse 4, "And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God who sits upon the throne". The throne would refer to God's government: the thing itself is essentially in this matter. The bearing of it runs on; it is eternal. We are now coming to have the mind of God in judgment, the eternal bearing of His judgment.
A.B. Is there any import in the order here in relation to the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures? In the early chapters, from chapter 4 onward, the living creatures take the precedence, but here it is taken by the twenty-four elders.
J.T. I suppose the living creatures represent God's testimony in the creation, what He has in the creation.
{110}
The twenty-four elders refer to what He has in experience, companionship with Himself; so the precedence of the living creatures would mean that they are properly subordinate to the elders but the elders wait until they make a move. In chapter 4 it says, "And the four living creatures, each one of them having respectively six wings; round and within they are full of eyes; and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come. And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne, who lives to the ages of ages, the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of ages; and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honour and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created". That is, the elders have precedence because they have intelligence as being with God and coming down, as it were, through David; representing the best of the old dispensation. They include this dispensation too. So that when the living creatures give glory and thanksgiving, it is said the twenty-four elders shall fall before Him. They act consequent upon the action of the living creatures, as if to give fulness to what they do. There is, therefore, in the ways of God the principle of grade throughout, and the twenty-four elders represent the most exalted grade in the sense of intelligence in the government of God.
C.H.H. That would be marked by the way they speak with feeling: "O our Lord and our God".
H.H. It says, "In the midst of the throne, and around the throne, four living creatures", @Revelation 4: 6. That is not said of the elders, is it?
J.T. No; the elders are seen in verse 4. First it
{111}
speaks of the One who is on the throne and then that around the throne there are "twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed with white garments; and on their heads golden crowns", meaning that they are intelligent in their position in the government of God. Then in verse 6, "And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, four living creatures, full of eyes, before and behind". So that they are in a sort of subordinate position, whereas the twenty-four elders are supreme in relation to God, the Supreme. So we have in the general ordering, culminating here in their presence in this celebration, supreme intelligence in relation to God in His government, and then the living creatures representing the energy of life that is in God's creation.
R.H. Have you in mind that generally the more spiritual part of the service of God should be taken on by those with experience?
J.T. That seems to be the position in the introduction here in this remarkable way in chapter 4. The matter comes down through David, because the reference really is to David's regime in the great stress on the number twenty-four and the different offices and functions mentioned. It would seem as if David's part in this last book of the Bible, as we call it, is to stress excellence and grade. The word 'grade' is a good one, I think, in the government and ways of God, and the elders represent the highest grade. The book of Psalms should be connected with the Pentateuch, which is the historical working out of the creation, and of the position of Israel in the government of God. The nations were all arranged in relation to Israel; they were bound to stand in relation to Israel; and David comes in in that setting in the book of Psalms, which expresses the highest order of intelligence and feeling and spirituality in the Old Testament. The highest order of intelligence in all the dispensations is represented there, of course involving experience
{112}
with God, because the Psalms are expressions of experience with God. Hence I would think that David's part in this book is to convey supreme excellence and special experience with God; as though the wealth that He has coming down with Him through the ages is now enthroned and crowned in relation to Him-because it is God's throne; that is in mind in chapter 4, and it is God that is celebrated here. Then again we have in verse 6 of the passage we read, "I heard as a voice ... saying, Hallelujah"; so that God is in view here and then the Lamb.
R.H. Would you say a word as to the thought of worshipping God? I feel very defective in the matter. We seem to have much more liberty in relation to the Father.
J.T. Well, clearly the idea of God is stressed in this book, especially here; and so it is said in the last chapter, "And I, John, was he who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who shewed me these things. And he says to me, See thou do it not. I am thy fellow-bondman, and the fellow-bondman of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Do homage to God", @Revelation 22: 8, 9. That is a leading thought and it must point to the great ultimate in the ways of God, that God may be all in all. God is the great end, and ought to be the great end in our services now.
R.H. Does it go beyond what is historical? In chapter 19 the phrase "Our God" is in relation to the judgment, is it not? Have you in mind that chapter 22 would go further?
J.T. Well, I think the whole book places God before us, that is, God in His essential being, as He "who is". God in His essential being is in the mind of the Spirit throughout the whole book. We have the historical side in chapter 4 where, you will notice,
{113}
the living creatures say, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come". "Who was", that is historical, and then "Who is"; that is, the historical is put before the essential thought, whereas in chapter 1: 8 the order is reversed. There it says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty". That is the Spirit's way, you might say, of placing the Deity in this book. He is first seen, in chapter 1, in what He is essentially "Who is". But the living creatures, who have come into things in creation, recognise the historical God first; that is, the Creator God is historical. He is known historically, and as I understand it, they celebrate Him in this way in chapter 4. They say, "Who was, and who is, and who is to come". "Who was" is the historical God; that is a somewhat lower thought of course, but it has the first place there because the God of history is much better known than the God of eternity, of whom it is said: "From eternity to eternity thou art God". That is, He is better known in what He is and where He is operating in the dip down into time than in eternity. Still, "He is", and when we come to Moses we have that abstract idea. We have it for the first time in @Exodus 15 where "Jah" is used, the title, according to those who should know, that refers to God in the abstract, less known obviously than the historical God. Still, the more spiritual we are the more we shall value God in the abstract.
H.H. In this connection there are three designations of God that come into one's mind: "The Alpha and the Omega", "The beginning and the end", and "The first and the last". They are very striking expressions, and I thought that perhaps they are shared by more than one divine Person. Is there not a very plain relation or connection between God and the Lord Jesus as presented in the Revelation?
{114}
J.T. Quite. John has a way of linking them together without making it formal at times. Therefore "He who is" would at times refer to Jesus: the Deity is there.
Ques. Does all this enhance the thought we had in the first reading, of one, two, three? Does that come into this also-"Who is, and who was, and who is to come"?
J.T. Very good. As to these three distinctions that have been pointed out: the Alpha and the Omega would allude to the speaking, which came out, of course, in Christ, because He is the Word, the Logos; still, God is in it too, He speaks; He must have the first and the last word. Then "The first and the last" would mean the Deity personally; the Deity must be first and must be last.
H.H. In regard to "the beginning and the end" it is said in @Genesis 1, "In the beginning", and in @1 Corinthians 15, "That God may be all in all". That is the end, is it not?
J.T. Just so. "Then cometh the end": God must be that end, and He must be the beginning too,
R.H. When addressing God in this setting, have you in mind the three Persons?
J.T. I would never think of addressing the three Persons at one time.
R.H. Is that not in mind in the exhortation, "Do homage to God"? Would that not involve the three Persons of the Deity?
J.T. Well, it is always in the singular when you have to do with God. When the three Persons are seen they are viewed as in the economy, not involving absolute equality. Baptism is "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". The Father must be first, before the other two Persons in what we commonly call the economy: "To us there is one God, the Father, ... and one Lord, Jesus Christ". That is the mediatorial position. When we
{115}
have to speak to divine Persons it is all on the mediatorial ground, and that implies that They are not seen as equal. We know They are equal; John's gospel, which stresses the idea of the mediatorial economy, makes it plain that the Son is equal with the Father and that we must honour the Son as we honour the Father; but nevertheless, in addressing the Deity, that is the Persons, it is as turning to one of Them and addressing Him by the title by which He is set before us in the economy. I doubt whether the Spirit contemplates that as creatures we are equal to addressing the three Persons at one time, because it says that "To us there is one God, the Father". So that if you wish to speak to the Father, you address God as such; if you wish to speak to the Son, you speak to Him as such; or you have the Spirit in mind as such. The economy is intended for us, to make God available to us; so that we shall be intelligent in what we are saying and doing.
C.H.H. Would the highest form of worship include two Persons? "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father", @Ephesians 2: 18.
J.T. That is the economy; but the Father is the end; either the Father or God: but God is the great ultimate in all that we do or say.
S.J.H. Would that be higher than @Revelation 5, where it says they did homage "To him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb"?
J.T. Well, of course that would be to One at a time. You speak to One at a time. Therefore our hymns are somewhat difficult when they are mixed as to that.
C.H.H. "Endless praise and adoration, To the Father and the Son"-that would hardly be in order, would it?
J.T. Hardly. It has become a doxology through usage of the brethren. It was never intended to be
{116}
sung to close the meeting when the service of God is before us; we are to go out on the highest level. But the dear brethren will understand that we are on a subject that is the supreme of all subjects, and we cannot hope to deal with it now beyond what we have said. We cannot afford to spend the whole hour on it, although it is worthy of it. But to come to the position of the assembly as we are considering it in this reading: this passage in chapter 19 is where we find it properly introduced again after chapter 3. Before it is introduced we have the other person, the wicked wife, not only set aside but destroyed. The true wife is not even introduced until the false one is destroyed, and that in an eternal sense; understood to be destroyed eternally. I think it is intended, brethren, that we should know that. The twenty-four elders would know it.
W.W.M. Would it be right to apply this judgment to any imitation of what is real, so that we might be kept constantly in self-judgment lest we become religious without vitality?
J.T. Very good; religious without vitality, that is Sardis. She had a name to live and was dead. But now we are in the presence of the wife, the Lamb's wife. She is introduced here, but not before we have this wonderful celebration of the destruction of this thing that has been a blot really on the creation. The whole history of God's testimony has been, as it were, affected by this monstrosity, by its antiquity and its learning and its greatness according to man; all that the world is finds a place there in opposition to God, organised opposition to God, so that before He introduces the true wife He gives us the judgment of this system and the celebration of that judgment. There is nothing else that affords so much occasion of celebration as this happening: there is again the second time, "Hallelujah". It is an addition to what might be ordinarily, it is greater than anything that
{117}
has been, so that it is celebrated the second time with "Hallelujah".
W.F.K. Does the appellation, "the Lamb's wife", suggest that she has passed through reproach and suffering?
J.T. It would have in mind that she is in accord with the Lamb's position, which is that of suffering. She is not yet introduced as heavenly, although historically she has already been translated to heaven according to chapter 19, but in chapter 21 we have the heavenly side; she is coming down from heaven.
W.F.K. She has "made herself ready"; what would that imply?
J.T. She is fitted in that way. She knows what she is doing, she knows she has come to the time of this event; she knows how to provide her glorious attire and what it should be. It is not her own choosing, it is granted that she should wear this attire; she is allowed to wear it.
S.J.H. You were saying that Satan is cast out of heaven before the saints go up. Is this something similar, that the ground is absolutely clear of this false wife?
J.T. That is right. Chapter 12 shows that heaven is cleared through war; whatever adverse thing there is in heaven is dealt with. But the false wife is never seen as there, only there is an analogy. The angels of the devil were there, and although she was not there, she was affected by what was in heaven. The earth is cleared of her too before the Lamb's wife is brought in.
H.H. Would not true assembly features show themselves now as the false system is judged in our souls and in our associations?
J.T. That is the idea I am sure, as we were saying at the beginning. The parting of the ways means that everyone that names the name of the Lord withdraws from iniquity. We judge it and leave it. It is
{118}
no use saying we judge it unless we leave it; it is in the leaving of the thing that we show we judge it; and in doing that according to 2 Timothy we come back to the pristine position of the assembly where we can carry on the service of God.
H.H. One feels it is very important as we near the end that there should be no halting between two opinions.
J.T. That is right. If we are to have part in the divine service, as indeed we have through grace, it must not only be that God has judged our judgment upon the system that is, that we have judged it in our minds as a judge would do, but we must abandon the thing, leave it definitely. So that the exhortation to "Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins", really enters into our separation as in 2 Timothy.
Ques. Does that all link on with the nuptial garments here, the righteousnesses of the saints? The note says that they are not imputed righteousnesses here, they are actual.
J.T. Just so. "The righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit", @Romans 8: 4. It is not simply what our judgment is, but our walk and ways; that is all implied in the garments she is to wear. But the Lord would help us now to think of this great personage as realising in some little way by the Spirit that we are really part of it ourselves, and already, as it were, providing the material for the final nuptials. @Psalm 45 says, "All glorious is the king's daughter within; her clothing is of wrought gold", according to the footnote, "within" is 'in the royal apartments'. That is the idea. It is what is being wrought out day by day and minute by minute, that is what is going to come out presently in display. She is allowed to use this material for the great display on the marriage occasion, the righteousnesses of the
{119}
saints, the fine linen, said to be bright and pure. "It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints".
R.W.S. It seems a greater thing to rejoice over the marriage of the Lamb than over a negative condition when the false wife is destroyed. There ought to be some reflection of that in us now as forming part of the rejoicing and exulting.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord has helped us to bring the thought of the marriage into our service. @Psalm 45 has been much used in that connection, and the Spirit has helped us to prolong the time allowed for occupation with the marital relations between Christ and the assembly.
S.J.H. Why does it emphasise in verse 9 that these are the true words of God?
J.T. "He says to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the true words of God". It would look as if the idea of variety is stressed in relation to this marital matter. The direction to write is important. In some cases John is not to write, but he is to write here. It seems as if this paragraph should come into our assembly service, especially the marital side coming in after the actual partaking of the Lord's supper.
S.J.H. Do you think we should not hurry too much? Sometimes there has been haste in the desire to get on to the Father and to God. Should this matter be dwelt on more definitely and be quite clear in our minds before we move on in our service?
J.T. Quite so; and there is the word 'write', too. We have to compare it a little with other features in John's writings. We get the expressions, "I write unto you, little children", "I write unto you, young men", and "I write unto you, fathers": all that is our point of view, but here it is the direct word of
{120}
God to John. It says, "These are the true sayings of God", as if we ought to be very sure of what we are doing in celebrating in the Lord's supper the marital relations between Christ and the assembly.
C.H.H. In verse 9 where it says, "Blessed are they", would that refer to the bride herself, or to another company?
J.T. I would connect it myself with us, for present purposes, according to what we are trying to stress now. It is blessed to be in this part of the service and give the Lord His place in it, in the assembly, as to what she is to Him; not that we can exactly say she is the wife, because that word is used here designedly after the profession has been destroyed, after the one who had that place outwardly is destroyed. But inasmuch as the word "wife" is used, we are entitled to bring it spiritually into the service of God. I believe the statement that "These are the true words of God" ought to have a great place in that section of the service, that is, after we partake of the emblems and come under the Lord's influence and into the discernment of being in assembly. It is a question of what we are ourselves, the true words of God apply to us.
Ques. Would that be in contrast to what is false and not true?
J.T. It would indeed. The whole profession has much that is not true, but we want to be sure that what we celebrate in relation to the Lord's supper is a true matter, and that there are no additions to it either in word or in form.
H.B. Is it something like what Paul says, "I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you"?
J.T. That is good and confirms what we are saying. The apostle was confirming that it was a real thing. He did not simply carry down the thought of the Supper from the twelve, but he heard it from the
{121}
Lord Himself directly; it was directly received from the Lord, so that it is Paul's matter.
S.J.H. We have been anxious that the Father should have His place in the service; but do you think we need to be quite sure of this marital matter being reached before we move on?
J.T. I have no doubt that the Spirit of God had in mind the controversy there would be over the Lord's supper, and the terrible thing that Rome would make out of it; making it idolatrous as to the bread. Hence this phrase, that "these are the true words of God". These words are written, so that there is no use in going back to church history; because while the early fathers will give the Romish advocates enough to support their contentions, these true words of God that have come to us in the epistle to the Corinthians are what Paul received directly from the Lord. It is not simply what he heard from the twelve, but what he received directly from the Lord.
A.B. Yesterday you made reference to Philadelphia in relation to the overcomer and the writing on him. Ought we to have in mind that this writing is personified, these true words of God? Is that what you have in mind?
J.T. Quite so; and how the letter of commendation comes into the Lord's supper, into the new covenant. We had it yesterday and it comes home with force to one now as to the words of the apostle, "I received from the Lord". Then the writing in the second epistle, how he speaks of his affection for the Corinthians, bringing them forward because of his love for them. Wherever he was he spoke of them. And then the Spirit of the living God had written on them; they were declared to be the epistle of Christ, making the Lord's supper so real in word and letter.
A.A.T. But in connection with Paul's visit to Corinth, he delivered the truth of the Supper to them
{122}
before he wrote it down: "That which also I delivered to you", he says.
J.T. Well, Luther wrote down about it too. That is what one feels just now as to this terrible thing we are dealing with, that is judged; how even Luther was detained, really held in darkness, on this point of the bread. "This is my body": he wrote that down on the table-cloth, and he never got rid of that error; whereas the Spirit of God would make us rid of all these darkening things that would come down to us. The bride never ceases to be a bride, and there is no such thing as transition or transubstantiation either. It is a memorial in a spiritual sense, and I only refer to that to show the importance of the true words of God as applying to the marital relations between Christ and the assembly.
R.H. Would that link on with Jethro bringing Moses¬ wife to him in the wilderness and his kissing his father-in-law, the legality of the relation established?
J.T. Very good. In the words 'wife' and 'father-in-law' the idea would be that the thing is confirmed legally, that she is the real wife; and that comes out here. The real wife is seen in those who remember the Lord, who keep Him in their hearts. She does not forget Him, and her Husband is known in the gates. So that the whole thing, that which is called the sacrament, is stripped of all additions, inclusive of what Rome has added. We have the simple thing, the original thing, as in @1 Corinthians 11: 23, "For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you this do in remembrance of me".
S.R.McC. So that the real issue is Naboth's vineyard. Jezebel wrote in regard to that.
J.T. That comes into it. Jezebel dealt with that in her wicked ways. Naboth died on account of the
{123}
inheritance; and what we are speaking of is really the inheritance because it is the truth of the Lord's supper as it has come down by the Spirit of God; not by the early fathers, nor by church history, but through the word of God, using actual Scripture.
T.S. So in the challenge of the daughters of Jerusalem to the bride in Canticles, when they say, "What is thy beloved more than another beloved ... ?", she is able to speak in a living way, saying, "My beloved is white and ruddy", and so on with the description of Him.
J.T. She could give a true account of Him; she could tell what He looked like. That enters into what we are saying, that we have the real thing. The word 'memorial' enters into all that.
R.W.S. So what the Father gets and what God gets really become contingent upon the recovery of the Lord's supper?
J.T. We get on to a right basis; we are set up in transparency and the true words of God are fundamental for us. Having dwelt so long on this passage there is little time to touch on the beginning of chapter 21, where we have the assembly in relation to new creation. "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more". This is the basis for what he is now going to say: "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice out of the heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God". Now we have come on to what we might call the divine service, making application to current practice amongst the brethren. We come on to God and the assembly, that holy city, new Jerusalem, comes down out of heaven from God. That is, she is
{124}
already what these words express, making the application to what is current amongst us. This passage links on with chapter 19. It is the wife there, but here it is the bride coming down from God out of heaven and adorned for her husband. She is ready for the great occasion. But then immediately after we have the tabernacle of God; God has a place and He is known there.
C.H.H. Would this furnish material for the worship of God, entering into the service?
J.T. Yes, it links on with what we have been saying. We have the wife, the marital side, as we partake of the emblems, and then we are ready for the tabernacle. It is the same assembly. We may speak of the brethren of the Lord, His brethren, but presently the Spirit of God is apprehended in another way. He is the Spirit of God, but He is also the Spirit of adoption, becoming in us the power of sonship, the power of it in speaking to God; and the fact that the tabernacle of God is with men fits in now. God is with us in that position in the tabernacle.
W.F.K. Is the tabernacle system carried right through to this?
J.T. Yes, I think that is the thought. It is an eternal thought. Our services are rightly regarded as leading into eternity.
F.K.C. Is that what is in mind in the end of @Ephesians 3: "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages. Amen"?
J.T. That is right; that is what I understand. We have reached that point, and then the bearing is eternity. It is the assembly in Christ Jesus. In Christ involves the power, it is in that power. The "in" is suggestive of the power of Christ there, maintaining the position, so that God's glory is there throughout all generations of the age of ages. It is
{125}
not from age to age, it is one great thought that leads into the eternal state of things.
W.F.K. She is no longer the Lamb's wife; she is the holy city.
J.T. You get the wife again in verse 9, but it refers to millennial conditions. Here you do not get it. It is the eternal state of things that is in mind here.
H.H. Why have you the holy city, new Jerusalem, brought in in verse 2? What is the relation of that to what you have been saying?
J.T. The word 'city' is the system of things, involving still the mediatorial state of things, but with a capital, the holy city. It is suggestive of being the chief thought in the system. But then the question arises whether the emphasis is on the word 'holy' as fitting us for our entrance into eternal relations. "Be ye holy, for I am holy", holiness must be there.
H.H. How far would you carry the word 'city' in relation to eternity?
J.T. I do not know that you can go very far, because it is changed here immediately to tabernacle. It is stressed in verse 10 as the capital of the millennial day but the character seems to be dropped here.
H.H. It is an identification, more or less?
J.T. Yes. The city does not stress the thought of love so much as the thought of administration; but a tabernacle is where God is near to us and we to Him.
H.H. Would you carry the thought of administration into eternity?
J.T. I do not know. There must be something. The Son Himself is to be subject there. In the universe of God there must be law, governing principles; I would say that love involves that state of things.
C.H.H. In the light of what we have here, would you be free with a hymn such as No. 97 (Hymns and Spiritual Songs, 1932), 'At length the state eternal', in the worship at the end of our meeting?
{126}
J.T. Yes, quite so. We have not very many such. I think that as we count our hymns we shall see that we have not many that carry us through very far. J.N.D. was greatly exercised because there were so few hymns to God as the Father.
J.W. Does this scripture imply that we never lose the thought of the bride or wife in the eternal state?
J.T. I think so. It is a primary thought with God, and primary thoughts go through. They come into time and are worked out in time, but they go through.
R.W.S. In this eternal setting allusion is made to tears and death and sorrow. Does that have a bearing on our service in the assembly now?
J.T. Well, that is for ourselves. In these scriptures the negatives are especially helpful. We often quote that very passage for comfort. Verse 3 says, "And I heard a loud voice out of the heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God". It is a voice you will notice. We can work all that out in the truth of the epistles, especially in Ephesians, as to how we arrive at God in our service.
Rem. There seems to be a remarkable coalescing here with the thought you were suggesting in chapter 19: "And he says to me, These are the true words of God". Here we have at the end of verse s, "Write, for these words are true and faithful". It is preceded by, "Behold, I make all things new".
J.T. That is very interesting; so we are on sure footing right through.
H.H. In regard to J.N.D.¬s hymns, it has been said that he put into them what apparently the brethren were not ready for at that time; most of these hymns to the Father were written when he was very near the end.
J.H. In regard to the expression that "the former
{127}
things have passed away", would it be permissible at this point of the service to sing, 'O bright and blessed scenes, Where sin can never come', or would the thought of sin be an intrusion?
J.T. Of course it is only spoken of negatively; that is, it involves the positive. There is no sin there, which is a comforting thing. In fact it almost fits with certain things that are said here: "He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes"; well, that suggests that there has been sin which caused the tears. "And death shall not exist any more", that is another negative, but it is only a negative to assert a positive. "For the former things have passed away". I think that hymn is quite in order; it is precious anyway, as confirming us, because we do not forget that we are still in the body. We are in the body in all our service, we can never assume that we are out of it. Paul says he did not know whether he was in the body or out of it, but we can never say we are out of the body.
J.L.P. Hymn 97 (Hymns and Spiritual Songs, 1932) brings in the same thought: 'No breath of sin to wither'.
C.H.H. Would you say these negatives that imply a positive enhance the service?
J.T. Yes; the whole passage is of that character. God says, "He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son. But to the fearful and unbelieving, and sinners, and those who make themselves abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; which is the second death". So that it seems that these verses are for us at the present time as confirmatory, and comforting us in a negative way.
Ques. Would it be right to say that God has
{128}
reached His purpose that He had in mind at the beginning, "Let us make man in our image"?
J.T. Yes. God Himself is here, He is with men "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God. And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall not exist any more, nor grief, nor cry, nor distress shall exist any more, for the former things have passed away". The whole passage is both comforting and confirmatory, although largely negative.
R.W.S. And if we scrutinise the hymns too much, and publicly criticise the hymn a brother gives out, we may be put under bondage and really hinder the service of God.
J.T. Yes. So what comes in between chapter 19 and this passage involves the complete clearance of the universe from sin. The whole matter of sin is dealt with and settled in the lake of fire. The very thought of the lake of fire is admitted: they shall have their part in the lake which burns. It is the eternal judgment of sin which enters into this matter, the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is "the second death". That hymn is quite in keeping with the language we use in the divine service, because we are still here and we value the thought of eternal judgment, that is, the final settlement of things which are causing so many tears and so much sorrow.
S.J.H. In @Isaiah 65:17 it says, "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind"; but in the last chapter (verse 24), it says, "And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh". That is in connection with verse 22 which says, "For as the
{129}
new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me ...".
J.T. Isaiah gives the application of the new heavens and the new earth to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is made a joy, showing that at the present time the things that are spoken of here are already realisable by the Spirit. We are able to speak of them as confirmatory of the situation. How sure it all is! But what comes in here in chapter 20 should be looked into to get what good we might from the introduction of the lake of fire, and of all that is said about it as basic now down here. It is basic as to the service of God that we are conscious by the Spirit that there is a final solution to all wickedness and evil. It is not simply that it is destroyed, but it is there as a testimony eternally as to what God thinks of sin, and how it is dealt with. It is limited, but it is there. There is no suggestion of the lake of fire ever terminating; it is known to be there.
S.J.H. Why should they go and look upon it?
J.T. That is the prophetic way of speaking. The idea of the new heavens and the new earth is brought down to practicableness in the millennium. Jerusalem is made a joy, that is by the Spirit, and even in christianity it comes to us in the joy we have in the assembly. But all is in view of the eternal state of things when matters are settled finally.
C.H.H. Would there be a present connection in Hebrews where it is said that we have come "to the city of the living God"?
J.T. That present thought applies to all these things: we have come to them really; and that only brings in again the importance of maintaining the liberty of the Spirit by which we realise these things.
Ques. "The tabernacle of God is with men": would that include God's tabernacle with Israel as well as with the church?
J.T. The allusion is to that. God's primary
{130}
thought is the tabernacle, not the temple. The temple came in with David and Solomon as a matter of greatness and glory, but the primary thought was that God would be near His people and He would have them near Him. So in @Exodus 24 He brought them up to the height, and they ate and drank before Him and He did not lay His hand on them, as if to say, You can be free and happy with Me, you have nothing to fear. That comes in here.
T.S. We spoke previously about joy and exulting; I was wondering whether what God does here would indicate something of the peculiar joy He would have in all this?
J.T. That is what these words imply; He is having more out of it than we are. In having His tabernacle with men His thought was to have a people near unto Him. That is in His mind now. He has them near Him eternally in the tabernacle. The tabernacle is the saints, the assembly, that in which God will dwell eternally.
C.H.H. Would the tabernacle exclude all else but the body of Christ?
J.T. I would think so: "the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all". All the operations are carried on there in the eternal state of things. "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".
C.H.H. The earthly bride would have no part in that?
J.T. I think not. I do not know if she will continue really. Whether she will continue or whether she will merge is a matter to be understood.
R.H. Do we ever touch in our service a point that is beyond the mediatorial idea, or is it always through the Lord?
J.T. I do not think we could be with God at all except on a mediatorial basis.
C.H.H. Eternally?
J.T. Yes.
{131}
THE ASSEMBLY AS SEEN IN THE REVELATION (5)
@Revelation 21: 9 - 27; @Revelation 22: 1 - 5, 16, 17
J.T. We saw in our last reading that verses 6 to 9 of chapter 19 again introduce the assembly as leading us to the final state of things, and that in the subsequent part of the book we have a return to the millennial state, with administration stamped on the instruction in the record. We finished with the thought of the service of God, and the application of chapter 19 as read and chapter 21 as read to that service. That is, we linked it on with these scriptures in line with what we have observed as the Spirit's teaching in recent times, namely that the service leads us on to the eternal state of things, ending with the tabernacle. The city is alluded to, but the finish is the tabernacle, as we should expect; that is, that God would come in finality to love conditions between Himself and His people. There will be no more sea; both nearness and movability are involved. Administration is not stressed, though the Spirit as returning to millennial conditions in verse 9 of chapter 21 has administration in mind; and we come back through that way, in chapter 22: 16, to the assemblies as we have them in the early part of the book. In that passage the Lord does not return to millennial conditions, but to present current conditions. He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come". So that we finish, as we may say, with the Lord's relations with us as we are now, seen in this message to us and the response that He looks for in us: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".
Ques. Do I understand that the millennial period runs collaterally with the eternal state?
{132}
J.T. I think that, as applied to the assembly, the eternal state, as we call it, begins as she is translated to heaven, and therefore runs on collaterally with the millennium on the earth. But the millennial conditions are not properly eternal, they are in relation to the earth. There are nations existing, and Israel existing as a nation in the great period of administration, the great period of rule and blessing on the earth; as if God would show what He can do with man in the flesh, Satan being limited or in prison, so that there is no incentive to sin; although sin is supposed to exist and will be dealt with. Chapter 20 deals with that. So that the eternal state of things begins for us as we are translated, and that is contemplated in chapter 19.
H.H. Would there also be the work of the Spirit on the line of new creation now?
J.T. Quite so, it is going on now, as Paul says, "So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation", @2 Corinthians 5: 17. That is the principle of our dispensation, at least one of the principles. It is in view of eternity, in view of eternal conditions which may take place at any time. It is no earthly matter, it is a heavenly matter, a heavenly movement to take the saints up where eternal conditions will at once begin. Chapter 19 contemplates the first transaction and our being translated.
R.W.S. The great purge of chapter 19 immediately precedes the millennium.
J.T. You mean the Lord's incoming militarily in chapter 19? Quite so. He is seen coming out "And I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and one sitting on it, called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war in righteousness. And his eyes are a flame of fire". That chapter ends with the destruction of the beast and the false prophet. That clearly is pre-millennial, but introduces millennial conditions. Then chapter 20 gives us what takes
{133}
place as the angel descends from heaven and binds Satan, putting him into the abyss; then the thrones are set in verse 4 and the judgment given. This is inclusive of the raised and glorified saints; not only is the assembly there, but, as I understand it, all that are raised. Then after the millennium the rest of the dead are all raised and all have part in this scene in the end of chapter 20, running on to the final settlement of things in the lake of fire. The beginning of chapter 21 has application to the service of God as continuing on in principle from the Lord's supper to eternal conditions. Then in verse 9 we come back to millennial conditions. So that we know that the assembly's position now is to continue on in the service of God as inaugurated by the Spirit, leading on to eternal conditions. The millennial state of things begins at verse 9 and brings out what God can do with men as we are now in national conditions and the like, the heavenly city being in touch with the earth as ruling. So that eternal conditions are already there in the assembly, which is in touch with the millennial earth, although these conditions are not eternal. However, there will doubtless be a merging here, for flesh and blood does not inherit the kingdom of God. Therefore the millennium is limited, one might say, provisional, but will bring out what God can do with men in flesh and blood conditions.
C.H.H. Are millennial conditions anticipated in their moral features today in the church?
J.T. I think so; new creation, too, has already begun, so that we link on already with eternal conditions; with the so-called bridge of the millennium. The millennium is a matter treated by itself, a special matter with God in which He works out certain things in men and nations as they are in the flesh, with Satan bound.
H.H. There is a kingdom now on earth, the kingdom of God established in connection with the
{134}
Holy Spirit and the saints; a kingdom which cannot be moved.
J.T. Oh, yes. The word 'kingdom' is used variably. It is used to refer to Christ's own kingdom, which is not of this world; and then too as to the formal conditions here, the Spirit being present. Matthew speaks of it as the kingdom of heaven; Luke and John as the kingdom of God. It has a moral bearing; it is the power that is operative for deliverance out of the world, while the world remains as it is.
C.H.H. Would Paul's designation of "the kingdom of the Son of his love" have an eternal bearing?
J.T. I suppose it would. We are translated into that already, I suppose for educational purposes, because the Son of the Father's love contemplates the book of Proverbs. He is not yet on His own throne, but on the Father's throne, I would say for educational purposes; so that we are brought up in the rule of love itself in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love. It is a kingdom to make it effective, but love is the idea of it. There is rule there, but it is to work out in love at the present time.
-.E. Would you make a distinction between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the Father?
J.T. Well, there is a difference. There are varied references to the use of the word 'kingdom'; even we ourselves are said to be made a kingdom at the present time, that Christ has made us a kingdom (@Revelation 1:6). The saints themselves are a kingdom; I think the principle of rule is set up amongst them  by themselves. And so it says, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13: 35. But it is on the principle of kingdom, that it is intolerant of wickedness.
H.H. You said some time ago that the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love in Colossians went over the Jordan; that it is not a wilderness condition.
{135}
J.T. I think that is right. It is a spiritual state of things in which the Son is known in that peculiar character as the Son of the Father's love; and you are delivered from the authority of darkness and translated into that; showing that it is at the present time in christianity because the book of Proverbs really is in mind. Solomon is the Son of the Father's love, and it is Solomon who can teach us, who can tell us of the Father and show us what the Father is to him. Hence in @Matthew 11 the Lord says, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls". I believe that is where the matter lies: it is the Son in the presence of the Father, and an Object for us, an educational Object for us. What a state! "Ye shall find rest to your souls".
H.H. And that in a chapter in which everything is going the wrong way, John the baptist in prison and the Lord's works not accepted.
J.T. Yes; everything had gone wrong. It was a critical time in the Lord's path here and things were brought to an issue. It was a time of crisis when things had gone against Him outwardly. But it is the Son in the presence of the Father, and the Lord says, "I praise thee, Father ... that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes", @Matthew 11: 25. That is to say, it is Himself and the babes, and henceforward it is an educational time; so that it is a kingdom in a very attractive form. Now we have come to the millennial kingdom, and it is said, "And there came one of the seven angels which had had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. And he carried me away in the Spirit, and set me on a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from
{136}
God, having the glory of God. Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone; having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. On the east three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb". So that we have now come to the idea of the personnel, as we already had it in the beginning of the book. But here it is a question of the angels, creatures in the service in the divine system, and of the sons of Israel, and of the apostles of the Lamb; so that we have a great range of administrative personnel. We have come to that now, seen working out on this present earth; not in the new earth but in the present one. God is going to show what He can cause to happen on this earth.
H.B. Is the beginning of this scene in the upper room in Acts?
J.T. Well, Acts introduces christianity, and christianity is in mind. We have in the book of Acts the inauguration and the personnel of the present dispensation. It is not a question there of the millennial dispensation but of the christian dispensation, and so we have the personnel of that, the twelve apostles, and certain women, among them the mother of Jesus and His brethren. These are set there as if God is going to work out there a nucleus of what has developed during all these centuries, as God brings out the fulness of the nations. We are now in the time of the fulness of the nations coming in, and the personnel used is seen in the first of Acts.
C.H.H. Would this in any way refer to the masculine and feminine side in @Genesis 1? He says, "Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle,
{137}
and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth ... male and female created he them". Would millennial conditions on the earth show the male and female side?
J.T. Quite so; intelligence comes into that as to the male and female side of things, because the government of God requires both. There is hardly enough time to go into that, but it is worked out concretely in the book of Esther, and of course in other books too. God is showing in the creation of man that He had in mind the two sexes, and that they were both necessary, not only in the populating of the earth but in the rule that God has in mind. "Let them have dominion", He says-a most interesting line of things. But I was thinking how the inauguration of the present dispensation in the book of Acts can be profitably compared with the inauguration of the millennial dispensation. They are two distinct things, and we have the latter here. The numeral 'twelve' is stamped on the whole construction, as if God were saying to us, I am going to show something special. It says in @1 Timothy 6: 15, "Which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall shew". God is going to show what He can do. Man has failed utterly, and all kinds of government have failed, but God is going to show in the millennium what He can do and how He can govern.
W.W.M. The Lord says in @Acts 1 that it was not for them to know the times and seasons. Would this be in His mind, too, do you think, this time of the millennium?
J.T. Yes. The apostles wanted to go too fast; they wanted to go on to the millennium, not to the eternal state. They had not that in their minds; they wanted to know about times and seasons. "Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel? And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons". That is remarkable. But He says,
{138}
as it were, The Spirit will come, and that is a greater thing for you; you wait for Him, and you will get everything. There is not a thing that He does not bring in. It is the day of the Spirit, and so John enlarges on that: "Ye have not need that any one should teach you", @1 John 2: 27. That is our dispensation and there is no other like it.
But now we are dealing with the millennial dispensation, and the saints who form the present dispensation are already in heaven. They are not going through the millennium first; they go by themselves, so to speak. Others go too; but the assembly has already gone into heaven when we reach the millennium. The end of the matter is in the verses we had this morning, in the holy city coming down out of heaven. She is called "the holy city", but she is a bride adorned for her husband, that is, there is the idea of freshness. It is a question of what is for Christ. But now, beginning with verse 9, He is going to use her in the millennium.
H.H. Do the saints come out with Christ in chapter 19?
J.T. Quite so; they come out militarily. They come out on white horses in chapter 19, but they are seen on the thrones in chapter 20. They are in an effectual position on thrones. The whole vista is here to look into. We have already seen our destination in the beginning of chapter 21; but now the Spirit of God is turning round to the millennium, and He would say, This is the point now; it is the administrative period that the Lord has in His mind now, the dispensation of the fulness of times.
R.W.S. What would you say about the white horses and the thrones in connection with the assembly?
J.T. Well, the white horses of course are military. It says, "I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and one sitting on it, called Faithful and
{139}
True, and he judges and makes war in righteousness. And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems, having a name written which no one knows but himself; and he is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which are in the heaven followed him upon white horses, clad in white, pure, fine linen", @Revelation 19: 11 - 14. That is a military position. Then in chapter 20 we have Satan bound, and the thrones: "And I saw thrones; and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them". That is one group. "And the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God": that is another company; they suffered and died after the assembly is taken up into heaven, but now they are seen on the thrones. Then it goes on "And those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand; and they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years". That is the position we are looking at now; the assembly is included, but it is not exclusively the assembly; evidently there are others living and reigning with Christ.
-.E. Do you think the preaching of the glad tidings would be intended to bring men into millennial conditions before the day of display, as well as into assembly conditions?
J.T. You mean evangelical work, the angel flying in mid-heaven with the everlasting gospel? Of course the result of all that will be brought into the millennial state of things. So in chapter 7, the great crowd which no one can number is brought into it.
-.E. I mean now-not only for the future but for the present moment.
J.T. Of course we have part in the millennial state of things, but only on the principle of ruling in it. The heavenly side is just rule and influence; the
{140}
thousand years of blessing is for the people on the earth. The principle for us is to influence it.
T.L.S. Is the assembly seen in a militant attitude prior to the millennium being ushered in?
J.T. I think she is included there in chapter 19. It is not like chapter 12 where you have Michael fighting with the devil. This is the Lord Himself, and the saints coming out with Him in military array to destroy His enemies, inclusive of and led by the beast and the false prophet. This greatest array of power, as you might say, the Lord Himself destroys. And now we come to verse 9, to the assembly, the Lamb's wife, coming out in the sense of administration. She is seen as the great metropolis of the universe, really the heavenly metropolis of what is on earth; and she is going to influence all that happens.
J. W. It seems that the Lamb is prominent in this section, but not in the previous one, where the assembly is seen as a bride adorned for her husband. Here she is spoken of as the Lamb's wife; the Lamb is particularly mentioned.
J.T. The millennium, beginning with verse 9 of this section and running into the next chapter, has the Lamb in mind. The saints would, as it were, come back to earth again; not that the heavenly city is on the earth, but it is in relation to the earth, and the Lamb is in mind. It is to bring out how the assembly as having gone through experience is qualified to be associated with the Lord in His administrative services, and even in the military services.
S.J.H. Is this what the apostle was telling the Corinthians they were to be prepared for? They were not prepared for it in wifely feelings.
J.T. Paul said he had espoused them as a chaste virgin to Christ. He told them that they would have to judge angels, and all that is in view in what we have been speaking of. We are to be prepared for heavenly administration.
{141}
Ques. Is the thought of the Lamb based on the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. Yes; the Lamb usually carries that thought; and we have here the Lamb's wife: "Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife". She is a bride adorned earlier in the chapter, but that is in view of eternal relations with Christ. Now it is "the bride, the Lamb's wife".
H.H. The millennium fills in one thousand years before you get what we had this morning as to the bride in relation to the eternal state. Is that right? I mean that after one thousand years of millennial administration she is just as fresh and beautiful as at the beginning.
J.T. Just so; only the question is whether the two do not synchronise, carrying the thought through from chapter 19. The Lamb's wife in chapter 19 is seen as married, united to Him officially. It is a scene of marriage. But then the Spirit takes us on to the end, to what is eternal, and that is involved in the beginning of chapter 21. Then He comes back again to the millennial scene, but the two may synchronise. However, we have to view the beginning of chapter 21 in relation to what is eternal: that is, what the assembly is to Christ, a bride adorned for her husband; while in this section it is the bride, the Lamb's wife. She has the glory of God, and "her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone; having a great and high wall". As you will see, she is already in relation to the millennium, but she is the Lamb's wife nevertheless.
R.W.S. How do you view those who are not today walking in the light of the assembly? How would they be able to function in the heavenly city in relation to the millennium on earth?
J.T. Well, it is a question of what God can do in a short time. He can raise us in the twinkling of an eye; so quickly can He change us, change myriads.
{142}
It is a question of what He can do. If they are really God's people, the subjects of the work of the Spirit at the present time, then we have to come back to what God can do, to God's sovereign power. How quickly He can do things to complete all the work of the present dispensation, and to make the assembly fit for its eternal purpose!
R.W.S. Will there be gradations in rule?
J.T. You mean in those who rule? We are not all alike.
R.W.S. I was thinking what a great advantage one who lived in the light of the assembly and understood something of assembly administration would have over one who was just caught up, having the Spirit but not knowing much about the assembly.
J.T. Suppose we put it this way: everything is going to be right; the great Operator is infinitely right. He has infinite power and can do things quickly if necessary. So we rest in that. We shall not get all our questions answered. If you were to ask me how babes are going to be saved, I do not know in detail, but I know they are going to be. That is, there is so much we just have to leave. Why can we not do that? If the Operator is infinite in wisdom and in power and in purpose, then everything must fit, and we can just say, That is all right; we do not need to be anxious about that. I do not mean that if it is in Scripture we should not look into it; but if God can raise a man out of the grave, or a million men, in the twinkling of an eye, the shortest conception of time, why can He not take a brother, or any number of brothers or sisters who are poorly educated, poorly trained, and do all the work in a moment?
That is how I look at matters of this kind. Today I see believers in the Presbyterian church singing in the choir; but in a moment I see the thing turned around and I see them in heaven. What has happened in between? Whatever it is, God has done it.
{143}
Rem. The Lord said, "To-day".
A.B. This morning you referred to verse 6 in connection with the eternal state: "And he said to me, It is done". The whole work is accomplished. There may be difficulty in regard to questions and inquiries, but the great thing is that it is done.
J.T. So if you take @Genesis 1: six days and it is done; the work is done. God rests on the seventh.
H.H. Could we not add the transaction at the cross, the comparatively short time in which the whole question of sin was dealt with? And the Lord said, "It is finished".
J.T. Quite so.
C.H.H. Would the Thessalonians be an example of how quickly things can be done in the souls of people? It says the word sounded out from them when they had been converted only two or three weeks; still they were a testimony all over the country.
S.J.H. I thought that reward and the position in that day were dependent on our education and formation now. Is that wrong? If it is not a matter of formation through exercise now, we could sit back and it would be all right in the day to come.
J.T. You cannot reason that way. We have been speaking of the six days of the creation, and that on the sixth day all was done, even the creation of Adam and Eve, and God rested and was refreshed, meaning it had been a real matter of toil. He waited to create Adam and Eve till the last day for a special reason; all that He says about them took place on the sixth day. In chapter 1 God says, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth". When we come to chapter 2 it is said, "And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of
{144}
life; and Man became a living soul" (verse 7). That happened on the sixth day. Well, how much more He could have done! How many minutes did His operations take? How much time did it take to fill out the expanse on the second day? He took the earth out of the sea and set it up in life in a day. How much more He could have done! That is the way to arrive at the truth. If the scripture is silent you come back to God and what He can do, and rest in that. We have a lot of things in our minds and we are apt to get confused. We are now on the idea of how christians in the different sects, hardly educated at all spiritually, are to come out when this millennial day arrives.
How will they have part in it at all? How awkward they must be! And we are trying to think of what God can do in view of education-how much He can effect in view of His own eternal purpose. What we are saying is, I think, important, that God can do everything. Job says, "I know that thou canst do everything", @Job 42: 2. He had needed great adjustments, but he arrives at that, and that is what we have to arrive at, to understand and know Him, what He can do. We have to follow the creative line and what God can do, and what He can do in educating christians; the thousand ways we may arrive at things by bringing God in.
W.F.K. Is that the idea when Abraham says, "Will not the judge of all the earth do right?", @Genesis 18:25?
J.T. Just so; that is another thing. You look at all this war, the atrocities, but God can deal with these things in every detail; He will not overlook one. Every one will be dealt with.
C.H.H. The man at the Beautiful gate was a beggar one minute and the next minute he was a worshipper.
H.H. Is there not in all that the thought that the Holy Spirit is here? And it can never be said of the
{145}
Holy Spirit that He did not complete His work in every detail.
J.T. I would say that. But I was thinking of the material creation, the vegetable kingdom. A man says, "How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?". That is simply a natural question. It is an act of God. The apostle says, "Fool". Take wheat, or corn, or any cereal: put any number of them into the ground: well, God gives them all bodies as it pleases Him. Apply that now to all the brethren, christians in the different sects, uneducated spiritually, what cannot God do in view of translation, overnight?
R.W.S. I am getting great help. I had never thought of it in this way.
J.T. I think it would turn us to God to see what may happen overnight. And yet we are praying about what may happen. Take our children turning aside into the world; we know they are the Lord's; what may God not do in a moment with them?
T.L.S. In @Ezekiel 37 there is an exceeding great army that comes suddenly into life.
J.T. Even the skin comes upon them; they are brought into being. It is a real thing. There is ornamentation in the skin.
T.L.S. Would you say that in @John 12 there was quick adjustment by divine power? I have in mind the adjustment of the family, of Martha serving more intelligently, and of Lazarus the dead man being there, and Christ supreme in their hearts. It happened in a very short period of time.
E.A.L. Do you mean that we are to be careful not to question the right of God to be magnanimous, as those did who worked through the heat of the day for a penny?
J.T. Yes; God has a right to be magnanimous. But if you apply the thing to the vegetable world or the fish of the sea, you see what can be done by God.
{146}
Take the Lord in the incident of the fish in @Matthew 17; He says to Peter, Cast a hook into the sea. There is to be one fish and in that one fish's mouth one piece of silver. That all happened. The Lord must have been operating there before. When Jonah says, Cast me into the sea, the fish came and swallowed him up; it says Jehovah had prepared that fish. That was quick work.
Rem. And then the gourd; it came up overnight.
J.T. Quite so; various things were quickly prepared in Jonah's case. So when we come to the bodies of the saints it says in Matthew that "many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many" (chapter 27: 52, 53). Well now, suppose they had all arisen at that time, how many would there be? Who can tell, from Adam down? They will all come out in the twinkling of an eye, and those who are alive here will be changed in the twinkling of an eye. It throws us back on God and the knowledge of God. The Holy Spirit is working in us to that end, that we might know God.
H.B. "Can a land be made to bring forth in one day? shall a nation be born at once?", @Isaiah 66: 8.
J.T. Quite so. In our inquiry now it all resolves itself into a question of the knowledge of God. Paul says, "Some are ignorant of God"; not simply 'about' God but ignorant 'of' God. We are now looking at this great subject of the millennium, the great administrative matter, and it is for us to proceed in our inquiry in the light of the knowledge of God which He has given to us, and to see how all this can come about. We must see how the number twelve is the great numeral for our education; how it enters into the measurements. One of the features we must understand is that God is the God of measure; the knowledge of God implies knowing Him as the God of measure. He is the God of glory, but He is the
{147}
God of measure too, and we have to apply that here. We are in the presence of God in our inquiry, but it is as the God of measure. So it is said that she has the glory of God, the heavenly city has that; and "Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone; having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. On the east three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb". So that now we are, as it were, brought up to this city. It is not a bride adorned for her husband exactly; it is a great administrative city, and there are persons¬ names involved in it. That is, there are certain classes of persons, angels, and the sons of Israel, and the twelve apostles of the Lamb. We are bound now to consider what all this means, and how it is going to work out. Then the next thing is, "And he that spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall. And the city lies four-square, and its length is as much as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed-twelve thousand stadia: the length and the breadth and height of it are equal. And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, a man's measure, that is, the angel's". Now we are, as it were, there. What are we to make out of this? Are we able to take in these measurements, and these persons mentioned? Then we have its foundations: "And the building of its wall was jasper; and the city pure gold, like pure glass: the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper ...". We have to take into our minds the idea of the twelve foundations, that it is a great structure. Twelve foundations! So that it is a question
{148}
of our power of absorption, whether we can take in these measurements; and then to see that we are being educated to have part in this structure when it begins to function.
H.H. I would like to ask about the measurement according to the angel.
J.T. It is a man's measurement, it is brought down to our compass. It is not infinite. We are in the presence, not of infinity, but of man's measure; it is what God has wrought in man. That is the point. The measurement is according to man, within our range.
H.H. Why does it say "the angel's"?
J.T. It is instrumentality, clearly. That has a great place in this book. But it is a man's measurement.
C.H.H. Would the fact that it is an angel infer that man has arrived at heavenly ability to measure things?
J.T. Yes. I suppose then we shall know a little more about angels than we do now; but we are not to enquire too much into it, because God has intimated to us that families are to be kept distinct. The light that shines for us in Jesus is not for angels; it is for us. He is the Light of men.
C.H.H. A man's measurement here would be no different from the angel's?
J.T. No. Man's measurement would mean it is finite. It is intelligible to us who are men. It is very hard to take this in with the natural mind because the city is a cube. How can you get persons, an untold number of persons, formed into a city, and that a cube? It is humanly incomprehensible. We have, therefore, to go back again to God as to how the thing can be; how it works out. It is a solemn and substantial matter and yet it is formed of persons.
-.M. What is the difference between this city and the one that Ezekiel sees?
{149}
J.T. Well, this is the heavenly city, formed of ourselves, to be simple and practical. We are being formed for it now and put into it even now. But Ezekiel is an earthly state of things; it is what will be set up in Israel presently according to God's purpose on earth. But we are now occupied with the heavenly; and to pursue the subject, we are told that these twelve foundations are the twelve apostles of the Lamb. The precious stones are brought in to show how intrinsically precious the thing is, and how strong the foundational idea, that it will stand eternally.
A.B. Things seem much clearer as considering your reference to Genesis in connection with what you have been saying: God working at the outset and bringing man in, and then Babel coming in, the result of man's mind as away from God. And now we have what is set over against that. Would you say it is most interesting that God held man in relation to Himself, and now we have a city composed of men, persons? There is no difference. He says, "Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife": it is a city.
J.T. Showing that God has in His mind to stress the administrative idea as worked out millennially: Then as to the effect of it: when all these things are stated we have the moral question. He says, "And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon, that they should shine for it". It is a heavenly, spiritual matter. The lights were set up in Genesis and were needed, but no natural lights are needed here, for "The Lord God shall shine upon them". Yet we have terms here that belong to the beginning of Genesis; really the allusion is to Jehovah Elohim, showing the extent of this matter, that it extends back to the beginning of creation and is now workable in relation to men in flesh and blood here, in the nations, through the heavenly city. There they are, even the nations. God says, I am going to rule in these circumstances, but this is a heavenly thing through which
{150}
I am ruling. It needs no natural light. No statesmanship or education or politics or business will be of any avail here. We are being made now and educated on these lines. How are we getting on? Let us challenge ourselves: How can I get on without the sun or moon or electricity? I have to challenge myself, and that brings up the question of spiritual constitution in us, and of what we are as spiritually formed. So it is said that Christ is a quickening Spirit, the last Adam is a quickening Spirit. He has quickened us and made us for this purpose, so that we do not need these natural lights. And we are told what the effect is in this new state of things: "And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon, that they should shine for it; for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb. And the nations shall walk by its light". That is, they have learned now to walk by light that is not merely the product of man's mind. It is another kind of light. "The kings of the earth bring their glory to it". It is showing itself to be superior. What God has provided in view of all this is superior to everything else, there is nothing like it. Then, "And its gates shall not be shut at all by day, for night shall not be there". In @Genesis 1 God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night, but these two ideas stop here, they are finished. We are now dealing with another order of things, so that there is no night here, and the light is not from the sun or from the moon but from something else: the Lamb is the light thereof, the Lord God and the Lamb. And then we are told, "The nations shall walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory to it ... . And nothing common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie, shall at all enter into it; but those only who are written in the book of life of the Lamb". I think we are challenged as to whether we can take these things in, whether we can carry the thoughts away, whether we are capable of absorbing
{151}
spiritual thoughts. How can we have light without any sun or moon or stars?
C.H.H. Would there be anything akin in Colossians where it says as to the assembly, "In which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge", @Colossians 2: 3? According to that you need no natural light whatever.
J.T. That comes into what we are saying. We do not have to go outside for light. The Colossians were in danger of natural lights, philosophy and vain deceit, but the apostle says these are not needed; they are not right and they are not needed.
A.A.T. Is it moral light you are speaking of?
J.T. Yes; it is light in the sense in which you say, My soul was enlightened, and enlightened by what is said. You might be in a dark cellar, and yet say that; you are enlightened by what is said.
S.J.H. Paul and Silas in prison were not affected by their circumstances; they had light.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would it be like "God is fight"?
J.T. Just so. Now as regards the effect of the city, the verses read in the next chapter show how benign, how enriching it is; that the whole scene below is refreshed and invigorated by it. All the effects of sin that have been working are removed by the healing power of the leaves of the tree of life. Chapter 22 brings out the healing effect of this wonderful tree on the nations and all below. And surely there is some moral connection now as to its effect in the conditions among the brethren; as to whether this matter is not practical so that we might be healed today. Let us be healed! Why should there be a laceration amongst us?
C.H.H. Would @Philippians 2: 15, 16 in any way correspond with her shining? "Among whom ye appear as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life".
{152}
J.T. Quite; it is clearly applicable because it shows that what we are now is to work out then in this wonderful system; the tree of life in the midst of the street, and this river, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb. We can only touch it, but if we are at all able to take the thing in spiritually we shall see what an effect it will all have. When what we are now is turned to account by the power of God, what an effect it will have on all below! And so God is going to change this present earth and its woes benignly through the assembly, through the heavenly city, to bring about a state of recovery all working out from the heavenly city above.
H.H. As to the producing of the twelve fruits, in each month its fruit, what would be the relation of the fruit to the month?
J.T. I think it is to show that we are still in time. We have been dealing with an eternal state of things in chapter 21, but now we are dealing with time, and assembly time is most precious and should not be wasted. We were speaking of that lately in connection with @Luke 22: 14: "And when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him". It is an administrative position that the Lord was in. The Lord's supper was instituted in administrative conditions.
H. H. Who benefits by this fruit? Who eats it?
J.T. It is for the inhabitants of the city, for the elite -- not for the nations or the Jews; they get the leaves. Israel may get some of the fruit because they are at the gates, but the inhabitants of the city are the assembly, or those raised from the dead at the same time, and the fruit of the tree of life is entirely for the celestial residents of the heavenly city. It is their fruit.
C.H.H. Would the twelve fruits refer to variety in ministry, like the produce of Solomon's twelve
{153}
superintendents? The provision would not only be fresh, but would have variety in it.
J.T. Just so; every month something different. That ought to affect us too.
C.H.H. Would you apply it in any sense to our monthly meetings?
J.T. They are numerous now. We had about twenty meetings last year lasting for three days each; and we need freshness for these. In addition I do not know how many weekly meetings, so-called special meetings, we had. What you suggest is well worth considering, as to how we are going to maintain freshness; because we are learning how to be fresh now. The bride begins with freshness. After one thousand years she is still fresh. Well, these celestial people that are contemplated in the heavenly city are maintained in freshness by these twelve kinds of fruit. But then, that is not the eternal state of things; eternity is not in mind. What is in mind is time. God made time and used it first, and He shows us how to use it. We should learn to use it, and not come late to the meetings, for we are dealing now with assembly time; not with factory time, but with assembly time. "And when the hour was come", it says, "he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him". It is a question of administration, and time is precious so as to get everything done. Things are not to be left undone.
H.H. He must have been there early in order to sit down at the right time.
Ques. A good deal of sleeping goes on in assembly time. It is not the time for that, is it?
J.T. Jonah learned something about sleeping at the wrong time!
S.J.H. Inasmuch as it is the holy city, and heavenly, and comes down from God, why does it need a high wall?
{154}
J.T. Because of conditions below. We have already said that the millennium has to do with conditions on the earth; the remedy is from heaven. The remedy does not arise from conditions on the earth but from conditions in heaven; it is to bring out and establish the precedence of heaven in everything. So that is the point here, that she comes down from God out of heaven with conditions made to meet earthly conditions. That is not what you get in chapter 21; at the beginning of that chapter she comes down in relation to new creation, a new heaven and a new earth. But here she comes down in relation to men in the flesh, the nations and Israel as a nation.
S.J.H. The wall is not for our protection, for holiness would take the place of that; but it is needed for the earth.
J.T. The idea of the wall is to educate our minds that there is no admission of evil there at all. The heavenly city is proof against anything of that kind, and that would be conveyed in the idea of the height of the wall.
Rem. In the beginning of chapter 21 there is no clock, but at the end of the chapter there is the clock.
J.T. In the city it is administrative time, and therefore very precious. Of course factory time is precious too, and the scale of wages is very high; but it is not so high as that with which we are dealing now, the value of assembly time. It is in view of what is here below. The holy city has come into time as the Lord came into time, as God came into time. The first part of chapter 21 leads us into eternity, where time is no more; but time is stressed here, and that we should be kept free in time. If we are late for the meeting, we are very apt to be flustered if the brethren start to sing a hymn and we are not just in the state to join in. We need to be adjusted. We all, perhaps, transgress in this sense, but it is well to keep it before us. Assembly time is precious and when the
{155}
hour was come the Lord was there. He did not just come in to take His place; He was already there.
R.H. Verse 10 of chapter 22 says; "The time is near".
J.T. Just so. The meaning of that is seen in what follows: "Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still; and let the filthy make himself filthy still; and let him that is righteous practise righteousness still; and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still". There is no time for setting up anything new, to introduce any new ways or principles; the time is near. God would say that what you are you must remain, as it were, judicially; if you are filthy there is no time to change. It is to impress us with the seriousness of being filthy, I think that is what is meant. God would say that if you are in that state there is no time left; adjustment must take place at once or not at all.
R.W.S. Does all this bear on the fact that God seems to be going on with what He has already in hand without enlarging things greatly? The additions are not so frequent as they were in the past. Does the wall appear to be higher because of the various tests coming up?
J.T. Yes; the need for the height of the wall is being stressed, and the measuring of it too. As has been remarked, Let him that is filthy be filthy still, a most solemn thing. But it must be ironical with God. The nearness of the time when God will say that all is over is to impress us with the seriousness of not settling matters. Then the final thought in mind is in verse 16 -- the way in which the Lord comes back to us after carrying us to such heights, as it were, in this book, carrying us into the heavenlies, and then back to the wonderful administration on earth for one thousand years, with this wonderful structure functioning, enlightening the universe. It
{156}
is not simply that things are shown in a general way, but the assembly is like a temple; the nations inquire there to get light; those below get light and instruction from it. But after all the instruction of that is over, the Lord comes back to ordinary conditions such as we have here in Montreal, and He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies. I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". The Lord would say just that to us: "I Jesus". Because after all, in the government of God we may continue on here a little longer, and if so it is Jesus; as on the mount of transfiguration they looked around after all the glory, and it was Jesus alone with themselves. That is the position. His angel has been sent to testify these things to us in our localities, in the assemblies, and then the response: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come". We are to be active on those lines; the Lord would say to us right now, Go on with those lines. It is "I Jesus".
He is going to keep on as "I Jesus". And the angels are subject, they are sent out as ministers; and we are to go on telling people about the living water. We are not to enlarge so much on the river that flows out of the throne as to point out that the living water is available. It is really the living water, the Spirit, that is in mind in the gospel in the present dispensation. It is not a millennial matter, but a matter of the present dispensation, God presenting Himself in the gospel and in the presence of the Holy Spirit here below in the assembly, to save men. That is what these verses mean, I believe. So that it says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely". So that we can move on maybe for a few weeks more on Sunday evenings, and the Lord will say, I am going to be with you.
{157}
C.H.H. It is not the missionary aspect, but more what is just here.
J.T. What "I Jesus" will do. What He was there in Palestine He is here now to His people, to the everyday man and woman. We have Him as the truth and the Spirit as the water of life.
Ques. What about "The Spirit and the bride say, Come"?
J.T. I think that is to stress how the Spirit is personally amongst us. The question often comes up as to whether we speak to the Spirit; but here He Himself is viewed as speaking, that He is affected Himself in regard of the coming of the Lord Jesus. And then the bride also says, "Come". It is a beautiful response given with that of the Spirit, which will be infinite for the coming of the Lord.
{158}
FULNESS
@Genesis 15: 16 (last clause); @Romans 11: as (last two clauses); @Ephesians 1:22, 23
I have in mind to speak about fulness. It may be spoken of under three heads: first, fulness in connection with the Amorites, for though the word is not actually used in @Genesis 15: 16, the word 'full' gives the same sense: "the iniquity ... is not yet full"; then the fulness of the gentiles, referring to ourselves as part of the race; and thirdly, the fulness of Christ, alluding to the assembly of which we, as christians, form part.
My first scripture, being of a negative character, will not detain me beyond the measure proper to it. It refers to sin becoming exceedingly sinful. The law has this effect, "that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful", @Romans 7:13. But the Amorites had no law to effect this. Sin was working in them without it, and it is working now without the aid of the law in many parts; but instead of things becoming in any sense better and better on the earth they are becoming worse and worse, and this is not to be changed from within. It will be changed from without; that is, it will be changed by God's judicial action, a sorry contemplation for men without God, as there is no hope of a millennium working out of present conditions in the race, no Utopia or other change of that kind. There will be a wonderful time on earth, but it will not be by what works out from within, but by God coming in and removing sin. It will be effected by God. He has appointed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness, that is in the sense of physical judgment. But preceding the physical judgment, and including it, there will be a terrible dealing with actual sin, that is, sin according to its true meaning, which is lawlessness; men doing
{159}
their own wills, whether as nations, tribes, families or individuals. God will produce ways and means by which sin will be effectively dealt with and removed. A little evidence of it will remain for a thousand years, but it will be ultimately judicially removed, removed thoroughly and for ever. It is not that sin essentially is destroyed, it remains, but in God's own wise ways it will be relegated to its own place and allowed to continue in some sense but entirely under divine regulation.
Now this scripture in Genesis does not contemplate that. It contemplates something in the form of sin progressing and coming to the full. God Himself says to Abraham, I am waiting for that, and you will have to wait too, and while you are waiting things will become better in your family. God had taken up Abraham and his family, indeed the word 'fulness' attaches to it, and the fulness of Israel is coming in too. It is not fulness in the sense of wickedness but in the sense of what is law-abiding, for God says of Abraham, "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him", @Genesis 18: 19. He intimates in that chapter by the expression "after him" that he would die and be buried, but not cease to exist, for Abraham was held in the divine mind from the outset as essential to the divine purposes. And things were to go well with his family: "They shall keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, in order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what he hath spoken of him". So that Abraham was not to fear in this announcement of God, that the iniquity of the Amorites had not yet come to the full. Abraham might say, I am here where they are, for he was a stranger there for the moment, a pilgrim and a stranger. The Amorites were not pilgrims and strangers, they belonged to the place according to their own reckoning, and as sin continued developing among them God was saying, It is going to be that way until
{160}
it comes to the full. This is a most serious thing for anyone who is admitting of any of this world's lawlessness, admitting of it either by word, gesture, walk or conduct, for God says, This must come to an end! It is going to come to an end but it must come to the full first-a most serious matter! He will wait, will give plenty of time, so to speak, until it comes to the full. Sometimes we question why current occurrences are happening, why God allows them, but that is God's prerogative, it is His way. If He intends that sin should go on after Adam and Eve transgressed, intends that it should go on and on as it has done for all these years, centuries, millenniums, that is His prerogative. If God wills that sin is to work out to its fulness, then He will do something drastic, something final.
So it is that if in any way our relations, public or private, are on the principle of sin, that is lawlessness, for that is the meaning of the word 'sin'. It is something that has no law; law in the true sense of the word is not admitted. Perhaps we admit it in some matters but not in everything, but God will bring everything to pass in the believer. There must be an end to lawlessness in him, and if it does not cease God may have to say to us, 'It has gone on too long'. The Amorites¬ sin went on too long and therefore the Amorites, as a whole, were not saved. The Israelites had no commission to convert the Amorites. Whatever commission they had as to them was for their destruction-a most solemn thing! God indicated that from the time He was speaking to Abraham until that should come about, approximately four hundred years should elapse. The Israelites should go down to Egypt themselves, and the principle of their stay in Egypt would be that lawlessness in them should come to an end. Hence the law made sin exceeding sinful.
Sin was never more sinful than it was in Israel, that is the Israel of the flesh, and the law helped that. So
{161}
it is now that christendom has taken that same place. The Lord said to the scribes and Pharisees, "Ye, fill ye up the measure of your fathers", @Matthew 23: 32. That is, their measure was sin in the sense of murder, and that measure is brought into the history of Israel. Even Cain's murder comes into that, and the example set by their fathers is filled up. A converted man is not going to pursue his father's ways. His father was unconverted and died unconverted, and he is not going to fill out his father's sins if he is converted. Yet the Jews were doing that. But the time of conversion has come and the Lord says, 'There will be no hope for them unless they repent'. Then He acts judicially to prevent their conversion. It is a terrible thing to continue in a course of lawlessness in any degree, because God is saying, 'It must stop'. He has fixed the day and the moment for it to stop, and there is no hope for you after that. Take advantage of the converting time!
In @Isaiah 6: 10 it says, "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and healed". And in @2 Thessalonians 2: 11, 12 we read, "For this reason God sends to them a working of error, that they should believe what is false, that all might be judged who have not believed the truth, but have found pleasure in unrighteousness". How solemn it is that God should act in this way, allowing sin to go on and on until He Himself stops it! He has fixed a day when it is going to be stopped, and then it will be stopped. But the point is for you to stop now. It is your opportunity now to stop, your opportunity to be converted; not so when the Lord says in Isaiah, "Lest they ... be converted, and healed". So it is that the apostle Paul says of the Jews, "That they may fill up their sins always", @1 Thessalonians 2: 16.
{162}
Even in a christian community, like the assembly of Corinth, there are these warnings. The apostle Paul says, for instance, "Let your women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak; but to be in subjection, as the law also says", @1 Corinthians 14:34. And no doubt they were. 1 Corinthians thus is full of directions. We may say, 'They are only trifles'; but not one of them is a trifle. So the apostle goes on to say, "But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant" (verse 38). Do not say, What is the matter with God? I am speaking from the word of God, and God says, "But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant". And so elsewhere the Lord says, "Let the filthy make himself filthy still", @Revelation 22: 11. You may say, That does not comport with the gospel, but I reply, It comports with the word of God. God is saying that to a christian company some of whom are lawless, and He may be saying it ironically, but it might help some who are standing in their own light to see what they are doing. The principle is that if people will be that, and they show that they are going to be that, God says, I am determined they shall be that; I have fixed the day, let them be it, let them be filthy! It says also in the same verse, "And he that is holy, let him be sanctified still". That statement is perfectly suitable and logical, but for God to say, 'If a man be filthy, let him be filthy', should arrest us.
What past history is involved? Matters have been neglected and are still being neglected, and they may stand like that.
So it was with the Amorites, their condition was fixed; it was only a matter of years, four hundred years. God showed remarkable longsuffering in allowing the Amorites to go on for that four hundred years. No wonder that when Joshua crossed the Jordan, and Israel with him bearing the ark, the symbol of divine power, so that the waters of Jordan rolled back to the city Adam and were cut off toward
{163}
the Dead Sea, the Amorites began to quake and fear! The time had come, the four hundred years had spent themselves, and there was nothing for the Amorites but destruction. So it is now, for we are living in times of this kind when sin is mounting up to heaven. Why is God not striking? Why does He allow the things that are happening? The best answer to that is that He is doing it. If God did not allow these things to go on as they are, they could not go on; God is ordering it. But let those who have part in the light, outwardly at least, take notice that we may be drawn into that whirlwind of things. We may be drawn into it although christians, or at least nominal christians, and it may happen that the iniquity will come to the full and God will strike and it will be finished! I cannot say too much about the negative side but it is a solemn thing. Sin at the present time is becoming exceedingly sinful, not so much in China, India or South Africa, for there it is no question of the Lord, but it is in christendom where sin in its nakedness is working, and God is allowing it.
Now over against that we have "the fulness of the nations" coming in. It is not the fulness of time for the nations, though that also is found in the Scriptures. The fulness of time for the nations is measured by years, God having allotted a certain time to work out something with the nations as nations. But the verse I read in @Romans 11 is not the fulness of times for the nations but "the fulness of the nations", or the gentiles, and that is not a matter of wickedness. You might say it is if you looked around, but God is not dealing with it like that in this scripture. He is not leaving the human race for the devil altogether, for He is saying, I am working out something according to My purpose in the nations, and their fulness will be that. That is what these readings mean and others like them, and what the gospel implies. Consider the remarkable meeting at Jerusalem in @Acts 15, what we
{164}
may call a church council, perhaps the only one ever held that was owned of God. There were many afterwards but we cannot say God owned them, yet we can say God owned that council, and it was a remarkable time. Paul and Barnabas went there from Antioch because of certain teachings that had come down from Jerusalem. The apostles were there and Barnabas and Paul went there from Antioch to see about this matter. It was a matter of administration, a matter of adjustment of doctrine. It is a very important matter that doctrine be right. We have already been speaking today of the doctrine of Balaam, an awful thing! It takes form at certain times when some unrighteous conduct is condoned in a place and presently it is legalised and formulated into doctrine. Balaam's sin was that, "the doctrine of Balaam" it is called. Then, too, there was "the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes".
Now this may be going on with us in certain communities, as it went on at Jerusalem in some sense. There were those there of the Pharisees suggesting Pharisaic conditions, and others, perhaps Sadducees, who worked out judicial reasons for certain evil conduct, requiring that the christians who had been liberated by the death of Christ be brought into bondage. Christ had set them free, He had said that Himself, "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free", @John 8:36. Hence the wickedness of persons formulating the doctrine that saints must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses, which is what they were saying at Jerusalem. It was wickedness. So Paul and Barnabas went up from Antioch and were received by the apostles. The apostles were not infected by the doctrine, thank God; they were kept throughout. But others had been infected, though not the mass of the people. They came together and Paul and Barnabas told them about the wonderful works of God among the nations. It exhilarated them
{165}
to hear how the Spirit of God was working abroad among the nations. Idolatry was overthrown, for many hundreds, I suppose thousands, were converted in Asia Minor, as Paul says elsewhere, "So that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ", @Romans 15: 19. I do not suppose he had gone all the way at that time. Thus they had a very encouraging and profitable time at Jerusalem at that first great council. We speak of it more properly today as an assembly meeting. Peter got up at the end of the discussions and said, "Brethren, ye know that from the earliest days God amongst you chose that the nations by my mouth should hear the word of the glad tidings and believe", @Acts 15: 7. He says, "by my mouth", not 'by my writings'. The gospel was not spread abroad among the heathen by writings, writings came in after that. The testimony was by word of mouth, which is usual, and the confirmation is by writing. The writing is to endure but the testimony is from man's mouth. Peter says, By my mouth the gentiles were to hear. Then James gets up immediately, or at least, shortly afterwards, and says, "Simon has related how God first visited to take out of the nations a people for his name".
Now that is what is meant by "the fulness of the nations". It has been going on, and it is going on tonight in this very hall in a little way. The intent is that as we sit here these three days and talk together the Spirit of God may do something, and that something is to separate us from the world, to take us out from among the nations for Himself. You get nothing of it in the newspapers. You may get religious notices, some of them announcing the preaching of the gospel too, but this matter is not public news, it is the news of heaven-of what God is doing. He is doing it even on the battlefields. All this helps to make it clear that the fulness of the nations refers to the saints,
{166}
ourselves, and all the saints that have been gathered out from among the nations, including those from among the Jews, since Pentecost until now, and those who are yet to come. This verse implies that the work is going to continue on until the last soul is secured for God. May God grant that something of a separating character may go on in the heart of every one of us here, something of a sanctifying character that will make us usable by God and pleasing to Him! The fulness of the nations, what a time it is! The very suggestion implies that God is taking out of the nations a people for Himself, to dwell among them. That is going on, and it will go on too, for though the time left may not be very long there will be completion. It really synchronises with the completion of the assembly.
I want to come to the assembly in verse 22 of @Ephesians 1. Ephesians is the assembly epistle par excellence in the sense of blessing, not exactly in the sense of order, government or administration, but in the sense of blessing. The Spirit of God has singled out that assembly for the apostle Paul, that he might write to it the fulness of heaven's mind and heart in regard to the gospel and the ministry in which it culminates. It involves the gathering out of the assembly and forming it into one body; as is said here, "The assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all". What a thought that is! We can think of it by itself, so to speak, abstractly, but how blessed and how great it is too that we should be able to think of it as inclusive of ourselves at this very minute; for the work that is going on at this very minute in relation to it all is in view of translation. So the Lord is said here to be given to be "Head over all things to the assembly"; not here Head of the assembly, it is said elsewhere that He is "head of the body, the assembly". We get that idea in Colossians, and in Ephesians too, but here He is given to be
{167}
"Head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all".
I would encourage the brethren to transfer their minds from the fulness of the gentiles to this thought of the assembly, which is the same thing only viewed in another way. How patiently God has gone on with the nations and raised up governments century after century to keep order, to police the world, keep down evil, restrain it, so that this precious thing should be brought out, the fulness of the nations. I do not say that organised government has had anything to do directly with that, though used of God; it is the Spirit of God who has done it through the influence of the teaching from above. Then we transfer our minds from that to the great thought of the assembly, Christ's body. It is "the fulness of him who fills all in all". Paul prays "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints", @Ephesians 1: 17, 18. This is all a prayer on our behalf, and it goes on: "and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come; and has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all", @Ephesians 1: 19 - 23. Dear brethren, I have read those verses because of their magnificent richness. And they are all applicable to us. They are not written about the Jews or any other nation, tribe or kingdom, they are
{168}
written about the saints that form the assembly, the people of Christ at the present time. Such have received the Spirit on the principle of faith, as it is said in this chapter, "In whom ye also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of his glory" (verses 13, 14).
So that what I have read is one of the most magnificent passages that applies to us, to our very selves, though not to us exclusively. It applies to myriads, extending back for over nineteen centuries, and it applies to our very selves at this present time. What is going on here in this small way is the continuance of this work of God, so that there should be what is called "the assembly" over which Christ is Head; it is great enough to be His body, the expression of Himself, the fulness of Himself. It is marvellous "the fulness", and yet that is spoken of creatures. The assembly is not divine, yet it is said to be the fulness of a divine Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, "the fulness of him who fills all in all". That expression could only apply to God. Christ is God, the One who fills all in all is God. Indeed it is said in @1 Corinthians 15, "That God may be all in all". That is the great ultimate of all the operations of God and it enters into what I am saying, for we ourselves here, a few christians in this city of Montreal, gathered from many parts, we belong to that. These meetings have in mind that heaven has had to do with us, and that being so we would like to know what is in the mind of God concerning this wonderful formation called the assembly, which is Christ's body, His fulness. It is not stated as being simply the fulness of Christ, but the fulness of Him who fills all in all, suggesting God; for that Person is God; Deity is
{169}
there, and yet the assembly is the fulness of that! In Colossians the fulness of Deity is Christ, "For in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell" (chapter 1: 19); and so in chapter 2: 9. The fulness of the Deity is undoubtedly in Christ personally, and the fulness of Christ is the assembly.
I cannot say much more, I have arrived at the limit of the matter. The great ultimate of God, in that sense, is Christ, "Head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all". There we have Deity-God. It is God in Christ, of course, but nevertheless it is God. We would not alter that, and, dear brethren, we belong to that. Is it not enough to move us, to make us see what we are missing if we are not practically in it? How can I afford to be out of it, to say nothing of the danger! If it is mine according to divine light I want to be in it, otherwise I can hardly be classified as a responsible person. This is what is within our reach, that those who are real christians according to divine light are the fulness of Christ, "who fills all in all". How marvellous! That is really what the epistle to the Ephesians is throughout the book, wherein christianity in its fulness is set out. It is applied mainly to the gentiles, though there are some Jews; but now it is almost exclusively gentiles. And it covers this wonderful inheritance that has been brought down to us while we are still here on earth, but about to be translated to heaven; meanwhile we are being purified by current conditions so as to be fit for translation, suitable for the pleasure of God.
{170}
PURIFICATION (1)
@John 3: 1 - 12; @Ezekiel 36: 24 - 32
J.T. The thought is that we might trace a little the idea of purification. The third chapter of John, which is no doubt well known by most of us, leads in our subject in a basic sense. The Lord evidently selected the man to open up the subject to him, and he represents a class. He remained in the Sanhedrim after his conversation. He never openly identified himself with Christ until the Lord died. There are many like that now, and so we should have open minds as to the setting of this subject, to include in them persons who are not separate outwardly, and yet are genuine to some extent. The Lord may be working with them, and we have to keep those people in mind as well as those we know who are in the truth. There are many undoubtedly in mind in @2 Timothy 2: 19, "The Lord knows those that are his", and there are some marks which they bear and, although carrying worldliness, when put to the test they show that they have some regard for the Lord and secretly are indeed His. Nicodemus represents this class. Therefore, it is said, "There was a man from among the Pharisees, his name Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him". This was his speech. The Lord did not accost him first. He accosted the Lord. He came to Jesus by night and addressed Him as "Rabbi" which shows he recognised Him as a teacher; he himself was a teacher. It goes on to show that he links the Lord with God, which is a great matter "We know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless
{171}
God be with him". Therefore, the Lord has a basis to work on and proceeds to use one of the double 'verilies', "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God". That is the Lord's first remark, and if we bear it in mind, it will help us throughout. One has to be born anew. The Lord does not say to him that personally he had to be, for he had been born anew. Hence, the true persons of this type have something, some discernment, and the Lord's first remark shows that they have got to face this fact that new birth has to be known and felt, so He proceeds further to open up the next remarks.
C.H.H. Would you say that the fact that he uses "we" indicates that he represents a class? Would that bring the whole class that he represents under the responsibility of the present day?
J.T. I suppose so. This light the Lord furnishes, this teaching, is for them especially, in fact, wholly, for already the Lord had discriminated against others.
The "but" of the first verse discriminates. Others, we are told, the Lord had no confidence in. It says in chapter 2: 24, "But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man". Therefore, the Lord Jesus is regarded here as come from heaven, having discriminative feelings amongst men. They are different in His eyes. There is a difference between those that can be trusted and those who cannot. He knew. We might as well just eliminate them if we only knew, but of course, the gospel includes them. This is not exactly a gospel address. It is a teaching address and they are excluded in the Lord's mind. Men like Nicodemus are included in what He has to say.
S.McC. It is interesting that over against what Nicodemus says, "We know", the Lord says, "We
{172}
speak that which we know". He does not say, 'I speak that which I know', but "we speak that which we know". What do you think the Lord has in mind in that "we" there over against the "I say unto thee"?
J.T. I think it would be the 'we' of authority, one who knows. "We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness". The "ye" there addressed to Nicodemus is, I would think, the Pharisees, those who did not receive the Lord's witness. What would you say?
S.McC. I was wanting to know about the use of the word 'we'. He had been speaking about "I" all through. Then he says in this verse, "We speak". Is He including the disciples?
J.T. I think it is more authority. They are not yet in the picture as to teaching in John, because John the baptist had not yet been cast into prison. The Lord had not formally started His ministry yet. The "we" would be in authority. As regards the "we" Nicodemus used, "we know", that would be probably his own class, persons he knew who had formed a judgment as he had about the Lord Jesus that He had come from God. He was basing it on signs. But the other "we", I think, is the "we" of authority. The Lord might have included others. He might have included John the baptist, but it would seem that what He had to say was referring to Himself because He says, "If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?". His mind turns to those who did not believe and He uses the singular, referring to Himself personally. So it seems as if at the outset we should learn to speak in the same way, with some measure of authority if we know, and if the persons we are speaking to show that they are against the truth, we have to tell them.
{173}
A.A.T. I was wondering whether "we know" is knowledge in the matter of growth?
J.T. It is a question of whether Nicodemus¬ "we know" is a matter of knowledge of some persons like himself who by the signs that the Lord performed concluded that He came from God. You might call that growth. I should think there is some sense that Nicodemus implies that he had thought of what the Lord had been doing. So we have to judge every one of these 'we knows' by itself, as to what it may mean. Now what is before us is that Nicodemus is an interested man. The Lord acknowledges that in the way He speaks to him. There were others that He would not speak to in that way.
J.W.B. Would "Rabbi", as Nicodemus calls Him, involve the thought of seeing? In the first chapter, we have the two disciples of John who say "Rabbi ... where abidest thou?", and He says, "Come and see". Then Nathanael calls him "Rabbi" at the end of the first chapter, and the Lord tells him that he shall "see greater things than these".
J.T. He says to Him, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God". That "Rabbi" is of great value. It enters into John's line, John's way. It is a title that is much used in John. It ends in the word "Rabboni" used by Mary Magdalene, "My Teacher", which shows that it runs through John and it ought to appeal to us in our present inquiry as to whether we are ready to be taught, because John implies that the christian ought to be taught. John says that they shall be all taught of God. There is a great amount of teaching if we listen and profit by it. Nathanael is with the Lord and he is a quick learner, too. He is a much quicker learner than Nicodemus. Nicodemus is a slow learner, but still he learned. The point is to be learners, take in the right teaching.
S.W.P. Would Nicodemus present himself as willing for adjustment?
{174}
J.T. I do not know whether he is willing to go the whole way. The sequel would hardly show that he was immediately ready to go the whole way with the Lord, because he stayed in the council. Nathanael is a quick learner. The Lord called him, "An Israelite, in whom there is no guile". So it is said, "Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth". Rather than speaking roughly, He gave a heavy dose of the truth, but He did not give that same dose to Nicodemus. Nathanael was a quick learner. He says, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile". He is very different from Nicodemus. No honours at all are paid to Nicodemus, but there is a great deal paid to Nathanael because he is a quick learner. "An Israelite in whom there is no guile". The Lord does not say that of Nicodemus. Then "Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel". That is to say, he is a quick learner, and the Lord knows that because he quotes from the Psalms, and the Lord further says, "Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these. And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man". We can see in Nathanael we have a quick learner which the Lord values. It would seem as though Nathanael became an apostle, although his name is not mentioned. Bartholomew is probably the same person.
{175}
C.H.H. Would you think that Nicodemus was never quite purified from associations?
J.T. Just as Jonathan remained as he was in his father's house and died with his father, Nicodemus, you might say, denied the Lord in a sense. You may say that he came out in time. Joseph of Arimathaea came out as the Lord died. I would say that they are a class that come out in the end. The real thing is there and so it was in John's time. It is a sorrowful thing that they are not associated with the Lord until He died. We cannot say how far they went.
S.W.P. The Lord spends much more time with Nicodemus than with Nathanael unfolding what He has in His mind.
J.T. I think the Lord would consider him a man of influence who might, as far as he could go in the council, make some seed be fruitful, because what he says in chapter 7 shows that he was a genuine person and he really suffered: "Art thou also of Galilee? Search and look, that no prophet arises out of Galilee". He is under reproach there and yet he had not left the council. I am sure there are many like that and we must have our eyes open to it.
A.S.B. Is there something in the fact that Nathanael is singled out? The Lord says of him, "An Israelite", but Nicodemus, "The teacher of Israel", is in the system and great responsibility lies with him.
J.T. The Lord would imply in His remarks in that sense that Nicodemus was in His mind and possibly usable to spread the seed of the truth. Any person like that should be. He is what would be called an honest man. Although he was not separate, he is usable to some extent. I think if we follow the line of ministry, the revival, we see that that is exactly what happened. The truth is presented to persons who might take it in and who might spread it, but who did not all come out. Nicodemus was on the right
{176}
line, but although very slow he came out in time, and brought an offering of spices.
E.C. Would you say something about the necessity of new birth as the basis for purification?
J.T. That is the thought we had. We have now finished what came up-which was very important -- with regard to Nicodemus and Nathanael, and we have this matter of purification which the Lord does not mention at the first. The Lord's first remark is, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God". Now that is not purification. It is the Lord's second remark that unfolds the idea of purification. Nicodemus says, "How can a man be born being old?", showing that he is governed by natural thoughts; yet he has other thoughts which are good. "Can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born?" is a purely natural inquiry which shows how his mind is running, and the Lord answers, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee ...". These 'verilies' are the insertions of special truths. There are about twenty four of them in the whole book. This one is "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit". That is an addition. The Lord is not repeating. He is adding another thought, namely, water. He is adding to the idea of being born. Being born is not so much stressed as the word 'anew'. That is another time. The Lord is stressing that more than the idea of water, but He is stressing water, too.
C.H.H. Is it a continuity of the stone water vessels of purification going right through John?
J.T. There is probably something in that. I think, however, the Lord is opening up a wholly new matter with Nicodemus, and He is bringing in the idea of the water which was for the purification of the Jews. That is being used. That is turned into wine, and, therefore, finished, as it were, that idea. What the
{177}
Lord says about the water in verse 5 is, I think, another thing. He has much more on His mind which could be opened up in the earlier chapter which refers to the millennium. Here is what refers to christianity, I would say. "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit"-water is put before the Spirit-"he cannot enter into the kingdom of God". The kingdom of God is not the millennium exactly. It is what is going to take form and would take form in John as christianity.
S.McC. What would you say refers to the millennium?
J.T. The second chapter, "According to the purification of the Jews". They were empty and the Lord says, "Fill the water-vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he says to them, Draw out now", and the result is what typifies Israel in the future, I would say, but this chapter refers to christianity. The Lord has christianity in mind, heavenly things. He is teaching purification here, at once introducing the idea of water in connection with new birth, that you are to be born not only of the Spirit, but of water.
S.McC. Is this being born of water and of Spirit an automatic process consequent upon the new birth, or is it an intelligent moral process in the believer?
J.T. It is an additional thought. It is an application of the idea of new birth because He says, "Except any one be born of water". Notice it is "born of"; 'born of' is not an idea of cleansing, but water is. The water is used in the process of birth the same as the water of the "washing of regeneration". Regeneration is not cleansing by itself, neither is new birth cleansing by itself. The water is additional and is jointly used in the process. It is the cleansing element, the idea of purification inserted basically in the new beginning. It is a new beginning.
G.McP. Does it represent the power of the truth
{178}
working in our souls to bring us into the heavenly side of the truth?
J.T. It is too soon to say heavenly. In saying these things the Lord says, "If I have said the earthly things to you". New birth belongs to the earthly. It is an earthly term. We are not born in heaven. We are born on earth. Nor is new birth introducing us into sonship, or even the position of children. It is less than that. We have to be careful in the use of terms, only that the word 'water' is here before the word 'Spirit' in this operation of the Spirit called new birth.
S.McC. The general thought is that new birth has to do with children. Sonship is on the line of gift, but children are in connection with birth.
J.T. This word goes that far. When the word 'children' is used in chapter 1, the idea of this teaching in chapter 3 is included. It is said, "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God", @John 1: 12, 13. Now new birth in chapter 3 is included in that but it does not go so far as the idea of being born of God. I think it is important to bear this in mind, otherwise we lump things, you know, and the Lord does not. He calls this matter in chapter 3 new birth, something that is earthly. He says, "If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?". Therefore, I remarked that the Lord has not gone on to the heavenly yet, nor to the idea of children. He is dealing basically with both. The idea of children brings us into a new status correlative with sonship but sonship takes us to heaven.
S.W.P. Would this be the basis on which we could receive the testimony in order to become children?
J.T. I think that Nicodemus shows in his history
{179}
that he was capable of receiving testimony. In fact, his opening remarks show this; He says, "We know that thou art come a teacher from God". He is very definite about that and he bases it on the signs. He is not an ordinary man and these are men we have to be watchful of and follow them up.
C.H.H. So that the seed of the word in Peter would be in advance of this.
J.T. Exactly. It is in advance of this; it is "The living and abiding word of God".
H.B. It speaks of being called "By glory and virtue". Would the thought of the virtue fit in somewhere in the earlier thought?
J.T. It would fit in the gospel. "Called us by glory and virtue". Peter has a great way of speaking in his epistles of one thing working on another thing and that working still on something else. We are getting the idea of new birth here. Something must flow out of that. The idea of virtue enters into the teaching set before Nicodemus. Nicodemus is himself a virtuous man.
C.DeB. This remark draws him out and causes him to think, not understanding what he was saying.
J.T. He would not get very far if he remained in the council. The council is not great enough for this man and he stayed too long in it.
S.McC. Would you help us on the difference between born of water and of Spirit and begotten of God?
J.T. We have not got so far in this chapter as the term begotten of God which John uses in chapter 2 of his epistle. We have to learn to come to a point, because John has in mind that we are to be learners or disciples and to address the Lord as "Rabbi".
Ques. The word 'born' is mentioned eight times here. Is that the teaching of this?
J.T. That is the thing to keep your eye open for. It is a teaching word and we are in a teaching section
{180}
and we are in the presence of the Teacher, the Lord Jesus, the heavenly Teacher, God Himself come down, who teaches, because it says, "And they shall be all taught of God" (@John 6: 45) and we are also in the presence of a man who is also a teacher, according to man, and there is something to be acknowledged in him. He is the teacher of Israel. The Lord calls him that and He says, You should know these things. It is a matter of importance that we have a man to deal with. Although he is in the council he may be talked to this way. You should know so-and-so. You know the Bible. He appealed to him in that way. So it is a teaching time. It is a teaching section.
C.H.H. Would "born" here go so far as to involve a new personality?
J.T. I do not think it goes so far, because you have got a person, then you have an individuality on new ground, and Nicodemus is not really that yet, because he is still in the council and he is still a teacher in Israel. You could hardly say that to any man in the Roman Catholic Church or Presbyterian. You can hardly go so far as to say that he is the teacher of Israel or of the Jews. He is hardly entitled to such an epithet as that, whereas Nicodemus was. The Lord recognises him as a teacher of Israel.
E.C. Would you say that entering the kingdom of God is a more practical matter than just seeing it? The water and the Spirit are required for purification to enter.
J.T. We have just got to that point. The Lord's first remark is plain enough: "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God". Then the next answer is "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God". Well now, did Nicodemus do that? Did he ever move, because the word 'enter' means movement; seeing does not except in the eye. Did he come into the kingdom when he put
{181}
the Lord in the tomb? What did he have in his mind when he put the Lord in the tomb? He did all honours to the Lord as far as you could speak of honours in burial, but the Lord is going to rise in three days, as He had already said, and Nicodemus, even in chapter 19, did not seem to know that. Therefore, did he really enter into the kingdom? We have to come to what happened in Nicodemus. He remained in the council.
E.C. We have to understand the bearing of the water on purification before we can enter?
J.T. Yes, whether we made a movement in that respect. He should have left the council and joined the disciples. The Lord says to them, "He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet". Could that be said to Nicodemus? I do not think so.
Not yet. He was not washed all over.
G.McP. Would it suggest the truth of baptism? I was thinking of what was said to Paul, "Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away".
J.T. That is another thing, washing away your sins. It is important to bring that in here because it would show that he was very like Nicodemus in that sense; he was tarrying, he was not going the whole way in Damascus, but he was going faster than Nicodemus, but he was not going fast enough for Ananias. He says, "Arise ... and have thy sins washed away", as much as to say, 'You are not going fast enough'.
Ques. Would this be one who would see the kingdom? He says there, "We know that thou art come a teacher from God". Did he see the kingdom of God?
J.T. I should not like to say that he did. He stayed in the Jewish system. He had no exercise as far as we can see, although he spoke nicely about the Lord, but then he is not leaving. The point is that the time had come for leaving, to be a disciple of
{182}
Jesus, and Nicodemus was not moving in relation to that because he did not leave the system that he was in.
Ques. You would say that he was born anew?
J.T. We said that in the beginning. He is not moving in relation to it.
S.W.P. Your thought of purification is primarily to be clear of what is accredited as religious.
J.T. You mean that purification implies that you can move? That is what Paul understood when Ananias said, "And now why lingerest thou? Arise".
Nicodemus was very slow. Paul was not just so slow, but he was too slow for Ananias. There are many tarrying today. They come just so far, and no further.
Ananias says to Paul, 'You are too slow. You should be a disciple and wash away your sins'. "Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away", because that is a symbol of what we are talking about, the purification of the Jewish system.
Rem. His sins were more ecclesiastical.
J.T. Just so. He was not a thief or robber. He was an ecclesiastical sinner.
W.L. I was wondering if what you have in mind is in line with 2 Timothy, "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel ... serviceable to the Master", @2 Timothy 2: 21.
J.T. That is the idea that we are at now. That requires separation and Nicodemus was not ready for that. Ananias is pointing that out to Saul: "And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away", meaning that you become a disciple of Jesus and no longer a Jewish disciple.
J.W.B. So that in @Revelation 22 it says, "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city". The movement is there, is it not?
{183}
J.T. We come to that later. We touch on all these things, to bring the whole thing, that is, the full thought of entering, not into fellowship only, but into the city, partaking of the tree of life, showing that it is a real thing there.
J.W.B. I was thinking of the movement.
J.T. Exactly. That is the thing to look for in any man we meet. Not simply what he says, but what movement is there with him? That is the reason the Lord uses the word 'water' in the second answer.
F.F. Would the form of water be something?
J.T. Yes, it is. It is the water of purification.
Ques. Are you suggesting that we should be on the look-out for such persons?
J.T. There are many of them. You cannot go very far with them. The Lord did not go very far with Nicodemus. He immediately went on with heavenly things. He implied to Nicodemus that 'You really do not believe what I am saying', but still he was born anew as the sequel shows. We cannot spend too much time with them. Apparently when the test comes they do not go all the way.
C.H.H. This water is not to be repeated? It is once and for all?
J.T. That is what the Lord says in chapter 13 "He that is washed all over". I do not think that Nicodemus was ready to be washed all over.
Ques. What would be looked for in our children to show that being born of water and the Spirit was taking place?
J.T. You have the whole thought before you. You have not anything less in baptising than that they should be clear of the world. Alas! They go in for the world. You have the whole thought before you. The Lord had whole thoughts here, but Nicodemus did not. He was holding back.
J.K. It says of Nicodemus that he knew He was come from God and that God was with Him. The
{184}
thought in verse 7 is that it is needful that movement should take place, not just knowing.
J.T. It says, "It is needful that ye should be born anew", meaning that the Pharisees or Israelites needed this. This second time that the Lord uses these words would mean that water is included in the word 'born anew'.
A.S.B. Is there something in the fact that Nicodemus initially recognises the Lord as teacher, Rabbi, but he does not travel very far in regard to seeing the kingdom? He sees the Lord personally as the Teacher, but he fails to recognise the fulness of the system of the kingdom of God.
J.T. Well, that is it. He was not ready for whole thoughts. "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him". They had whole thoughts. Nicodemus was not among them. He was not ready for that. That is in the second chapter. The time of discipleship had come and Nicodemus was not ready for it. Thousands are not ready for it. They are ready to read our writings but they are not leaving the place where they are. They are not leaving the council, as it were. That is the real test that we have. How far can you go in talking with a man like that? The question is how far is he ready to go with you.
C.H.H. Would following up the current ministry be the secret?
J.T. Therefore, the Lord challenges Nicodemus as to the Old Testament, saying as it were, What scripture are you studying? Where have you been brought up, in a seminary or college? You ought to know these things. You appeal to them on those lines as far as you can, all with a view to their moving, because the second answer of the Lord here is that he enters, and that is not the Presbyterian Church. He enters the kingdom of God; if he does not, what point is there in talking any more?
{185}
S.McC. Would you say something about the water and the Spirit, the difference between the two? Born of water seems to be a positive element: "Born of water and of Spirit".
J.T. I think it is a positive element, but it is not in itself positive. The positive thing is in the word 'birth' or regeneration, and therefore the Spirit given to him is not suggested here. In Titus we have, "Which he poured out on us richly". We have to wait for that until next time-this matter of the Spirit poured out. The Lord does not hint at that really, although we do get it in the passage in Ezekiel that we read: "I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you", but then the next word is, "I will put my Spirit within you". @John 3 does not allude to that in the instruction. The Lord does not mean to convey that one who has gone so far as new birth gets the Holy Spirit, because the blood has to be brought in afterward, and, therefore, the whole truth of the gospel must be brought in so as to set a man up in christianity.
S.McC. In a spiritual way, what does the water convey to your mind?
J.T. A negative way, what has cleansed the person in the making, you or me. I have got to be cleansed, or you. The water means that. It is negative. The positive thing remains.
S.McC. I think it is helpful, because some have tried to put into it the idea of the word.
J.T. We must learn to stop, because we are, so to say, learning scientifically. We must learn to stop at certain points and be clear about all up to that before you proceed further. The word in Titus is, "Which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour", but the Lord does not touch that here. He does not touch the idea of giving the Spirit yet. It is what the Spirit does. The Spirit is connected with both, the actual birth which is positive, and the water
{186}
which is a negative idea, because the positive thing is being cleansed. That is what is meant. Water is basic because we have got to maintain that cleansing.
G.McP. Does "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit", suggest the Spirit connected with water?
J.T. The first word is the Holy Spirit, but the second which is written with a small 's' means that the thing is spirit. It means that the thing taking place in him is spirit. He gives it a name, just spirit, not flesh. What we are speaking of requires the brethren to be teachable, to be pupils, to get things, you know. What do these words mean? Why does the Lord use one word that has to be spelt with the capital? He is speaking about the Holy Spirit. He is speaking of Him as an Operator, whereas the result of the operation is the thing called spirit.
G.McP. @Ezekiel 36 speaks of a "new spirit" and in verse 27 "my Spirit": "I will put my Spirit within you".
J.T. You do not get that in @John 3. The Lord does not go so far as that in @John 3.
Ques. Is @John 3 more the classroom, getting the thing?
J.T. That is what it is. If the brethren would only learn to stay there and learn that. That is what?
He is stopping short of the gift of the Spirit. He wants to insert the idea of the positive work by the Spirit in us which He calls spirit, and then He adds to that the idea of cleansing, the process, or element and that is the whole thought as far as He goes. He does not say that we are to have the Spirit as a gift in this passage so far.
A.L. Does a sense of this challenge us as to whether we have the Spirit?
J.T. There is time enough to say something about that as the apostle Paul said to the Ephesians, "Did
{187}
ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?". He does not say, 'Have you been born again?'. We have not come to that yet in our passage, but the Lord alludes to it in @Ezekiel 36. It says, first of all, "I will give you a new heart", that is the new birth, "and I will put a new spirit within you". That is the spirit, your own spirit, the kind of spirit you get, and then He says, "I will put my Spirit within you" that is the gift of the Holy Spirit, but the Lord does not reach that point in @John 3.
A.S.B. Your reference to the scientific side is rather interesting because in that line we have to do with what is basic. You used the word at the outset as though in relation to Nicodemus there are apparently two systems, the system connected with God which he recognises in the Lord, and the system of Israel; does not the principle of analysis enter into this section, determining what is basic?
J.T. Yes, and there is the general idea of God. Nicodemus, as it were, is as pronounced about it as the Lord would be. "Thou art come a teacher from God", but then there was teaching about God that he did not believe. We can go so far with the man, that he believed God and that he believes in Him, and we do, too, but there are things he cannot admit, that he is not ready for, and I believe that that is why we should learn to be pupils or disciples in order to get the things as in a classroom and get them by terms, see what the term means, so that when Paul came to Ephesus he did not speak about new birth because they were disciples anyway. They did not need to be born again. They were John's disciples, but they needed to be taught about the Holy Spirit as a gift. Therefore, he says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?". That is what we have to come to, to learn things, and discriminate between them.
C.H.H. Would it lead you to the conclusions
{188}
arrived at in @Romans 7, the flesh and the inward man? Would it lead as far as that?
J.T. I think it would. We begin to learn anyway the difference between flesh and spirit because you have all these things to call upon, all that is within you to praise God, but then you must label them and be sure you do not call on something that is corrupt or impure; it is pure things you call on and you have to label things and call them by their right names and that is what is being touched on here. Nicodemus, if he were only ready, would have got much more from the Lord than he did. The Lord named something and He named it new birth and He named the water included in it.
J.W.B. The woman in chapter 4 gets more, does she not?
J.T. Yes, because she was ready.
J.W.B. I was thinking about the word 'spirit' (chapter 4:24). The small 's' is used there.
J.T. She gets nothing about new birth, but she gets about the gift of the Spirit, the well of water springing up, which is important to bear in mind. She is further on than Nicodemus. She gets more than he does. So that the passage in Ezekiel distinguishes first the water as clean water, that they should be clean. "I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you". Then in verse 26, "And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh". We have to understand this. The word 'flesh' here is something that is impression able-a heart of flesh and not of stone. That is, the christian is impressionable. I do not think Nicodemus was to any great extent, but I think the woman of Sychar was impressionable. She got more. "And I
{189}
will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances". That is the next thing. I thought we might add that, that we might carry something with us at the end of this meeting in the way of a lesson, what the Lord is teaching Nicodemus here.
{190}
PURIFICATION (2)
@Titus 1: 12 - 16; @Titus 3: 1 - 7
J.T. It is thought that consideration of the persons and the circumstances in the scriptures we have looked into and are going to look into now and later will give help as to the understanding of them. We have had Nicodemus before us, also Nathanael. These persons are presented in the Scriptures regarding the truth before us; that is, new birth. And we should also remark that John's writings were before us this morning, John's gospel in which our subject is particularly found. Now we have Paul and Titus and the Cretans, the inhabitants of Crete. These later circumstances direct our minds to a somewhat lower state of human society as seen identified with them. Timothy is seen identified with what we may call the upper classes at Ephesus, presenting the higher features of the truth. He was left, we are told, at Ephesus. And our subject was touched on in that connection as pointing out that instead of new birth Paul referred to the reception of the Spirit. Instead of the operations of the Spirit, he referred to the Spirit Himself, the gift of God to be received. The truth in that way becomes somewhat elucidated for us, if our minds are involved in the ministry as the subjects also of the ministry. In Titus, however, we have the lower strata of humanity with a peculiar characteristic, for they are said to be always liars: "Cretans are always liars, evil wild beasts, lazy gluttons". And in connection with this statement we have, "All things are pure to the pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure". Their minds and consciences are defiled. Then we have to discriminate, as we were saying this morning, with regard to the characteristics of the persons that we have to deal with, in seeking to serve.
{191}
The need of purification is especially in mind in the epistle to Titus, for his ministry tells us in chapter 3 what we might call the modus operandi of salvation "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour"; for the gospel is in mind in the epistle, the whole thoughts of the gospel. Full thoughts are in mind. No question now of new birth but of what is needed for salvation. So what lies alongside the truth of salvation which is in mind, is the idea of eternal life, as an adjunct to what we are saved by. It involves eternal life, not that eternal life is presented here in the epistle as we hope to look into in the next reading, in what it is in itself essentially, but as part of the gospel. And it is therefore the elements of the glad tidings which are in mind in Titus. So it is said, "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that, having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life". So that in reading these sections the hope is that we may learn, in what may come before us, the truth of the gospel involving the need of purification and purity.
Ques. Verse 13 reads, "This testimony is true". Is that the thought in relation to teaching how conditions are such as needing this line of ministry?
J.T. The testimony he alludes to is what a prophet of their own said: "Cretans are always liars, evil wild beasts, lazy gluttons". So that evidently in seeking to
{192}
serve men, we have got to pay attention to what is public historically and what characterises them in their various sections. For instance, the Cretans are said to be liars here. The Galatians were fickle, uncertain, changeable. The Corinthians, on the other hand, were loose and worldly, instructed people but using their intelligence to penetrate the depths of wickedness. So that we have to learn as in the world what the world affords in the way of information, what history affords in the way of people, that the gospel meets every condition, but each condition has been located and observed.
S.McC. In line with what you are saying it is important to have a right judgment of things where we are, understanding the conditions that prevail, taking account of them and seeking to be saved from them. Do you have that in mind?
J.T. Yes, I thought of that. For instance, this city is a great industrial city. We have in @Acts 4: 27 the idea of "this city", whatever it may be, the one we are in, for instance, whatever the characteristics are, because we have to meet them, not only in the preaching of the gospel but in the ministry of the truth regularly amongst ourselves, because we have these conditions to contend with.
H.B. Is that seen in the Acts in relation to the Bereans? "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so", @Acts 17: 11.
J.T. Yes, very good. What is to be particularly kept in mind is the gospel, which Titus was to keep in mind too. In the chapter we had in John this morning we sought to confine it to just the facts presented, as to what the Lord calls "earthly things". He had in mind, however, to speak of heavenly things and to leave Nicodemus. He is part of the personnel, no doubt, but is left. The Lord launches out to
{193}
wider territory in the reference to @Numbers 21, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal". That is, He goes along and leaves Nicodemus, and proceeds into the full truth of eternal life; we find the same thing in this epistle. We find eternal life. "Paul, bondman of God, and apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect, and knowledge of the truth which is according to piety; in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time, but has manifested in its own due season his word, in the proclamation with which I have been entrusted, according to the commandment of our Saviour God", @Titus 1: 1 - 3. Now then there are these verses in chapter 3, "Having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life". Now it seems to me that we should clearly have in mind the distinction that is to be made between this epistle and @John 3. They are linked together very closely, but in @John 3 the Lord confines Himself after new birth to the subject of eternal life and its fulness in the gift of eternal life, that God so loved that He gave it. Whereas here eternal life is to augment the great truth of the gospel generally, of what is needed at Crete for salvation to these people that are characterised, as we have already seen, with the lying disposition and other features that go with that, sort of underworld conditions, the conditions of large cities such as this. The low conditions of large cities were to be known in order to be free from these conditions, and purity is essential. That is the whole idea of the gospel. It presents God's thoughts meeting the conditions, eternal life being included.
C.H.H. Do you think that eternal life as presented in John's writings brings you into the realm of attributed love, whereas eternal life in this epistle is in
{194}
view of being in the good of deliverance and salvation?
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. It is part of the gospel, but in a limited way, not rising to the full thought of eternal life and its heavenly relations.
S.McC. Say a little more about eternal fife in connection with its heavenly relations. What do you mean Ly it?
J.T. The Lord says to Nicodemus, "If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?". And then He goes on, "And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal. For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal". The Lord rises in His speaking from the level of the earth. Now in the millennial world the thought of eternal life will be largely linked up with the earth, but in christianity, which John's gospel touches very quickly, the idea is elevated from earthly things and linked with heavenly things.
C.H.H. In @John 4 the thought is the springing up into eternal life.
J.T. That shows that it is an elevated thought; whereas in the conditions contemplated in the epistle to Titus it is rather what you have to do with directly in a collateral way. It is not a heavenly line but what belongs to the gospel. Believers need eternal fife for deliverance from the conditions in which they are found.
S.McC. What you have said as to eternal life gives a touch to it that we have not had before. It has generally been suggested that sonship is linked with
{195}
heaven, and eternal life with the earth, whereas you are giving it a heavenly touch in the ministry now.
J.T. I think it is right to do that because we are not really dealing with the millennial world yet in John. @John 2 deals with it. The marriage at Cana of Galilee has it in mind and there the Lord begins to manifest His glory. "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him", @John 2: 11. What is the relation? The relation is christianity, what we come into, what eternal fife is in relation to christianity. Another thing that we ought to notice is that the minister here is a deputy. Titus is a deputy minister. The ministry is not his. It is Paul's. He says, "Eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time, but has manifested in its own due season his word, in the proclamation with which I have been entrusted, according to the commandment of our Saviour God". That is, Titus is just a deputy, an apostolic appointee for carrying out his orders. I do not know if that is very clear to the brethren, but it is a fact nevertheless that both Timothy and Titus were apostolic deputies. They are not commissioned men. We have to learn to make allowance for that and learn in a way to carry on such a ministry; that is, that we have not a commission. We do not say we have a commission, but still we have the truth and it is going to be carried out. It is to be kept and preached and taught.
A.S.B. Does verse 5 confirm that-"For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest go on to set right what remained unordered, and establish elders in each city, as I had ordered thee". *Establish* them -- delegated authority.
J.T. That is important. I do not suppose we know anything about that in any personal sense today, but it is important to keep it in mind as an element of truth that there is such a thing as that.
{196}
C.H.H. Would that be continued in @2 Timothy 2: 1, 2? "Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus. And the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also".
J.T. The ministry is carried down to us on that same principle. It has often been called attention to that four generations are involved in this deputy ministry. "The things thou hast heard of me" Paul is number one; Timothy is number two. "Many witnesses" are number three. And then faithful men are number four: "Faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also". So you see the line of transmission from Paul down to the persons who can instruct others also. So that it is something we ought to observe and profit by. Where are we in these matters? Are we in the latitude of Timothy himself, or in the presence of witnesses of what Timothy learned, or faithful men, or the others who are instructed?
S.McC. In regard of the ministry, is the authority in the ministry discerned on the basis of Scripture, or how is it discerned?
J.T. Well, it is what may be called oral services. It is not writing. Timotheus had learned them from Paul. He says, "In the presence of many witnesses". That is, this would all bear back on Timothy, what he learned from Paul and then, "These entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also". There is nothing said about writings but, of course, we would bring writings in now, but it seems as if the idea is of a personal transmission of the truth from Paul down, as if the middle ages and all that is simply omitted, because those in public authority and responsibility had departed from the truth. So we have to watch the thing working out, how the line of witnesses has come down to us and how faithful we
{197}
are at this end, the end which finishes the thing.
S.W.P. Why does Paul add competency to faithful men, "Such as shall be competent"?
J.T. That is important, too. It came into our minds this morning, the thought of competency. We read in @1 Corinthians 12: 28, "God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues". And Titus implies competency. Evangelists are not mentioned in Corinthians but apostles and prophets and then others such as those who can govern and other such things as that. But all these titles such as this, as well as those in @Ephesians 4, involve competency. If I ask a brother to preach, is he competent? And that competency must be of God. The idea of the ministry is on the basis of competency. Timothy was competent. Of course gifts were given to them by the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. He not only received the light of Paul's doctrine but he had himself direct gift from God and it was through the presbytery or by the episcopacy. Either the one or the other. The words 'episcopacy' and 'presbyterianism' really relate to competency, a means of imparting or passing on gift. The Episcopal church have in their minds that a bishop can pass on gift to a curate and others, whereas the Presbyterian Church have a committee, a special group, known as the presbytery, who pass it on. That is, Paul himself passed on gift. He reminds Timothy of it, "For which cause I put thee in mind to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands",
@2 Timothy 1: 6. All that brings out what we are as in the midst of a living state of things that directly has to do with God.
C.H.H. Would there be a present bearing of that in the thought of the brethren committing themselves to any one? Would the laying on of the hands of the
{198}
presbytery have a present bearing in that way?
J.T. No, I think that times are too small for that. The presbytery would be just the elders, you know, and God had put moral responsibility on the elders as to their hands laid on a brother like Timotheus. God would use that, their identification, to give him some thing that he needed for a special purpose. I do not know what you have to say about that.
C.H.H. I was wondering if competency would come out in those who are spiritual today in committing themselves definitely to those who might serve.
J.T. I would be afraid of that. Take Barnabas and Saul at Antioch: the Spirit says to the assembly there-we cannot tell how He said it, it must have been through some brother-"Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them", @Acts 13: 2. That was all they were asked to do, to separate. This incident at Antioch is helpful; they were not asked to do anything to these two brothers save to separate them for the work, so they laid their hands upon them and let them go. You cannot say anything more. There is nothing inferred as to whether there was any transmission of power to Paul and Barnabas. I do not think there was. But the presbytery did transmit power. I think it would be very unsafe for any brethren today to undertake anything like that now, or even the calling of the elders to pray over a sick person, anointing him with oil; you would be very much afraid. Unless you have a particularly spiritual set of brethren, there is great danger in anything like that. I hope I am not speaking riddles to people, but it is important that we should know these things.
Ques. In @2 Chronicles 15: 3 it is said, "Now for a long while Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law". The whole condition there was bad. "And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet,
{199}
he took courage". Would there be some analogy as to the way things are done today in a priestly way?
J.T. It expresses the value of spiritual persons or spiritual brethren. For instance, "If even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted". The stress is on the word 'spiritual', that spiritual persons have a certain power in such a case to restore an erring brother or sister, but nothing more than that; whereas James says, "Is any sick among you? let him call to him the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be one who has committed sins, it shall be forgiven him", @James 5: 14, 15. That would suppose a primary state of things where elders were recognised as in this epistle and he would call them and they lay hands on him and pray for him and anoint him with oil, and it says, "the prayer of faith shall heal the sick", but it is in that connection.
A.S.B. I think your reference to @Acts 13 is very helpful because of the engagement of the brethren in ministering to the Lord and fasting, and the Spirit having His place. What to do is not by commandment. It is more by instinct under the power of the Spirit, and then "They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit" are in full accord with the Spirit's movements.
J.T. So the brethren at Antioch had no right, nor power, nor authority over the two apostles, Paul and Barnabas, to control their movements. It is a mistake for brethren to control, or attempt to control, ministering brethren.
C.H.H. Would "Trophimus I left behind in Miletus sick" (@2 Timothy 4: 20) imply that the condition that had come in would weaken the position as to elders?
{200}
J.T. It would seem as though nothing was done to help Trophimus. He was just left with God. It is a remarkable thing. Why did not Paul himself do it? He would not attempt to do it. He left him with God. It would indicate that there was some condition that would hinder.
G.McP. Does Paul have that in mind as speaking to the elders in @Acts 20? He says, "And now I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace". He would link their souls directly with God.
J.T. Quite so. You mean Paul commended the elders to God? There is no idea of transmission of power in that chapter at all. It is a question of the elders at Ephesus and they are responsible and they are apt to stray, some of them. The whole position is put on that footing so that you feel you are dealing there with Paul's great work, his final work. Ephesus was a final great work and Christianity was set going in that way and left, commended to God and His grace and then Paul departs. That is the condition at Ephesus. So in Revelation, Ephesus is viewed as the summit of christianity and is the first assembly referred to.
H.B. I would like some help as to the Lord's word to Saul of Tarsus, "Rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do". How far would that go today?
J.T. Well, it is a very simple matter. The Lord is telling Saul, or Paul, that He has some representation in Damascus, and they are not persons of great distinction, but persons who are just there in Damascus. He direct him to the city to a few men in it. He would as it were humble Paul, I think, like Naaman, the Syrian, for Elisha did not do anything very great. Naaman says, "Behold, I thought, He will certainly come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper", @2 Kings 5: 11. I think servants
{201}
need to begin that way, that inconspicuous brothers in the name of the Lord are to do the needful. "It shall be told thee what thou must do". The Lord had to prepare Ananias for the service. He had to prepare him immediately. He needed a little replenishing himself to do the needful for Paul, the young convert.
T.L.S. Elisha called one of the young prophets and told him to go and anoint Jehu, and so on. Does that enter into what we are speaking of now?
J.T. Yes. Elijah was to anoint Hazael, Jehu and Elisha. He was to anoint three persons, meaning that the coming generations were to be on the basis of anointing through Elisha honouring Elijah. I do not think we are ever allowed to be in a sort of static condition. Brethren are always being moved. There is someone to be distinguished and we are to be in movement in regard to him, respect him and God is with us.
T.L.S. In connection with the matter of Titus and that it is Paul's ministry, we would hardly say that Titus was passing on something second-hand, would we?
J.T. Well, there is a difference between Paul and Titus, but there is no such difference between Paul and Apollos. Apollos was not a delegate at all but Titus and Timothy have that peculiar place and it carries with it something in the way of what you call 'second-hand' work. For instance, Paul sent Timothy to Corinth. There was no assumption of Timothy's having any special ministry because of it. He was not to go there and give out what he liked but he was to go there and represent Paul. Paul says, "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly". It is not Timothy's ways, but Paul's ways. All these things are most important to bring out what Christianity
{202}
really means, how we are always to be on the move. Here is Timotheus. What is going to happen? Where is Apollos? He is not here. Timothy is here to represent Paul; therefore, the Corinthians are somewhat on low ground at that time.
C.H.H. The disciples would have that thought in their minds, when the Lord told them, after they had done certain things, that they were unprofitable servants and had done what was their duty to do.
Ques. What would you say about Paul's desire to go to Rome? "Having great desire to come to you these many years", @Romans 15: 23.
J.T. He would do that himself. He had not gone as yet. He had not been to Rome. He wished to go and as a matter of fact he became a prisoner, but we may be sure that a gift was imparted. When Phoebe went to Rome she would convey something of Paul. She no doubt brought a letter to them and they would read that letter doubtless in her presence and she would be there; she is highly commended. She would be highly exercised as the letter was being read. Why should I be singled out thus? Well, it was an honour and she would doubtless impart something to the Romans as a sister. It is a poor thing if any of us does not impart something.
Rem. "I have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase. So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase. But the planter and the waterer are one", @1 Corinthians 3: 6 - 8. That indicates that Apollos was not delegated; it bears that out.
J.T. No, and he would not go to Corinth at one time; it was not his mind to go, showing that he was not like Titus or Timothy.
Now in @Titus 3: 4 we read, "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done
{203}
in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour". Now we began this time to call attention to the fact that what was said about new birth in @John 3 was not a full thought. The first refers to what would enable a person to see the kingdom, and the second statement of the Lord's would enable a person to enter into the kingdom. It is only the entering in. It is not the full thought of possessing or enjoying the full kingdom. It is partial. We make a point of that but in this chapter we have complete thoughts. The truth here runs on to the Spirit: "Renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour". It is the modus operandi of the gospel as stated here in full terms. And the great thought is what is poured out on us richly, and then the result "That, having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life". It is a question of the modus operandi of the gospel, whoever might preach it-Paul in this case-and the result that one is saved. The terms of salvation are employed and eternal life is included.
S.McC. Would the thought of regeneration help as to Nicodemus? He did not seem to leave the old state of things, whereas regeneration involves a new state of things.
J.T. Quite so. It is really a new order as the note shows. The note is, '"Regeneration" is not the same word as "being born again", nor is it used so in scripture. The force of the word is a change of position; a new state of things. The word is only used here, and in @Matthew 19:28 for the Saviour's coming kingdom'. Here it is used in relation to christianity. It is used in @Matthew 19: 28 as a change of position in a sense of the millennium: "In the
{204}
regeneration", the Lord says, such-and-such will happen. Well, that is the millennium but here the regeneration is connected with christianity, a complete changeover from judaism and particularly from heathendom.
Ques. Does the "washing of regeneration" involve experience or is it an immediate matter?
J.T. It is attributed to God. It takes place, you might say, simultaneously with regeneration, although they are two thoughts. The word for washing is a bath. You have the washing, and there is plenty of water. It is just a bath in water to wash yourself but it is God that does it. Regeneration is a positive thing and it denotes your coming into a new state of things. For instance, if immigrants came from Bohemia to this country in the old times, consideration would be given to their fives, the other countries, and the low conditions that existed. They would get citizenship. They would get education. It would be a point that their children had to go to school. Everything must be right, so to speak, and in keeping with the Constitution. The immigrant would be herded into a position down at Ellis Island, as we used to call it, and then they would be allotted something else a step higher and the idea would be that they had to be purified from the old conditions. You must not live in this country in these conditions. It is a weak illustration but it is the truth. I know well enough how it is worked out. You must be educated to the conditions of this country and live accordingly. The idea is that it is a new order of things. The Americans like a new world to live in these days. And that is what christianity is, a new world. Regeneration alludes to that. It is not new birth. It is a new order of things and you must come into that. You must learn to be in it and be in the good of it.
Rem. The "evil wild beasts" would be changed entirely by the renewal of the Holy Spirit. They were
{205}
characterised by being always liars and lazy gluttons, but now conditions would be entirely changed in their character and the Jewish mind and judaism that was prevailing in Crete would be discontinued and christianity entered into.
J.T. Quite so. He pictured christians just as the immigrants came into things here. In the second verse he says, "To speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be mild, shewing all meekness". This is the education they are coming into. "For we were once ourselves also without intelligence". That is the natural man. And we ourselves are in this this afternoon. We have to come into a new order of things spiritually, so that it says, "For we were once ourselves also without intelligence, disobedient, wandering in error, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour". Well, now that is what everyone here today can say: that we are changed, that the washing has changed us. But regeneration, that is the schooling, the education-I am using a symbol-that this country affords fits us for a new order of things, that we know how to live in this great and rich country as people call it, know how to live in this new order of things. That is exactly what christianity is.
Ques. How does the pouring out of the Holy Spirit fit in here?
J.T. The pouring out of the Holy Spirit abundantly is a full thought. It is a greater thought than the millennial regeneration. They will not be indwelt by the Spirit but we are, as we have in @Romans 5: 5,
{206}
"because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".
C.H.H. Would the education be anything like that of the woman in @John 4 who left her waterpot?
J.T. Yes, after she left the waterpot. The waterpot was the whole thing. That was the drudgery she was in. That is what she was herself. It is a good illustration of the way into the new order of things. We are introduced into it by the washing. The washing is distinct from regeneration but both thoughts run together in it.
G.McP. Do you see that in @Acts 10: 47? "Can any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did?". I was wondering if Cornelius would come into this principle of regeneration.
J.T. Well, there it is. We have to regard him not as an ordinary heathen because he was already in touch with God. He prayed and gave alms and certain other things were said about him but still he had to come into the Spirit's realm, as it were. But the Spirit is shed abroad immediately as Peter is unfolding these things to the company.
A.S.B. In @Titus 3, would verse 3 be the thought of degeneration, and regeneration would stand over against that?
J.T. Very good. So the word 'regeneration', as has already been noted in J.N.D.¬s footnote, points out a new order of things that we have come into.
C.DeB. What is meant by "the kindness ... of our Saviour God"?
J.T. The footnote gives the word as meaning 'philanthropy'. It is used of God. The philanthropy of God. The word 'philanthropy' is well known in the world. It is used here to show what the terms of the gospel convey, how rich they are, how magnificent they are and what they bring us into.
{207}
Ques. Would you say a little about the idea of heirship? You have alluded to ourselves in the negative sense, but it says, "We should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life".
J.T. That is another thing. There is no probate tax on our property. The taxes are going to be very heavy on property here, but there is no tax on this. It is the richness of the thing and the bounty of it and the freedom of it that is unimpaired. We come into an inheritance that is entirely free. There is no mortgage on it. This country is highly mortgaged. The generations for long enough are mortgaged whereas in these words, we are "heirs according to the hope of eternal life"; there is no mortgage on that. We are clear as risen from the dead unto eternal life.
Rem. "Poured out on us richly". That is the idea, is it not? Whereas taxation is being poured on us every minute.
J.T. It is to understand that in the new order of things in Christianity there are no taxes. Everything is free, abundantly free.
J.W.B. "If I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it", @Malachi 3: 10. How does that fit in there in regard to the pouring out here, the pouring out of the blessing there?
J.T. Well, the terms are mentioned that the tithes are brought into the storehouse. "Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it". It is something like this, but there is no idea of a tithe here. The word is really 'the philanthropy of God'. That is the word in verse 4. Philanthropy does not imply any taxes at all. The thing is given outright. What you do is given outright and liberally. Well, that time had come, Paul
{208}
says, and it was not on the principle of works, but "According to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour". This is the principle. We were considering this morning the operations of the Spirit and only in a limited way. There is nothing said about Himself as being a gift to the believer. "The renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that, having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life". It is the richness of it, the magnificence of it that is in mind. It is not tainted in any way and the hope is eternal life.
G.McP. Would Acts z help us? "And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting". And then in verse 4, "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit".
J.T. This is very much like Pentecost. The gentiles come into it in @Acts 10 when Peter opens the way. Peter is reminded of that when he sees what happens because he was preaching when that happened.
S.McC. What is meant by the washing of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. I think that is what is involved in the new order of things which they were brought into. I think it is the newness and freshness and vigour and power marking the incoming of the Spirit falling on the gentile believers. I think that is what is meant. Peter was amazed at what he saw, because he was preaching while it happened and he was reminded of what happened at Pentecost. The word 'renewal' is strong. @Acts 2 enlarges on what happened, the rich breathing that was heard. It was breathing and the whole house is filled with the sound of the breathing, as if the very depths of God were involved in the gift.
{209}
The depths of God were in the idea of breathing. As the note says it is not 'wind' exactly, but it is 'breath', the thought of divine Persons breathing. The Lord breathed into the disciples. The thing is conveyed in its greatness and essence. It is Pentecost that is reserved for that.
Ques. Does the word 'holy' link on with the word 'purification'?
J.T. That is just it. The whole epistle to Titus stresses the thought of purification. "All things are pure to the pure". That is to say that divine purity brought about by this transaction creates a condition in men and women that forbids the occupation with impure things. There are things that are pure and are to be regarded as pure and to be spoken of without fear or thought of indecency. God has made them pure. "All things are pure to the pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving", that is an unregenerate person, "nothing is pure". Even the pure things which a christian deals with are not pure to them. They are impure in their very mouths. The very words that they use are impure to them. They cannot be otherwise.
C.H.H. "But the wisdom from above first is pure", @James 3: 17.
J.T. That fits here.
A.S.B. In @Acts 2 Peter says, "And it shall be in the last days, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream dreams; yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy". God claims them in that way.
J.T. Well, what a rich pouring out in the millennium that will be! It is brought in here, but it does not go the whole way. What goes farther is what is
{210}
stated in the beginning of @Acts 2, the breathing of God. Then Peter is reminded of it by what he saw at Cornelius¬ house. So that he immediately commands baptism. He commands it.
J.McK. Why is it justified by His grace and saved according to His mercy? What would you say the grace of God operating testifies?
J.T. You are asking the difference between the word mercy and grace? Mercy is a sovereign thought. "According to his own mercy he saved us". Ephesians says, "Being rich in mercy". Here it is "His own mercy": "According to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that, having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life". It is all governed by the idea of mercy. "Justified by his grace", that is, God graciously justifies us. The idea of grace surmounts evil, overcomes evil so that the subject is made righteous. God makes it righteous. Not only forgiven, but justified, made fit for the new order. Nothing can be laid to our charge. It is to bring out what christianity is. There is no charge to be laid at our doors at all. We are justified.
What a people we are! God would have us to glory in what His mercy has made us and how grace rises above our guilt and justifies us. "We should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life". Heirship goes with it. We know from another scripture that the Spirit is the earnest of the inheritance, that is to say, eternal life is available to us on the principle of the Spirit, the earnest of the Spirit.
C.H.H. In @Titus 2: 13 we have "Our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ". In @Titus 3: 6 we have "Jesus Christ our Saviour", then in verse 4 there is a difference-it is "Our Saviour God".
{211}
J.T. Generally it is the word 'Saviour'. It is a question of salvation in this epistle, that is, God being a Saviour. Eternal life is only an adjunct to the great idea of salvation. "Awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ". That is to say, Jesus Christ is the great God and Saviour, which is a great tribute to the Lord.
{212}
PURIFICATION (3)
@1 John 5:6 - 15
J.T. The truth concerning eternal life has been before us in our readings so far but only in a secondary way, whereas this section of scripture treats of it in the absolute; in one sense it treats of it as a finished matter, a finished subject. The passage reads, "This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus the Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth. For they that bear witness are three: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one". So we see by this introduction that the matter is treated in a full or absolute sense. The immediate means of reaching eternal life has been stated. It would be the water and blood, all that came by water and blood. The Lord had it in mind in becoming man, as it were, basically, so that it was the prime thought in His mind. He came by these things. We looked at the subject in Titus which is augmentary, in a sense filling out the idea of salvation. In Matthew eternal life is treated as belonging to the earth; not only persons but the nations themselves are viewed as going into it. In no sense do they go to heaven. It is a question of a sphere of blessing on earth, whereas John treats of it, as we said, in a basic sense of entering into christianity. So that he begins or continues the subject of new birth running into the matter of eternal life as a gift. In @John 3 the great thought of gift is in the gospel, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal". It is a gift in the full sense and the gospel continues to treat of it in chapter 4 on the principle of the Spirit springing up into it, not something on the level of the nations
{213}
here but something to be reached as belonging to elevation. The Spirit or well of water springs up into eternal life and the subject of worship is continued on that, showing that it leads upward. So we should use these thoughts before us now in looking into this passage. It treats of the truth of eternal life, as it were, in the Lord's mind in the beginning in becoming Man. "This is he that came by water and blood" involves that the idea of washing and purification is in view in entering into this great subject.
S.McC. I should like to ask if you regard the thought of eternal life as bearing on the saints down here and linked with the ways of God on earth. Is it entirely linked with the provisional side of things or does it have any bearing on the position in glory?
J.T. I think it does. As we are indicating, it is an upward trend in John's writings in view of eternal life. It is not the life on the earth as in Matthew where the nations are brought into it. John views it as leading up to heaven.
S.McC. In the world to come, in the assembly, what would be the bearing of eternal life there? What would be the bearing on the saints?
J.T. I think it would be the tree of life which is the prime thought. It is said to be in the midst of the paradise of God. It is the highest level of it and those that wash according to @Revelation 22 have a right to the tree of life and to enter by the gates into the city. The tree of life belongs to the paradise of God, which is identified with the assembly, the heavenly city.
S.McC. Then would you regard the thought of eternal life as going through into eternal conditions?
J.T. I think it does. It is essential, for we are there as linked with Him in the city. What do you think?
S.McC. What you have said of late helped much on the subject because the general trend of our apprehension
{214}
of the subject has been to entirely limit it to the provisional side of our position.
J.T. Well, it is treated as a matter of purpose, as we saw yesterday in Titus, "The hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time". And in 2 Timothy the apostle says, "Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, according to promise of life, the life which is in Christ Jesus"; and the Lord Himself speaks of it in @John 17, "These things Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee; as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal. And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". The Lord there speaks of it as being administered, that the Lord should administer it. "Thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal". That is, He would administer it to all that came to Him. Then He proceeds to say what it is, "This is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". This is in His mind and these are remarkable circumstances; it was in His mind to be administered.
C.H.H. So that "He is the true God and eternal life" (@1 John 5: 20) is an eternal thought.
J.T. I think so. It is in Himself.
S.McC. Is it the thought that eternal life in eternal conditions is linked with the great general thought of life? It is a relative term over against the pressure of death, is it not? The word 'eternal' life would hardly have force in eternity, would it? Does it merge into the great idea of life generally as we have it now?
J.T. Well, it would hardly be stressed when there is nothing else to challenge it, but while we are here
{215}
there is, and therefore the importance of the relative term. "In the coming age life eternal" shows that it has a beginning on earth but continues; the idea of eternity would drop but the thing is there. It is continued. I think that John's epistle is intended to treat it in an absolute and complete sense. The words alluded to earlier, "This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus the Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness", would mean it is a complete, full, and important subject. The idea of the truth supports this because it is added, "the Spirit is the truth". It is a reciprocal term that could be turned around and say the truth is the Spirit. The truth is viewed as important as the Spirit in that sense. It is an eternal thought, an integral part of God, as it were, the Spirit being the truth. So we are forced into it in John's writings particularly as a prime subject, a full, complete one. The Spirit Himself being the truth treats of it as a witness.
Ques. Would eternal life be in the words of the Lord Jesus when He said, "Because I live ye also shall live"?
J.T. It would be that in @John 14. The subject of life is treated in John up to chapter 12 in a formal way, and chapter 12 ends with the Lord saying that the Father's commandment is eternal life.
Ques. Would that help us to understand how the idea is continued? We live in that sense.
J.T. Well, He is life; but it says because He lives we live also. That brings our life up to His. We have part in it. But the matter is formally treated up to chapter 12, and you might say completed there, because the Father's commandment, the Lord says, is eternal life-a very remarkable statement. The Father's commandment would mean that that must go through. "For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father
{216}
who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak; and I know that his commandment is life eternal". So that finality is to be reached on the subject in John although it is touched on afterwards. What is before us now is to understand the means by which it is intended to be reached and finalised, fixed as blessing in the divine scheme.
Ques. Is eternal life a sphere or quality in the soul?
J.T. It is both. It is a thing that can be entered into according to what we quoted already, "These shall go away into ... life eternal". They go away into it; therefore it is a sphere to be entered into. Now that is future. The nations will go into it. But as to the christian period the apostle says to Timothy, "Lay hold of eternal life", and then again John says, "No murderer has eternal life abiding in him". Negatively that would mean that it abides in some who are not murderers. It is in christians, in believers. It is a thing in us.
G.McP. Have you in mind in suggesting the thought of eternal life that while the assembly is here it is to be enjoyed now?
J.T. That is the suggestion. The believer is to lay hold of it. It is a sphere of things. J.N.D. said that it is an out-of-the-world order of things.
C.H.H. What is the distinction between the terms 'eternal' and 'for ever and ever'? In @Ezekiel 37 you get the idea of an eternal covenant established for ever. It is the covenant made with the house of Israel. "My sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever".
J.T. Well, that is to be understood contextually, as a blessing belonging to Israel. We have, for instance, the term 'eternal Spirit', what is eternal attached to the Holy Spirit, but we have to look into the context to see whether the blessing may refer to Israel as a nation; whether that is a primary thought
{217}
or whether it is just a limited thought. Those who form the nation of Israel will be brought into another setting in a merging sense. That is, they will have part in the heavenly. All who form the Israelitish nation will enjoy the position in flesh and blood but that will not continue. God's thought is that men should be spiritual and I apprehend that those who form the Israelitish nation in the coming day will merge into higher thoughts. There is much that is not written or said on those points, but what is of Israel and even flesh and blood will be blessed on earth but not in the final sense for they are to pass into eternal conditions. Flesh and blood is not to continue in the eternal state. That is clear, although it does in the millennium. So that the entry into eternal conditions is as persons, not as a nation. You cannot imagine that the nation of Israel would go to heaven and have part in the heavens in a literal sense, because old things are passing away.
Ques. Why does the apostle say, "Not by water only, but by water and blood"?
J.T. That is to bring out the full thought of death, in the terminating sense as well as in the purifying sense. The blood was necessary as a witness that the condition of flesh and blood really was terminated in the death of Christ, though it is continued now in christians, and in the millennium, but that is only provisional. God has reached a new condition in manhood, while we are in flesh and blood; that is our place now, and all who are His are to conform to that new condition.
The regeneration will take place in the millennium and then we will be passing into a new heaven and a new earth wherein righteousness dwells. It is not only that righteousness reigns but dwells, and the new heavens and the new earth are a matter of new creation. The old is intelligently terminated and the means of the termination of it are water and blood. He came
{218}
by water and blood, meaning that He came in connection with these things that were necessary to finish up the old condition and bring in the new.
C.H.H. The term itself is not used in @John 3 and 4 or in Titus although implied.
J.T. Without the shedding of blood there is no remission, and therefore the Lord came by these things. That is, He took manhood to die in it. He took the conditions in which He could die. He died to terminate the old flesh and blood condition and bring in the new. He appears to the brethren saying, "A spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having", @Luke 24: 39. He does not say blood; it is flesh and bones, a new condition which abides and that is what we are brought into. We are brought into that and that is what is meant in eternal life. We are dealing with the purifying side, the water and blood. These two elements are essential to purification in order that we enter into eternal life.
C.H.H. Would you say there is anything more conveyed than in the Son of man being lifted up or as Titus speaks of Christ giving Himself? Is there some significance in bringing in this word 'blood'?
J.T. It is because of what the judgment of God required. The idea of blood is promulgated from the outset. Water is there in type but blood is insisted upon. Without the shedding of blood there is no remission. Therefore the blood alludes to flesh and blood condition, to humanity. The Lord had to come that way so as to terminate it. "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again", @John 10: 17. The Father loved Him for that, because He laid down that condition and took another condition. Taking it again means life in another condition, because He did not take up what He laid down. He came here to lay down His life and the Father loved Him for that.
{219}
C.H.H. I think you said on one occasion that the blood removed man from before the eye of God and the water removed man from his own eyes. Is that right?
J.T. It is a question of state whereas blood deals with sin.
Ques. It is only in John's gospel that we get "blood and water". Is not that another line of teaching?
J.T. Quite so. There is a witness to those two things. "There came out blood and water", and here he says, "He that came by water and blood". He transposes them, but for a purpose, because of the actual state they were in, a peculiar condition rather than sin.
J.B. Why does the witness come in immediately after this statement in @1 John 5?
J.T. "It is the Spirit that bears witness". That is to say, the Spirit is competent to do this. John himself says in his gospel that he is a witness. The Spirit Himself is a witness, as already remarked. The idea of truth is as prominent as the Spirit so that there is no doubt as to what eternal conditions are to be. It is not to be flesh and blood but it is to be spiritual. The Spirit is a witness to that. Flesh and blood conditions are terminated because the Lord came in connection with these two things. The Spirit is a perfect, complete witness to that fact. It is terminated and the new heavens and the new earth cannot contain it. If it is continued on now, it is because God needs a witness. It is God's divine purpose that He is able to carry on His testimony with men in flesh and blood. What is continued is the position that Christ is in now and that is involved in the term 'eternal life'.
Ques. John speaks in his epistle of "that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled,
{220}
concerning the word of life; (and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us:)", but here he says, "this life is in his Son". Does anything of that go through into this new condition we are speaking of in chapter 5?
J.T. He is alluding to the Person of Christ in chapter 1. But instead of speaking of Him as a Person, he is speaking of Him as a condition. "That which was from the beginning" means what was there in manhood. "That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life; (and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal fife, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us:)". That has gone through because they refer to condition. It is the Person, of course, but a condition that God had in mind to establish and that condition was termed eternal life. Fifty years ago we had a great controversy. It was said that eternal life was a person in a condition, whereas the condition is in the person. The person is greater than the thing. "He is the true God and eternal life". The idea of eternal life does not cover the truth of His Person. It is a matter of the condition of manhood that we can be brought into.
A.S.B. That is very helpful because it says, "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is he that came by water and blood" (verses 5, 6).
J.T. Just so. He became man. That is the condition He took to lay down. He does not carry that condition with Him. He laid it down. The accomplishment of the divine purpose contemplated eternal life. He has left that condition and His Father loves Him for it.
{221}
-.G. Would you help us on the thought of water of life and tree of life in @Revelation 22?
J.T. We will come to that because that is part of our subject. We have not come to the tree of life, but now we are seeking to get at the basis on which eternal life is found, how the Lord Jesus came in in connection with that, because He came in connection with those two things. The word 'but' implies that He came in connection with those two things. He was not a man before but He took that condition. It was needed as a basis for this great matter of eternal life. Eternal life was reached and established and then the condition He took was no longer needed. The condition that is needed for that is what Christ is in now. The position now requires eternal life, not flesh and blood, but flesh and bones, a new order of life.
C.H.H. Would not the thought of water and blood be in its application to practically relieve us and deliver us from what is brought in by sin and death?
J.T. That is the idea. That is our subject, the question of purification, a man in a pure condition. God has in mind that we are to be purified, and water and blood are the means of it, the basic means of establishing for ever this great thought of eternal life. It implies a pure condition, impurity set aside for ever.
S.W.P. Would the first few verses of this epistle introduce it, hearing, seeing, contemplating, handling, witnessing, and manifesting? Would all those be used to preserve us from mere abstract thinking?
J.T. Quite so. This is a concrete condition that they could see with their eyes. It may refer to what was in the flesh, because in Him was life, but it is more likely to refer to what He was in resurrection. He was really a Man then as before, so that christianity was set up on this principle of witness. The thing was there for anyone to see-I mean to say, those who had eyes to see. Therefore Peter speaks of certain men who were witnesses to Him in that condition.
{222}
S.McC. Would you say something in regard to the water as we had it in the first reading in relation to new birth, and then the water in relation to the regeneration in Titus, and now the water in relation to this side?
J.T. I think we are brought back to water; we had the washing of regeneration yesterday. John is dealing with the matter now, not as salvation but a thing by itself. It is a witness too, but a thing by itself, so he says, "If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God which he has witnessed concerning his Son. He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself; he that does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning his Son. And this is the witness". Now notice this, he is coming down to one thing in the great subject of salvation, eternal life. Therefore it says, "And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son". The passage leads up to this and it seems to me that God has a witness not only in Christ personally, that eternal life, but He has a witness in the saints, a present concrete witness down here in the saints. That is, that God has given to us eternal life. It is not simply something that faith can lay hold of, but more than that, it is what Christ was here. The saints are here. We are also a witness to that as possessing it.
Ques. Do we have to distinguish between the features of eternal life in chapter 1 that go through, contemplating, handling, and seeing, and the condition of flesh and blood that the Lord took which was terminated?
J.T. The actual condition was terminated, as we have said. The full thought of God was reached in resurrection. Now to apply that to us it is said of Him in @1 John 2: 5, "Hereby we know that we are in
{223}
him. He that says he abides in him ought, even as he walked, himself also so to walk". Remember that the early verses treat of Christ in manhood, in flesh and blood condition, but what He was so are we. Then it goes on, speaking of what is carried on in the saints, "Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard. Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you". I believe that is the point, what He was here in flesh and blood. He was eternal life before His death as much as after, only the condition was different after. Now we come into the after condition, as risen from the dead. It is eternal life we come into. So it is that the new commandment includes us, that is, includes the saints. They are witnesses, as Christ is the witness. In chapter 1 Christ is the witness, seen, handled, and so forth, but in chapter 2 the Spirit of God brings the thought down to us; the new commandment involves that we are brought into His condition, the condition He was in in flesh and blood provisionally, so that the witness of eternal life is seen in us. It is all provisional both in Him and us as a witness of God. Now the saints are a witness. That is how I understand the witness in chapter 5, "And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life". It is there for any who have eyes to see. It is in us, but in Christ. It is a position of life into which we have come.
Rem. So that His coming by water and blood is the means to this great end.
J.T. We should have it, you know. Therefore, the means of reaching this condition were in His mind all the time.
Ques. Is it right to say His death is a necessity then?
J.T. Certainly. There would be nothing consistent
{224}
in His becoming Man unless He took up the humanity in which He could die. He could have done otherwise, taking up humanity in which He could be for ever, but He would have no others with Him and that is the reason He came by water and blood. The water is the moral idea.
Ques. In @Hebrews 2 it says, "Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same". Is that the same idea?
J.T. Quite so. It is a necessity because of what is in the mind and counsel of God. "But thou hast prepared me a body".
A.S.B. I was wondering if the footnote in @Hebrews 2 emphasises what you are saying, 'There is an intended difference here between the words for "partake" ... and "took part in". ... The first, referring to the children, is a common equal sharing of the nature. The second, referring to Christ, means, he took a part in it: and refers always to something outside myself'.
J.T. The condition was such that He could take part in it. We were not perfected and therefore there is the condition of imperfection and corruption. Adam failed and there was imperfection. The Lord Jesus took Adam's condition but wholly uncorrupted, sinless. It shows how unique He was, and yet He was capable of dying and shedding blood so we should be brought into it through cleansing.
G.McP. Does @John 13 suggest the means of cleansing that we may have part with Him in the sphere in which He is?
J.T. That is another thing, but what we are at now does not go that far. It is a basic matter in this epistle. There it says, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". Here it is not quite that, it is bringing in a new condition in which we could have part whereas @John 13 is our part in the assembly.
{225}
This is racial, a new race established. The Lord Jesus had part in the first race, the Adam race, but wholly separate, undefiled; but He took it on Himself-all the impurity we were in. He could only do it by taking this condition, namely, water and blood.
Ques. "Even as he is, we also are in this world",
@1 John 4: 17. Is that a present condition?
J.T. Yes, that is abstract truth. It does not admit of anything else but that. There are other things that are not taken into account in the abstract statement.
C.H.H. I suppose what Paul says would be concrete, "For we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh", @2 Corinthians 4: 11 .
J.T. Quite so. The life of Jesus, that is what He was in testimony.
S.McC. When it says, "This life is in his Son" does that bring out the exalted position of it?
J.T. I think it is the immutability of it. His Son is declared to be Son of God in power. It is immutable because of the power that is there in the Son. There is no possibility of overthrowing it. The position is immutable. It is not simply a condition of life set up here. It is more than that. There is no such thing in any other quality in heaven or earth. When it is fixed, it is fixed. Fixity is a great point in this matter. It is in His Son. There is no possibility of Satan ever interfering with it again, such as he did in the garden of Eden.
C.H.H. It says, "He that has the Son has life". Is that on individual lines?
J.T. Quite so. It is well to have it that way because of the fixity of it, the immutability of it. Anybody could speak of it in that way but the joy of it is individual. There is no idea of interference again. It is so essential to the purpose of God that there should be life in men and that it is fixed in such a Person as the Son.
{226}
G.McP. Is that what we have in mind when we say God has reached finality in Christ and the assembly?
J.T. Quite so. It is a fixed position and that is in the Son of God. What can be more powerful because He is the expression of divine power. "Marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead", @Romans 1: 4.
G.V.D. Why is God so concerned with witness? It is stressed considerably in this section.
J.T. I think you can see that if you think of it. What an important thing it is for God to have a few brethren in this city who are a witness to His thoughts, not simply that they are in salvation but that He has given to them eternal life. He has given them the same thing that was here in Jesus in humanity; the same thing is here before He died and after. It is a concrete thing that God is stressing because the Holy Spirit is here. It is a substantial, spiritual matter and that is what God is witnessing to men and they are closing their eyes to it. How important it is that we should be a witness to it.
H.B. We read in chapter 2 that "the darkness is passing and the true light already shines".
J.T. That is what we had. The new commandment is in us. What is true in Christ is true in us in our little way even now. The Spirit is here and the darkness is passing. If there is a handful or a hundred brethren, the darkness is passing in that way. God is a witness to that.
J.McK. Does the man in @John 9 go as far as this as over against all that was in the synagogue?
J.T. He became a witness. So the darkness is passing. There is very little light in this city but the darkness is passing to that extent, however little it may be, and God is a witness to that: "This is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son". So the teaching runs on to the fact that the Lord Jesus is the true God and what
{227}
could be more immutable and fixed? He is the living and true God.
S.McC. Why should this be brought in in the light of the economy, "He is the true God and eternal life"?
J.T. I think that is brought in because the truth should merge in one Person. Therefore it is immutable, it is fixed. The Person is the life. The life that we have part in is also the God that we worship. He is the second Person in the Deity but the true God; there is no question of second in that. He is really God because the idea of God includes Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
C.H.H. So that, as you said before, that expression was stated in the error that crept in fifty years ago. That was the great antidote for it.
J.T. Yes, it was. They insisted that eternal life was a person, that is, you are made eternal life through God. "He is the true God and eternal life". They are two thoughts. That is what we are brought into. The centre of blessing is the same God we worship.
Ques. Do we get the thought then that what came out in Christ is reproduced in the saints in the idea of witness?
J.T. That is what we mentioned in the new commandment. "Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard. Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him". "Him" is the true God, but eternal life is also true in Him. It "is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines", meaning that however few we are the darkness is passing to that extent.
J.B. Would this be seen in "He that has the Son has life: he that has not the Son of God has not life" (chapter 5: 12)? It is a fixed state, is it not?
{228}
J.T. Quite so. Let us read the passage again. "These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God. And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us. And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him" (verses 13 - 15). We are in relation to God and what we ask we know we will get according to His will. Confidence is in mind.
A.B. Does this section clarify what we have in chapter 3, "We know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure". Is the thing worked out in detail here concretely?
J.T. Just so. There we are brought into the heavenly side of things. It does not yet appear what we shall be. We know what we are now. "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God. For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is". That is the glorified position of Christ, "as he is", not as He was even on earth after He arose. Therefore we are to be conformed to Christ's body of glory which is His present body, the state He is in now.
T.U. Do you distinguish between testimony and eternal life or are they both the same? Testimony in its general bearing, for instance, the woman in @John 4, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?".
J.T. Eternal fife is testimony but not everything. What you have spoken of is additional but part of the testimony. What we are saying now is, "And this is
{229}
the witness, that God has given to us eternal life". That is the witness; what you and I have now is the witness.
T.U. You have said in the past that testimony is a continuation of Christ down here in man. Does that link on now?
J.T. Well, it is as far as eternal life is concerned but it concerns other things too. The life of Jesus is to be manifested in our mortal flesh and that is testimony.
T.U. I was thinking that there may be a difference. It seems to be the witness of three, "the Spirit, and the water, and the blood". It seems to be on the basis of the reception of that. Is that so?
J.T. You see these three witnesses are one and that one testimony would mean the acceptance of the purifying means in persons who receive eternal life. We come into the thing in our souls by the testimony of those three, but after we have received, there is a further thought of testimony in us. So we are an additional testimony, a continuance of what Christ was because we have received eternal life.
C.H.H. Is there any essential difference in the life of Jesus and what He is now?
J.T. No essential difference, but I would say the life of Jesus as here in flesh and blood was one condition, but now He is in another, but the witness is in the assembly. What a witness it was at the beginning to God!
Ques. Are not the conditions of eternal life in a way in themselves a testimony to Christ now?
J.T. Quite so. These meetings are a testimony in a little way. That is how it was in the beginning. The saints at Corinth would prophesy and that would be a testimony. The saints would love one another and it would be a testimony. That is the idea of what was set up in Christ.
{230}
Rem. The Lord Jesus said, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35.
J.T. Quite so.
J.K. Would this position be seen coming out in our prayers in regard to asking?
J.T. It is a very important thing that the brethren pray and are heard. If a man or woman is sick and they are raised up in answer to our prayers, it is a witness. The same kind of thing came out in the Lord's life. The same thing is in the assembly but the more you look into it the more you are affected by the fact that God has set up Christ here to be the same witness in the assembly as He was before He died. It is Christ reproduced in His body.
C.H.H. Referring to @Ezekiel 36 you get the idea of testimony after purification. It says, "This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden".
J.T. Quite so. Then in the next chapter the whole house of Israel is raised up and united and therefore a witness to God on the earth, an exceeding great army. Persons who had been dead morally are now standing on their own feet, justified and made to live, the Spirit of God in them. It is the same thing as here.
C.H.H. Would you say there should be, as taking on the truth, some collective testimony to outsiders?
J.T. That is just the point. If any came in here, as at Corinth, what would they see? They would prophesy and the man falls down. He is judged of all. The whole meeting is brought into it, and he reports that God is among them and he worships God. This is a heathen person and he sees this and reports that God is among them of a truth. That is the idea. We must come back to this idea of purity. The means of purifying are water and blood and these three-the Spirit, and the water, and the blood-agree in one. If God has given us eternal life, we are pure.
The idea of purity must enter into it. Peter says,
{231}
"Your pure mind", a pure humanity that comes out through self-judgment. The saints are to be more and more pure in their minds, thoughts, and affections.
S.McC. In the expression "He that has the Son has life", just what is involved in having the Son? Is that expression true of everyone who accepts the Lord Jesus as his Saviour or is it John's characteristic way of speaking?
J.T. It is more than that. It is a question of the Son and he that has Him. We have already alluded to the man in John g. His history is given in full with the intent that he should be a witness to what came out in the Lord's ways on the earth. He was left to himself. He did what he was told and went to Siloam and washed and came seeing. What does he think about the Lord? He tells what he thinks about Him and then the Lord finds him. They cast him out. He is isolated, typical of a real christian. He is shut out of man's system and the Lord says, 'I will show Myself to this man', and says,,"Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?". The Lord is going to bring out something in this man's soul. "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?". He is ready for Him, and the Lord says, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage". That is the idea, and the narrative goes on with that individual person who accepts or confesses that Jesus is the Son of God. We go on to the idea of life in Lazarus, a man actually raised by the power of life, by the Son of God. Well, you see how this develops and how it stands, so that we look for men like that in each other. Is there anything like that in us? It is the Son of God, not what He did for man, but believing on the Son of God. Are you ready for such a point as that? How far-reaching and important it is, because it enters into the coming world. It is the Son of God that is establishing that world and this man is a witness. So
{232}
that the idea of sheep is developed in the next chapter and then Lazarus is raised, and chapter 12 completes the subject of eternal life. That commandment is made true in the Son of God: "He is the true God and eternal life". The teaching of those chapters sets out the order for us and this apostolic epistle confirms what John wrote. "These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name". The testimony is in His name, the Son of God Himself a witness to the power of God.
T. S. Does the matter of the three young men in Daniel go as far in connection with what Nebuchadnezzar saw as to the fourth, the Son of God?
J.T. Quite so. That is remarkable although it is a plural idea. It indicates what God is stressing there in that man.
T.S. I was just wondering if you would attach a great deal of importance to the matter of witness, not merely in words, but this thing comes to light in the witness of the Son of God.
J.T. That is right.
{233}
PURIFICATION (4)
@Numbers 19:1 - 22; @Revelation 22: 14, 15
J.T. The instruction in @Numbers 19 comes in by itself. It is not given according to actual record of instructions at Horeb but came in much later and may in that sense point to the last days-the end of the dispensation, pointing to the conditions that have arisen in the interim. No such conditions had to be dealt with at Pentecost, although they were there, but such have arisen since. So that in order to understand this, we have to understand assembly history. It is to be hoped that this chapter will furnish us with what is now needed in the course of our instruction. Certain facts are mentioned, requirements that afford clues to the chapter: first, the creature which is a type, the heifer, a female creature which is to be without blemish, without defect and never having had the yoke upon her; and secondly, Eleazar, the priest, who is acting, operating. Although the instruction is to Moses and Aaron, Eleazar is the priestly operator and alludes to the spirit of priesthood, the whole congregation being brought into the ordinance and it is to be observed as we proceed that the offence is not so much in uncleanness being manifest as that the water of purification is neglected. It will be seen in the legal instruction of the chapter. Verse 14 says, "This is the law" and verse 20, "And the man that is unclean, and doth not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation". It is neglect, of course; the uncleanness is there, but it is the neglect of the use of the water which is particularly stressed. God has provided for us in relation to conduct that would defile the fellowship; God providing for it, the provision neglected is the evil pointed out.
{234}
C.H.H. Would that be the defect in the Corinthians? They had not availed themselves of this water of purification. They partook of the Lord's supper and did not discern the Lord's body.
J.T. Just so. They were to eat but to eat in a proper way, not to stop eating but to purify themselves. So the neglect was, "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep" (@1 Corinthians 11: 30), brought down to judicial dealings amongst them.
Ques. Would it be right to say that the teaching we had in Titus is what God has done for us in taking us out of all the evil and corruption? Is it more here what we have to do?
J.T. The chapter down to the end of verse 10 shows the provision, the ashes of the heifer, the burnt heifer and the running water provided in a clean place. That is, it would be known by all in the camp. So that the evil would be in not appropriating what was provided.
We should look at the details of the provision down to the end of verse 10 so that we may see how foundational it is. "Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without blemish, wherein is no defect, and upon which never came yoke; and ye shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring it outside the camp, and one shall slaughter it before him". Eleazar does not do it. It is another. It is in the presence of the priest. That is, in the presence of Eleazar, not Aaron. "And Eleazar the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle of its blood directly before the tent of meeting seven times. And one shall burn the heifer before his eyes; its skin and its flesh, and its blood, with its dung, shall he burn. And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer. And the priest shall wash his garments, and he shall bathe his flesh in water,
{235}
and afterwards he shall come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until the even; and he that hath burned it shall wash his garments in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. And a clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer, and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the assembly of the children of Israel for a water of separation; it is a purification for sin. And he that hath gathered the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. And it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, an everlasting statute". The process of reaching the provision is in these verses and they have to be understood so as to see the kind of virtue, the cleansing virtue, there is in the provision.
S.McC. Would you say something as to the difference between the process of cleansing here and the laver in the court of the tabernacle? What is the difference between the application of the water in the laver and the water of purification we have here?
J.T. These provisions, the water that is in the laver and in the sea as in the temple, cover the general position. In the laver in the tabernacle the provision made at Horeb was not to meet an emergency. What was inaugurated there was to cover the whole position, whereas this is special as meeting what arose in the interim, providing a remedy for what has come in and defiles, since Pentecost. The primary institution involved is seen in Horeb or Sinai as God made abundant provision for uncleanness, for cleansing, but certain conditions arose in the interim which had to be met and hence this peculiar ordinance in @Numbers 19, which comes in late as we already remarked.
C.H.H. Would there be any similarity in 1 Corinthians answering to the laver and 2 Timothy answering to this?
{236}
J.T. I do not know if we can work it out then, whether it is 2 Timothy, but there was what was provided in Sinai in the laver, and in what Solomon carried through, the sea and the ten lavers, which brought in more water. There are the two ideas -- the sea which is a very large vessel and then ten lavers in the temple. This has to be worked out in our souls as to whether the same thing existed at Pentecost, and whether the conditions pointed to in this chapter have not arisen since. I do not know whether we can work it out in 2 Timothy, but, anyway, it is to be worked out. We become sinners because we neglect it. The guilt is rather that we neglect the water of purification than in becoming unclean.
W.L. Would the thought of running water bring it down to the present time in the light of current ministry?
J.T. The idea of running water is perhaps suggestive there. We get it also in the ordinance regarding the cleansing of the leper. The idea of running water was there too. One of the clean birds was slain over running water.
J.W.B. Would you say a word as to why Eleazar comes into evidence here instead of Aaron being used while he is here?
J.T. It is to bring out that the priestly element is here on earth. We are told in Hebrews that our High Priest is in heaven and Aaron is the high priest. The instruction here involves that Aaron is recognised (verse z), but the operating priest in the chapter is Eleazar. I think it means the Spirit's being here after Pentecost. The priesthood in Christ was there before Pentecost. Immediately Christ is in heaven, He is the Priest. He is recognised as Priest in heaven before the Spirit came, but the advent of the Spirit's presence here implies that there is a priesthood on earth available for this purpose. That is to say, the saints are priests, but it is a question of the Spirit operating in
{237}
them. That is what Eleazar means, what refers to him typically. He is mentioned more in this book than anywhere because it is a wilderness book. We need this element amongst ourselves all the time; "Ye who are spiritual ..." (@Galatians 6: z), indicates an element of priesthood down here, not only a priesthood in heaven but that there is a priesthood down here corresponding to it.
G.McP. Do you not think that this chapter comes after the public breakdown in chapter 16?
J.T. Well, the public breakdown is one of the things. There are several things, in fact. The bearing is a good deal after the refusal of the gospel of the land, after the testimony of the spies was refused. Then the great number of people that were slain from that point onwards. A great number died in the wilderness and thus it was easy for a person to come in contact with an unburied bone. That is in mind particularly in this chapter, the number of persons involving unburied bones. This is a condition that has arisen in christendom itself.
S.W.P. Should the man in verse 20, that will not purify himself, normally be aware of the fact of the availability of this spirit of priesthood suggested in Eleazar?
J.T. He should be. We were considering a man like Nicodemus. The Lord has to say to him, "Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things!", @John 3: 10. That is, a man like that does not know these matters that are available, whereas the Lord is helping the brethren because we come back to the truth of the position, and we know things that our brethren in the systems around us do not know. They are ignorant. But then, their ignorance does not shield them. Nicodemus¬ ignorance did not shield him. Nicodemus should have known, and he suffered because he remained in the council and he could not be clean there. "Wherefore come out from the midst of them,
{238}
and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not what is unclean, and I will receive you", @2 Corinthians 6: 17. That is the point. It is in separation we are pure.
S.W.P. Would it not be very serious if I continued in uncleanness and refused it?
J.T. How many are doing it? They are doing it in ignorance, but it is culpable because it can be known. The Collected Writings are an example for evidence. They have a very abundant circulation; the Scriptures themselves provide instruction. There is immense testimony from God. They have a wide circulation abroad in christendom, so ignorance is culpable. The present ignorance among the clerics is culpable.
Rem. Would you say that haste is indicated? A dead body and grave and bones would be no place to linger; movement forward must be resumed as promptly as possible.
J.T. Quite so. If we calculate the possible number of persons who died after they refused to go into the land, then we can understand the number of actual carcases that were strewn on the desert, and how impossible it would be to be free from touching the carcases and bones. And God is merciful in not stressing the uncleanness from touching the bones, but the neglect of the provision for cleansing.
Ques. Would the elders in @Acts 20 give us what Eleazar represents here in a way? Paul speaks of his departure and the things that would obtain.
J.T. The whole matter is put on them. I believe the whole church dispensation is in mind in Paul's word to them. He sent for them and put the matter on them, as pointing to the culpableness of those who are ignorant, that they should not be ignorant for there are plenty of means of finding out what God's provision is.
G.D. After Paul's reference in @1 Corinthians 10 to the carcases strewn in the wilderness he says, "I speak as to intelligent persons". Would you think
{239}
that Paul would appeal to us in that way to take the thing up and judge it?
J.T. Especially as taking the Lord's supper; @1 Corinthians 10 is a provision for the wilderness in view of participating in the Lord's supper. That is the point in it. "I speak as to intelligent persons". It is as if the Spirit of God is lifting up His hand with a red light to say that we can have no part in it at all unless we use this water, the water of purification. And therefore there is the appeal to each of us as an intelligent person; it says, as it were, 'If you know, you should not be unclean'.
S.McC. Verse 5, "One shall burn the heifer before his eyes", is an unusual allusion, is it not, in the offerings? Would it have in mind that the operating priesthood amongst the saints is to be affected by this direct action of the fire in relation to the heifer?
J.T. Just so. The person who does it is not any person; it is whom the priest would consider most suitable. The priest does not do it. I think it is to spread abroad amongst the brethren that anyone is eligible and ready or should be ready to cast a stone as it were to deal with the matter of this kind, but the priest is to decide. It is not a priestly act to slaughter the animal, but it is a priestly responsibility to see that it is done. And therefore it becomes a matter for all the congregation. Anyone may do it according to the priest's reckoning and therefore it is a congregational matter and the operation is not exclusive. Anyone can do it. It is under the surveillance of the priest and not Aaron, but the saints who are priests.
S.McC. In a meeting where there is much sometimes in the way of worldliness defiling and interrupting the saints in their communion with God, do you not think there is a certain onus of responsibility on the priestly element in the locality to see that these matters are rightly taken up?
{240}
J.T. To see that things are done. Therefore the priests are called in. Sisters are included in the priesthood. Anything that comes under their cognisance should be reported, but it is not only a report in mind that is here, but the thing is done, the slaughtering is done and the burning is done.
J.K. Would you say it is not a priestly act, the slaughtering?
J.T. Well, that is not the way it is put here. The slaughtering is done by the priest in other offerings as in @Leviticus 14 but generally the idea of priesthood is not slaughtering or putting to death. The priestly really belongs to heaven in christianity. That is the idea of it. Christ is in heaven. If He were on earth He would not be a priest; it is a heavenly matter and it is all the more important that we see the thing is well done. It is a heavenly matter and heaven is cognisant of it.
A.S.B. In @Deuteronomy 21 it is a city dealing in regard to the heifer. It is the elders who operate in regard to the slaughter, not exactly slaughtering there but breaking the heifer's neck and the priests come automatically into it.
J.T. That is a good point to bring up here because we have a word there that clarifies the priesthood. It is said, "The city that is nearest unto him that is slain, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer that hath not been wrought with, that hath not drawn in the yoke; and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto an ever-flowing watercourse, which is not tilled, nor is it sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the watercourse; and the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to do service unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall be every controversy and every stroke", @Deuteronomy 21: 3-g. So that as soon as you have an operation they must come into it. They are the other ones.
{241}
They have the last word about everything. But the actual operation in both cases here is in the elders, and in @Numbers 19 it is by anyone.
Ques. Is this not a very testing matter in small localities because there are several persons involved and there must not only be the priestly element but the clean man?
J.T. That is another thing that has to be taken account of. "A clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer, and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the assembly of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin". Now that is the point to be kept in mind because we come to it again in the law of the matter. The second thought is that as a clean man, he takes the hyssop and dips it in the water and shall "sprinkle it on the tent, and upon all the utensils, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that hath touched the bone, or the one slain, or the dead person, or the grave; and the clean shall sprinkle it on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and he shall purify him on the seventh day; and he shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even". So the clean man in verse 9 is also found in verse 18 and here these are important men but they are not called priests.
T.U. Where would you put the house of Chloe in this matter?
J.T. Well, we have not the idea of a report here. The house of Chloe reported the thing, and I should think that the house of Chloe therefore would be, in principle, clean. It would be a clean house. Paul said in that connection that he did not baptise. He said, 'God did not send me to baptise, but I baptised households'. The household is definite and I would say the household of Chloe was clean in the report. But Paul was the one that must carry the thing through
{242}
and he puts the responsibility on the whole assembly at Corinth.
S.W.P. Was the act of Phinehas in @Numbers 25 more an act of the spirit of priesthood rather than a priestly act?
J.T. Well, I do not know what to say about that. Phinehas was the priest par excellence, but he is the son of Eleazar. That is, it is an extension of the idea but the idea carried through. That is, the posterity of Aaron is recorded in @Exodus 6 and it ends up in Phinehas, as if the primal thought is carried through in him and the priesthood is given to him in perpetuity, showing that it is a question of what the man did, not what he was told to do, when an emergency had to be met. It has to be met and God owns it.
C.H.H. "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work", @2 Timothy 2: 21. Would that be a clean man?
J.T. Just so. One that is separated. That is exactly how the thing works out. He becomes purified by separating.
A.S.B. Is that the import of the appellation "water of separation"?
J.T. Yes. That is what it is for, to separate the person by washing him from the uncleanness. The uncleanness is all about him. The dead bodies, bones and graves, that is accounted for by earlier history. They had to traverse a certain territory several times, and there they were. There were six hundred thousand people dying in that territory over certain years; therefore you can calculate the number of bones that must have been in it. It is almost excusable if you touch a bone, but it is inexcusable if you do not appropriate the water. So that, "Be separated" is what the Lord is telling us. We are in difficult days
{243}
but at the same time there is a means of going through these days and maintaining the service of God.
S.McC. Would you say a word as to the practical application of this? I am sure there is a haziness in our minds as to how the matter works out practically. Is it that when defilement takes place, there is the reverting of the mind and intelligence to the death of Christ, and what it means as separating us from what is defiling, or how does it work out?
J.T. What you have suggested already as to the requirements of the provision comes up here. Suppose a young person has been in touch with a bone or with a dead person or a grave, all of these of course being understood antitypically. They are moral things that defile us. Well, the next thing is the knowledge of these things ought to be current amongst the brethren. What is kept in a clean place, of course, means not that the brethren have bookshelves and books in them, but they have in themselves knowledge of the provision, that they can tell immediately that the provision exists. The type says that it is in a clean place. It was put there by a clean person, but the antitype is in the brethren, in the people. They know they are responsible to impart it to a young person who does not know and therefore, you would say, naming the person, 'You have to do certain things'. The word 'law' in verse 14 is to be kept in mind. The law is what applies at any time, what is authoritative. It is not simply what I say, what a brother says, but what is authoritative. And the final authority, of course, is the Scriptures and therefore a young person has to become acquainted. We will take @Leviticus 4. We will say if a priest sins and is ignorant of it, and then if the whole assembly sins and is ignorant of it, and then a ruler sins and is ignorant of it, in all cases they are guilty as soon as it is brought to their attention.
What if the common people sin? That is what you have in mind, a young person, an ordinary person and
{244}
she or he is responsible. The ignorance does not shield them. Ignorance of the law never shields anyone. The law is the law, and therefore it says, "This is the law". That is to say, we have something authoritative, and that is to be brought in immediately and you move according to that law. Carrying out its injunctions means that I am cleansed.
S.McC. That helps very much.
J.T. You want to get the person right. It is not only what any statesman or governor says. It is what the Lord says. So it says in verse 14, "This is the law", and that is authoritative.
C.DeB. I notice that the clean person spoken of goes through the same process as the priest. He bathes himself, whereas in other instances it is merely washing. Would you say a word in connection with the bathing?
J.T. Well, bathing is washing, but what you notice in regard to the priest or the person who slays the offering is that they do it themselves; whereas in the case of an ordinary person, the law says that a clean person must do it. The law says that. It does not seem as if the priest is put under the law because he is supposed to know.
J.J. What is the significance of the slaying of the offering?
J.T. It is just a type of the death of Christ. He was slain. Whoever does it, the thing is done even though it was Pilate who ordered, or the Roman soldiers who did it, the thing was done.
J.W.B. What is the significance of cedar-wood, hyssop and scarlet?
J.T. They would be symbols of worldly glory, what might attach to us as being defiled. Perhaps indulging in these things might lead you into defilement and you have to see that that is cast into the burning. That is to say, the whole system of the world is brought down in this type and it is important
{245}
that a young person be brought now into the presence of the destruction of the whole world.
J.W.B. So that is not only the greatness as seen in the cedar-wood, but the smallness as seen in the hyssop.
J.T. It is all the same. It is the system of the world. When you get a convert that person is brought into the light of the destruction of the whole world, that God is done with it and He is not justifying it in any person.
Ques. This teaching is for an emergency. Apparently it was the young coming along at that time. Would a brother or sister amongst us linking themselves on with a worldly person for a wife or husband be a dead bone?
J.T. They might get a proposal of marriage by that young person. They are both young and they are, so to say, the generations that are going into the land potentially, because earlier than this the six hundred thousand that came out of Egypt never came into the land, only Caleb and Joshua. All the others are strewn in the desert. It makes it very solemn and yet I am taking them on as though nothing had happened. This is what is meant, I think, by the authoritative law here in verse 14 being brought to bear on these matters, what the young people are apt to indulge in and excuse themselves. The brethren have to be severe in these cases. It is for their good, because we say, 'What harm is there in it-he is a Christian?'. Yes, a Christian, but he is living in the grave, living with dead people morally, and he himself is dead, and yet you want to marry a dead person! That is the idea, that the thing has to be dealt with, and we have to be severe with it. It is not our feelings, but what the law says.
J.V. Would a purified mind help for keeping from these things? We move about and our intelligence should have a true place with us.
{246}
J.T. That is the point in our inquiry. We go to our house and other houses here as well as this meeting room and we have in our minds that we are to be pure. We have already referred to the house of Chloe. It must have been a clean house. It was not an open house where young people could bring in their friends in the evening and maybe have dances. It was not that. We read here of the open vessel. "And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, shall be unclean". We go into each other's houses. Are they open? Are young people allowed to come in and do what they like as they would in the world or
 nearly as much as the world would do? That will not do. The household is provided for. Evidently the house of Chloe was pure. Paul was counting on their reliability in accepting the report. He immediately acted upon it. It is a very important matter as to our households, whether they are clean, whether they are like an open vessel or whether they are covered.
Ques. "Whoever toucheth a dead person, the dead body of a man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; for the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him: he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him". Does this emphasise the ease with which this matter of cleanness may be brought about when it is understood to be needed? There are drastic consequences and I wonder if it is not emphasised that this is available.
J.T. The matter becomes simple because verse 14 is going over somewhat the previous verses but it is called the law. The thing now is imperative. What we are doing now is imperative, not simply it is relief to do it to be cleansed, but it is imperative to be cleansed and if he does not avail himself of the provision he is to be cut off, which is most solemn.
S.McC. Would that help us with questions coming
{247}
up in the matter of smoking? The brethren may be patient with a brother that smokes in bringing the truth to bear upon him in regard to it, but if he persists I think the brethren are justified in withdrawing.
J.T. I would go with that. The brethren may say you are severe in doing that, but it seems to be the right thing to do. Another thing that goes with a pipe and cigar is the radio, and also young people marrying outside. They are all grouped together. The young are just exposed and we are endeavouring to bring the truth forward and the authority of it.
Rem. Smoking is generally well known as being defiling, and I am sure that there is also a defiling influence in the current multiplicity of loose publications which particularly our young sisters read for the fashions and what-not. Possibly they do not see this and no doubt it hinders the service of God. Do you think that is suggestive?
J.T. That is good, because it is modernism that we are now dealing with, what they did not have in Pentecostal times or in the middle ages. We have a peculiar world that has arisen and these two wars have greatly accentuated it, and lawlessness. The young grow up in these things and think nothing of them, but the responsibility of the brethren now is the law-the kingdom of God. There is much made of man's kingdom which is in a certain way right, but there is such a thing as the kingdom of God which we must insist on. It is "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". 'Righteousness' is a big word and it means that it must be. There are no excuses at all. It must be so, the thing is right.
T.U. It seems to go to the root of things. We read of defiling the tabernacle of Jehovah, verse 13.
J.T. That is very good. The young people forget that. It is not simply a personal matter. It is a case of the sanctuary of God and what He requires.
{248}
A.S.B. Would you help us regarding verses 17 and 18? The ashes are connected with the purification offering and the virtue would appear to be in the ashes, offering the ashes of purification. "And they shall take for the unclean of the ashes of the purification-offering that hath been burned, and shall put running water thereon in a vessel". Say something about that-the ashes of purification, and the waters of separation.
J.T. And the vessel. All these things have to be looked into because the idea of a vessel is something, too. You cannot have the running water preserved without that. It would run away, but the vessel contains it so that it is applicable at any time in quantity. It is not to run away but rather that the Spirit of God is in it. The law is one thing but then the Spirit of God is in it and the Spirit of God is the cleansing power. If a believer, christian, or young person is at all amenable, he will find that out, that that vessel is useful. It contains what he needs. It is enough to cleanse him, not only the water, but the combination of the ashes. That is to say, the death of Christ brought into contact with the Spirit in the vessel.
S.W.P. The vessel is the believer who has the Spirit. Would that be in mind in what Paul speaks of, "Ye who are spiritual", @Galatians 6: 1?
J.T. The idea is that the persons are spiritual, and they have the Holy Spirit; "Ye who are spiritual", means that.
G.McP. Is it not very humbling that these conditions and refusal to purify ourselves are found amongst us, whereas John says, "And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure", @1 John 3: 3?
J.T. Yes, he has the means in himself.
S.McC. What is referred to in verse 18 is interesting: "And a clean man shall take hyssop, and dip it
{249}
in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and upon all the utensils, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that hath touched the bone, or the one slain, or the dead person, or the grave". Looking at it in a broad way, Bethesda would excuse certain persons because of where they were. While they did not take in the thing, they say they were immune from it, but the principle of the persons that were there is important, is it not?
J.T. Yes. So that this section comes under the heading, "This is the law", therefore the clean person here carries authority with him. He is not any brother who might give advice or even opinion. He comes under the head of a person who is authoritative. The brethren are to be viewed in that light. Now, in our houses we might give advice about a matter to a young person, but when we sit down in the care meeting or in the assembly then we come under the law. It is not the advice now, but rather the law, the authority that we are under, and we are to be subject to one another.
Ques. Why is the water sprinkled first on the tent and then the utensils?
J.T. It is an enclosure. There is not much in that. Let us just look at it again, first of all, keeping in mind the provision and then the clean man in verse 18, and what he takes, hyssop which denotes smallness. It is smallness. He is small like Paul. He is not a weak person. He is not a great cleric or a man that would say, 'You belong to my flock'. He takes hyssop and dips it in the water and sprinkles the tent. The tent is brought into the idea of small ness. There is no sense of great furniture or carpets or the like that would be imposing upon the human mind. The hyssop would deal with all that. It says, "Upon all the utensils"; however valuable they may be they are brought into this smallness in the idea of the hyssop and the idea of persons that are
{250}
there, and then he comes into it: "And upon him that hath touched the bone, or the one slain". All that runs together-how the brother is really brought up in truth. Paul is really a model for a christian. "Saul, who also is Paul", which means small, not a great person who would stand up and assume to be important because he has got clerical orders. No, he is just one of the others. Paul would provide a fire and build it and do anything else that had to be done. The Lord says, "But I am in the midst of you as the one that serves", @Luke 22: 27. We can hardly serve the brethren unless we have respect for them. And a small person is ready to respect the brethren and in that way there is power, which can be used in the cleansing of any one.
S.W.P. The heifer is small and red. Why this conspicuous colour? It is a small animal. It is not a bullock.
J.T. It is important to note that it is not a little creature. The heifer is a full-grown creature only representing what is feminine and in this sense soft and tender and feeling, the fullest thought of perfection, no defect. That is what God has made her. Now as to what this redness means. I should think that she is not only carrying these feminine qualities but she is different. She is distinctive because she is red, like the house of Stephanas or Phoebe. All these are distinctive persons. Why are they distinctive? Because they are christians. They have christian qualities, and intelligent qualities. That is what is in mind. This point of littleness and redness-what is meant? What do you say?
S.W.P. I wanted to contrast that with the glory of man that is introduced in the scarlet and the cedar-wood.
J.T. To follow this thought up in the heifer: she has feminine qualities which means tenderness and feeling, but she has no defect. "They bring thee a
{251}
red heifer without blemish, wherein is no defect, and upon which never came yoke", you see, and she is red. We will now look at all these facts. What do they mean? She is a type of Christ. She does not mean something small but something distinctive. And its distinction is what you expect to see in Christ, that He was distinctive in all His characteristics and He suffers in that way. The heifer represents Christ in the offering but it works out to every one of us and gives us status, so christianity is distinctive. The assembly is distinctive, where persons are not like ordinary persons; a sister is not like an ordinary person. There is none like her; she is distinctive. Phoebe, when she went to Rome, is a good example. She had a letter from Paul commending her as a sister and she went to Rome, the capital of the world at that time. Would she be interested in the buildings or the shops or in buying a new dress there? Not at all. That would not give her distinction. Others in Rome would do those things. She is not like that at all. She is distinctive, that is to say, she is a real christian and is not like the world at all.
Rem. The whole household of Stephanas is distinctive.
J.T. She is not aping the world or taking on the fashions. They are nothing to her. The question is whether she is suitably garbed before God.
A.A.T. Is the thought of the red heifer to apply to us?
J.T. If it were not, it would not be here. It is selected for this purpose. It is a personal feature which can be noticed, but not noticed as rich or worldly, but as having a christian character, a lowly christian character like Phoebe.
J.J. Paul was being a model to believers.
Ques. Is it the tender feelings coming out when he says, "We beg you, brethren, to know those who ... take the lead among you in the Lord, and admonish
{252}
you, and to regard them exceedingly in love"? It is taking account of this.
J.T. Just so. The Colossian saint is hidden in the sense that he is not distinctive according to man. The Lord was not distinctive according to man. He was amongst men. He took His place among men like another man. The christian can do that.
Ques. In the gospel last night the thought of smallness came in. I thought it would be much in line with this, but yet distinctive. Would this be in line with the smallness of the setting of the poor wise man?
J.T. Quite so. The city had a poor wise man in it. I was thinking of the distinctiveness of Elisha in Israel. Naaman thought of the king. If he was to be cleansed it was a question of the king. But no, it is a poor wise man; he did not come out to see him but he showed him how to get cleansed; that is the idea.
G.McP. Would the heavenly qualities and distinctiveness of christianity be seen in Paul and Silas in prison and also in Lydia-the distinctiveness of the heifer?
J.T. Just so.
H.B. In the matter of restoration the spiritual restore in the spirit of meekness. Is that how it is to be done?
J.T. You approach a brother or sister not as above him but at his feet to serve him.
E.C. Why do you think it is necessary to do it on a third day? Is it to derive virtue in the matter?
J.T. The third day brings in the idea of progression. Suppose you call a person an untruthful person to his face and rail on him. You may judge it on the spot and regret it, but you cannot go in and give an address to the people of God right away. The thing has to be gone through. Certain exercises have to be gone through to reach the point of purification for the service of God or whatever it may be.
{253}
E.C. Is three days the normal length of time for the self-judgment to take place?
J.T. Well, it says seven in this passage. Take the history of Peter. The Lord appeared to him as He arose from the dead. "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". You say Simon will be fully restored. But according to John he had much more to go through. That would mean the seven instead of the three.
H.B. Unclean until the even.
J.T. That is another thing. Another day. "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath". That is an allusion to the day, the close of the day.
A.A.T. I was wondering what the connection was with @Revelation 22, the washing of the robes?
J.T. Well, we have anticipated it largely. It says in verse 14, "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life". It is a question of washing the robes. It is not that you have been washed. The Lord says to Peter, "He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet, but is wholly clean", @John 13: 10. That sort of thing has to go on continually and that is what is alluded to in @Revelation 22: 14, that one has to continually keep his robes clean. He is to be up-to-date all the time with clean robes so that any time he may take part in the tree of life or enter by the gates into the city.
H.B. Something like what you said about the repenting sinner?
J.T. Yes. It is going on all the time. That is a real person. John says, "Blessed are they that wash their robes". Not that 'have' washed, but "wash" their robes. They do it all the time, so to speak. That is, they are always clean that they might have right to the tree of life and to enter by the gates into the city. So you are always ready for the tree of life and for the city. You are part of the most exalted things. Paul was always ready for them.
{254}
C.H.H. Would the application of the water bring to light the necessity of household readings? It says, "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work", @2 Timothy 3: 16, 17. You speak of the sins of ignorance: probably a good many things are done through ignorance, whereas the reading of the Scriptures and the application of them would convict, and would not the water there be the word in a sense?
J.T. I would think so. We shall proceed to that this afternoon, the washing of water by the word. Where the Scriptures apply as in our morning readings, the young people get washed by what is said and that is what is in mind here, that he has in mind that he has part in the greatest things, that he is not only a clean person, but that he can have part in the greatest things, that is, the tree of life which belongs to the celestials, to the people of the heavenly city. "That they should go in by the gates into the city"-meaning you pass with the doorkeeper. You do not have to ask any leave to go in. You just go in. You have a right to go in because you are washed.
A.A.T. Is it right to fink that scripture up with people seeking fellowship?
J.T. I think it would be, only that when they are coming into fellowship we are not so much stressing the idea of what is heavenly-of course you may do -- but you begin at the bottom. What we have already in @Numbers 19 would apply more because we are in the midst of a world of corruption.
S.McC. When you say the tree of life belongs to the celestials, have you in mind that only the saints who comprise the heavenly city will have access to the tree of life?
J.T. I think that is so. The leaves of the tree are for those outside.
{255}
S.McC. What about the saints of past dispensations that are embodied in the twenty-four elders referred to earlier in Revelation? Do they have part or access?
J.T. I think all have part, that are celestials. There are to be other families, but the city comprises one family. I think it is exclusively the assembly when you come down to the abstract. But then you have the names of the twelve tribes of Israel inscribed at the gates, and the nations bring their glory to it. So that they are closely linked with it. I think the Old Testament saints in some sense have access to the tree of life. That should be gone into more, but we have no time. Our subject is purification, not life.
{256}
PURIFICATION (5)
@John 13: 1 - 17; @Ephesians 5: 25 - 27
J.T. Verses 14 and 15 of @Revelation 22, which were touched on this morning, really link on with what is here in @John 13. We were unable to enlarge on those verses because there was not time, but they are very important verses as to our subject, especially because they connect washing or cleansing with the very highest enjoyment and relation, that is, part in the tree of life and then going by the gates into the city. The passage in @John 13 is intended to be the finishing part of the Lord's life here before His death, that is, viewing His departure, not as from a realm on earth that He entered after His resurrection, but from the actual conditions in the world, which He moved in with the disciples. It, as it were, was a moving from those conditions into heaven. His actual ascent is from resurrection ground, which is not the point here. The point here is leaving the conditions He was used to in service and administering His parting word to His disciples.
C.H.H. The position of the tree of life in the second verse of @Revelation 22 is very conspicuous and very accessible.
G.McP. Is there any difference between the thought of washing our robes and that in @John 13 of the washing of the feet?
J.T. Well, there is a link, I think. Both are dealing with the very highest levels of our position: @John 13 refers to us having part with Christ as having gone out of the world to the Father, and @Revelation 22 to having part in the tree of fife. "They may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city". The idea of right in this verse is striking, that the right is established for us, that we
{257}
go into our own realm, as it were, so that the idea of asking for fellowship or being received into fellowship is questionable. These phrases are just questionable. The idea is to establish a right and that includes washing, washing the robes. The robes are not inner garments, but externals, in which we would appear externally.
A.A.T. What is the difference between washing the robes and having a right to the tree of life, and washing the feet and having "part with me"?
J.T. We are just coming to those matters. It is in order to bring it up now, what the difference is. The difference is not very much because what each introduces is part with Christ as having gone out of the world to His Father, and the right to eat of the tree of life and to enter in by the gates. There is not very much difference really, but John in chapter 13 is dealing with the Lord in the scene in which He had been, that He is just going out of that scene, not rising out of the grave and going up, but going out of this scene into the realm of His Father. The tree of life is in the midst of the paradise of God, and the gates are an allusion to official entrance to that paradise which was shut according to @Genesis 3. Paradise was closed to Adam. Now it is open, not simply that access is permitted, but that there are those who have a right to it. It is remarkable that the word 'right' should be used. We have a right to eat of the tree of life, not just to partake of the leaves, but to eat of the tree, the real fruit, and then to enter by the gates into the city.
A.A.T. I notice this difference that in Revelation it is done by the person whereas in @John 13 someone else is washing the feet. I may wash my feet or you may wash mine.
J.T. That is quite true. That is what the Lord is endeavouring to establish in @John 13 by example. In the last chapter of the Bible it is those that wash.
{258}
They do it themselves, just as in chapter 7 they wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb. So in this last chapter they wash their robes without saying by what. The first washing in Revelation is by the Lord Himself, that is, He washes us by His own blood, we are told.
He has done it. It is a finished thing, but in chapter 7 it is the persons themselves who have done it. It is still finished. It is a question of the blood in chapters 1 and 7, but chapter 22 simply speaks of washing; we are not told how. It is simply that they do it, that the washing is done by themselves. So that it gives them right to the very highest things.
Rem. Verse 14, therefore, is like a normal procedure, the consequence of which is the right to the entrance. It is a normal procedure followed out by us who abide by the instruction.
J.T. I suppose the earlier references would be included or considered, but the persons and the immediate result are what our inquiry is concerned with now, the persons that do it. They are blessed, it says. They are blessed people. Notice the stress is laid on that, that they do it, not on the materials they use, or the modus operandi of it, but that they do it, and that they are blessed in that, and the greatest things are available to them through that. I mean to say, the idea in both cases is as if we are finishing up. The Spirit of God is finishing in @Revelation 22 because those outside are not merely ordinary worldly people.
They are persons who are lost. Verse 15 says, "Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loves and makes a lie". That is to say, we have no one of that class, so that all the redeemed are in mind in verse 14. There all believers are in mind; none of them are left outside and they are already blessed in what they are doing. There is no half measure. There is no idea of one being partially able to enter, but it is an absolute thing.
{259}
Ques. Is it a fixed class?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. What is without is a fixed class?
J.T. That is the word to be used. The class outside is fixed. There is no hope for them. It is not just as it is now. There are many who remain in the world and yet they may be the Lord's, but there is no suggestion of that in chapter 22; moreover as you go down the chapter it says, "And let the filthy make himself filthy still". The matter is fixed.
T.U. In verse 14 is it optional with them? Do they wash their robes because they have to do it or because they desire to do it?
J.T. I think it is a class. They are a blessed people. The Lord gives us in @Matthew 5 a list of persons who are blessed for what they do; that is in His ministry down here, but this is the finish of things, I think, here in Revelation. The classes are defined and fixed.
Ques. Do you think in @Revelation 22 it is not so much the process that is in view, but the wonderful results that are acquired?
J.T. And the persons that do these things, what kind of persons are they? They are thorough people. They are people who value what they are brought into, what is available to them. There are no half measures contemplated by them at all. We might as well make up our mind that there are conditions such as these. We are drawing near the end. We might as well accept it that there are fixed conditions, and challenge ourselves lest we be found in the outside position, because the others are real people, thorough people. They are first-class people and they know how to do things and they know why they do it and they are blessed because they do it.
S.McC. What would be the difference between washing the robes and making them white in the blood of the Lamb and the washing in relation to the water?
{260}
J.T. Well, there is not much as to the way things are put. They are thorough people. You often see a wash hung up in the garden and it is not altogether white. Stress is laid on the whiteness, that it is a thorough matter. It is thoroughly done. It is over against those who take half measures, whereas God is serious in everything and looks for things dome well.
S.W.P. Is the thought that they are not blessed because they do it, but they do it because they are blessed? Is that the suggestion?
J.T. The word is, "Blessed are they that wash". That is, the persons who do that are blessed, I think. You might say you are speaking about any of those now towards the end of the dispensation that we are in. They are thorough people and they are blessed in their thoroughness. They are blessed in it. It is not that the things washed are half white or partially white, but entirely white. I mean that is what is meant, that the thing is done. They washed their robes so that the robes themselves speak for themselves.
Ques. Is there a suggestion in the fact that it is not mentioned what they washed with because they were accustomed to it for a long time?
J.T. If you were talking about it, you would say, 'I know them. I know that they do not deal with half measures and they are blessed in doing'. There is blessing in the things that they are doing.
J.McK. Is there any suggestion as to the testimony or witness in the purification, so what is characteristic of them is what is seen in that their robes are washed?
J.T. The thing is there. Their washing is testimony for they are thorough.
A.S.B. Does a robe suggest a rather lengthy garment subject to contamination?
J.T. I suppose so. It is an external thought, that in which you appear externally. The high priest's
{261}
robe would extend down to his feet. That is the idea of an all-over garment.
S.McC. In @John 13, it is not the garment that is in mind, but persons, the feet. What would be the difference?
J.T. It is "Blessed are they that wash their robes". The person is in mind, that they do it.
A.S.B. Is it like the psalm in that way, "Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah"?
J.T. Just so. They have that characteristic, that they have such a God as that and they are blessed. That is, a real people. What you feel is the need of real people, out-and-out people. The time has come especially for that and nothing else will do. "Let the filthy make himself filthy still", the Spirit of God says.
G.McP. Does the washing of the robes involve what we have in chapter 1: "Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written in it; for the time is near", so that we may enjoy the tree of life in our assembly relation?
J.T. Just so. The last chapter of the Bible has a significance. Of course, perhaps the order of the Bible is not the Spirit's work, but it seems to be of God: the book of Revelation is just where it should be. We are finishing and there is no time for half measures; we should go the full way, otherwise we are apt to be outside. "Without are the dogs".
Rem. It says of those of intelligence in the last chapter of Daniel, "Many shall be purified, and be made white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand". I think the wisdom here is very evident in those who have washed their garments.
J.T. That is a very good connection. It says, "Go thy way, Daniel". He was a trusted man. It is not anybody that can go. That is what God is looking
{262}
for and stressing that we become at the last moment. There is no time for half measures in the last moment. We want to go the whole way and be ready for the end.
T.U. Is there any thought of urgency in this matter in verse 14? It says that they may have right and that they should go in. As those two thoughts are dominant and linked with the end of the book and the finality of things, I wonder if the thought of urgency would enter into the matter of washing their robes.
J.T. Urgency is good, I am sure. That is just the point. There is no time for anything else, but finishing things and doing them well, being ready, as it were.
Ques. Is there a suggestion in @John 13 that this is a great matter in the Lord's mind that He lays aside His garments and girds Himself?
J.T. We are trying to stress the character of the book of Revelation, that is, finishing things. We come to the finish. God is looking for reality. In @John 13 it is as if the Lord is departing and giving a parting word. It is not as going up to heaven from resurrection ground as risen. That is not the point. He is going up from the sphere where He has been setting out the greatest possible things and all has been done well, infinitely well, and He is saying He is going to leave and He expects similar conditions amongst them when He leaves; so in verse 13 He says, "Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for I am so. If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet; for I have given you an example that, as I have done to you, ye should do also. Verily, verily, I say to you, The bondman is not greater than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him. If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them". So the matter is put in their own hands. Now we have to examine what was done, what was put into their hands, what was left with them. The paragraph
{263}
starts: "Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end. And during supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon, Iscariote, that he should deliver him up, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God"; He goes to God. That is a real thing; it is urgent, almost immediately happening. He "rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel he girded himself: then he pours water into the washhand basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded". Now, that is what He did. That is the example. But then, there is something that happens or is said by Him in answer to Peter's attitude. Peter says, "Thou shalt never wash my feet". That is Peter's attitude. "Jesus answered him, Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". There is something injected there seemingly incidental, but it is really the crux of the matter. It is a question of having part with Him in the interim between the time that He ascends to the Father and His return. This process has to be understood.
S.McC. Just how does it work out? What form does this service take, "unless I wash thee", with us now?
J.T. I think it goes on. The Lord means to say that it is a process which goes on in which He has part, what He has to do in order that we should have part with Him. It is a spiritual matter. What He did actually is typical of what is spiritual.
C.H.H. Would the clean man of @Numbers 19 have the teaching of the application of this, or would this go farther?
J.T. I think this goes farther because it is the
{264}
highest thought, you might say. It is an answer to what Peter said, and the Lord is saying that unless this happens, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". That is very serious. Would it not fringe on what it says in @Revelation 22 on those being without? It would make matters very serious among us unless we go the whole way, bowing to what is to be done, what is essential, what must be done.
S.McC. "Unless I wash thee", does that take form by the Lord operating in a general way through the ministry in relation to this service, or is it specific?
J.T. I think it is carried on spiritually. It is done mediately and very likely He might use you or me or others, but He does it. It is mediate service, not immediate, but mediate. He does it, I suppose, through us because He is not here, but He has got that here through which He can act in a mediate way. Would you say that?
S.McC. Yes, I am sure that is so.
J.T. If you do it, the Lord may be using you to do it, but He is doing it. On the other hand, you may do it and be regarded as doing it as well. The same time, the service by itself goes on continually during the dispensation and characterises this dispensation. I do not think there will be anything like it in the future. There may be something of it in the coming dispensation, but I do not think the Lord will be acting from heaven. He is doing that now.
S.W.P. How extensive is the thought in the Lord's mind, "Part with me"? Is it wider than a provisional thought?
J.T. I think it involves what will be our eternal portion. We get it already through this process. While we are down here we come into that and if we are not washed, then we may get among the outside persons that are so severely spoken of.
T.L.S. Do you think Peter had a greater advantage? It would look as though the Lord came to
{265}
Peter last and as if he would see all that matter going on before him. We have the advantage of seeing these matters going on before our eyes and then it comes to ourselves as though there is a great advantage in having it come that way too.
J.T. Yes, that is that kind of thing is carried on.
Ques. We have been having moral features in @Numbers 19. Is this washing here more than that?
J.T. I think so. I think it is on a higher level. It is really the Lord's own action, only He introduces other things. That is an idea of an example for us but it is a service taken on and is carried on in heaven, but He does it mediately, through others.
Ques. Is this operation which the Lord takes on in view of what follows? You referred in the beginning to the Lord going to the Father and are we to regard this operation in view of what follows?
J.T. Quite so. It is having part with Him where He is.
A.D. Is this service in relation to the Supper? I was wondering if the Lord in this action here is not fitting us so that we can be suitable to take part in the service of praise.
J.T. Just so. The service of God in the assembly really is involved in this, what is going on in the interim. All these years the Lord is maintaining this. Even if He is using others, He is maintaining it, and if we do not allow Him to do it, then our position is questionable.
G.V.D. Does the Lord's saying He was going to the Father suggest that? That is, the very highest part of the service of praise is in mind.
J.T. Quite so. Moreover, we should notice that it says, "Jesus knowing ... that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end". That is a beautiful word to have in our souls, having loved
{266}
them, "having loved his own who were in the world"; He carried on this.
C.H.H. Do you think it would be a sovereign act on the part of God in respect to those we speak of as in christendom? Paul speaks in the Thessalonians of those who do not wash their robes, yet they are the elect, and have no idea of any changing at all. Do you think there will be a sovereign work of God before they are taken away so that the full thought will take place, otherwise where would you place them?
J.T. Those that are spoken of in Thessalonians?
C.H.H. Those we are told not to keep company with. They do not follow the instructions of the apostle's doctrine and we are not to keep company with them. They are not washing their robes, but so to speak they are in, but where would we place them? I wonder if there would be some act of God sovereignly at the close of their history to put them in this class in Revelation.
J.T. You say they are not washing their robes? You mean that they are not carrying out the instructions? It reads in @2 Thessalonians 3: 6, "Now we enjoin you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw"; that word 'withdraw' we have often noticed. It means 'shrink from', not exactly refusing, but shrinking, hesitating, and so it goes on, "that ye withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the instruction which he received from us. For ye know yourselves how ye ought to imitate us, because we have not walked disorderly among you: nor have we eaten bread from any one without cost; but in toil and hardship working night and day not to be chargeable to any one of you: not that we have not the right, but that we might give ourselves as an example to you, in order to your imitating us. For also when we were with you we enjoined you this, that if any man does not like to work, neither let him eat. For we
{267}
hear that there are some walking among you disorderly, not working at all, but busybodies". Well now, you refer to these and your inquiry is as to whether some special action is not needed to take place in order to fit them for eternal relations.
C.H.H. Yes, I had in mind particularly verse 14 which is not quite so severe as what we have read.
J.T. "But if any one obey not our word by the letter, mark that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed of himself; and do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother". Well now, does this chapter not contemplate a tentative state of things? The brother is not named as outside, or even worthy of being put outside. It is not even said that you should withdraw from him, but shrink from him, as it were, so the whole position is tentative and God might adjust it by ministry through one another. That is going on all the time amongst us and therefore I do not see why you bring in the idea of doing something sovereignly at the end because it may be done here amongst ourselves.
C.H.H. I was assuming what we find in system, where there seems to be no recovery as far as we see, and yet there are the elect.
J.T. Does the instruction not indicate possible recovery? You are not putting the brother away or separating yourselves as in 2 Timothy. It is just that it is a state of things that is dangerous; it should not be there. Can it not be rectified through their service to one another because they are told what to do to the end that it might be rectified?
C.H.H. That would be very encouraging because there are so many young people who move away into the world and they have been that way for years, while we have assurance that they are really the Lord's.
J.T. I think that is what is meant here. The
{268}
persons in mind are not working with their hands, yet they may be fairly good brothers and therefore the instruction may be given as to correction and adjustment. I do not see why we should put this off to the end. If you are referring to persons who are in christendom, we have evidence that they are real; as to whether the Lord would come for us and find those half real persons, what is to be done?
C.H.H. Yes, that is what I have in mind.
J.T. That is a big matter; I think we spoke about that in Montreal; that same question came out. What will be done with persons abroad in the different denominations, persons whom we have good reason to believe are the Lord's; I think it was observed that the Lord could do a good deal in the twinkling of an eye, and I believe that is true; it is our hope that every element that belongs to Christ will come out in the end in some way and if we fail to secure them, the Lord will probably, or really, have a way of saving them by sovereign actions so to fit them for the eternal portion. I believe that that much will be done and we know that much will be done, for our own resurrection will be done on the basis of a twinkling of an eye. We shall all be changed in the twinkling of an eye. Why could not some of those be changed inwardly and made fit to be caught up to heaven? That would not give licence to suggest that we should remain as we are outside; not very long since a sister said to me, 'Even if we are not in fellowship, we will be saved anyway'. It is serious. If we think that, it is another matter. The Lord has power to do that. In the twinkling of an eye He has power to do great things; namely, to change us from our present state into the resurrection conditions.
A.S.B. I wondered when you referred to the change, because what you have emphasised elsewhere is that there will be no development of the work of God in eternity. The requirement is that the development
{269}
is now and we have to link on with that development side.
J.T. That is quite right. We had that years ago and we had trouble about it, too; the idea that we continue to grow on after we go to heaven really involves a monstrosity. What shall we grow to? So it is, every man shall be presented perfect, but supposing we have not got that ministry? The Lord is able to do it. The Lord is able to perfect a brother or sister here on earth before He takes them to heaven. The work is finished in every one of us as we are taken to heaven.
S.McC. How do you distinguish between measure of capacity alongside of that? Everyone's measure of capacity certainly will not be the same in eternity.
J.T. The Lord can do that. The things that He can do are infinite and if He has a niche for me to fill in the body, we will say, I will be there. He will see to that. But that is not intended in any way to mitigate our responsibility. As Paul said, "present every man perfect in Christ Jesus". He was aiming at that and we should have no less aim than that. There cannot be a single discrepancy in us in eternity from the counsel of eternity before. God has seen us before we have ever had our being, "Whom he has foreknown". He sees us as we are actually here. He has seen us in the past eternity and we shall conform to that. He will see to that.
S.McC. Perfection in that way does not mean that everybody will be the same and have the same capacity but that each is perfect according to his impression of God by the work of God.
J.T. God sees to that. That belongs to His province. What takes place in result must be entirely according to His plan, to His counsel, because He has foreknown us. I understand by that He has looked down the ages and seen us as we are here and seen us as we shall be caught up to heaven.
{270}
{271}
perfectly. We are not to judge really as to whether they are perfect, but suppose there are persons who are imperfect according to the work of God, well, God can finish it, you know, in the twinkling of an eye.
A.S.B. I like what you say in regard to our having no licence, that is, the putting off this constructive side, for I might maintain a place outside the fellowship and this chapter contemplates the fellowship. I might say it will be all right in the end, but I am putting myself out of this realm of cleansing and greatly suffering from it.
J.T. How do I know that it is so? Maybe I am not saved at all so far as myself is concerned.
Ques. In relation to what we are saying, how are we to understand a man's works being burned, but that he himself shall be saved?
J.T. That is something to consider. We have to work these things out to see how they can be. But if we bring God in they will be very simple. That a man's works shall be burned up and he shall be saved; the man that God saved is the man that He foreknew. He worked out what He foreknew, for what He foreknew is what He intended to work out to completion.
Hence, some of us would be very small. But then we were that size when God saw us and foreknew us.
Ques. Would you say that Paul has the Philippians especially in mind when he says, "He who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day", and then he adds, "As it is righteous for me to think this as to you all, because ye have me in your hearts"?
J.T. That is a very good passage to bring up now because it shows in Paul's mind the completion of the work. Paul had good ground because what God's counsels were, what He foreknew, were in His hands. The result in them would be perfect, would conform to the will of God because he says, "Ye have me in your hearts", for having him in their hearts you might
{272}
say that they loved Christ and loved Paul as being like Him, because Christ is a model for us. Paul says, "Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing". So he knew what they would be ultimately by the way they regarded him.
The Corinthians did not regard him that way. They thought he should have a letter of commendation as an ordinary brother, but the Philippians would not have it that way. They had him in their hearts.
A.S.B. Making what you are saying practical, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure", @Philippians 2: 12, 13.
J.T. That is all very good and I am glad it has come up for it is the way it should be regarded, on the way to the final result. It is the way we should look at things. It dissipates carelessness. A person saying, 'I will be saved anyway', how do you know? How do you know you are not deceived now?
C.H.H. "Examine your own selves if ye be in the faith", @2 Corinthians 13: 5.
J.T. He speaks about certain having the marks of sinful people.
Ques. "Make your calling and election sure". Does that fit?
J.T. That fits in exactly. Quite so. "Make your calling and election sure", because it dissipates carelessness. I think the idea alluded to, to say, 'I will be saved anyway', is abominable. It is abominable. It is trifling with the things of God, because it is a most serious matter. How do I know I am saved? May I not be deceived? It is very likely I am if I speak in that careless way.
J.McK. In @2 Timothy 1: 14 it says, "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit
{273}
entrusted". That is the exercise from our side, but he says, "for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him". That is the thing from God's side.
J.T. See the language he used. On the way to the end, travelling on from the divine conception of the beginning, "Whom he foreknew"-travelling on from that to the finish. What language the apostle would use and what solemnity!
T.L.S. John says, "We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren".
J.T. That is good because, as I was saying, we are apt to be so trifling and consider that we are saved anyway. If I am trifling may I not be dark altogether? "Let the filthy make himself filthy still".
Ques. Would the Lord be looking forward to chapter 20 of this gospel? Would the fulness of the thought be in His mind in the feet washing?
J.T. I think that is right. He starts on that basis, knowing that the hour had come that He should depart out of this world to the Father, and then "knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God, rises from supper". That is the whole matter settled in His mind from the beginning to the end. I believe all is fixed. All will be gone through and He is operating on that principle. Therefore, He is washing their feet. They needed that.
That belonged to the scheme of God. This part of the work belongs to Him.
A.S.B. It is really a wonderful thought of coming out from God and going to God. How much is involved in that and gathered up by the Lord in this great system of cleansing set up to preserve us in it.
J.T. So the Lord says, "Those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be
{274}
fulfilled". So that things are just as accurate as God can make them, infinitely accurate. Everything conforms with His plan.
G.McP. Does coming from God and going to God suggest that the approach to God is equal to the revelation?
J.T. It is. The approach is equal to the revelation because Christ is the One through whom we approach. God has come out in Christ and we go in in Him. That is, the approach is equal to the revelation; it conforms to it exactly.
S.McC. That is important because we can never assume to draw near to God except through our Lord Jesus Christ, can we?
J.T. That is the point we have come to, I am sure, that the Lord would get into our souls the certainty of our position as believers. And on the other hand, the abominableness of assuming with lightness that things will be because God has counselled them and we can do as we wish here in this world. Whereas the Lord's service here is that we should not, because if the washing does not go on then He says, 'You are out of it, whatever you may think. You are out of it if the washing does not go on'. Here is a man professedly an apostle and he is saying something that would put him out of it if he carries it out, and therefore the danger of allowing our wills to act as if we could not interfere with it. Our wills can interfere with it.
Ques. Are we to hold the two thoughts in our mind-come out from God-revelation, and "Came by water and blood" linking on with that?
J.T. Coming out from God is one thing. That is, He is a divine Person but coming by water and blood means that He has become man. The water and the blood is the means by which He brings the things to pass and He is operating in that and we are to be brought into it, too. We are all to be operating. It
{275}
is a living system. And so the woman of Sychar left her water-pot. She is brought into the new system. She is an operator of the new system right away and so it is with every christian. You begin to operate in the new system.
A.S.B. It is His own prerogative. It is not as being sent here. It is "He came out from God and was going to God". It is a wonderful thought.
J.T. It is in a sense the Mediator. He is viewed in that way. He came to carry out the behests of God and to reveal Him and goes back to Him, and brings about the result, because we are the result, and therefore He says, 'There is not one lost save the son of perdition, that the scripture should be fulfilled'.
G.McP. Is not the feet washing to make us more suitable for the presence of God in the assembly?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord intends that the divine behests are conformed to even already. Before we are conformed to His resurrection the divine will is represented in the present time with the washing, with this further service, this (as you might say) last moment service which the Lord carries on with every one of us, and we must not withdraw our feet from His hands.
C.H.H. I think you said the first of Corinthians is the wash-hand basin and the second is the towel.
J.T. Yes, it is a linen towel, you will notice. They are hard to get now. Linen is the most absorbent thing you can get. It absorbs moisture. The Lord took it here, we are told. He took the linen towel and girded Himself with it.
Ques. Are we looking at the water as to the prophetic side of the truth and the towel as to the priestly side?
J.T. I suppose there is something in that. The prophetic side is that what comes from God is God's mind because prophecy is from God. It is His mind, what He would do, and what He thinks. Well now,
{276}
how am I to be conformed? I think you would say that it is priestly. We need the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. Therefore, the ministry meeting requires more than the word given. There is the priestly side as to how we learn and treat each other so that the ministry is effective and acceptable in each other.
Rem. The Lord changes their way of speaking about it: "Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord". He reverses it: "I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher". I suppose we need to come to that side of the Lord before the teaching becomes operative?
J.T. You mean that the Lord comes before the Teacher? Well, I think that is good. The Lord put it that way and that is the way it is to be put. Not what they said, but the way He is saying, that the authority of Christ comes before His teaching. If I am to be taught by Him, I must submit to Him. The word 'Rabbi' is 'teacher' and I think it carries with it the idea of authority. Therefore we have the teaching in Ephesus; Paul retired to the school of Tyrannus. That is the place of authority, not simply that he spoke with authority, but there must be subjection in the learning. As I listen to the truth, there must be subjection to the Lord. His authority must be owned. I am glad you brought that up. "If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet; for I have given you an example that, as I have done to you, ye should do also".
E.C. Would you say that this service requires great spiritual sensitiveness so that we should not offend?
J.T. Quite so. We are apt to offend. I think the clerical system is just characterised by that sort of thing. Men are browbeaten by it. Primarily the clerical system tended to bondage. Teaching should be liberal but still at the same time there must be
{277}
submission to the Lord. "And having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled", @2 Corinthians 10: 6. Every item of disobedience will be dealt with, but when the saints come to it, then the apostle would deal with the disobedience. Disobedience is intolerable amongst the people of God.
S.McC. In @Numbers 19, the washing, the purification is connected with some specific act or condition of defilement, but here it does not seem to be linked with any act of the moment but general.
J.T. That is to say the apostles in this time are ceremonially clean. They are not viewed as unclean. So that there is more needed in this process than merely external rectitude prevailing among us, fulfilling what we may think is right. There is more needed than that for the service of God, for our part with the Lord in the presence of the Father-this delicate matter of not washing all over but of removing the slightest soil. The Lord says, 'It is My matter really, that you are to have part with Me but you must be equal to Me', because it is a question of Himself and those He is bringing in in the service before God. For instance, Joseph was to present his brethren to Pharaoh. It was not all of them. Five of them were presented. We are not given their names, but a selection was made as if they were suitable to be presented to the monarch and that is what the Lord is dealing with here. He is bringing us in before God. He is going to the Father. He is going to God and He wants us to be there as He is, not in any way discrediting Him. Everything must be conformed to Him.
S.McC. Would it not be involved in our being set free inwardly, not just as to any external action or the like, but being set free in our spirit and mind in passing over with Him to have part with Him?
J.T. So that I think sonship must enter into all this. John does not deal with that formally but it
{278}
underlies it. In order that the Son should have companions they must be like Him. He must have this liberty to remove anything that would interfere with His companions¬ having part with Him in the new order of things.
C.H.H. In saying that He is going to the Father first and then going to God, is He laying the basis for chapter 20, "My Father and your Father"?
J.T. I think He is. Here it is going out of the world. He is going out of the world, but there He is ascending to His Father as risen. This is the moral side. In chapter 20 He is ascending to His Father as risen. There is no discrepancy at all and the message to the disciples was to bring them into accord with that. There is no discrepancy at all. There is nothing wrong according to @John 20. The first visit after the Lord is arisen according to @John 20 is from heaven.
That is to say He visits the disciples via heaven. He comes in through heaven. He was on the earth but when He comes in to the disciples according to @John 20
He goes up and comes down. Therefore it says, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". The principle is that that has happened, that He has come in via heaven and says, "Peace be unto you". Therefore it is Christianity where the disciples were in Jerusalem with the doors shut. There is not a bit of discrepancy here, just peace, and He says it again and then He breathes on them. The matter is settled but settled on the heavenly principle; but that is not the point here. He is going out of the world here where He had been, the scene of defilement, and they are to be left in it and He washes their feet so that they should have part with Him in the new place.
Rem. This feet-washing provides the basis on which Paul says He is not ashamed to call them brethren.
J.T. I think it is. As I was saying, the occurrence
{279}
in @Genesis 47 is very remarkable. Joseph had eleven brothers and he only chooses five out of the eleven to present to Pharaoh. We may be sure he selected the best, that is, those that he would consider that Pharaoh would be pleased with. He presented his father without any question. The father was by himself, but he presented the brethren in five only, not in eleven, but five, so that I think we have there an illustration of what we are saying, that Joseph was concerned that his brethren would not discredit him. He told them what to say to Pharaoh: that they were cattle-men. He was not ashamed of them. He wanted them to be known as that, to be known as they really were.
G.V.D. The Lord said in speaking to His Father, "And I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we". Is that the full thought of part with Him?
J.T. I think that is the continuation of this chapter. The Lord's prayer has in view the continuance of the disciples here where He had been. The Lord's prayer in chapter 17 is not on the basis of His resurrection. It is on the basis of what He was here as from the Father and He is now going to the Father. He is not going as risen, nor are they viewed as risen. They are here yet but they are kept by Him and He asks the Father to keep them. So I think the whole section from chapter 13 to 17 is one, in that sense. It is the saints here where Christ has been, not as risen, but where Christ has been and where they are, and He is not here and He is committing us to the Father in view of that; whereas here He is seeing to it Himself to keep us washed so as to be presentable to the Father.
J.McK. Is that seen in the Ephesian side? You referred to the washing of the water by the word.
J.T. We just have a minute to look at @Ephesians 5
{280}
where the saints are seen as the assembly or bride or wife of Christ, and so it is a question of His love and how she is to be presented to Himself. "Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word, that he might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless". So that it is not now His companions before the Father, but His bride or His wife to be presented to Himself, and therefore we see her in @Revelation 21, "Coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", but here in the interim and He occupied with her, by the ministry of the word, the water meaning it. The ministry of the word to one another, of course, is carried on so that there should be no defect in the bride. Of course, there will not be when she has ascended, and is in heavenly glory, but the point is what He is doing just now in @John 13.
A.S.B. It is a great culminating thought here in regard to what has been before us, whether it be ours or the system applying to us, that we become presentable to Christ.
J.T. You feel that it is time that we should awake to the great things we are coming into and so have part in their perfecting, should know what is in the Lord's mind as to things. John the baptist said, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom".
Well, we certainly should not be behind in this. We know what is in His mind in this illustration of the water and the word administering, and the Lord uses us for this very purpose; and the point is we are to be occupied with the great things we are brought into.
In the note it says, 'Or "having purified". The
{281}
aorists "loved"-"delivered"- "sanctify"-"purifying" may be coincident or consequent one on another'. That is all very instructive. And that may be going on at any time amongst us. These words are all coincident. They fit into one another all together.
G.McP. I was wondering if the emphasis is on the word 'glorious' so that in the working out of the principles of feet-washing and the washing by the word in our local companies we see that the local assembly is glorious.
J.T. Just so. What a great thought that is, to present her "to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things". I believe the Lord is putting it upon us that we are brought into the greatest things, that we should be occupied with them and be morally great in the occupation.
C.H.H. In addition to that you get the nourishing and cherishing.
J.T. Essential things for the final result. Cherishing is a beautiful thought.
{282}
HAVING PART IN THE KINGDOM
@Genesis 30: 22 - 25 (first clause); @Matthew 6: 33; @Isaiah 38:4 - 8; @Acts 2:47 (last clause)
We have been speaking today, dear brethren, of the movement characteristic of christianity beginning with the idea of entering the kingdom of God and what I have in mind in these four scriptures is those who have entered and are moving with God, each knowing that he is a part of the kingdom: "Made us a kingdom", @Revelation 1: 6. It really synchronises with the kingdom of God, but it has its own distinctiveness and implies that each is not only known in the kingdom and under protection, but is part of it, part of the great system of government and movement and activity in which God has part as well as ourselves, a living system, a system of persons; the Lord spoke of one who was evidently moving apart not far from the kingdom. When one comes nigh movement is there, but in that well-known case the movement was not allowed to become effective. But to come to the personnel of these scriptures, the first is Rachel, one who is deserving of being regarded as a mother in Israel, and it is because of this that she is under review now. She had asked for a child, a son evidently, for it is said, "And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her", showing that she had acquired a place in God's mind. Now in saying all this I had thought of opening up a little a family matter, a household matter: my thought is to be very simple and practical; this matter of a family and all that enters into it has a great place with God. We see here a mother, or one who would be one, and becomes one, not a foster-mother, she was a foster-mother already, but she was to become a real mother with a real son. And she had acquired a place in God's mind, not in any great
{283}
affair, but simply in the desire to have a son. And this raises in our minds the fact that many mothers in Israel or those who were eventually mothers in Israel had been deprived of families, God Himself acting in that way negatively. Sarah was one and Rebecca was one and Leah was one and Rachel was one. And surely they who were to be the mothers of the tribes became concerned as to the families and became interesting to God. You can understand, dear brethren, that I am speaking of them, not to them. They are out of the reach of my voice. Whatever any may think all are out of reach of our voice, all of these dear women. So that I am not speaking to them. I am speaking of them in order to be of help to ourselves. For their God is our God. And He is our God in the sense of One who cares, who is a Father to us. "And I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty", @2 Corinthians 6: 18. This had become known in Genesis that God was interested in these matters of wives without families. It was an interesting matter; it was God's matter. Their families were really of more interest to God than they were to them, or ever could be to them. So they had learned to pray and what I wish to enlarge on for the moment is that these women prayed; Rachel prayed. I believe it has come to us while we have been together that we are in a wonderful time, not only a time of divine movement, but saint movement, divine activity and saint activity, that we, in fact, have come into a wonderful system of love and intelligent life. Of course the natural things are also in a way living. There is the kingdom of God which is all-inclusive of living creatures, but I am speaking not of them but of persons who are living, of creatures who are living in a divine sense, and moving in it, having feelings divinely begotten, these feelings inclusive of families, husbands, wives and children; God is interested in all this. I am not
{284}
seeking to proceed to the typical meaning of these verses, but am just going to speak of the verses as they stand. They refer to a mother, to her child and to her husband. They refer to the fact that this mother had prayed. Now I want to promote prayer. That is really one of the things I am seeking to forward; and these matters of families, husbands and wives and children have a great place, not a selfish place, but a great place with God. I mean to say not in the sense of selfishness with us. They belong to the divine realm. Husbands, wives and children belong to God, every one of them, in the relation which is meant to belong to God. And so we have this woman, Rachel, one who prayed, and who had her prayer answered; she became a prophetess through having her prayer answered and that is not beyond any sister here either. Were there more praying and prophetic sisters, there would be more praying and prophetic husbands, because one works out on the other. And so in Rachel who is remembered by God. It was not that she asked for a husband: she had one; we are not told that she had asked for a husband, but she had no child and she asked for one. We would be much safer and happier with young sisters who want husbands-it is quite right, God honours that-if there is prayer. God will honour the prayer. God will honour the prayer of a brother who wants a wife. Pardon me for being so simple and direct, for we are in great danger. It is a terrible time of corruption. The brethren are in great danger, young husbands separated from their wives. They are in great danger and so are the wives and the fiancees. All are in great danger and God is beckoning to us and leaning towards us and telling us that He is with us and wants us to tell Him about things, to pray, to pray against the danger. A spinster may pray as well as a bachelor. God would say she is happier if she remains single but nevertheless God is beckoning to us that He is interested in our family affairs, our
{285}
marital affairs; so why should we become exposed to the corruption abroad because of neglect of God? So God remembers Rachel. What a very beautiful touch that is. When did she pray about a son? We are not told. We know that she resorted to prayer and God remembered this. He remembered that she wanted a son and she got one. God remembered her. She became signalised amongst the godly women of Genesis. Godly men are found there, too. Genesis is not necessarily a book of young people but of old people. Young people are found there, but old people dominate Genesis. When I say old people, I refer to Rachel. She is not an old woman but I refer to such as Rachel. They are the kind that are distinguished in the book of Genesis. They are the beginning of things. So the word is dependence upon God because these scriptures that I read tell us about what comes to those who are dependent upon God, especially if a person wants a family. I am not now speaking of Jacob. He wanted a wife. For a wife he kept sheep. We know what Scripture says, "And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep", @Hosea 12: 12. That means that he loved her. He loved Rachel as Christ loves the assembly. "Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly", @Ephesians 5: 25.
Now, Rachel, as I said, is remembered here and in being remembered and knowing that it is divine remembrance, she becomes a prophetess. Notice that she does not say, 'I hope to have another son'. Nor does it say that she hoped to have this one but she did have Joseph, and 'Joseph' means 'addition'. It does not mean that he is the addition, but it means that there is another. The prophetic word in regard to the other is that God will give me another son. That is what she says. "And she conceived, and bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach. And she called his name Joseph; and said, Jehovah will add
{286}
to me another son". She does not say, 'I hope so'.
She is a prophetess. She says, "Jehovah will add to me another son". I am just touching on this practical matter. She is not saying that 'God will save me from having another', as some do. God hates that. God is asserting His rights over humanity. He has a right to have children born. They belong to Him. Their spirits are from Him. Every child born has his spirit given to him from God. So you can see how important he is, every child, and how important it is not to defeat the divine mind or the divine purpose. And so Rachel becomes a prophetess. She says, "Jehovah will add to me another son". It is of God. That is, Benjamin became known in heaven at once. From this point onward Benjamin becomes known in heaven. The first name is Benoni and the other was Benjamin. So important was he in the mind of heaven that he gets two names. One means the son of his mother's sorrow. I am not touching on that; the other, the son of his father's right hand, meaning that he is a type of Christ. Wonderful indeed that any family should have anyone like Christ, a wonderful thing! Surely the thought of our hearts is to have our children have some ray of Christ in each of them. So it was in Benjamin. There was a ray of Christ in the son of his mother's sorrow. The wail of Rachel, weeping for her children, comes down the ages; it comes in the gospel of Matthew. I am only touching this matter so that we might become interested and living and moving in these matters as to our husbands, wives, and our children, as to their names and what there is in them, as a reflection of Christ. If there is no reflection in the family, what is there? Nothing! God intends the family to be radiant with touches of Christ. That is, the fathers and mothers have that in mind and nothing else. So we are told that Rachel wept for her children. It is brought in in a very significant section in Matthew. There are murderers
{287}
in mind and our children are greatly exposed to murderers, if not in a physical sense certainly in a moral sense, but we are not to be afraid of those who kill the body and Rachel comes into that. She comes into issue with the wicked Herod, who slew all the children over certain years. What a terrible crime that was in order to get at Christ, slaying a number of them to get at Christ, to destroy Christ if possible. You see how the matter stands in relation to the mothers¬ progeny from God which is to be in the assembly, which is to have a place in the assembly to swell the numbers, to make them greater, to add to them as we hope to see in a moment. The children of the saints have prophetic beginnings, if they really are children of the saints. Rachel was a prophetess. She says, "Jehovah will add to me another son", and through that son she becomes a woman of sorrow. She died at his birth. She comes down through the ages as a witness to feelings. She belongs to the family of Jeremiah, so to speak, the weeping family, and the issue is not uncertain. She would say she lost her child. She lost herself in bearing him, but she neither lost herself nor him. She saved herself and she saved him. Benjamin is saved, standing out from the tribes, and Rachel too, in her latter end, in @Jeremiah 31. I am reading this for those who want children, who have children, or should have children. So it says, "Thus saith Jehovah: A voice hath been heard in Ramah, the wail of very bitter weeping"; this is what she became coming down through the Scriptures through the weeping prophets. "Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because they are not". But God will wipe away all tears-mothers¬ tears. "Thus saith Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears"; let us not forget that God is a wiper away of tears, of all tears, of mothers¬ tears. "For there is a reward for thy work, saith Jehovah; and they shall come
{288}
again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope for thy latter end, saith Jehovah, and thy children shall come again to their own border": that is why I speak of not only Benjamin living in the light of God's purpose but Rachel. Things come back, you know. God has a long outlook and a great memory, an infinite memory. Think of what He has in mind and it all comes out in perfect accuracy. He has named Christ as the "Firstborn of many brethren". There are many but not one too many, nor too few, nor is it so to the tribe. Every seat will be filled and so Rachel and Benjamin come to light in the latter end. I need not say more on that point but I wanted to show in Matthew how the parents are provided for, and that there is a provision for children. We know how the governments of the world take on these matters. It is for us to take them on, to look for children and provide for them. We are the only ones that take on these matters rightly. So as we read in @Matthew 6: 33, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you". I just want to make a few remarks on that verse because it is needed in regard of what I said. Now it is for the brethren, as I have been saying, to prepare themselves, for there is no doubt something for all of us in these remarks of what is to be added "unto you". That is to say, it is to be children. It is children properly provided for. What are the husbands to do? What are the wives to do? "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you". This is a wonderful matter for us to study, for a christian, and for working out as a problem and seeing the results, the net results, in what God does for prayer. Now Solomon, for instance, a young man in a place of great prominence, a king of Israel, son of David, prayed a prayer about the kingdom of God, not his own kingdom, but the kingdom of God and
{289}
His righteousness. It is not the long prayer of Solomon's, but his first recorded prayer, in @1 Kings 3: 6 - 9, where the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night. He says, "Ask what I shall give thee". Now this is not Solomon's long prayer. This is his first prayer. It is a brief one but it is a very, very important one. He prayed and it tells us what he prayed about, and then in verse 10 it says, "The word pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing". Now, that is for each one of us to enquire what the thing is that we have especially in our minds. I have spoken of what Rachel had in her mind and the net result of her prayer, and now what Solomon had in his mind and then what God thought of it. "The word pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing". What was the thing? "And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself discernment to understand judgment". That was 'the thing', distinct. God remembered the prayer. It was pleasing to God. It is lovely to have a sense in your soul, in your loneliness as you are praying, that God hears you. He said later to Solomon, "I have heard thy prayer". That was the long one. It takes about eight or ten minutes to read it. This is not the long one. This is for one thing, discernment. "God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing ... discernment to understand judgment". Dear brethren, do we not need it? Have you ever asked God for such a thing, to have judgment? We are called upon, every one of us, to judge. The apostle says to the Corinthians, "Set those to judge who are little esteemed in the assembly", @1 Corinthians 6:4. We are to be spiritual and learn how to judge. Solomon asked to know how to judge and so God says to him, "Behold, I have done according to thy word: behold, I have given
{290}
thee a wise and an understanding heart, so that there hath been none like unto thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked". That is to say, Solomon did not ask at all for the things belonging to this life, what we call provision for our families, the wherewithal to be fed or clothed or housed. Solomon did not ask for these things. But God says, 'I am going to give you what you did not ask for', and that is really what @Matthew 6 means. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you".
So, dear brethren, I mentioned that because we are in a very great city, this city of Detroit, an industrial city, one of the greatest in the world, one of the most prosperous, one of the most productive. And the princes of the wealth of this city, the heads, are great men, princes, as they are called, and of course we are apt to be influenced by their success, and we are apt to think of how we can get such success as that, and we lay ourselves out to get it and we do get it and we will ruin ourselves. You actually ruin yourself if you set out to be a prince in commerce or anything like it, anything at all approaching this city, because there are so many opportunities of obtaining your end, but you leave God out. If you do, if you seek these things and maybe you ask God to help make you prosper in this life, you will ruin yourself. You will spoil your use in the assembly, in the preaching, in the ministry and in the levitical service. You will simply drop out and die spiritually. But to take the other line, that Solomon has led in and Matthew directs you in, is sure prosperity. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you".
Well now, you can see the connection of these two first points, the family and the wherewithal to provide for the family so that it becomes potential material for
{291}
the assembly. God undertakes to provide the where withal. It is His matter. And then the next thing is the father who has to think of himself, to think of his own. Suppose he is fifty years of age. He has a family. He thanks God for his family and brings them up for the assembly. But he begins to number his days and it is a most important thing to do, not to wait until you are fifty, but you must certainly attend to it, if you have got to that point, to number your days. We are told to do this that we may acquire a wise heart. What about the father who is fifty or more and the mother who is fifty or more? Where is she now? It says in @Isaiah 38: "In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live". No question of a child here, wife or husband. It is a question of God. It is a question of days and man has to exist in these days. It applies to every one of us. Hezekiah was not that old: he was much less than fifty, but he had right exercises. God says, 'You are going to die'. Well, what does Hezekiah say? "And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah, and said, Ah, Jehovah, remember, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept much". He numbered his days. He had not many. He was short of time, and there is a time coming, if it has not come yet, when we begin to feel that we have a very short time. The point now is to make the most of what we have. Hezekiah had nothing. "For thou shalt die" were the words to him. So the first thing is the filling out of assembly life and the increase of assembly material, for the elder brothers and sisters are the best material we have, but God is saying they are going to die. It is a most solemn matter, this matter of days. What will become
{292}
of the assembly? Where are we going to get material? The old brothers and sisters are dying and the Lord says, 'It must be so'. Well, now, dear brethren, if the assembly needs me, is it not right to pray? If the Lord needs me here, is it not right to pray? I am not now speaking of what I have of a family, nor means of support for a family, but I am speaking of myself and my relations with God. God said nothing to Hezekiah about anybody but himself, nothing about his wife, his children, but himself. Well, a great servant is going to die. There will be a great void in Israel and so it is here in this city, in this Union and in Canada. How many there are in this place getting near to the appointed time, threescore years and ten. This is a matter for everybody to think over, not simply what happens to you, but what happens to the assembly, what happens to the ministry. Where is the material coming from? Is the testimony to die out? These are problems. These are questions to be raised with God and He will listen. God is urging it. He is looking out for it. He is listening for such prayers, prayers of older brothers and older sisters. Take Anna, or take Simeon; he told the Lord when he was going to go. "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation", @Luke 2: 29, 30. Well, that was wonderful! That was triumph! Like Aaron he was going up to die, not down. Aaron went up to die. Moses went up to die. They die at the word of the Lord. They knew when the time came. They could tell to the moment. They all became prophets, in that sense. It is a very precious thing to be able to talk that way in the presence of God, to be able to speak in this way of time. Brethren who have spent long years and who are about to finish their days in the ordinary sense may think God is not interested. He is. I am speaking now as one of the most interested here. I say that here without any
{293}
hesitation, one of the most interested here. Not a question of money or families now, but a question of your relations with God. As if there is only God and you. You talk to God about this matter: how long you are going to stay here, how long He wants you here. If you give Him time, He may not need much, He will answer you. It is very comforting. The testimony is bound to go on if the brethren learn to have intercourse with God about these ordinary matters. There will be an answer. So the prophet is sent again to Hezekiah, "And the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying, Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years". Thank God. I am sure that word was precious to Hezekiah, going to live fifteen years longer. Young people are not so concerned about this matter. Young people do not prove this. God gave fifteen years longer to this brother. I am putting the matter to you. It happened to Hezekiah. God went to all the trouble of causing the sun to go back ten degrees for his benefit. It was not simply to be a prophetic idea. It was to be a positive sign that Hezekiah would live fifteen years more. Fifteen years more of God for Hezekiah the servant of Jehovah, the son of David, who spent the time in the house of the Lord. And so it tells us what he will do if he lives. "The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness: I said, In the meridian of my days I shall go to the gates of Sheol: I am deprived of the rest of my years. I said, I shall not see Jah, Jah in the land of the living. With those who dwell where all has ceased to be, I shall behold man no more. Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent. I have cut off like a weaver my life. He separateth me from the thrum: -- from day to night thou wilt make an end of me. I kept still until the
{294}
morning; ... as a lion, so doth he break all my bones. From day to night thou wilt make an end of me. Like a swallow or a crane, so did I chatter; I mourned as a dove; mine eyes failed with looking upward; Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me. What shall I say? He hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it. I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul. Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit; and thou hast recovered me, and made me to live. Behold, instead of peace I had bitterness upon bitterness; but thou hast in love delivered my soul from the pit of destruction; for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. For not Sheol shall praise thee, nor death celebrate thee; they that go down into the pit do not hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I this day; the father to the children shall make known thy truth. Jehovah was purposed to save me. -- And we will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life, in the house of Jehovah". These men are reliable and we need them. One could look back and count, you know, such men as Hezekiah. The Lord has taken them and their places have not been filled. It is a solemn matter. How many it may happen to! It is for us younger ones to pray that the older ones may continue, not get rid of them. It is a question of the service of God, the need for these experienced men; if it only be ten years, no matter how long it is, it is worth while to pray to God that He may be pleased to leave them here to continue the testimony.
"And the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved", @Acts 2: 47. Faith counts on that, that God's work will go on anyway. He will see to it. But at the same time it is for us to fill out the service until the end, until we are all translated to heaven, to be with the Lord for ever and ever.
{295}
SINS REMEMBERED AND SINS NOT REMEMBERED
@Genesis 41: 9; @1 Kings 17: 18; @Hebrews 10: 15 - 17
The first two verses read draw attention to sins remembered, and the last verses refer to sins not remembered. I wish to show why some sins should be remembered, and why others should not, trusting that the Lord will use for blessing the remarks which I hope to make.
Doubtless all will remember the history of Pharaoh's cup-bearer. He is the first sinner of whom I wish to speak. Doubtless too we all remember the widow of Sarepta to whom Elijah the prophet was sent. Now there may be those here who have come in on account of someone, or perhaps because the one who is speaking has been known here in the past and has not served here for a long time, and whilst we are glad they have come even for that reason, we desire that the Lord may take advantage of the occasion to speak to such. Perhaps someone here has sinned and has left his sin unsettled and it still remains a sin of commission. The thought for such is that he may be caused to remember his sin. We are prone to remember them in a general way as is commonly said, 'We are all sinners'. It may be that you feel glad to have companions in sin and feel relieved that you are not alone as a sinner. There is cold comfort in that, because any companion who is a sinner and remains one will come into judgment, and a very severe judgment too. The books will be opened in which his name will be found, and enquiry will be made and it will come to light that he is among the lost.
Now, as I said, perhaps you came in here tonight just to hear me. Well, that will not help you in that great day, that great assize, the date of which is fixed. There will be no comfort then in the fact that you
{296}
came in here tonight and got no gain from the meeting. The books will be opened. At present it is a time of book-opening of another kind. It is a time of searching into grievous sins that have been committed by certain persons in authority. Certain governments are ordering such enquiry and many secret things that have been happening will come to light. Things will be spoken of that have been well known and which have caused grief universally, that man is capable of such atrocities. But the devil is the author of it all. He has got two names at least which mean 'destroyer'. He is a destroyer and an accuser too. And so, it may be, there is one here who has sinned; it is true that "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (@Romans 3: 23), but I am speaking now of some particular sin in your history that as yet is not settled, not washed out. If that is so you cannot take comfort in the blood of the Lamb; the blood of the Lamb could have settled the matter at any time during all these years since the sin was committed. There are those in Scripture who are said to have overcome by the blood of the Lamb, a remarkable word; that is a remarkable weapon for persons who have sins. However heinous those sins may be, such a one can overcome by the blood of the Lamb. That is to say, he can use that as before God and as before believers to show that the thing is settled, that the sin is atoned for. It is no longer his, no longer upon him; he is clear. If he is a true believer, not only is he forgiven, but he is justified; that is, he is as clear as if he had never committed the sin at all.
Well now, I am just supposing a case, but it may be a reality, as applicable to some person or persons here. This first case we have read refers to the cup-bearer of king Pharaoh. A story, a true story, with which, doubtless, most of us are acquainted, and I read the particular verse because in it the man calls attention to his sins being brought to light, remembered. It
{297}
says, "Then spoke the chief of the cup-bearers to Pharaoh, saying, I remember mine offences this day". Two years at least had elapsed since these offences occurred and he tells us about them; but I will return to them later. I speak now of the fact that two years had passed since the faults occurred, and according to what is said here the remembrance of the faults is accidental, as we would say. But it is not accidental, but intended: something has happened that they should be remembered, and that they should be brought to light, and that something was in Pharaoh's own history. We are told about it briefly: "It came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the river ...", and you know the sequel, which relates actually to the history of Egypt for a long time. That is a much more important thing than that which happened to the chief of the cup-bearers, infinitely more important, we might say, but these great facts coming to light according to Pharaoh's own words, caused the man to remember his faults. Now let us each here, who may be in this case, speak to the Lord and to his own heart as to why in all these two years the matter never came into his mind. He never remembered what had happened, and he is now reminded of it and evidently perturbed. He is in the presence of a monarch who had power to put him to death at one time and who saved him, although the chief of the bakers was hanged. He had power to hang the chief of the bakers and power to release the chief of the cup-bearers. The fact is, he had in his hands the power of forgiveness and non-forgiveness. Now the chief of the cup-bearers is in the presence of this same monarch and an extraordinary incident has happened which the monarch is relating and no one seems able to help, and this man says, "I remember mine offences this day".
I need not proceed on that line because you can
{298}
catch the thought and apply it yourselves. Read through the history. I will refer again to this passage, but just now I would remind anyone who has been in such a case that something has happened. In this case it was two years before, but in your case it may not be so long, or perhaps it may be longer; but it has happened and the matter stands unsettled, and, as I have said, something will come about to cause you to bring it up. If it is not brought up in this world it certainly will come up at the great white throne. If it is not settled in time, it will stand against you then and my thought now is that if there is anyone in this case he may see to it that anything unforgiven is looked into and settled at once.
I turn now to the passage in 1 Kings. You will remember the Lord spoke of this widow of Sarepta when He was here. He said about her that there were many widows in Israel in her day, but to none of them was the prophet sent but to her. It says, "And the word of Jehovah came to him saying, Arise, go to Zarephath, which is by Zidon, and abide there behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee". Remarkable! Possibly no one here has been in such a position or had such an experience. It is not that there are no prophets in our day, for there are such. Not such as Elijah, indeed, but still there are prophets. In this dispensation the second outstanding gift is the gift of prophecy. Therefore there are prophets, but, as I said, doubtless none of us has had such an experience as this widow. Jehovah said, "I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee". He was in the East and he was being sent to the West to Zidon, where there was a widow that Jehovah had commanded to maintain him, and she does so for a whole year. It is very remarkable that during the time of famine she maintained the prophet and her son and herself for a whole year. But it says, "And it came to pass after these things,
{299}
that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him". He died. Then it goes on to say, "And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to me to call mine iniquity to remembrance, and to slay my son?". She does not say 'iniquities' or 'faults'; she says "iniquity". She would, as it were, bulk them as people often do, so as to get rid of them at once; it may be to comfort themselves that in forgetting them they are forgiven. But is it so? That is just a lie, and if anyone is in that case, they are just hiding behind a lie and some day something will happen, just as in this scripture, when it says that the boy grew sick and we are told later that he died. Now I need not say much to make the application. I have called attention to the fact that Pharaoh's cup-bearer called his sins "offences", and whilst they were offences, yet they were sins. How many there were we are not told. But this widow uses the word "iniquity". She is complaining to the prophet that, so to speak, he was harming her; she had befriended him and he was not doing her good in return. She says that he was calling her sin to remembrance and slaying her son.
Now the question is as to ourselves, in regard to any calamity in our own history. In the case of Pharaoh's cup-bearer, what had happened was not to himself but to Pharaoh. The dream was Pharaoh's, but in Kings the matter was the widow's, and she is talking about her sin to the prophet, and as I have already remarked, there could be no doubt she had in mind to cover the whole matter of sin conveniently. She thinks that all she had been guilty of before God was being brought to light by the prophet. It was not at all so. It was darkness in her soul that made her say so. But what I wish to emphasise is how we view this matter of sin, and if it has been called to
{300}
remembrance. I have already spoken of the man whose offences were brought to remembrance, but now I am speaking of the widow, and what a plight she was in! What darkness was in her soul! Her sin had not troubled her before as far as we know, but now it is a trouble, though it is not that exactly that causes her to complain against the prophet. How often we complain about our circumstances, or our fellow men, or our relations, whereas the real thing is to get at the root of this matter of sin. Now in the case of this widow it is called to remembrance. It is well, if we have these sins, or this sin in bulk, that they should be called to remembrance. It may be some of you are heaping up your guilt. This widow speaks of it, as it were, in toto, without specifying anything except by using the word 'iniquity'. But then the thing has to be gone into in detail. When the books are opened it will not simply be a question of sin, but of sins. They are to be specified in that day, so why not specify them now! It may be a summons has come to you; your son or your daughter or your mother may have died, or some great sorrow has happened and the whole matter of sin comes up. Do not put it off! It is of God and His voice is to be heard as to this great matter of sin. Some occurrence may be a serious calamity in your mind, but it brings up the question of sin which is more serious than your calamity. I would therefore urge everyone here to look into this matter now. It may be that you have not done so before. You may have been too careless, too general, and put yourself alongside others as if they could shield you or comfort you. But they cannot do so and this matter of sin will stand up before you in that day. God is bringing it before you now whilst it is still settling time. In that day it will be too late to settle the matter and I would therefore urge everyone here to settle this matter of sin which has come to light.
{301}
The chief of the cup-bearers said his faults came to light that day, though they had remained dormant for two years. How long yours have been dormant I cannot say. The widow is reminded of sin. The incident brought up in her mind the whole matter of her life, and that brings out the question of analysis, the analysis of sin. The widow spoke of her sin in bulk, but the woman of Samaria in @John 4 comes into my mind. In the evangelical realm things come into your mind; indeed God brings them into your mind. If we are in the evangelical realm, the realm of light, things come into mind, that are needed to help to bring sinners to face the settlement of their sins and get right with God and have done with sin. The woman of Samaria had sinned, though she did not speak of it to the Lord. The Lord knew she had sins and the meeting with Him at the well was no accident, and the question arose between the Lord and her. It was the day of days for her, as it may be for some of you tonight; the time of bringing things to light in your soul so that they can be settled with God and with His people. With the woman of Samaria you would think that the conversation drifted, but it did not drift, for the Lord knew what He meant to bring out, but He allowed the woman to speak, just as He would be ready for any one of us who has unsettled sin to talk to Him. His disciples wondered that He talked with such a person, but He had come to talk to such, as it says elsewhere, "This man receives sinners and eats with them", @Luke 15:2. He was here to get in touch with sinners, to talk with them. He is here tonight for the same purpose, He is here by the power of the Spirit, seeking to help souls through myself, in whatever way I may be able to do it, to the settlement of matters between their souls and God, and the people of God too, for you have to do with them. So the woman in the course of conversation says to the Lord, "I see that thou art a prophet".
{302}
The Lord called her "Woman". Why should He call her "Woman"? He does not do so until she says, "I see that thou art a prophet".
But now to go on to the sequel, which is always the point in the gospel, to get to the end of things, to get results. She says of the Lord Jesus, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?". She does not charge the Lord with reminding her of her sins. She brought them in herself, although the Lord really had it in mind to bring them up when He said, "Go, call thy husband, and come here". The point was to bring both of them there, but she said, "I have not a husband" which was hardly true. But at any rate she came to this point that the Lord Jesus had told her all things that she had ever done. She is not like the widow of Sarepta who uses the word 'iniquity', nor like the chief of the cup-bearers, who uses the word 'offences' without specifying them. In the case of the woman of Samaria the matter was out. That is what the great white throne is for and if you are not saved whatever you have done will come out there; but why not let it come out now? Not that I would ask you to bring it out publicly here, but have to do with God about it and with His people. We should talk with souls and get them to judge themselves and tell the truth about themselves, to acknowledge their wickedness. David said, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done what is evil in thy sight"
(@Psalm 51: 4), but the result was "Jehovah has also put away thy sin" (@2 Samuel 12: 13), and that is the point I would make here. The widow of Sarepta got a result: the boy was given back to her alive. He had died. No wonder she was in darkness and distress, but the sequel was glorious, and so it will be with anyone here who is ready to settle matters with God and with His people. I do not say your forgiveness depends on the people of God, but at the same time
{303}
we are to confess our sins to them. But I will now confine myself to God. Confess your sins to God, as the man did who went up to the temple and prayed, "O God, have compassion on me, the sinner", @Luke 18: 13. So it is that as we get into close contact with God things become settled. Perhaps they have been allowed to drag on far too long and now, as with the cup-bearer and with the widow of Sarepta, the time has arrived for your sins to come upon your conscience. They have been elsewhere, but now they are on your conscience and that is where God wants them to be so that you may get forgiveness. They have to be remembered by you before God ceases to remember them; you have to remember first so that they may be forgiven. It must be borne in mind that no unconfessed sins are forgiven. Sins must be confessed, as it says, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (@1 John 1: 9), and that is what you can do now.
I could say much more of the widow of Sarepta, but I have to go on now to this grand statement as to persons who have judged themselves having felt the weight of their sins. The passage read in @Hebrews 10 says, "And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness of it; for after what was said: This is the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings; and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more". That could not be said of the cup-bearer when he spoke, nor could it be said of the widow of Sarepta when she spoke. It may be said of someone here tonight who has remembered his sins, if there is repentance, which is an important matter as to forgiveness. We read in @Luke 24, where the Lord speaks about this wonderful gospel period, "that repentance and remission of sins should be
{304}
preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem". From the divine point of view repentance and remission of sins is preached and if there is anyone here who is questioning in his soul about something which has happened and is not settled, and you are consequently not happy, I would say to you that repentance and remission of sins is preached. The first thing is repentance, and if a thing comes into your soul which you feel is unsettled, the thing to do is to repent. I do not ask for remorse, but I ask for repentance. That is the word. If anyone is involved in this way and you do not know what to do, get some believer here and enquire of him. The time to settle this matter is at this very moment. That is what was done at the early preaching at Jerusalem. They enquired of Peter and the eleven, for they were all included in the question. If anyone here has soul trouble, ask and you will get answers.
There are plenty to give you answers. Peter gave the answer on that occasion. He said, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit", @Acts 2: 38. You see how full the statement is. Why should the matter of sin or sins remain on our souls, exposing us to the devil and indeed to judgment? What can we say when people carry sins year in and year out! They may talk about being christians, but you are no christian if you are carrying your sins. Get rid of them! That is the divine way which Peter indicates and which this scripture indicates. God says, "Their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more".
I have spoken of two cases where sins were called to remembrance, but in this third scripture they are remembered no more. How sweeping that is, and what rest and assurance it brings! Why should it be otherwise? And so, as I said, repentance is needed. To repent is one of the greatest difficulties that souls
{305}
have; to specify a thing which happened, when it happened, why it happened. So the word is, "their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more". God says, You are confessing them to Me and I am saying to you that My beloved Son has died for them. That is God's side, they are settled once for all! May the Lord bless His word.
{306}
THE WAY INTO THE CITY
@Ecclesiastes 10: 15; @Psalm 107: 7
You will see that what one has in mind has reference to a city. The word is used in both passages. The book of Ecclesiastes speaks of Solomon as "the Preacher", and the first passage one has alluded to speaks of those that weary themselves because they know not how to go to the city. There are several persons who are classified as preachers in the Old Testament, such as Solomon, Jonah, and such even as Nebuchadnezzar among the emperors. All are regarded as preachers, and you can understand that a preacher is usually allowed latitude in the use of words or metaphors or figures. So in the use of the word 'city', we regard that with a certain latitude; it is employed in view of reaching souls who are in the world. The preacher has to speak not only metaphorically but morally, meaning that the idea of a city is not always literal, built of stone and mortar or wood, but it may mean a system. In this case it does, and the persons mentioned do not know how to get to it; it is remarkable. To find a city in this world is a very simple matter. It is only a matter of geography to find the right road which is usually marked up on the highways. I have visited most of the great cities of the world, so that I know something about them, and how they may be reached, but the city in mind here is a moral idea, and can only be reached by persons who understand moral ideas. In a word, to bring it down to this day, the idea of a city here refers to the assembly, and the assembly is not formed of stones and mortar; it is formed of persons, and persons who are converted to God. Perhaps some of you have never thought of a city like that, composed of persons who are really converted to God, but that is what this city is. It is
{307}
designated in the book of Revelation as a city. John says, "I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God". Well, you see what is meant; it is the assembly that is meant, and now what I have to say is about the assembly as a city. Many of you here are really in it as believers in the Lord Jesus, most of you, but some may not be, and so I would seek now to indicate how this city may be reached, because it is the city of salvation. As of old, Zion was the city where God had placed salvation, so today God has placed salvation in the assembly.
Now I do not want you to think that He has not placed salvation in Christ, because He has. Christ alone is our Saviour. The assembly is not our Saviour; Christ is our Saviour, and Christ is the subject of our preaching in that sense. He is the Saviour of sinners, and He is proclaimed in the gospel as the Saviour to men. It says, "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own times", @1 Timothy 2: 5, 6. It is rendered here tonight, that the Lord Jesus has given Himself a ransom for all. For hundreds of years this wonderful proclamation has been going forth, and myriads have been saved. It is the day of salvation, the accepted time, and it is through the blood of the Lord Jesus. "Ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift", @Ephesians 2: 8. But then I am talking of the city, and whilst proclaiming that Jesus and Jesus only is our Saviour, yet there is the idea of salvation in a place, and as of old it was in Zion, so today it is in the assembly. Hence it says in @Acts 2, after the first great gospel address was preached, and three thousand persons were converted, "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved". There are some here who *have* to be saved, yet most of us are already taken into the category of the saved. Those who are
{308}
not are in mind tonight, and if there is anyone here who is exercised about salvation, then of course I would like to speak to that one.
There are persons here who are really saved in the sense in which I have spoken, but yet they are not too restful in the forgiveness of sins. If you are worldly, you are apt to forget that you are purged from your former sins, and you become indifferent, and these gospel preachings all over the world are intended for such as you. You have been saved in the ordinary sense, but you have turned to the world, you have become worldly. You need salvation from the world, and God says, "I will give salvation in Zion, and unto Israel my glory", @Isaiah 46: 13. He has placed salvation in a certain place, and that place is the assembly. The assembly is formed of saved persons, and the Holy Spirit indwells it, and operates in it, and if you turn away to the world, "The labour of fools wearieth them"-that is, every fool-"because they know not how to go to the city". He needs to know the way and he does not know; it may be he has the desire to go, but fails in the moral importance of it.
Now in order to qualify further what I have said, I quote what the writer in the previous chapter says, "This also have I seen as wisdom under the sun, and it was great unto me. There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and encompassed it, and built great bulwarks against it: and there was found in it a poor wise man, who by his wisdom delivered the city; but no man remembered that poor man". Well now, this is the city, and in it the Lord Jesus was found, because the Lord Jesus is really depicted here as the "poor wise man". He built the city, but it takes a long story to show that He delivers the city. I am not going to tell that story, but simply to say that the Lord Jesus is in mind here, and most of us remember Him in the Supper, but many do not. It says in verse 15, "But
{309}
no man remembered that poor man". The Lord is in mind; He is the Builder of the city, and the Deliverer of the city. Indeed He is the Builder of the assembly. He calls it "my assembly", saying, "On this rock I will build my assembly", and I say to every one of you young people that it is yours too. The Lord has it for you at the moment. He has it for Himself for ever and ever. It is His bride out of heaven, "a bride adorned for her husband", but in the meantime the Lord is using it for His people, so that you might find deliverance in it, not only deliverance from your sins, but deliverance from the world. That is the idea. He has set it up to be a vessel of deliverance for His people, and I address every young person here tonight, that the Lord has this wonderful system ready for you, and in it you will find deliverance from the world. Most of us here have found it so; perhaps you have not, and if so what I am saying is for you, and you need to know how to get into it.
Now as I said it is a moral thought, and has to be apprehended in a moral sense, and if you want to get into it, it involves judgment of this world that you have fallen into, and maybe that you have been damaged by its influence. You may like it because of what it gives to young people, to make them, as they think, wise, but this wonderful system that the Lord Jesus has is for your deliverance. He has built it, and He has it for the moment for you. Presently He will have it for Himself eternally. He has it for Himself now, but it is also a vessel of deliverance for every person who wants it. Perhaps you are a believer in the Lord Jesus, but the question of the world is not settled in your soul. You do not know the way into "the city". You weary yourself. You say, I would like to be back with the people of God, but somehow I cannot find the way, as this verse says, "The labour of fools wearieth them, because they know not how to go to the city". You would have no difficulty if you wanted
{310}
to go to Edinburgh or Aberdeen. The way is plainly marked for your natural eyes, but this city is not so plainly marked; you get no boards to show you the way into the city of God. It has to be understood morally, because it is important to learn to judge things morally, to judge the world which seems to be pleasing, and holds out so much for you. You have to learn to judge it, and unless you do, you will not get into the city. In a word it is the fellowship of God's Son-a wonderful thought. "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", @1 Corinthians 1: 9. The way is for you to find, and the ministry that the Spirit of God is maintaining here is to show you the way. Hence you find such a voice as Isaiah's speaks *behind* you. Some night when you are going to the theatre, or cinema, or the card table, or whatever it may be, you find a voice behind you-"This is the way, walk ye in it", @Isaiah 30: 21. You have to hear that voice and take that way.
Now, as I was saying, the poor man, who typifies the Lord Jesus, has delivered the city, and if He is not in your mind, the Holy Spirit intends that He should be in your mind, if you are a christian; and if you are not, He should still be in your mind, because you may be among those who *are to be saved*, "those that were to be saved", meaning that God has you in His purpose, and you choose to stay out, to remain in the world, or at times you want to come back to your place with the lovers of Jesus in the things that relate to salvation. Now I am speaking very plainly, I hope, to every young person here. It is a great opportunity for you to lend your ear carefully to what has been said, and see if you cannot find your feet in the way.
That way is available. There are many other ways of course: there is the way of death, you know, and the way of the world, as I have been saying. It may be the way of commerce is leading you, or it may be the
{311}
way of music; your social entertainment leading you off, and yet you have not yet found the way! The Lord Jesus says, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life". But I am now speaking of the way to salvation, the way to the city, which the foolish man is wearying himself to find, but does not find it, whereas when we come to the passage I read from @Psalm 107, you have a beautiful reference to the gathering time. Of course, it refers to the gathering time for Israel; and it is the gathering time too for the people of God. I am speaking of persons who are to be saved. Scripture says that He died to gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad, and there are many. Those of us who are christians here perhaps have learned to weep secretly for our brethren. It is said in @John 1 that as many as received Christ, to them God gave the power or title to take the place of children of God-a great matter. It is a title to take that place, a title to enter by the front door as one of the family. That is the idea of @John 1, "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". Now there are many like that. They are scattered abroad in this world, but there is the gathering power of God today. "Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever. Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the oppressor"-notice that-"and gathered out of the countries, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the sea. They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way, they found no city of habitation. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them: then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble". Now that is the point. Perhaps you are not moved by what has been said. If you do not know salvation, if the idea of it has never come into your mind and
{312}
you are to be saved, well now these verses are most touching: "Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble". If the trouble has begun in your heart now, it is time for turning to the Lord. You need not go home to do it, you can do it now. As one said, "O God, have compassion on me, the sinner", @Luke 18: 13. Why not do it, the cry taking place at the moment of the preaching?
What I am speaking of in @Ecclesiastes 10 does not give you the way at all, nor does it give you the cry, for you are called a fool there; you do not find the city. You remember a man who is called a fool in the gospels? He said to himself that he had plenty of goods, plenty of money, so to speak, to buy all he needed, as people do now because of the big wages. Big wages are often a curse, because they give you so much means of gratifying yourself, but the scripture says, "Love not the world, nor the things in the world". The love of the world is not of the Father, and maybe you have never learned to give up the thought of the world, nor have you found the way into the city, and my effort now is to impress you with this, that there is such a way, and that way leads to the city of salvation. Salvation is in it. I have already said that salvation from sins is not exactly the point, it is a question of salvation from the world. You will find that salvation in the assembly, and my point now is that you should find the way into it, and the first thing is to cry, to begin to feel that you have never come to it. You have long wished to be in the city of salvation, but you have not found the way, wearying yourself in endeavouring to find it, and you have not found it. Well, have you ever cried? You see the way is simple, for God hearkens to the cry. You remember how it is said in @Exodus 3, "Jehovah said, I have seen assuredly the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and their cry have I heard". They were suffering Egypt's bondage, and so are you. It is
{313}
the same thing. The world holds you in bondage, and God gives you to understand that He is feeling for you, and I hope you will feel for yourself, and that that will give vent in a cry! "They cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses". He did that. You have not touched that yet! Most of us have-but you have not touched it, the cry and the deliverance from your distresses-and so it goes on, "And he led them forth by a right way". *He* led them. God does it; it is not simply now the cry, but immediately submitting yourself to the leading of God; that is the truth of the gospel, the truth of salvation.
We are told that the gospel is for the obedience of faith among all nations. We shall never be suitable for the assembly unless we have learned the idea of obedience of faith. It is not simply what your father and mother say you should do, but what God says, "Faith cometh by hearing". But hearing what? It is not simply by the act of hearing, or by the power of hearing in the ear, but hearing "by the word of God". That is the point, the word of God. God has His servants ready, and they have been preaching in hundreds of places the word of God. Now the point is to anyone here tonight to come into the thing which I have been speaking of, namely, salvation.
Last week, I was saying something in the west of London about two men that were blind who followed the Lord Jesus. They knew He was there, walking before them, and they said, "Have mercy on us, Son of David", @Matthew 9: 27. The Lord did not answer them. Well, I am just telling you now how things happened in the work of the Lord, that the Lord challenges us as to things that we want, that we urgently want, and He does not say anything. You say, I have been exercised about salvation for long enough. I have been coming to the meetings and I have not got it; I have never had experience of it. Well, these two
{314}
men did not either. They were blind, and they followed the Lord, and they said, "Have mercy on us, Son of David". The Lord did not say anything. Perhaps that is your case. Perhaps you say, I have been longing for it. Well, have you? The Lord did not say anything, and the Spirit of God says, "When he was come to the house". Perhaps you have not followed Him into the house. You have been trying to detain Him outside, to have your own way about it, to have those things come your way as you think, but the Lord does not say anything, but He goes into the house. We are not told whose house it was. There were many houses in Matthew's gospel, and they followed Him in. Do not turn aside what I am saying. They followed Him into the house. Perhaps you have not come to the house. These men said, "Have mercy on us, Son of David", and the Lord did not say anything; He just went into the house. Maybe you have not come into the house. If the Lord elects to do things in a house, why not follow Him and see how He does things. They kept on saying, "Have mercy on us", and when He was come to the house, they came into it. Now listen to what He said, "Do ye believe that I am able to do this?". He is saying, I want you to have faith. Have you got it? Perhaps some here that are called christians have not got the element of faith. The Lord says, "Do ye believe that I am able to do this?". In the house He said that, and they said, "Yea, Lord". Then the Lord says, "According to your faith"-notice that-"be it unto you". Well now, what about your faith? Have you any? If you leave this room without it, I would urge you to get hold of this matter. Millions are coming into it, and they are getting saved by faith, because you know the truth of the gospel is justification by faith, not of works, nor sight, but by faith. And that is what the Lord means. He meant to convey to these two blind men that He expected them to have faith,
{315}
or they would not be anything in the assembly. So they say, "Yea, Lord". But the Lord did not rejoice in that either; He did not make much of them, and the Lord would never make much of you. He is telling you He is looking for faith in you. "Without faith it is impossible to please [God]". And so they said, "Yea, Lord", and their eyes were opened; but He says, mark you, "According to your faith, be it unto you". In @Luke 7 the Lord says to the woman "Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace". "Thy faith"-not someone else's faith. The Pharisee said something which would belittle her, and anyone seeking to come into the truth will be belittled by the Pharisee. When it comes to you actually to be saved, you must have faith yourself. You will never be saved if you have not faith. You might have faith to remove mountains, and yet be nothing, showing how real the thing is.
I come now to the matter of getting salvation, and how it is obtained according to @Psalm 107, how to get into the city. The first thing is they cry. If you have not found your way into the city, you have not come into the fellowship, you do not belong to the saved in the sense I am speaking of it. I mean, saved from the world, and the need of coming to the city for it. And so in this psalm, as I said, we have first the thanksgiving that the Spirit of God urges, "Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; for his loving-kindness endureth for ever". Let us learn to say these things from our souls. "Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so". How we love to do this! "Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the oppressor, and gathered out of the countries, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the sea. They wandered in the wilderness". That is what many are doing -- wandering in the world, having the pleasures of sin for a season. Perhaps you are wearying yourself in it, and then it goes on, "They found no city of habitation".
{316}
After all this has been said, it goes on to say, "And he led them forth by a right way, that they might go to a city of habitation".
Now let me extend an invitation. Heaven entitles me to extend an invitation to you here tonight, to get into this right way! "He led them forth by a right way, that they might go". You have to do it yourself-"that they might go to a city of habitation". And then, "Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for *his* loving-kindness, and for *his* wondrous works to the children of men". Salvation and deliverance are to be known in coming to all this. Accept it from the Lord, and give thanks! That is what the apostle came to-"O, wretched man that I am! ... I thank God", @Romans 7: 24, 25. The thing is reached in the giving of thanks. "Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for *his* loving-kindness, and for *his* wondrous works to the children of men; for he hath satisfied the longing soul and filled the hungry soul with good". Then it says: "And he bowed down their heart with labour ... . Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble". I do urge anyone here tonight to cry unto the Lord. His ear is open to your cry, He will never repel you for your trouble. He will hearken to your cry in it. "And he saved them out of their distresses; he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bands in sunder. Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for *his* loving-kindness, and for *his* wondrous works to the children of men".
Every intelligent person here tonight will understand what has been said. I can hardly speak more plainly of the city of God, for the Lord has in mind His own assembly. It is the precious system of things in which He supports His people. The saints are in it. The Spirit of God is in it, and the saints are your best friends. Keep by them if you want these things. They are in the city of God. They are able to tell you how to get into it. Why not be with them? If
{317}
you are not in fellowship, it is your portion, your right, your privilege, as we have been saying about the passage in the last chapter of the Bible: "that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city". There is no other way. It is *by the gates*. The angels of God are there, the names of the twelve tribes of Israel are there. You are welcome there. Everything affords welcome to you there, and so the word is, "Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for *his* loving-kindness, and for *his* wondrous works to the children of men". The city is available to you-"that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city". What that means is fellowship at the present time. There will be no fellowship in heaven.
There will be no need for it. Fellowship contemplates a period of time in which there is opposition. We would urge any who are not in it to come in.
May the Lord help someone here tonight to enter.
{318}
THE ASSEMBLY AS CUSTODIAN OF THE INTERESTS OF CHRIST
@Matthew 16: 13 - 20
J.T. What is in mind particularly is that we might all see that the assembly is the custodian of the interests of Christ. We see in chapter 18 how it has a final word as to differences among the brethren. The interests of the Lord are not at the disposal of any nation or accumulation of nations, nor dominated by any person on earth. The assembly is constituted to take charge. Matthew has this in mind, the Lord saying in Matthew's gospel that He is with us always even to the end of the age, not exactly to do things for us but that we should do them ourselves according to the light and ability He gives us, but He is with us, and so if any acute situation arises He is with the two or three gathered unto His name. I think the point that is important is, that drawing near to this section of this gospel of Matthew, dealing with the assembly and with the revelation made as to it and as to the Lord Jesus, we have stressed the idea of faith. That is, what we are dealing with is a faith matter, not simply a visible matter such as would appear in relation to any human matter or organisation. It is a faith matter, and so we have such statements as the Lord's remark to Peter as having attempted to walk on the water, "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?". His faith was little. Then again we have the Syrophenician woman of whom the Lord says, "Great is thy faith", and there are such statements which bear upon the passage in the gospel. Thus we are dealing with a faith situation, a faith system. Christ is above, He is not visible to the natural eye. It is said, "Whom heaven indeed must receive till the times of the restoring of all things"
{319}
(@Acts 3:21); but He is going on with the assembly and calling it. The Spirit too is not visible, but He is here. These are the thoughts one had.
Ques. What is secured in the thought of the "Son of the living God"?
J.T. That will come in later if you do not mind. In verse 13 it says, "When Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi, he demanded of his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am? And they said, Some, John the baptist; and others, Elias; and others again, Jeremias or one of the prophets. He says to them, But *ye*, who do ye say that I am?". I was thinking we might dwell a little on this situation indicated here as to what people are saying. It is not what we think first of all, it is what we say, whether it be to one another, or to men, but men are saying things about Christ too, unconverted men. Perhaps it would be helpful that the young ones here might come to see they should have the right thought of Christ in naming Him, and then too the instruction is in a certain geographical setting, Caesarea-Philippi, which would mean it was outside the Israelitish territory. The assembly is not presented as exactly a part of Israel's possession. Later on the disciples ask the Lord whether He should at that time take up the kingdom of Israel (@Acts 1: 6), but that would becloud the assembly. He had already assembled with the brethren in @Acts 1 and therefore we have to understand what the position is with regard to Israel, and with regard to the nations too, because the Lord Jesus is to rule over the nations also, but both are in abeyance, and we have to leave that, the Lord is leaving it. The Father has kept all these secret things in His hands. The Lord is now coming to the Spirit and the assembly, so that He says to the disciples in @Acts 1 that they are to be witnesses. He would send them out as His witnesses. They were to wait for the coming of the Spirit, so that everything now
{320}
hinges on the presence of the Spirit, and He is not occupied with nations nor even with Israel but with the assembly and all that relates to the assembly; that is the gospel.
Ques. Had you in mind we should have the firm conviction of the Person of Christ with regard to faith?
J.T. Yes, especially young people. The young need to be guarded so as to have the right understanding as to Christ. Zacchaeus "sought to see Jesus who he was".
Ques. So would you say that is the first thing to be established with us, as to what we should say? Is that the ground on which the disciples act when sent out to all the nations: "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit",
@Matthew 28: 19?
J.T. Yes, just so, and that someone knows. Peter knew, hence Peter says, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God", so that it is a question now of the Son of the living God. So much is being said now, we ought to be on our guard as to whether we can say the right thing. It is what we say, not what we think!
Ques. Why does the Lord ask the question, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?".
J.T. It is to make the matter clear, to give them to understand that men are talking about Him. His name had become public now. The brethren ought to know what they say, not only what they think.
Ques. Is there a reason why the title, "Son of man" should be introduced with regard to speaking to men?
J.T. The Lord says when He was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?". Now arises the question as to the Son of man, and notice it comes in before we have the revelation made as to the Son of God. "Son of man" refers to His public position with regard to the
{321}
whole race of man, so the mind must be centred in Him. He is the Son and Heir, Heir of what belongs to man; the Son of God is Heir to what belongs to God, therefore He certainly has a right here to the position in which man is, but the Lord had in mind, however, that the revelation would come and the Father would have part in the thing. He would take up the matter, so that someone answers and that someone is Peter, and therefore the matter is settled. It was the revelation. If what we are engaged with is revelation, what can anyone say? It is a revelation from God the Father; what need for debate if it is a revelation? Have we the revelation? We have; that is the point here.
Ques. Is the same order seen in @Acts 7 where Stephen testifies to the Son of man, and then in chapter 9 Saul preaches that Jesus is the Son of God?
J.T. That is a good connection, I should say, because the public position is the one in mind, the parting of the ways, Stephen being cast out and about to be martyred; his martyrdom involved a new situation which would come out in Paul. That is another matter which comes into this section. The great thought of what was revealed to Peter was intended to be Paul's great matter, the great subject of his testimony. "He preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God", @Acts 9: 20. Peter never did, as far as we know. It was a question of Paul, and that brings up another matter as to Paul's place in the assembly. Stephen says, "I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God"; it was a matter of humanity. The gospel implies humanity, "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus", @1 Timothy 2: 5. It is a question of men, therefore the Son of man is seen at the right hand of God. It is spoken of in John's gospel as "In heaven" showing that the title "Son of man" involves His presence as Son of man. It
{322}
involves that He is a divine Person. That is what we all need to understand, especially the young ones as they are coming into the truth.
Ques. Is not ignorance as to the Son of man the great defect in Christendom?
J.T. So that what men were saying implied they could say what they like about it. We sometimes see the Lord's name connected with ungodly men. No one who loves the Lord will admit of that for a moment, they would never admit of placing the Lord's name against great men of the earth.
Ques. How far did Peter go in his preaching in Acts, that "God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ"?
J.T. That is the official place. Here he went the whole way as to the Lord's deity, "Christ, the Son of the living God". Notice the word 'living', meaning he did not imply a dead system of things, but living. The assembly is the assembly of the living God too.
Ques. One feels the importance of this great matter to which you have referred. Would you just help us, especially the young, how we can get these right thoughts with regard to Christ when His name is so lightly spoken of?
J.T. Well, of course, the Spirit is the great Teacher in that sense. The Lord is the Teacher too, and John tells us, "They shall be all taught of God", @John 6: 45. These are great facts to keep before us, and now you are enquiring as to how the young are to arrive at the truth. Well now, I would say the truth of the household enters into this matter. It belongs to Paul's line. Paul arrived at the full truth of Christianity as it was intended to stand in this world publicly; he preached in the household. He did not make much of baptism, but Peter would make much of baptism. Paul baptised the household of Stephanas, showing he was thinking of that and the place the children have in view of the assembly. All are to be
{323}
taken account of potentially. All believers are to be taken account of and held as belonging to the assembly. If in time they break away after being baptised in the household of faith that would be apostasy in principle. While they remain in the truth nominally, their conduct being in relation to it they are to be held in relation to the assembly, and the teaching of the assembly is to be for them as well as for the brethren. It is a question here of teaching.
Ques. Is that why they are addressed in the epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians?
J.T. Quite so. They are not held in the same importance in Corinthians, nor in Romans. Not that these epistles ignore them at all, or set aside the thought of the household, but it is remarkable they come in such prominence in such epistles as Ephesians and Colossians. Brethren will do well to pay attention to it, if they are to come into the assembly. It is the design of God that our children are holy. They are held in the mind of God in that way and the teaching should have that in mind; the assembly should be in mind.
Ques. Is Timothy an example: "From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures"?
J.T. Very good! That is what I would say exactly. There was good reason for it. His grandmother and his mother are spoken of, implying that not only the immediate parents of the children are responsible but the grandparents too.
Ques. Does the name the Lord gave Peter have a bearing on what you are saying?
J.T. It is to call attention to his responsible position. The Lord names him, He gives him his proper assembly name. The Lord had the assembly in mind, "I also" (verse 18), meaning the allusion is to what the Father had said to him in revelation. The Lord alludes to that, "I also, I say unto thee that thou art Peter", that would be he is material for the
{324}
assembly, but the name Peter is called in John, "Cephas" meaning the same thing, the name the Lord gives to him directly as the last Adam, so that his status is established as to the assembly.
Ques. Do you mean He speaks to Peter in his responsible position first as having received the Father's revelation, and then, when He says, "I say unto thee that thou art Peter", on the line of purpose?
J.T. Quite so. He is material; one man who knew, and I think Paul had that in mind when he said, "Ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ", @Ephesians 3: 4. If there is one man who knows, one man being a creature, why not others? I think the Lord is stressing one answering His question because of revelation, not simply because he had heard it from others or that it was a known thing, but it is by revelation. I think that is the great point, the basis of our position on the earth today is revelation, there is no question about it. Infidelity being current is simply wickedness, just denying revelation.
Ques. Is "On this rock" on the revelation?
J.T. "Rock" has a known value in scriptural language; it refers to Jehovah, the word 'rock' signifies what is impregnable. The position of denial is simply wickedness; indeed it is blasphemy.
Ques. Is revelation consequent upon Peter's confession, "Thou art the Christ"?
J.T. Revelation is already made in the words, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". That is what he confesses, what he says, but that is already in his soul. That is where any idea of a stone or Cephas lies; the stones are impregnable too, the thing spoken of is also impregnable, "Hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it", the assembly.
Ques. Does "Look on us" bear on this? Would this truth have an effect upon the lame man at the beautiful gate? Peter says, "Look on us". I wondered
{325}
whether he would have this truth stabilised in his soul?
J.T. "Look on" would have some allusion to the word "Cephas", the thing indicated in the word applying to Peter, and John too. If anything comes out from God it is not intended for one person but to be spread abroad, so when the Lord says to Nathanael, "Thou shalt see greater things than these", He changes it to the plural, "Ye shall see". I think that is important to get hold of. The idea you are speaking of would spread out to John and to all of us because it is a question of what is in Peter's soul that would spread.
Ques. Have you in mind that the principle of "Look on us" would be developed locally?
J.T. I should say so. If a man is converted the thing is to spread. To illustrate that I would quote the woman of Samaria. You could hardly get a better case. She went to the men of the city and said, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" (@John 4: 29), and there was a nice spread of the truth. That is the basis upon which the assembly is formed.
Ques. This was a special revelation?
J.T. I am quite sure it was, a great fact to present before Peter's eyes. He who is said to be the Son of the living God is also the Christ. That is exactly what He said to the woman of Samaria. He told her He was the Christ. That enters into her testimony and into Peter's testimony. It would extend to Paul's doctrine. I should think it included all.
Ques. His special ministry of the Son of God?
J.T. Well, yes. The revelation was there.
Ques. The assembly includes Jew and gentile?
J.T. Quite so. That is what is meant here. It spreads out to the gentile. The epistle to the Ephesians assumes that and enlarges on it.
{326}
(Question with regard to the Messiah and "Son of the living God".)
J.T. He was the Messiah of Israel. The word is He is the Christ the Son of the living God. He is Christ as well as the Son of the living God.
Ques. Are you bringing this before us that we should be in the light of this revelation in the faith of our souls?
J.T. Even our children should be brought up in this great matter of the living God and the revelation made. Christianity is established on this line. It is an impregnable position and the children should know what to say to their school-fellows.
Ques. Why does the Lord say here, "Thou art Peter", but when he is coming with Andrew his brother the Lord says, "Thou shalt be called Cephas"?
J.T. The word 'Peter' is just material for the building. We remarked Cephas is the name which the Lord gives as the last Adam. That is the way I think it should be understood.
Ques. Thou art a stone-material?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Does He name him in view of this coming to light?
J.T. John and Matthew run together, John later, I suppose, so there is the idea of a name because the word 'Peter' or 'Cephas' becomes a name, but here it is viewed as material, the one is just material for the building, "I will build"; the word 'build' links the two things together, and Cephas is brought in in @1 Corinthians 15, but not Peter there. The Lord appeared to Cephas. Peter is stone. There was such a thing as material for the building and that is important too. What we are called to is to build up something the Lord has in mind, and it is to be impregnable, "The pillar and base of the truth".
Rem. It is suggested that all should be stones?
J.T. Mixture is what does damage.
{327}
Ques. I wondered about the distinction between the assembly of Christ and the assembly of the living God?
J.T. It is very precious that the Lord has an assembly. It shows how divine Persons regard each other. He has the assembly and God has it. It is said God purchased it with the blood of His own (@Acts 20: 28). The Lord builds it Himself.
Rem. "In heaven" is stressed here, "My Father which is in heaven", and "bound in heaven" and "loosed in heaven". All that is bound up with what is committed to Peter in relation to the keys of the kingdom. Will you help us a little as to why that thought is stressed?
J.T. It is a feature of Matthew, but of course it is generally true too. The heavens are brought in as well as the earth. The assembly involves, according to John, a universal position; indeed it is said in Hebrews, "He who has built all things is God", "all things" refers to the universe, and we are told in that epistle, "He that has built it has more honour than the house" and the builder is Christ, so that it is a universal position, not simply what may be on earth by itself, such as Israel or the nations but the assembly. The assembly stands in relation to the universal position and the idea of heaven. Heaven is prominent in Matthew. What power there is in the universal position, it is not Israel simply, but God was coming out universally, therefore the assembly is always to be regarded as universal. Look at Corinthians in its principles, it is universal, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies"; any local thoughts are foreign.
Rem. The prayer meeting takes a universal aspect, it comes into line. Help is needed to go beyond what is local or district.
Ques. Is this thought of building and revelation individual or more general?
{328}
J.T. I think it is what we come into. We have been speaking about the children and what they come into. What do they say they have come into? Is it church of England? It is a matter of revelation, hence it stands. That is the way it should be worked out. We are brought into a universal position and it is on the basis of revelation. All these religions claim revelation but it is all false. We have what is true here, we build into what is impregnable. I think children should be impressed with that and so with all of us in what we are saying to one another or to men.
Ques. Do we come into it by way of faith?
J.T. That is what I am thinking, only revelation is greater than faith.
Rem. Revelation stands once for all; the Spirit of God caused it to spread.
Ques. Is what comes in by way of revelation by the Spirit held in faith on our side?
J.T. If we have not faith we are not in it, so that faith is the test now. If one professes to be converted what has he got? Because the position has been secured by the death of Christ and the ascension of Christ and the gift of the Spirit. What has he got? It is a faith matter.
Ques. Have you in mind that Peter's confession showed what he had got?
J.T. I should say so. The Lord confirms it, "Thou art Peter", not a Jew, not a fisherman, not son of Simon; the point is he was Peter. That is he was material for the new building.
Ques. Is this worked out in Peter in chapter 2 of his first epistle, the living stones being built, and in Paul in @Ephesians 2, being built together for a habitation of God?
J.T. One is for spiritual sacrifices and the other for a habitation of God. "He who has built all things is God". That building is not this material, but He
{329}
that builds the house is greater than the house. It is material we are dealing with here; that material stands. The earth and heavens pass away but that material stands. Peter deals with what is passing, where there are all kinds of material things, but this material stands. The heavens and the earth pass away but this does not. It is indestructible. @Hebrews 12 sets it out in contrast to the things which can be shaken. It is opened up in, "Receiving a kingdom not to be shaken", @Hebrews 12: 28.
Ques. "I also". Does that indicate the greatness of the Builder here?
J.T. Just so. He is another divine Person. He speaks of the Father.
Ques. What is the importance of 'Christ' coming before "the Son of the living God"? He confesses Christ first, then the Son of the living God.
J.T. I would take that to be to set aside mere Jewish thought, the thought of the Messiah historically, the way it was held amongst them. The Father is the One who gives revelation. He would establish the Lord on an entirely new footing because Christ is associated with the truth right through in the assembly, and He is made Lord and Christ. We address Him in that way.
Ques. You are emphasising the Father and Christ here, two divine Persons. Would that be in accord with Peter's ministry being effected by the Father and the Son, that he is to first sound forth the truth of a divine Person, the Spirit, down here?
J.T. He is called the first apostle in Matthew. "First ... Peter" would imply in the Lord's mind that he had the first place with the apostles before Paul came. Not that he is relegated to the second place. It is never said of Peter that he preached Jesus as the Son of God; he never used that title in his preaching; it is as if the Lord reserved it for Paul.
{330}
It was the first thing Paul preached. He says, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me", @Galatians 1: 16.
Ques. Does this testimony stand? The gates of hades cannot prevail against it.
J.T. That is the idea one would like to have in one's own soul and in those of the brethren. We stand on impregnable ground which cannot be destroyed. It is a question of accepting that, and then the Spirit would support us in the position. We might die, we might suffer but the thing cannot be destroyed.
Rem. Say a little on verse 19, the keys of the kingdom.
J.T. It shows what God can do in a man. Peter had the power to bind and loose, and indeed the apostles had, speaking in general in chapter 18, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven", so it is a great matter. Peter had that power. It is exercised in the Acts. It is what we have in the assembly. It is one of the items that have come down to us; though Peter has passed away the binding and loosing has not passed away. John says, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". This is in the assembly; it is something the assembly has, and it greatly helps us when a lawless element arises. There is this power in the assembly and we can deal with evil, we are not driven to the wall.
Ques. Would it be right to say a man of flesh and blood reveals nothing of divine Persons?
J.T. The Father and the Son can reveal, therefore the whole position is outside the power of the devil.
Ques. Why does he use the word "whatsoever" not 'whosoever'?
J.T. Whatever lawless thing there may be. Persons may become things, they may become associations. Take the Roman Catholic system. It is a system of persons but it is an association and it is treated as such in the Revelation.
{331}
Rem. The Lord enjoined them after such a confession that no man was to say He was the Christ.
J.T. We are not to make these precious things public matters for the natural mind; we are to speak mysteries. We are not to cast our pearls before swine. Christendom is the things of God brought down to men's mind. When we preach we preach on the principle of mystery. We preach by the Spirit but not for the natural mind of man as man, but as taking account of men as God takes account of them. The natural mind is not appealed to; it cannot take in the things of God at all.
Ques. Is this binding and loosing applicable in the local company now?
J.T. Quite so, in the sense of binding sin on a man; if one known as a brother has known he has sinned and if it is unjudged I would say that principle holds; it is in keeping with @John 20, "whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". These are remnant times and we have to acknowledge all the weakness of the position, hence the word is, "Thou hast a little strength", and we exercise that.
Rem. The natural mind does not understand Christ and the assembly.
J.T. That is quite true, it is mystery.
(Question with regard to severity in dealing with one who has sinned.)
J.T. Well, if you analyse the first epistle to the Corinthians you will be fully confirmed in that. "What vengeance!", and yet the man was restored, showing severity is warranted.
Ques. If sins have to be retained, what happens?
J.T. It is a question whether he ever was converted, but then it is a comfort to know the man in Corinth was a bad case and he was restored quickly, more so than the highest hopes any one could have. He was restored and the apostle enjoins them to forgive him and comfort him. But if a man's sins are
{332}
not forgiven and have to be retained, I question if he was ever converted.
Rem. It speaks of being saved so as by fire.
J.T. That is true too. If his sin is retained solemnly before God it is doubtful if he was converted. We have to leave that, I would say.
Rem. So we look for repentance, "If he repent".
J.T. Quite so. Repentance must be there before he can be forgiven. "Convict before all".
{333}
CHRIST'S SUPREMACY IN THE GOSPEL
@2 Samuel 8: 1 - 18
I was encouraged this morning, in this room, to accept an invitation to preach here this evening. I was encouraged by the fact that the Lord Jesus is calling attention to His supremacy in the gospel. John the prophet, John the evangelist, when he saw the Lord Jesus in His official garb according to @Revelation 1, fell at His feet as dead, and the Lord laid His right hand upon him, saying, "Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". This word is to be observed, and I have observed it.
The Lord is calling attention, as I have said, to His supremacy in the gospel. He is marked out in Romans to be the Son of God "according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead"-not one dead person only, but the dead in general. There were those raised by Him, and presently all who love Him will be raised, "those that are the Christ's at his coming", @1 Corinthians 15: 23. Then the wicked dead shall be raised one thousand years later. The first resurrection will apply to believers and the second to unbelievers. So I am encouraged to render this service with the hope that the Lord may bless it, for Peter says of Him, "Who is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him", @1 Peter 3: 22. He is there supreme, not only being accepted in heaven, but triumphant over death, hell and hades. He has the keys of them; all the inmates of them are in His hand. The position of His triumph is clear, and none can interfere with Him. He has a free hand everywhere. He is on His Father's throne; it is a throne
{334}
of grace. He is on it, saving sinners, bringing about self-judgment and repentance, filling heaven with joy. Heaven's joy is constantly being replenished by every repentant sinner. It is what is current up there!
David is a type of Christ here in this chapter. It is a dim one because there is judgment in it; but this is his great chapter of victories, every enemy falling before him. He is not destroying so much (though he does do this), but *subjugating* them; he subdues people to himself. Subjugation is not destruction. It is the idea of the gospel, subjection, "for obedience of faith among all the nations". Joshua's mission was destruction. That was an earlier matter; and later on, at the Lord's appearing, His enemies will be destroyed. But here it is subjugation. If any here are insubject, let them come now under David, the beloved, a type of Christ in that sense. David was clever and keen as a warrior and ruler, to the end that subjection might be known. He was establishing his dominion by the river Euphrates. How widespread the rule of Christ is! He came not to destroy the world, but to save the world. Why should anyone be unsaved? It is His principal business to secure the members of the assembly, the greatest thing in the universe.
All that are saved now are to have part in the assembly. They are to be subject to Christ, and to other believers. Each one of us therefore is invited, indeed *enjoined*, to come into this system of subjugation; but it is more than that, it is a love system "For God so loved the world". Jesus has gone to heaven to carry on this matter of love, and even the matter of judgment is love, "For Topheth is prepared of old; ... the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it", so that love pervades everywhere. The lake of fire is to restrict wickedness it is the delight of love to do this. Joshua began a war of destruction, beginning with Jericho, but David
{335}
began a war of subjugation. So Christ, in His Davidic character, served in love; it is the service of the Beloved to secure persons on the principle of subjugation.
First we have "David smote the Philistines, and subdued them". It is not a question of destruction, but subjection; and then "David took the power of the capital", or 'the Bridle of the metropolis'. If it were Philistine rule then, it is Rome now who keeps men under cruel bondage of metropolitan rule. But in David's day the bridle was where people were held in slavery; today such towns and institutions are held in bondage to the wicked and cruel system by Satan's work. Unionism is another system by which Satan holds men in bondage, but the Lord is set for your deliverance by subjugation, that is by subjection to His rule; and what a benign rule it is!
If there is anyone here under another rule, we say before God, Why are you not really free? Or do you realise that you are being held in some way or system with Satan behind it? He hopes to keep you in bondage. This runs through the chapter. The Lord would deliver you from man's city, a place of nefarious uses, to His city, to Jerusalem above, "which is our mother", in moral superiority to all these things I have alluded to. If you are saved here tonight, you will be saved for the assembly. You may say to yourself, 'I am saved for heaven'. You feel safe. But no, you are to be saved for Christ now, for God, for the assembly, and this is the idea here. So David took Metheg-ha-ammah out of the hands of the Philistines, those cruel persons who David subdued. Samson ruled them, but David subdued them. So it is now; it is not heathen but christians. There is nothing much done in China or India or Asia: there is only one meeting in Asia, think of it! God is not generally working there, but in christian territory, though the gospel is for the heathen too! "For the word of God is living
{336}
and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword", @Hebrews 4: 12. Israel failed because they refused to hear the word of God, and if anyone here is failing to hear God's word, I would say, You are piling up your sins every day. You may say, 'I live a clean life', but one day the pile of your sins will meet you, and you will then have to do with God; and many are doing this! Christian Science is almost worse than anything; it is lawlessness, yet called 'Christian'! How the word 'Christian' may deceive people! And so it is, if you are insubject. David subjugated people; it says, "the Moabites became David's servants", not as servants to the world or any of its societies. You are either subject to the true David, or nothing. It is a question of subjection *now*, for wrath has been revealed, as it says, "For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men" (@Romans 1: 18), but it is not yet being executed. As Christians we are delivered from wrath.
I have pointed out that the Philistines were subdued, and the Moabites became David's servants, but in verse 2 we have David measuring them with a line, casting down two lines to be put to death, and one full line to keep alive. I spoke of David as not suggesting wrath, and this is perfectly right. The Lord Jesus spoke of Jezebel in Christendom, a cursed name, attached to the most wicked system in Christendom; He says, "Her children will I kill with death"; it is coming, as we get it in @Revelation 18 and 19. I refer to it here because of the two lines appointed to death; it is put off for the moment, but there the Lord has the means of dealing with it. I cannot tell you how many there are in that system, probably millions. See how many there are all around us, men being dominated and ruined by it. The Lord has to deal with it; He gives her time to repent, but she does not. Yet He is still on the line of subduing, and is here to do it this evening. Some of us Christians may need it, for
{337}
outside of faith there is nothing in any of us for the Lord. But if faith is there, however small, as it says in @Luke 7: So, "Thy faith", there is something for Him. Let us think how much we have; not the doctrine of Scripture, or the knowledge of the *Synopsis*, but the measure of faith. Here David measures persons, "making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive". If we are exercised as to life, and are repentant, it is one full line for life. How accurate he was! How he dealt with insubjection; and how he dealt with this one line! Are we living? All the principles of the gospel are in this chapter. The power of the capital is Metheg-ha-ammah (see note to @2 Samuel 8: 1), yet Jesus has the bridle now in His hands, "The Jerusalem above is free". That is a gospel matter for us to understand. No other city is free, though great men are granted the freedom of cities. What freedom is it really? Jerusalem is the only one that is free, and that is because God's Son has died, and in His mighty liberating power He has annulled death. He is now "at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him"! That is where He is now, forming that wonderful city, which is soon to be seen as "the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God". The gospel goes further than the forgiveness of sins, it means a place for you up there, in the city of the living God. I am preaching the gospel, endeavouring to enlighten you, and the Lord Jesus is free now, in heaven; He is free on earth too. He will yet go to hades, to deal with all that. He has dealt with everything in the universe, and now He is subjugating men, that they may be subject to God.
In verse 6 it says that "David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts". 'Garrisons' is a military
{338}
term; armies of occupation are called garrisons, that is the principle of it. It applies to all in this room; you must be in it, for the effect of this garrison principle is that people became David's servants, and brought gifts, which means that the service of God is enriched. We have, on the one hand, Jerusalem above, and on the other, these garrisons, which would refer to towns and cities here. I think they refer to the saints universally all over the earth, thus constituted by the teaching of Christ. In the main we have to rule out Asia, but the service of God is prospering here and in America and in the Antipodes, and the garrison principle is going on in the forming of saints into assemblies by the formative work of the Holy Spirit, using the word. This word which began in Palestine after the Lord went to heaven was used in power, and as things ripened we get persons *added*. They were added to what there was, so that they were all together. The place where they were was shaken, God was acting in love. The one hundred and twenty were all *called* persons; they were together. It speaks in @Acts 1 of "the crowd of names"; they were living. The divine actings did not go beyond the one hundred and twenty at first. It was not an organised position, but all could be distinguished by life; that is my point, it corresponds with this "one full line to keep alive". But in @Acts 2 three thousand souls were added, the first time such a large number is mentioned. God could have made it more, but the number was sufficient.
They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles-that is what 'adding' means. You may not be added yet! It says "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved". I look for that here tonight, that *all* might be saved.
I wish it were so. But I speak of "those that were to be saved". You are not really on His side, or really added to Him, if you do not know this, for He is working now on this line. He is not working with
{339}
Israel yet, but now, as then, He is adding "those that were to be saved". It is a 'daily' matter. Maybe there were a hundred meetings, or more, in Jerusalem after that first preaching, and they were being added to every day, "those that were to be saved". Let every one here search his heart; is he, or are you, one of those "to be saved"? You may say, 'Why does He not come into my way?'. But He may not. Sometimes He waits for you to come into His way, like the two blind men in @Matthew 9. He did not answer them, but He went into the house, and stayed there, and they *came to* Him. He was ready to save them, and He says, "Do ye believe that I am able to do this?". And then He says, "According to your faith, be it unto you". That was a sweeping statement, but true; there is nothing in that sense apart from faith.
This is a remarkable chapter of David's official glory, he fills every office. He becomes greater and greater. It typifies Christ as growing in the hearts of the saints, and so He is to become constantly greater. God preserved David all the time.
I leave it with you to work out this chapter and God will give you light through this type of David, and the thought of the full line of life. You have also the garrisons, and at the end the thought of David's cabinet, the officers that he had. It all prefigures the Lord Jesus working all the time in adding to the assembly, having the great end in view when it will be seen "coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God". The city of the living God is one of the things that we have come to according to @Hebrews 12: 22 - 24. Let us see that these wonderful things are ours, and that we are in them!
{340}
THE COMPLETION OF THE WORD OF GOD IN THE EPISTLES
@Matthew 26: 26 - 30; @1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 26
J.T. I have been thinking of the importance of the epistles for the completion of New Testament truth. The suggestion is that we might compare the truth presented not only in the Old Testament but also in the gospels, as not final, with the epistles which are final; so that we may see the differences, and perhaps be more accurate as to the truth governing our dispensation, the dispensation of Christianity. I thought we might look at the Lord's supper as presented in the gospels and the final word in 1 Corinthians, and then perhaps at something bearing on discipline in the gospels as compared with the epistles. I do not know whether this comparison has ever been made among us, but it occurred to me that it is important that it should be made so that we may know the truth as bearing on any particular point of doctrine, such as the Lord's supper. It is clear that it is of the first importance that all of the authority of the apostolic epistles should be fully understood. There has been a great deal of controversy throughout the history of the assembly, and there can be no doubt but that this has been due largely to the failure to produce what is final in the divine mind as to matters; one may say, what is the last word. Paul speaks of *completing* the word of God (@Colossians 1: 25). So that it is clear that the epistles should be especially in mind in all matters of doctrine; and then too, as to morals, the same thing applies. The passages selected are just samples, because there is a wide range of doctrine that calls for conclusiveness-the full idea of Scripture-so that the mind of God might be clear as to it. There is a great deficiency. One has observed, too, that things have
{341}
been said amongst us, to some extent fancifully, without the full support of Scripture, and therefore the doctrine is weakened.
W.W.M. The apostle says in the epistle we read, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14: 37. Is that final? Is that what you have in mind?
J.T. Quite so; the word is singular. It is the idea of *one* commandment, the whole epistle being one commandment, bringing in moral authority, moral conclusiveness.
G.A.D. Do the gospels call for different language because the Lord's supper is not in its final setting?
J.T. That is a good remark; the texts of the gospels are largely in Jewish settings and cannot be final. The Jewish mind and terms are made much of. The Jewish mind began early to damage Christian doctrine, according to @Acts 15, when the judaisers first appeared, and all the apostolic authority available was brought to bear on the truth. The epistle to the Galatians shows how judaising was a great error, and the truth had to be contended for accordingly, so that it might remain with the saints, as the apostle says.
A.N.W. Should our inquiry show that the finality of everything according to God will be found in Christ and the assembly?
J.T. I think that is good; it brings it down to a narrow application, only it is thought that the apostolic epistles should be the basis for us no matter what the sphere may be. If we were to consider ourselves in the early days of the truth of Christianity, and the judaisers were to bring in their doctrine, and quote from Moses or even from David, we can see how the spirit of the whole position would be aroused, for the attack was on the whole position of Christianity. Therefore the word in the beginning of the Acts is that those who were converted "persevered in the
{342}
teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers", @Acts 2: 42. We can see how any attempt to put Moses before the doctrine of the apostles would be regarded as error; and yet Moses had his place. It is a question of rightly dividing the word of truth. Recently, certain important matters have been dealt with from the Old Testament, and the New Testament and the light that bears on christianity was practically ignored. This related to the collection for the saints, the expression of the love of the saints.
And it bore also on the discussion of discipline. The Old Testament was preferred and the New Testament passed over in the decision. It is most important that the spirit of the word should be before us in such matters, and also the need of accuracy in what is done in administration.
R.W.S. Peter refers to Paul's ministry as being hard to be understood, but goes on to say that "the untaught and ill-established wrest, as also the other scriptures, to their own destruction", @2 Peter 3: 16. I am thinking of the things "hard to be understood". It might be that we have not been diligent enough to give the epistles their right place in our thoughts.
C.A.M. The authority for the Lord's day morning meeting is in the epistle, is it not?
J.T. Yes; and how important it is, because it implies the service of God.
J.T.Jr. Would you say that these defects have come in on account of the state among us?
J.T. There is evidently a disposition to have something new or something distinctive, with the best of intentions it may be, but still to have something distinctive.
A.N.W. You referred to what is fanciful. The types in the Old Testament really lend themselves to be used fancifully, which you cannot do with the direct doctrine.
J.T. That is just what is in mind.
{343}
C.A.M. Is it not a fact that Satan's intention is to unbalance the saints in some way, and so the Old Testament, having been opened up in such a wonderful manner for so many years, may be given an unbalanced place in some subtle way?
J.T. Anything to mislead the brethren. Satan has little regard for the instrumentalities he may use, provided he obtains his end, and so the Spirit of God has great consideration for brethren such as the Bereans, who searched the Scriptures daily to see whether such things were so.
F.N.W. Was it laying stress on the importance of the Lord's supper in the gospels, rather than in the epistles, that gave the new covenant an improper proportion in the truth a few years ago?
J.T. Yes, just so; the covenant was unduly enlarged upon and God brought into it; whereas, it is the *Lord's* supper, and the Lord is engaged in it from the outset to the end of it. It is the *Lord's* supper.
A.N.W. What you say about the Supper is interesting because the apostle evidently had that given to him of the Lord. Why do you use @Matthew 26 at this time instead of @Luke 22?
J.T. So that we might get the full idea of contrast, and the importance of getting the last word. @1 Corinthians 11 stands in its authority and clarity and brevity by example from the New Testament, and the use of Scripture when intended to be final. The facts as to the passover are found in @Exodus 12 and take up about twenty-eight verses, or more, of that chapter; whereas the part that Moses himself selects to be passed on to Israel takes up only about seven verses, and contains things that are not in the body of the instruction. But we are only calling attention to the use of Scripture; how it can be used, as exemplary, on a point, and how in a passage like @1 Corinthians 11: 23 and onward, there is brevity and clarity; whereas, if we extend our inquiry to Matthew and Mark and Luke we should
{344}
find great difficulty in reconciling them. But Paul has the last word, and he actually records it himself in a letter to a local assembly; that is, to Corinth, so that we have it concisely there, and with variations that are striking and with definite differences in the gospels.
C.A.M. Does what the Lord says, in the gospels, leave room for great inquiry? I am thinking of such a verse as, "But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father", @Matthew 26: 29. The position of divine Persons in the days that were to come after this must have raised inquiry.
J.T. Yes; and many such incidents as that. That has reference to Israelitish doctrine. As you say, it must have raised an inquiry with the early brethren, and they got the right thought as to it; so the Lord's supper was clarified through inquiry. Then Paul himself breaking the bread and discoursing at length on the occasion of the Lord's supper opened up much.
A.R. We are apt to confine our minds too much to the gospels instead of to what Paul says: "... in remembrance of me" has a Person in mind.
J.T. Just so. A striking thing came up recently when a brother advocated the idea that love did not enter into the Lord's supper, and that the cup of the new covenant was a cup of blood; that showed how the idea of being fanciful or prone to new things leads us astray. The Lord's supper is a memorial to Christ, and the cup is a memorial as well as the bread. This is mentioned by Paul only. The brother wanted to insist that righteousness only entered into the Lord's supper. I just mention that to draw attention to the danger of advocating new things for the sake of advancing something new.
R.W.S. In @Acts 20 it says that Paul prolonged the discourse till midnight. Would that be a corrective discourse?
{345}
J.T. I would think it was probably prophetic; that is, not applying to them alone, but to conditions that would come in, in the history of the assembly, such as have come in, and have been created since the time of the Reformation down to the present time. The apostle not only dealt with local conditions, in immediate need of correction, but what has affected the whole assembly.
R.W.S. Is it your impression that in the present period of assembly history there is a tendency for new and fanciful things to flourish amongst the saints?
J.T. I have observed that. It applies to the whole history of the assembly. One could cite instances in the early days, as well as in later days, that error or heretical teaching largely arose from the thought of a leader having something by which he could acquire power.
F.N.W. Did you have something further in mind about Paul's discourse?
J.T. I referred to that as suggesting the prophetic side of Paul's exercises at that time, and how much time was taken up by it. It has occurred to me that there may be a prophetic allusion to the *Collected Writings*. How enlarged the truth of the Lord's supper has become! And even down to our own day, how it is necessary constantly to allude to it in ministry, to guard it, because there is so much tendency to repeat and say things that are not exactly scriptural. For example, we often hear persons speak of remembering the Lord in His death. But it is really a memorial to Him in His life, a memorial in His present circumstances.
T.W.H. Would the conversational part of that meeting at Troas be something like our Lord's Day afternoon readings?
J.T. The conversational side came in after Eutychus was resuscitated; whether Paul continued with a reading is not clear, but it may be so, as if the apostle
{346}
would enlarge on what he had in his mind by conversation among the brethren. And possibly the resuscitation of Eutychus gave a fresh impetus and more appetite for the truth that he had in his mind to unfold in the discourse. Perhaps the apostle would say, We get on better if we converse about this matter and get the brethren to raise questions about what is in their minds. The discourse was that he spoke alone, evidently. There was no inquiry along with that, and there is no suggestion of what was effected by it, but the revival of Eutychus would give great impetus to the state of the meeting. They were no little comforted because of the boy's revival. It is made a point of, as if Paul took advantage of that to arouse more interest in the truth.
C.A.M. Your reference to discourse and conversation is a very interesting one as connected with the character of these meetings which we hold. There are no other christian circles where meetings like this can be found, as far as I know. Earlier in the chapter it refers to Paul "having passed through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse ...".
J.T. Apparently others are not able to carry them on to any successful issue of inquiry into the Scriptures, except that they have addresses or similar gospel meetings. But as to meetings for inquiry in the christian circle, there appears to be little power for it.
G.L. When a gifted brother comes along, the question is sometimes raised whether we should have an address or a reading. Is that a matter for spiritual discernment?
J.T. I think that is right. The Lord is greatly prospering such meetings as we are having here this afternoon, the brethren sitting down together as they did at Troas, because that would seem to be what happened; the address was probably first, and the conversation afterwards. It is, therefore, a question of what would be most suitable. The Lord fitted
{347}
Paul to answer questions as to the truth. If we examine the letters to the Corinthians, there are expressions such as, "But concerning the things of which ye have written to me ..". That refers to questions they raised with him. It is important to have questions raised and discussed as to the things the brethren have in their minds; and a meeting like this affords that; whereas if we have addresses only, there is not the same occasion and opportunity for having specific questions answered.
R.A.L. Would the gospels furnish the sentiment suitable for the Lord's supper?
J.T. Well I suppose the account in the gospels probably appeared after some of the epistles had been written. Evidently the Spirit of God saw the need of the Lord's own words, the Lord's own ministry, and the facts stressed in that ministry, the actual facts of the gospels: what the Lord said and did before He died, in order to meet the revival of judaism, for christianity developed largely into that. Then, later, Luke says, "I composed the first discourse, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up", @Acts 1: 1, 2. Apparently the Spirit of God saw that there had not been enough in the gospel of Luke to bring out what was needed for the inauguration of christianity, and so he wrote a second treatise, speaking of what the Lord Jesus "began both to do and to teach, until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up; to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and, being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which said he ye have heard
{348}
of me". It is evident that Luke felt that more time was needed for the unfolding of the truth after the Lord had suffered until He was received up, and that the brethren should not be in a hurry to conclude as to what was final, because forty days were mentioned; and Paul develops the same point many years later.
W.W.M. Do you think that if we gave a little more time to conversation at our family readings concerning what we have read, the instruction of the family would be far greater?
J.T. That is good. The facts of christianity indicate that the Lord worked late at night, even on the very day that He arose. And Paul extended his service into the night; indeed, he says, "night and day". And in later years, the brethren spent far into the night in looking into the matter of prophecy.
Maybe we should tax ourselves as to how much time we really make for looking into these matters, because obviously time is very scarce. But it may be because we do not provide for it, that we do not ration it.
If anything is scarce, it has to be rationed; used with judgment, and the most made of it. Maybe we should consider the matter of rationing time as well as meat and other commodities.
R.M. The Bereans searched the Scriptures daily, but Paul said to the Thessalonians, "Do not lightly esteem prophecies; but prove all things".
J.T. The Bereans and the Thessalonians were not far removed from each other, but they are contrasted in @Acts 17: 11, because the Bereans searched the Scriptures daily.
A.R. In viewing the emblems, the bread and the cup would not suggest so much the idea of the will of God as His dying for the assembly, would they not?
J.T. We have to tax our minds as to what is really in the truth of the Lord being raised. The Lord Jesus has risen and has ascended into heaven, and not only so, but He takes account of us, according to
{349}
Paul's own quotation in @1 Corinthians 15: 3, "For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures; and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to me also". At the time Paul wrote about, the Lord was moving about among the brethren in a spiritual sense. For in @John 14: 18 He says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". And if He comes, what hymn would be suitable? If He came to New York, where there are nine meetings, what would be an appropriate hymn? We are dealing with the assembly in its actual condition. The assembly is an actual thing. The Lord's movement in @John 20 would link on with @Psalm 22, the heading of which is "The hind of the morning", meaning that it is a fresh, actual, flourishing condition. Therefore the question is, What would suit that condition? We do well to just enquire as to what would suit any particular Lord's day morning in the light of what we are engaged with now on Saturday afternoon. What will be likely to affect us tomorrow morning? If we are active and alive in our souls, we will be buoyant; we will be ready for the Lord. It is not so much to be occupied with His death as it is to be occupied with Him alive, because He is moving about in love, and moving about with the assembly in His mind, and He is looking for response from us. So I would think, therefore, that the hind of the morning would be a suggestion of what should be in our hearts as we enter on the service, something to greet the Lord with as in heaven and coming to us.
Ques. Is moving from our side a test? It says
{350}
of the disciples that having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
J.T. That raises the question as to what is mentioned in Matthew and Mark. It surely is a movement that bears on the Lord's supper, and I would say that it would have in mind that the early Jewish christians particularly might be lifted out of their judaising setting. We are apt to be held in that kind of thing unless we are delivered from it in power. The allusion to going out to the mount of Olives, I believe, was intended to help the Hebrew christians at the outset to leave their natural setting and be with the Lord in His sphere.
T.E.H. It may be necessary, on some occasions, to allude to the matter of forgiveness, because if we get under judaising principles, we may need that help.
J.T. Very good; we may need the new covenant in that way. We often need to be reminded of the freshness of the covenant idea which God has entered into with us, for young people are apt to be down in their souls at times, and it is a question therefore of making inquiry in our minds as to what state the assembly is in when the meeting begins-what would be suitable.
A.N.W. That is very helpful, because it is not that we are to be occupied in keeping things out, but to have some priestly idea of what we can bring in.
J.T. That is good; and of course what we can bring in would include the Lord and what the saints have to offer.
R.M. In partaking of the emblems, we announce the death of the Lord.
J.T. That is the conclusion of that part of the meeting, to announce the Lord's death. That is testimony. That is not a question, exactly, of the state of the meeting, but a testimony to any, whoever they may be, that are present. It is a testimony that should be ever before us, and held amongst us, the death of the Lord.
{351}
R.W.S. It is very liberating to think that what is said depends upon the state of the brethren at the time. What would be suitable one Lord's day may not be right for the next Lord's day when the saints may be in a different spiritual state.
J.T. That shows the difference between christianity and judaism, or anything bordering on judaism. A written ritual fits in with days of the month, or days of the week, whereas christianity implies a living state of things. Hence the Lord said to John, "I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades",
@Revelation 1: 18. And then He tells John to write, and the order in which he is to write. I would say that we ought to gather from that fact how the Lord would have things in our days, and how the Lord's supper should be regarded as His. John said that he became in the Spirit on the Lord's day. It gives a clue to what the Lord would say, and how extensive the thing may become, for He says, "I am ... the living one". It is an active condition, and with ourselves it depends largely on the state there may be with us.
Ques. In @1 Corinthians 11: 20 the apostle says, "When ye come therefore together ... it is not to eat the Lord's supper". That is very strong language, is it not?
J.T. In what they were doing, they were not eating the Lord's supper; they were despising the assembly of God. Therefore it was not really eating the Lord's supper; and, of course, it may be that some may not be eating the Lord's supper who profess to do so.
Rem. They were together assembly-wise, for he says, "For first, when ye come together in assembly". Then he says, later, "What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this point I do not praise" (verse 22).
J.T. He twice says, "I do not praise". But we would desire to have an encouraging word from the
{352}
Lord, and particularly at times when we might be bowed by depression.
A.A.T. I noticed that, in addressing the Lord, you spoke to Him as Lord Jesus. Is that a term of affection?
J.T. It is an expression which Paul uses at the end of @Acts 20: "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus" (verse 35). It is the Lord's remark, but it is commented upon after He died, and rose again. It is not recorded in the gospels. It is evidently a touch that fits in with that wonderful chapter on love"Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive". Well, if you connect that with other uses of the title, such as, "The Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up ..." and the passage, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", there is a peculiar touch of affection connected with it.
R.W.S. Does Paul's ministry present the truth as to the Supper, and John the service of God, especially in @Revelation 21: 3 where he refers to the tabernacle of God being with men? Are there features which Paul's and John's ministry represent in the service?
J.T. What comes into @Revelation 21, in connection with the tabernacle of God, is connected with the bride. She comes down as a bride adorned for her husband, and then the voice calls attention to the tabernacle of God, that it is with men. It seems to me that would fit into the service, where the bride is linked on with God in the types, as Rebecca is linked with Abraham. He had a great concern about her in relation to Isaac. She appears in @Genesis 22 where heaven is making much of Abraham's surrender of Isaac. Rebecca comes into prominence by herself, as it were, in the midst of the genealogy of Abraham's brother Nahor. The passage reads: "And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham,
{353}
saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor: Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. (And Bethuel begot Rebecca.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother" (verses 20 - 23). And it would seem to me as if the allusion in @Revelation 21 affords us warrant for linking the assembly directly with the service of God: "The tabernacle of God is with men". That is said immediately after it speaks of the bride adorned for her husband, as if it is an appropriate time to refer to it.
A.N.W. Would you go as far as to say that we reach eternity in that way in a bridal setting, whereas we reach eternity in another way at the close of the meeting possibly in "God ... all in all"?
J.T. Certainly that reference in @Revelation 21 is a direct warrant for bringing her in in connection with the Father: "The tabernacle of God is with men".
{354}
SERVICE AND THE SERVANTS
@Revelation 1: 9 - 19; @Acts 14: 19, 20
The verses read contemplate those who serve the Lord, John and Paul being amongst them, and it is thought that we should have before us the great matter of the service and those who serve, that we may see the place they have with the Lord, and how He regards them, and how they are to have a like place with the saints, the generality of the saints. Their lot is a suffering one, as one of them said, "I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body", so that the effect of His sufferings is to extend to the whole body of the saints.
That is the saints viewed as the body of Christ, "his body ... the assembly". And so the verses in @Acts 14 were read that we might see how quickly circumstances change in the powers that be, in the governing powers, and in view of this, those who serve and those who are served should be ready for every emergency, our lot ever being to show the spirit of Christ, as Paul said, "The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ". Paul and Barnabas were the great forerunners of the great missionary enterprise of the Lord among the gentiles.
The Lord had said of Paul that He would show him how much he would suffer for His name, and so it is evident that the apostle Paul became the leading apostle, the leading evangelist, and also the leading sufferer under Christ. We have spoken today of the Lord Jesus in His relations with the assembly, His marital relations. They must not be regarded as militant relations. The Lord would have His own rights and time, for He owns time; He made it, and used it, and has a right to it. So there is a day called the Lord's day, and undoubtedly He intends to devote that day to His relations with the assembly. Not
{355}
indeed that it is so regarded in the world, but love for the Lord would lead it to be so regarded, that we as the assembly should be available to Him, for His pleasure, and we can see how Paul led in that. The Lord had said He would show him how much he had to suffer for His sake, for His name. A very remarkable thing was that the matter of sufferings was in the first place in the apostle's history and service. It is not the time for me now to detail the facts as to the suffering. The second epistle to the Corinthians helps as to the greatness of the suffering, and you marvel, as you read the facts detailed there, how much he suffered, but it is noticeable that Paul sets out as a sufferer as the Lord said, "I will show him how much he must suffer for my name". The suffering was to be before kings, and the sons of Israel, and so he suffered.
We are told he spent two years in Syria and he spent two in Rome, as far as we can see, and much more elsewhere, but I mentioned these two important periods as showing how much he suffered. He suffered much more, of course, but he suffered during those two periods, and there can be no doubt that the suffering was intended to soften his constitution, to refine him, to make him more refined in the Lord's hands, as a holy instrument, a holy vessel. He is called a vessel, "an elect vessel to me". No one else is called that, in the same way. He is distinguished in the Lord's mind in the way of service, but especially in the way of suffering, and we have all benefited by those sufferings. They are intended, however, to be participated in by us. The apostle intended the saints to join in with him, and so they do. In the verses I have read they encircled him, and I mention the word 'encircled', because it is a characteristic word entering into Christianity, which we all should cherish, the circle of the saints. Hence when the apostle was carried out as dead, we are told that certain ones
{356}
from the provinces came: "There came Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds and stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing him to have died". Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came to the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. That is to say the Lord, in effect, said, 'My service must go on, be the wickedness of the nations what it may, its violence what it may, the measures taken to murder him what they may, the service must go on'; and it went on the next day. And so we do well, dear brethren, to learn to have the servants in our hearts, in our affections, understanding what they suffer; if they do not suffer, there is something amiss, something awry, because suffering is the order of the day, according to the Lord's own words, "I will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name", and it worked out, according to the epistle of the Colossians. It is a peculiar epistle in this sense, because it says so much about Paul's service, about his suffering and about the kind of service too, what functions he filled in the service of Christ, as if each one of us is to go to school, as it were to him. I mentioned the word 'school' because it was he that separated the saints into the school of Tyrannus. There was no uncertain meaning, for the Lord would teach us, would impress upon us the necessity of learning, and learning well, not simply as it suits us, but learning well, and so he directed the disciples to the school of Tyrannus, in which school he kept on teaching. Both he and Barnabas had been teaching in another school at Antioch, where the disciples were first called christians, as if they earned the name in that school. They taught, we are told, in the assembly, a large crowd. These words are to be noted; they were there for a whole year, showing the length of time the servants were there in certain circumstances. They began with the crowd, that is
{357}
raw material; the material was woven, as it were, and fitted until it became an assembly, so that you can visualise what had happened at Antioch, when the building was first formed of raw material, uneducated spiritually, but gradually the crowd itself and the name became the assembly, as if I was speaking to five hundred people here. First we begin with raw material, indeed, the term is quite applicable, because so many are uneducated (spiritually I mean). We may be highly educated otherwise and not spiritually educated. The fact is, the more highly educated we are the less likely we are to be spiritually educated. Not that I make little of it, but it is not necessary to make much of ourselves as individuals in this world, because we are being fitted for heaven, another world, for that world and the resurrection, and we want to see that we are fitted for it now. And so individuals cease to be one of the crowd, and begin to be one of the assembly, and that is what I am aiming at, that the brethren may understand that Paul was a great assembly man, and that he laboured to that end, as he says, "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". Then he says that we should no longer be babes, that is no longer raw material but finished material, finished for the assembly. Hence Paul says again, "That we may present every man perfect in Christ". That is not impossible for women. The divine idea is that we should be perfect. 'Perfect' has its own meaning, and we have to understand that, for every man is to be presented perfect in Christ. Not simply perfect in the ordinary sense, but in Christ Jesus, and Paul laboured to that end; he suffered for it, and was carried out as dead. Think of the suffering the brethren had to go through.
And so I read the passage in Revelation, because John, another apostle, says, "I John, your brother
{358}
and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus". Now this is John, and he testified the great theme of the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation is said to be given to Christ: "which God gave to him". The "Revelation of Jesus Christ", and it says that it was sent to His bondman "to shew ... what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw". I should add the next verse, "Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written in it; for the time is near". That is to say keep, not only read, but keep the things that are written therein. Not only to know the things that are written therein, but to keep them. Now John says here, addressing himself to them, "I John", he says, "your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus". That is to say he is calling upon us, assuming that we are in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ. He is in that kingdom; the Lord is considering for him. He is one of the twelve, and apparently intended to be one of the last to go to heaven, as far as we can see. The Lord said to Peter, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?". And so it would appear from that that he lived to be a very old brother; apparently his service was not impaired by his age, and so we are not to assume that because a brother is getting old (he is apt to be called old too often), his ministry is on the wane and apt to be weakened; and that he is about to be superannuated. There is no such word in the divine vocabulary as that. There is very much of it found among official circles of the world, but certainly not in the divine vocabulary. A brother is to go on and on to his last breath, and the Lord may say, 'I will make that one longer than the
{359}
previous one'. He certainly did so for Moses; he lived to be one hundred and twenty, whereas he himself tells us by the Spirit of God that seventy years is the allotted age for man. If it exceeds that by ten years it would be labour in sorrow, but the Lord can change that, you know. We must never assume that divine Persons can be restricted. They are not restricted by Their own laws. We must always assume that God is God. I am quite sure that "I am Jehovah, and there is none else" includes Deity. And so God can make a man to live one hundred years, or one hundred and twenty years, as Moses certainly did, and the Spirit of God says, "His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated". How marvellous that God should be pleased to honour His servant in that sense! There was no lack, no want. God has His favourites, you know. He is entitled to them; let no one say He is not, because He is. John here was a disciple, the one whom Jesus loved; he was a favourite one, he was a speciality, and the Lord kept him a long time, and we may be sure that he was to the pleasure of the Lord every moment of his time. He would not set aside his individuality to serve, nor should anyone here assume that his time is up; it is not up, it is a question of what God wills. God directed that Moses should go up and die, and he did. He showed him the land of Canaan first. It was God's right. He did not take him into it, but He showed him all the land of Canaan. In designating the land of Ca designated it by all the tribes that inherited it. He might say, You will be among all those tribes presently. And so it will be as another has said,
<blockquote>'Nor what is next Thy heart Can we forget; <br>Thy saints, O Lord, with Thee In glory met'. (`160:8)</blockquote>
That is what the old brethren can count on presently, going into it. But how long is a question of the will
{360}
of God, and how sweet it is to nestle under the sense of the will of God! "The good and acceptable and perfect will of God". And so John says here, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus". There is a note to these words to show that they are bound together. John the prophet and the saints were bound together in holy bonds, bound up by the Lord, in the use of the word, to show how he intended the saints to be bound up with his service, and so we should learn to link ourselves up with the servants of God, great or small, and regard ourselves as serving with them, so that the service becomes the property of all. Why not? Those who maintain the servants, who lodge and feed them, are bound up in their service, and the Lord values it accordingly. "Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me". John says, "Your brother ... in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus", and he says, "I ... was in the island called Patmos". That is to say, he bound himself with the testimony, and of course that is what every true servant is thinking of. He is thinking of the testimony of Jesus Christ. If a brother has gift, he is to be used, but the gift is to enhance his testimony, just to enhance his testimony of Jesus Christ. John was in that, and he is the brother and companion of the saints in it. And so he says that he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind him a great voice as of a trumpet. And now I just turn briefly to these verses, only to bring out, as I have already pointed out, how the saints are bound up with the service, and of course, we all should bear testimony. We are all together as one. We are one body, we are all bound up in the testimony; it is an agreed matter. And so it is in chapter 12 of the first epistle to the Corinthians that Christ is
{361}
mentioned as the body, as the total of the saints, so that we are all in it, a great fact, and hence the greatness of those who are gifted, they enhance the testimony, they can say things better, in power, so that people are affected by it; here John says, "I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet, saying, What thou seest write in a book". But I want just to go to one point, and it is that he says, "I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden lamps". I want you to see, beloved brethren, that the Lord, while the assembly is His, His spouse, His wife, the bride of Christ, yet that He at times presents her rather than Himself. Let no one say I am making more of the assembly than I ought, because I am not, nor do I intend to, but in this particular passage John says, "I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden lamps". Now I am stressing this because you see the Spirit of God places the assembly before the Lord in this passage, and we have to learn to do that, if necessary. He saw seven golden lamps, and in the midst of the seven lamps one like unto the Son of man. That is what he saw. We were speaking today of Isaac, the type of the Lord, seeing the camels, not Rebecca. Why cannot the Lord do that? And so here John sees the golden candlesticks first. Let no one say that John is thinking of putting the assembly before Christ. Christ is everything to him, but the assembly is everything to Christ, and in a certain sense the assembly must go first, in certain things, and we are to learn to think that way, and to see how important it is in testimony, and to learn to revere every thought of it, and to see how very near it is to God. Next to divine Persons, the assembly has the nearest place to God, and so John sees the lamps before he speaks about the Son of man. I hope the brethren will not think anything wrong, as I said before. You do not need to be fearful about it. What
{362}
I am saying is the truth, and the truth here is set in the saints, and the candlesticks are mentioned before Christ, but then He is mentioned in the midst of them, as if the Lord would say, 'I am not going to be separated from My body', nor is He.
Christ is in the midst of the seven golden lamps, and throughout these addresses, seven, He is in the midst of the lamps, and we have to learn to listen to the prophet, because John is a prophet, not the apostle, here; he is the bondman of Christ, but he is a great prophet. The book of the Apocalypse is a prophetic book, and John is the writer of it, and so the passage goes on to say that he is to write. It says in verse 13, "And in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle: his head and his hair white like white wool, as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire; and his feet like fine brass, as burning in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters; and having in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth; and his countenance as the sun shines in its power. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last". I am going to say a word about John, and the seven golden lamps, but I want you just to notice how He is clothed. It is intended to inspire fear; it is as an antagonist. The Lord has the means of dealing with the disregard to the rights of God. He has the means of dealing with all that, but not yet, He is not doing it yet. He is clothed with garments in which He will do it, but He is not doing it yet. So John rightly fell at His feet as dead. The Jesus whom he had been accustomed to is now clothed with these fearful robes, and the Lord is saying that He is going to deal with all that is contrary to God, and so He says to John, 'You do not need to fear', and He would say to us,
{363}
'You do not need to fear'. Many things are being done by scientific man which might make our blood curdle, but we should learn to think of the Creator, and the power He has of carrying the assembly through, and keeping it out of the great tribulation, and the power He has to take us to heaven, and He says, "Behold, I come quickly". I am endeavouring to quieten the spirits of the brethren. We should learn to know God, learn that nothing can happen without God, not a thing, whatever men say, and whatever loud phrases and themes they bring forward; the people listen, but they can do nothing without God allowing it, and the Lord is seen here in the midst of the whole scene of judgment, about to burst forth, yet nothing can be done without Him. John fell at His feet as one dead, owing to fear, and He put His right hand upon him.
That is the hand that would effect all these things. He says to John, 'You do not need to fear'. You can be restful and quiet when these things happen. The Thessalonian saints were afraid that the day of the Lord had come. It has not come yet. We are still in the dispensation of grace, and the Lord is showing what power He has, in the scripture I read. Then it says that "When I saw him I fell at his feet as dead". Now Abraham began with that. Jehovah said to Abraham, in a critical time when he had no son, no heir, but God said to him "Fear not", and He is saying that to us today, dear brethren. We are to learn not to fear, but to be restful under the wing of the Lord; nothing can happen without Him, and He is taking care that it will not happen while we are here. "I also will keep thee", He says, "out of the hour of trial". He is not mincing the matter; we are going to be tried. We can hardly realise, ourselves, the terrible tribulation that is to come, but the Lord says, 'I will keep thee out of it', not 'I will take thee out of it', and that would mean that each one of us girds up his loins. If you are told you are not to go
{364}
through the fire, well, keep away from the fire. We have no right to go into it, but to keep ourselves away from the world, unspotted from the world. So the Lord is saying to us now, "Fear not". We have all come here in faith, in measure at least, and we are not afraid of the Lord. We have learned to address Him, and to nestle under His wing, and we have learned to sit under His shade with great delight. I have rapture, said one, and sit down in His presence.
"In his shadow have I rapture and sit down". We are learning to be restful in the knowledge of the Lord. He has made all things. Whatever was made was made by Him, so that our Saviour is a Creator and nothing can happen without Him, and so He says here to John, "I ... have the keys of death and of hades", so that the beloved John is as beloved as ever he was, maybe more than ever. He is now the devoted servant taken on by the Lord in this great matter. "And he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw", and I would venture to say that he was never more lovely in the eyes of the Lord than he is now, and so He would show us how lovely we are, according to what He has made us, and He is going to keep us out of the great tribulation. Our hearts are to be restful in these facts, and then we must continue to do something, whatever the Lord has given the servants let them do it, and do it well. Keep on doing it with all your might. "All things which Jesus began both to do and to teach". Keep at it till the last breath; He says to John, "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these", three sets of things. John, you are to write them. You can understand his remark in his gospel that the world itself would not contain the books that should be written. If the Lord says, 'Keep on writing', there must be paper, and there
{365}
must be ink; let the work not cease. Your labour is to go on even to your last breath. The Lord will take account of it. Do not write as you like, do it in the order He has given you, not as you think it ought to be. Be a good Berean and have the Scriptures before you. Read like Apollos who was mighty in the Scriptures, and taught accurately; Aquila and Priscilla made him more accurate; the Lord is looking for accuracy. Do not forget to have the right things, said well, but accurately. We are not to fear, we are to go on, and keep on writing to the last moment. The Lord knows when to take us, and I venture to say that we shall not be taken until everything is finished. Whatever is to be done will be done. The Lord is patiently working out the idea of the assembly, and it will be finished; there will not be one left out. Everything will be done, and done well; as Paul says, "Complete the word of God". Well, may He help us all, and the thing particularly on my mind is that we should be restful, and go on quietly with the work of the Lord, so that whatsoever our hands find to do, let us do it with our might.
{366}
THE LORD'S ASCENSION
@Luke 24: 50 - 53; @Acts 1: 6 - 14
J.T. The thought is to seek to develop the truth as seen in these two scriptures, in relation to the Lord's ascension. There was only one ascension, although it might seem that there is a discrepancy in the accounts, yet they report one ascension; that is to say, the ascension of the Lord Jesus into heaven. @Luke 24 contemplates it as taking place at Bethany, but mount Olivet was very near to Bethany, and therefore the connection with it as concerning the ascension is undoubtedly to bring out the truth that @Luke 24 relates to Israel and Christ's connection with it, whereas the mention of mount Olivet has allusion rather to what belongs to christianity. The time would come in which christianity should stand out by itself as it is today, but in the early days it was not so, and what is now in mind is to distinguish between the two chapters to show that @Luke 24 alludes to God's patience with Israel, the promises having still a place. Israel presently would be regarded as having crucified the Lord Jesus in ignorance indeed it is said, "I know that ye did it in ignorance, as also your rulers" (@Acts 3: 17), but the time would come when the guilt of the murder of Christ would be attributed to Israel. After the death of Stephen, it was. At the end of the book of Acts, Paul says that the salvation of God is sent to the gentiles and that they will receive it. But at first it was sent to the Jews. The promise was to them and to their children and to as many as were afar off. The gentiles were in mind, only distantly, but at the end of Acts, they are in mind directly and immediately. "This salvation of God has been sent to the nations; they also will hear it",
{367}
R.W.S. Would what was in the mind of the disciples in @Acts 1 as to the kingdom bear more on the Jewish side of the position?
J.T. That would be so, I would say, and in general the early chapters of the Acts bore on it. The message to the gentiles through the ministry of Peter did not actually begin to take effect until Caesarea.
A.R. Do you think there is a tendency with us to mix judaism with christianity?
J.T. Well, there is. We know, according to Galatians, that judaism was formally being introduced as a part of christianity. Circumcision and other features were insisted on by certain, but the epistle to Galatians was used of God to clarify the whole position. Paul and Barnabas were recognised and the fruit of their ministry in effect is seen in Titus; circumcision was not insisted on, so that the truth was gaining ground. But there is ever a tendency to mix up judaism with christianity. It is in the ministry of Paul that the matter is clarified and settled, so that we are to understand, from @Ephesians 2, that the gentiles were recognised as "built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit". Today, it would be difficult to find believing Jews in any number, so that the fact is apparent that the gentiles form a great number of those who are to be regarded as christians.
A.N.W. So that many expressions in the letter to the Hebrews do not necessarily apply to christians generally.
J.T. I suppose the apostle Paul, who is undoubtedly the writer of the letter, was seeking to bring in christian terminology as much as possible. There were many Jews, of course, at that time, who were still genuine. Many had accepted the christian faith at Jerusalem; there were many in Judaea and throughout the world, indeed. And the apostle, in writing the epistle, would be very tender and sympathetic and would avoid hurting them unnecessarily; but still,
{368}
the gradual tendency of the epistle is to establish christian terminology. We might term it a christian's vocabulary rather than linking everything with judaism. At the beginning, according to @Luke 24, the Lord led the disciples out as far as to Bethany, as far as to -- not further, and they returned to Jerusalem full of joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. But that was not intended to continue. The tent of Sarah was hardly intended to continue. At the beginning, according to the type in @Genesis 24, Sarah's tent was the place, but that was not to continue. It does not continue now. The assembly itself has a great place.
A.R. In @Acts 20 it says that on the first day of the week they came together to break bread.
J.T. Yes; showing the time had come for the new order to be established. Instead of the sabbath, it was the first day of the week, and that has continued until now. So that the Lord's day and the first day of the week synchronise.
C.F.M. What would you say as to the addition, in @Acts 1, of the two men appearing and speaking to the disciples, saying, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven"?
J.T. We should revert to @Luke 24, to fink on what had happened. In verse 4 it is said: "And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment".
Now what you allude to is in @Acts 1: 10: "And as they were gazing into heaven, as he was going, behold, also two men stood by them in white clothing, who also said, Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into heaven?". There is a difference in their external appearance. In @Luke 24 the two men are said to be in shining raiment, whereas in @Acts 1 they are said to be in white clothing. Now the question may arise,
{369}
Why should there be a difference? It would look as if the whole position in @Luke 24 is to bring out the fulness of the bearing of the resurrection, that it was to be heavenly. The shining garments would suggest that, whereas in Acts I would think the thought is rather to emphasise purity because of the actual beginning of things at Jerusalem. What was so necessary at that time was to assert purity, not exactly heavenliness but purity. Mark would say the same thing as to the young man in the sepulchre: "And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were amazed", @Mark 16: 5. So that the idea of whiteness, or purity, is in Mark and in the Acts. In Mark it would allude to what is needed in the service of God, in levitical service, whether preaching or teaching. @Acts 1 would also stress the need for purity in view of the inauguration of christianity. It was to be begun in purity.
W.W.M. Would the Bethany position be connected with those who had been affected by the baptism of John, and possibly not going as far as @Acts 1? John the baptist's ministry would have taken on those that repented. But the Lord has something further to go on to in what Paul brings out with the twelve men at Ephesus.
J.T. It is just a question as to the place John's ministry had; whether it had any place in @Acts 1. What corresponds with it is @Luke 24. It is the same position. Luke, the writer of the two treatises, has the same line of thought in mind, only in the first something needed to be added. He begins the Acts by referring to the former treatise, which evidently was not complete. Time brought out that it was incomplete, and the fact of the incompletion is a matter to be noted now, because we are all apt to be incomplete. And so we have to wait for Paul for completeness. It is through him the word of God
{370}
was completed. Through him the whole matter of christianity was completed, because to him were given the ministry of the glad tidings, the ministry of reconciliation, the ministry of the mystery and other ministries. So that the gospel by Luke was not complete; the completion is in the second treatise. John the baptist is only brought in incidentally in the record in the Acts, and what came out was that those who followed John and took up what he gave out were incomplete. They had to be baptised and to receive the Holy Spirit. And it is constantly seen that in the pursuance of christianity there is great incompleteness, generally, and a constant need of adding and of coming back to what we have overlooked. Hence the moral importance of connecting these two parts of Scripture is evident. What we get in @Luke 24, while bringing in the heavenly side in the shining garments, is but a preliminary suggestion. What was in the mind of heaven was to set up things at Jerusalem; they were not to depart from it until they were endued with power from on high. Therefore @Acts 1 brings out not only the great facts of the resurrection and ascension but of the coming in of the Spirit. It was to overcome and adjust and amend all that was needed to establish christianity. That is really what is in mind in the book of Acts.
F.N.W. Would there be instruction in Luke's use of words? In @Luke 24 He was "separated from them", and in @Acts 1 it says that He "was taken up" from them.
J.T. That is good. The truth of the mystery would not be while He was separated. All that is important and it awaited Paul to adjust everything. Christianity was there in power yet there was continual need for adjustment and adding to the completeness of what had been received. That runs on even now for there is constant evidence of incompleteness in ministry and in state of soul amongst the saints.
{371}
R.W.S. Where in point of time would Rebecca leave Sarah's tent and have her own place?
J.T. I do not think you get that in the type. We are dealing with types in referring to Rebecca, and Sarah's tent. I do not think we could find the thing in the type, because Sarah was not raised. She was buried. The question is how far the time would extend till the Jewish position was given up and the christian position accepted and recognised. I think it was by the epistle to the Hebrews; that is to say, it was to become a question of revelation, and the revelation was to be through Paul, to show that he completed everything. "He is an elect vessel unto me", the Lord said, and the completion of things was in abeyance until he arrived and then things were adjusted. And now, the question is as to how far we have gone in the adjustment, and how slow we are at times to come into the completion of the truth.
A.B.P. Would the fact that the epistle to the Hebrews was written to those whom he was not especially commissioned to serve, be the reason why he does not identify himself as the writer, as though he did not publicly or officially encroach on Peter's domain?
J.T. That might be. The introduction to the letter says, "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son". He does not say a word about his apostleship, and I suppose that is because of the delicacy that enters into it. But there can be no doubt that Paul was the apostle who wrote it. The internal facts, the substance of the letter show that he was the writer; in fact, Peter refers to it when he says, "Our beloved brother Paul also has written to you". He recognised that Paul had come in, and that it was necessary for him to come in, although he had not received the commission to the circumcision. Yet,
{372}
morally he rose above all that, and God used him to adjust and settle the whole matter of judaism.
C.F.E. Would these two men in white be on the fine of adjustment? "Why do ye stand looking into heaven?".
J.T. I think they were. Being clothed in white would give them moral authority; indeed it is the case at all times that along with the ministry there is the great need of asserting purity.
A.R. There may be a tendency with us to be religious instead of spiritual.
J.T. Just so; although we must not overlook that James says, "Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world", @James 1: 27. That is what we have alluded to in the idea of whiteness; both in Mark and in the Acts there is suggested the need of whiteness, of purity, in the ministry.
T.N.W. Was there nothing for the flames of fire in @Acts 2 to consume?
J.T. I should say that is right; there was not a thing there to be consumed. I think the matter was set up in perfection, as far as it went, on the moral side.
Rem. Stephen fixed his eyes on heaven, but the disciples were asked by the two men, "Why do ye stand looking into heaven?".
J.T. That is good. Stephen really became the test case, and the truth henceforth would be linked with heaven. He lifted up his eyes to heaven and "saw ... Jesus standing at the right hand of God". Hebrews has often been referred to as the book of the opened heavens. It synchronises with Stephen. It is a question of what is in heaven now, and that we are going into it and are being prepared for it now. So that the shining was proper with Stephen. Paul was there; he was a witness. He was not shining, alas,
{373}
but the facts come out how quickly he was taken up and how quickly he became useful, and how quickly he became suitable for the work the Lord had in mind for him. He was an elect vessel unto the Lord.
A.R. First you have a "sound out of heaven" (@Acts 2: 2), and then a sheet descending from heaven in chapter 10.
J.T. That is in keeping with what we are saying. The sheet from heaven had certain contents. It was a "certain vessel" in the form of the sheet, knit at the four corners; it was held together. It is a further thought of a vessel. Paul was to be a vessel, but the sheet was a vessel too, inclusive of what was in the mind of God.
C.A.M. Would you say that in the end of Luke the disciples were occupied with a divine Person going into heaven from a place where He had been known and loved, but in @Acts 1 when they returned to Jerusalem they were expecting another divine Person? And the location is called the mount of Olives. Does not that designation couple the thought of the Spirit's coming with heaven?
J.T. I am sure that is the thought that enters into the mount of Olives. The term would indicate the Holy Spirit in the sense of the anointing, I would think. That was needed. That was not at Bethany in @Luke 24. Love was at Bethany, but more than love is needed to bring out the full thought of christianity; that is to say, the Spirit is needed, and the mount of Olives would point to that, I would think, so that you can hardly avoid taking into account the geographical position. On the other hand it is a question how far it should be taken into account-whether our minds should admit of any difference -- because there is only one ascension, and what happened in @Acts 1, as associated with Olivet, is the same thing that happened in @Luke 24 in relation to Bethany.
{374}
C.A.M. Might not the Holy Spirit be anticipating a certain flexibility in our spiritual apprehension of things to make room for Paul?
J.T. That is a good way to put it, because flexibility is a very important word in regard to divine things. It means that we are capable of extension, expansion of things, and yet they are not altered in being expanded. The same idea is to carry through.
C.A.M. What you are saying gives us a key to the understanding of the end of Luke and @Acts 1.
Rem. In @Mark 13 the Lord sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple and taught His disciples.
J.T. That also would enter into what we are saying. The buildings had been made much of by the disciples: "See what stones and what buildings", they had said. The house that was built at Jerusalem was a very great affair. It was magnificent, but the Lord says, "Not a stone shall be left upon a stone", which is a most remarkable thing. The Lord said that and went to the mount of Olives. That would point to what the servants should understand and how they should speak of things and the power that is needed for it, in the sense of purity, and at the same time, in the spirit of the anointing.
F.H.L. Would you say that the Person is in view in @Acts 1: 6? The place is not mentioned until verse 12.
J.T. Yes. They returned to Jerusalem from the mount called "the mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey off". The geographical position is not so extensive as one might at first think. The distance to Bethany was fifteen stadia and would probably be nearly twice as far as to the mount of Olives, but really it was a very short distance. It would be less than two miles, and the other is called a "sabbath day's journey", which would be about half the distance to Bethany. It is a question
{375}
of our understanding what that means. It is a question of the journey that one might take on the sabbath.
C.A.M. The journey would be a spiritual idea?
J.T. It would. A sabbath day's journey would include judaism, but properly it does not when you come to christianity.
C.A.M. The sabbath day's journey is over, is it not?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Whiteness speaks of purity. In @Matthew 28: 3 the clothing of the angel at the tomb was as white as snow. Would that enhance the thought of purity?
J.T. And a certain amount of terror would be attached to it, because Matthew is more exacting and severe on judaism than Luke is. And so Matthew records that the Lord linked on with the disciples in Galilee. It is the idea of distance.
R.W.S. The disciples came back, in @Acts 1: 13 "And when they were come into the city, they went up to the upper chamber". Had they not morally taken a sabbath day's journey out of Jerusalem?
J.T. I would say that; that is the position we are in now. It was where the Lord's supper was inaugurated. I would say the basis of it all is the Lord's supper. It is a question of where the service of God links on.
D.A.P. Was heaven now to become the new operative centre and the disciples had to come to see that?
J.T. That is right. The upper room would dislodge from the mind all thought of religious architecture. Our minds need to be disabused of thoughts of religious architecture of every kind, even if it be the place in which we meet. The upper room is intended, I believe, to do that. It is but a step into heaven from the upper room. Anyone who attends a cathedral is hardly fit to go into heaven. Certainly there is a journey from a cathedral to heaven, but the upper
{376}
room is, you might say, the suitable place for the christian. It is out of sight religiously; it has no pretension religiously. The value of it is in what it contains; it is where the disciples were.
A.N.W. When the sabbath day's journey is over it would be the first day of the week. The temple is in @Luke 24, but the upper room is in @Acts 1.
A.B.P. Does all this link on with the thought of departing which Moses and Elias spoke with Jesus about on the mount of transfiguration? Would their testimony link on with the testimony of the two sets of two men of whom we have been speaking?
J.T. It would; the two men in @Luke 24 were in shining raiment, and the two men in @Acts 1 were in white. On the mount of transfiguration Moses and Elias appear in glory; which would be power. It is well to analyse these three pairs of persons. I think they synchronise. You can see that those on the mount of transfiguration were speaking of the Lord's departure which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem; that is, His death. The word really is exodus; a going out. It is the way the Lord Jesus was to go out, and they were speaking about that with Him, which is to be noted. So that we can see how these three pairs of persons link on together and synchronise in what they are engaged with.
A.R. In each instance Luke calls them men, full development. Paul's ministry would bring about full growth in all of us.
J.T. Very good.
F.N.W. It is His departure in Luke. Would you say it is our departure with Him in @John 13? He was about to depart out of this world to the Father but He has others in mind.
J.T. I think that the Lord did not have in mind that they were going into heaven, but that they were to be down here with their feet washed. It links up with @John 20, for in John's gospel, generally, it is the
{377}
continuance of the testimony here in suitable conditions, in life. John's thought is not to take us to heaven but rather that Christ goes to heaven; He ascends; He has the dignity to do that; He has a right to do that according to His dignity. The disciples linked up with Him as His brethren, are to continue here for Him. I believe that is the position.
G.V.D. Is that the reason why the Lord prayed not that they would be taken out but kept from the evil in the world?
J.T. Just so. Therefore, He says to the Father, "Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth". That is the position. The power of sanctification is the continuance of purity and heavenly shining.
F.H.L. Is the upper room on the level of the mount of Olives?
J.T. It is. The actual upper room was on a street in Jerusalem, but morally it was out of the world.
F.H.L. Is it the same room to which they followed the man with the pitcher of water?
J.T. I think so. So that ecclesiastical architecture is shut out entirely. The upper room shuts that out. There would just be a room; there must be a place of meeting, but it is a question of where the disciples are.
Ques. Would it be right to say that every bit of ministry we receive is part of the whole? It is not an appendix, something that is added.
J.T. That is right; it is one whole. Christianity is one whole and the truth of christianity is one whole. The Lord speaks of Himself as the truth and in John's ministry in his epistles it is a question of love of the truth. There is only one 'truth', it is one whole. It must be according to the truth that was at the beginning. John's epistle begins with that.
A.Pf. How does @Acts 13 fit into this? It was at Antioch that the apostle Paul taught at first.
{378}
J.T. It shows that God could have another place; that He has a right to have His assembly in any place, and so the two letters to Corinth are addressed to "the assembly of God which is in Corinth". That is yet another place, but it indicates how free God was in inaugurating things, and taking up towns or cities as He may wish; and so He took up Corinth. If the natural man were to make a selection, he would have passed by Corinth and taken up Athens because Athens was the place of learning, but God took up Corinth. He says, "I have much people in this city". It evidently was a terrible place, and the saints themselves were affected by the place, but God chose to set the testimony there.
Ques. The Lord introduces the thought of power.
He says, "Ye will receive power". He turns them from the kingdom to the matter of power. Is that characteristic of Christianity?
J.T. He says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth". It is good to bring that up. We have spoken about purity and holiness, but the one thing that was needed was power, and that is in the Spirit. His coming upon them is seen in @Acts 2, the wonderful power that came in from heaven. The sound out of heaven filled the house where they were sitting.
D.A.P. When did the faith system come into operation?
J.T. Let us see where it begins here: "And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of their sight". That is when the faith system began. It had been a sight system, as it will be in the millennium, but now it
{379}
is a faith system. He was received out of their sight, and the two men in white ask, "Why do ye stand looking into heaven?". The cloud had received Him out of their sight, so that faith must replace sight. Therefore we are in the faith period. That is in mind in @Galatians 3: 26: "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus". We are sons by faith.
Rem. Christianity in that way takes precedence over judaism.
J.T. It does. Christianity is a faith system. It is the greatest of all the dispensations, too.
F.S.C. Would you say why the disciples are called "Men of Galilee"?
J.T. I think it is to show the reproach that was attached to them. They were not the learned men from Jerusalem. Christianity did not depend on that. They were Galileans; men would recognise them by their accent; they were not of the Greek class, as men might speak. Christianity, publicly, soon developed into a system of education, with colleges and universities, but it did not begin with that. The apostles were men of Galilee.
A.R. Receiving power would suggest that they would do things. Did not Peter and John, particularly, have ability to do things?
J.T. That is just what is said: "Ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses". That word 'power' is in the dynamic sense. There are two ideas in power; one is in the sense of authority or right, but the other is in the sense of literal power. Both of these attach to Christianity, literal power in the Spirit, as well as authority.
Ques. Is a principle set out by the Lord in leading the disciples out as far as Bethany?
J.T. It says, "As far as Bethany". One is reminded of Paul's words, "Caught up to the third heaven".
{380}
The thought there is 'as far as', it is altitude, and so He led them as far as Bethany, meaning that the Lord would continue with the Jewish system, as it was needed, but it was not the final thought. The disciples were in the temple but that was not to be permanent. It was just for the moment. The mount of Olives represents what was in the Lord's mind, involving the Spirit; Bethany would not involve the Spirit. It is a question of love in the family at Bethany. The land of Canaan was in God's mind, and He will come back to that, but now He has gone as far as the ends of the earth.
A.P. With regard to flexibility in learning, do we see it when Aquila and Priscilla took Apollos and taught him the way of God more exactly? Apollos was ready to learn.
J.T. That is good; and so the apostle enlarges on that in his instruction to Timothy. "Occupy thyself with these things; be wholly in them, that thy progress may be manifest to all". Each one of us is to have before him that we have not yet reached finality: we are in the learning time. And I believe John's writings, especially his gospel, are to stress the idea of learning, and learning quickly. Nicodemus did not learn quickly; he was a learner and a true man, but he was sluggish; he did not get on rapidly.
R.W.S. Is there some connection with the fact that the Lord had led the disciples out to the mount of Olives after they had sung a hymn? In @Acts 1 they return from the mount of Olives to the upper room. It would be the same way over which the Lord had taken them.
J.T. They went back to the upper room; the place where the disciples were, where they could carry on divine education and learn from one another, giving themselves to continual prayer. All these things are in the upper room in principle.
{381}
Ques. What enabled these persons to differentiate between the temple and the upper room? The Spirit had not yet come.
J.T. It shows how extensive the work of God in the new birth may be. See how much Peter can do now, and only a little while ago he had denied the Lord. He does it of himself, for the Holy Spirit had not yet come. It is to bring out what the Lord's own word was to the disciples before the Spirit came. And yet it was not final. Peter knew what to say and do before the Lord sent down the Spirit. They proposed to cast lots and the principle was accepted. It is remarkable how much they had learned from the Lord before the Spirit came.
C.A.M. We are not all quick learners. Perhaps we will be from now on, but we have not been. It was many years ago that you brought out that the upper room is a moral idea. We are not very quick in getting hold of a moral idea.
J.T. It is remarkable how the brethren have been helped in getting suitable places in which to meet. A meeting room is necessary for serving the Lord in the wilderness.
C.A.M. It would seem that the best rooms are on the ground floor so that the upper room must be a moral idea.
J.T. Just so; it would be unwise to say we must build three stories so that you can have an upper room. We want to be constituted morally and be able to adapt ourselves.
R.W.S. Why is the breaking of bread in the early Acts connected with the house and not the upper room?
J.T. It is to bring out the family thought. It had not fully developed yet, because it awaited Paul, as everything had to. I believe the family was in mind; where a man might live and have his family. But when we come to the formation and ordering of things, Paul
{382}
says, "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God?". Of course Aquila and Priscilla had a place in their house for a meeting, and the epistle to Philemon alludes to "the assembly which is in thine house", but clearly the mind of the Spirit was that, normally, there should be a place formally arranged for the brethren to meet without any family interference or influence.
{383}
PRIESTHOOD
@Isaiah 61: 10; @Exodus 21: 1 - 6; @Exodus 28: 1 - 3
From these scriptures it is intended to speak about priesthood. It is stated in Scripture that the prophets were holy men, that is, that they were priests, priests unto God. Two of them at least were official priests, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, but undoubtedly they were all priests characteristically, the word having in mind the service of God, those who come near to Him.
This passage in @Isaiah 61 is referred to and spoken of by the Spirit as if the idea of priesthood was understood and not at all unfamiliar or unused. It is here said of the bridegroom that he "decketh himself with the priestly turban". The idea is to attach to all christians, for Peter says that we are "a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2: 5. So we are regarded, that is to say, christians characteristically, as identified with the priesthood and qualified to exercise priesthood, and we are called priests, not only a holy priesthood but a royal priesthood.
This leads me to Exodus, so that the thought in mind may be clear. Aaron was not designated a priest immediately, nor were his sons, showing that it is not a common idea as applicable to christians; it is an idea that is to be developed into what is characteristic of us. Aaron, although brought into the service with his brother, being three years older than his brother, is not immediately called a priest. This is significant. He is called a prophet, showing that prophetic ministry may not be just up to the mark of priesthood. Aaron was called a prophet before he was called a priest. As regards his sons, they were called priests in relation to him. They were called priests because they were his sons, and this is intelligible in its antitypical sense,
{384}
because our priesthood, that is christian priesthood, stands in relation to Christ, and involves our family relations with Christ. Thus it is an exalted position.
Whilst Aaron was not called a priest immediately, yet the idea was there in Israel, the persons being nameless, as if the service of God must have something of the kind. So we have the thought of priesthood in @Exodus 19, "the priests also, who come near to Jehovah", but they are nameless. That would indicate that the true thought of the priest was hardly there, except in the sense that there must be something like it in the service. Israel was already regarded as a people; they had come out of Egypt, they were to be a holy priesthood to God, that is, in a national sense, but that is hardly up to what we are speaking of.
As I said, Aaron is not called a priest until he is typically equal to it. What is needful in this great function is love. Priesthood is hardly intelligible without love. So before Aaron is called priest, before his sons are called priests, the Hebrew bondman comes into evidence-the Hebrew bondman, for there is really only One in the sense in which we are speaking of it, and it relates thus to the Lord Jesus, who is our Priest. He is our Priest, and He is our great Priest, and our High Priest. All that can be said of priesthood is said of Him. So the idea of priesthood is connected with Aaron in @Exodus 28. Before this a great deal is said about Aaron, much more about Moses, and more particularly that they served. They both belong to a system before Aaron is called a priest. God said to Moses, "I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet" (@Exodus 7: 1), as if God would come down to our level, yet retaining His infinite holiness and dignity, for He comes down in Christ. It is said, "Who humbleth himself to look on the heavens and on the earth", @Psalm 113: 6. He comes down to our level, that is, in the sense of making Himself intelligible to us; for, if
{385}
God is pleased to come into a system, and He is, then He would make Himself intelligible to men in that system. So He says to Moses, "I have made thee God to Pharaoh". One is touched that the Lord should even extend His thoughts to man's intelligence, and this must be shown if the gospel is to be understood. To those who are unconverted it can be very little understood, but it must be understood by man if it is to reach him. God gave to man an intelligence to understand something of Himself. So it is that God granted to Adam the privilege of naming the cattle. The cattle are named by Adam; hence it is that Adam is given to know that he has the means of at least understanding something of God. The gospel is announced to men; it is announced to all creation, not only creatures but all creation, so it is within the range of all and all are responsible. Hence the idea of a system in Exodus in view of God's taking out a people, and He names the people He has taken out, His son, a very precious thought; "Let my son go, that he may serve me", @Exodus 4: 23. The priesthood was in mind, and sonship was in mind, and Pharaoh was to understand that sonship was in mind. God said, 'If you do not let My son go, I will slay your son'. It was perfectly intelligible to Pharaoh that God meant that. He had only a short time to prove that his son would be slain.
God is spreading abroad His knowledge, as Paul says, that His knowledge should be made known through him in every place. "For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish: to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life", @2 Corinthians 2: 15, 16. It is fraught with love and mercy too, for God went as far as to spare some of the cattle of Pharaoh's people and some of the cereals and some of the vegetables, for the position is marked by mercy. If God is to be known in mercy He is to be known by
{386}
persons who thoroughly understand, and these persons are in the system and under the system and operating together. The system must be maintained and that system rests in the thought of the assembly, the great idea in the assembly being, "we, being many, are one loaf, one body", @1 Corinthians 10: 17. So, as I said, the system was there in Egypt in the presence of Pharaoh, and God says of Pharaoh,'He is going down to the river tomorrow, you go and stand in front of him'. That is how God treated Pharaoh, face to face, in his presence. So we are called upon to be open and transparent and fair with everyone, especially the powers that be. But Pharaoh was to understand that God had rights in Egypt, particularly that He had His people there and He would go to the length of setting up a system so that His people might be delivered out of Egypt, a holy people, a separate people, a people suitable to Himself, as He says, "a kingly priesthood, a holy nation".
So the thought is extended before it became applicable to the royal priesthood, that is, Aaron and his sons. The thought was there that God should have a people and a priesthood, persons specially near to Him too. Presently all will be near to Him. In our own case God has borne us on eagles¬ wings and brought us to Himself. We need not fear the idea of the air. God is using it as He is using water, and intelligent people would accept that and see what God affords. But I am speaking now of the power by which we are brought to Him. The power is in God Himself, only He uses the figure of wings of eagles. "I have borne you on eagles¬ wings and brought you to myself". All this was before Aaron was designated priest.
Then we have this thought of love, which is the attractive thought, as I hope all here recognise. It is certainly attractive to me, the love of God and how it is expressed in others, for "Love is of God, and every
{387}
one that loves has been begotten of God, and knows God", @1 John 4: 7. So this matter is found in one who is a slave, for that is what the man is in chapter 21; he was a Hebrew slave. The idea of love was there, so that we are not to assume it is beyond us, for it is placed in the very lowliest person, a person most accessible. He speaks of it in a threefold way. He plainly says, "I love". "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free". Then he suffers in that. It is hardly right to speak about love unless we bring in the idea of suffering. Love is a great suffering power in man. So this servant, this slave, says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free". We are now, dear brethren, alongside the Lord Jesus.
I wish to extend the idea of priesthood to every one of us. Love is the power of it, and hence it is not spoken of in Aaron and his sons until chapter 28. Chapter 29 also deals with it. Other scriptures deal with it at length, and particularly @1 Corinthians 13, which is a description of love, not in the persons but in the thing abstractly. We are not to be afraid of the abstract idea, for God would reduce things to the abstract idea so that we should understand it applies to ourselves. Even if we are not noteworthy, by the Spirit of God there is something there of God in us. New birth is taken account of by itself in Scripture, and carries with it the idea of birth, although the word in @John 3 is "from above", born from above. So the abstract idea in us becomes very intelligible and very applicable. The thing that is involved in the birth carries with it all its qualities, and if we are not born anew we are nothing, we are not christians at all. We may as well face this, because it is the great fundamental principle of God's work in men, never applying to any others than men. The Lord says, "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God", @John 3: 3. That shows there
{388}
is very little to be taken in by the natural man, although we are still responsible. Though not born anew, man is still responsible and, having heard the gospel preached, will go to the lake of fire if he does not believe. The Lord says, "Except any one be born anew"; his intelligence is reduced to a minimum. The person is responsible, his eyes are opened and his feelings become touched and he is conscious of what is of God. Even if he is sitting in the company of christians, though not a christian, he is conscious he is near to God. "God is indeed amongst you",
@1 Corinthians 14: 25. Hence a person amongst christians is near to God. His people are set in the very midst, so that man might know God is near to them. "He is not far from each one of us", @Acts 17: 27. How much more so when a person is set down in the midst of the Lord's people! So new birth is possible, and, if any feelings arise as amongst the Lord's people, new feelings that you have not had before, there is some warmth. There is evidence that you are born anew. It is not your heart, or your mind, but your self that is born anew, the whole being.
Paul says he has laid the foundation of a great structure, that is, the greatest order of people, christians called priests, holy priests and royal priests. They are holy, in the sense of being capable of drawing near to God, having to do with Him, speaking about Him; and royal in a public way to "set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light", @1 Peter 2: 9.
I am earnest to bring this point in, so that we may see how priesthood is set. Its setting is love. It is a question of God. We have to trace love to God.
"God is love", we are told. So it is that Aaron is reserved, as if God would say, 'I will set a prophet near to Pharaoh, My prophet to your king. I will place in his hands the means of reaching him. It will be only himself to blame if he is not reached'.
{389}
So the system was set up before him in Moses, who was to be "God to Pharaoh". Is he God? No, he is not deified, he is a creature, but the idea of God may extend down to persons who are judges, persons who form judgments, and in the sense that Moses was God to Pharaoh, he certainly was one who could judge Pharaoh. He says, "I will see thy face again no more!".
@Exodus 10: 29. He went out in a glowing anger (chapter 11: 8), showing the authority he had as representing what God is. The devil said to Adam and Eve, "Ye will be as God", @Genesis 3: 5. That is not the idea of God we are speaking of now; it is sons and representatives, christians in this world indwelt by the Spirit of God. That does not deify them, but makes them representative of God. God said to Moses, "What is that in thy hand?". It was a staff, what he would use in following after the sheep. God says, 'That is what I am going to use'. "The staff that is in my hand", He says (@Exodus 7: 17). Moses was so representative of God that the very rod that he had in his hand was said to be in the hand of Jehovah. How serious it was for Pharaoh! Pharaoh and his horsemen were destroyed.
Now I want to speak of Aaron's wonderful garments. I suppose no such garments were found anywhere in any setting as the garments of Aaron and his sons. The turban, I believe, denoted the intelligence, the remarkable authority connected with Aaron. Moral authority is linked up with priesthood, and that must be connected with intelligence. God has given us power to know, and the authority that goes with knowledge, the knowledge of God, the knowledge that develops in connection with the Spirit of God. There are no persons comparable to christians. "We have the mind of Christ", @1 Corinthians 2: 16. It is the thinking faculty, speaking reverently, of the Lord Jesus, and hence the great moral authority that attaches to us, and the great moral dignity to exercise
{390}
us in our service. The bridegroom in Isaiah "decketh himself with the priestly turban". I suppose there is only one. It belonged to a certain class. This bridegroom decks himself, adorns himself. We have immediately the bride as well, Christ and the assembly, because He is the One who decks Himself with the priestly turban. There was something peculiar about Aaron's head-dress, with the lace of blue over it. I am attempting to extend the passage in Isaiah to show there is designation in it to Christ. "As a bridegroom decketh himself with the priestly turban, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels". We may read Christ and the assembly into it. We belong to the assembly and there are garments suitable to the bride. She comes "down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", @Revelation 21:2.
So the garments of @Exodus 28 are full of glory. I leave it with you, so that we may all absorb the idea of priesthood. Much enters into it, and God waited for the time till Aaron would be fit for it. So it is with all things; the time arrives when we enter into it. We have the idea of priesthood now, Christ in heaven, the High Priest, the Spirit of God on earth.
The Spirit on earth is equal to the Priest above. The position is impregnable. It is a question of Christ above. He has to do with the forgiveness of sins, but the Spirit brings about a state suitable. "As he is, we also are in this world", @1 John 4: 17. These are wonderful things. They are worth all our closest attention, so that we might see how the matter stands now in view of our translation. We are to be translated from our present position, from a potential position into a position where everything is royal. We are to be transformed into the likeness of His body of glory, that is what Paul says (@Philippians 3: 21). John says, "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", @1 John 3: 2.
{391}
ABIGAIL AS TYPE OF THE ASSEMBLY
@1 Samuel 25: 14 - 19, 32, 33, 39 - 42
J.T. Abigail, as the brethren will know, is one of the types of the assembly in the Old Testament, and perhaps one of the most important. The prophetic ministry is in mind in this book, because Samuel, it is said, died. In view of the death of Samuel, who represents the prophetic side of the truth, David and Abigail come into view as in a sense replacing Samuel. The prophetic ministry has a great place now in connection with the assembly, and the assembly is in mind as the thought completed, the mind of God reached. Paul says it was given to him to complete the word of God, and he pre-eminently stands for the truth of the assembly.
The types begin with Eve herself, as of course most of us know, but it is of importance that we should also consider the types of Christ in conjunction with the types of the assembly. And so we have in Adam a type involving intelligence, which will be the truth entering into John's ministry where things are named as representing life. Then in Isaac we have a type of Christ as one having peculiar characteristics, as possessing leisure time, in order to do the part of a husband towards Rebecca. The assembly is to be understood in this way in Christ taking a wife, as seen in type in Isaac taking a wife. The types require that a man taking a new wife should have a year free from special cares, and so we see Isaac as a man of leisure, as over against Joseph who was a man of great care, a man of affairs. Zipporah on the other hand (not to speak specially now about Joseph's wife) comes in as a type of the assembly connected with Moses who represents the great feature of Christ's administration.
{392}
Then we come to David as the great military man in type, representing kingly rule and military power. So that Abigail as his wife becomes peculiarly distinguished as a type of the assembly. She is seen as like David in her characteristics, a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance, her good understanding coming out particularly here in the way she meets the great emergency that had arisen in Nabal so as to make way for David, to make way for Christ. She is informed as to what is needed and she acts on information, pointing to administrative ability based on information received. It is not what is observed but what is heard, corresponding with Matthew where we have the great thought of hearing the assembly. The assembly ears are a feature, having keen hearing. And so David says to Abigail, "Blessed be thy discernment". She is a discerning person. All this is needed for assembly care.
H.D. The assembly ears are a necessary feature for us all, are they not?
J.T. That is what I thought. We read of certain things coming to the ears of the assembly. Here a great disaster was impending but Abigail's hearing from her servant and acting on it saved the position.
-.D. "He that has an ear ...". Would that meet this question?
J.T. I think it would. "Let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".
-.P. Is it in mind in all administrative matters in the assembly that the principle of adequate testimony must be present?
J.T. I would say that. That is the principle that is stressed in Matthew, which as we know is the gospel that affords special instruction for the assembly. So chapter 18 furnishes instruction as to where the assembly would have to act. It is peculiarly necessary to have testimony.
{393}
-.P. And the testimony is based on what is observed rather than what is heard?
J.T. Testimony must be based on two or three witnesses. And although there is only one witness here, what Abigail does is to evade the need of disciplinary action. It is a question of food, and therefore she immediately acts as she receives the information. "One of Nabal's young men", we read, "told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master; and he has insulted them. And the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we companied with them, when we were in the fields. They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them feeding the sheep. And now know and consider what thou wilt do, for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household; and he is such a son of Belial, that one cannot speak to him. And Abigail made haste ...". That is, she acted on information that was evidently right. Abigail made haste, "and took two hundred loaves, and two skin-bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred raisin-cakes, and two hundred fig-cakes". So that she meets the situation with food.
W.W. Does it seem that the young man was sympathetic with David and with Abigail? I mean the young man who informed Abigail of the position.
J.T. He is sympathetic with his mistress, Abigail, because he tells her what had happened and how disaster was impending and that he knew what the character of Nabal was. So although she would have known it, she would be confirmed in what he told her. It is characteristic, or should be so, of anyone in the assembly if danger is impending to inform those in responsibility. What is to be brought out now is what the assembly is in the way of influence for good,
{394}
and influence which would lead to the avoidance of unnecessary damage. That is to say, the assembly is here in this sense that things are to be looked after without unnecessary damage, because nothing is done to Nabal except what God does. God acts against Nabal. Abigail does not. She says certain things as to Nabal which were true but the whole position is left in the hands of God, and she is influencing David against taking an action which might be damaging generally. That, I think, is the thing to be observed in the instruction, because information received might be listened to and acted upon with undue haste, or on the other hand with undue patience. We need to act wisely. And so it is that Abigail acts wisely, meeting the need of David's young men and saving bloodshed. Here David is below the level, we might say, of the responsible element. He would have acted hastily but she dissuades him from it. That is what the instruction would convey to us, and it is very important instruction, because we might act hastily on receiving certain information and do damage.
C.E.T. Would the report of those of the house of Chloe in @1 Corinthians 1 perhaps be something like this?
J.T. Quite so. And there is the report, too, that was general in chapter S. There are two reports referred to in that epistle, one from the house of Chloe, the other was general. What was needed in the assembly at Corinth was a general intervention to deal with wickedness. The general report was that there was evil in the assembly and it was not acted upon; they were puffed up, the apostle says. But there was nothing of that kind with Abigail or her servants. She was calm and quiet, and provided what was needed. Here the danger was that David would act hastily against Nabal, against the insult, and Abigail provided food to steady the position and to prevent bloodshed, to prevent unnecessary damage.
{395}
G.C.B. Would she suggest the true shepherd spirit?
J.T. I think so. She was wise and cautious. The information she received was undoubtedly right, but she discerned that it would lead to bloodshed; it would lead to disaster against her house, for she was part of Nabal's house yet. The whole household was in danger, whereas the only one who should have been affected or disciplined was Nabal himself.
Ques. Does she correspond with the word in the third epistle of John, "Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good"? Does Abigail not shine in that, not only not imitating evil but positively doing good? I was thinking of her action in providing food. Is not that a characteristic of the assembly?
J.T. Quite so.
W.R. We see the feature of haste with Abigail; this matter requires haste, but balance goes with it. Are these two features we have to bear in mind?
J.T. Yes, there should be balance. So that everything is to be weighed according to @Matthew 18, "That in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established". That is what Paul introduces, too, at Corinth. It is because there is so much danger of extremeness and want of balance in such matters, and personal prejudices, too. So that the truth in the passage is undoubtedly typical. It is illustrative of how the types may be used in discipline. It is clear that when discipline is needed, the final word should first be considered, the final word from God as to any point. We should begin with the latest information, the latest light we have. And so if an action of discipline is taken up and executed on the basis of an Old Testament scripture there may be great danger of damage because we must go by the apostles. It says, "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles", @Acts 2: 42. The latest word in regard of dealing with a thing is from
{396}
the apostles. Their epistles are the latest word we have from the Lord.
W.W. That would be confirmed in the apostle's word in @1 Corinthians 14: "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment".
J.T. That is very good. It has often come to one's mind. It is in the singular, as you know, so that the whole epistle is in mind, the Lord's commandment. So that if anything comes up, well, what does this epistle say about the matter? Because that should have the first consideration in assembly discipline.
J.W.W. Has the passage in @Hebrews 10 speaking of one who has insulted the Spirit of grace any connection with this? "I will recompense, saith the Lord". And it goes on to speak of those who suffer loss and how the Lord will take it up.
J.T. Quite so. And also in @Romans 12, "I will recompense, saith the Lord". But when we have something that is incumbent on the assembly, then, of course, we go by the facts relative to that, and Matthew is the feature of Scripture that deals with the truth of assembly discipline, that the assembly has authority. And then 1 Corinthians would be confirmatory of that, because it is the Lord's commandment which we are to recognise.
W.W. Is that where this question of discernment comes in? David says to Abigail, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me. And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed". The Lord would give discernment, would He not?
J.T. He would. And another thing is that the authority of the assembly must be based on the truth. It sometimes happens that a local assembly will act rashly and not according to the truth; the fact that
{397}
an assembly acts is not in itself conclusive, because the truth must be involved. And so it was that in 1889 an important matter of doctrine was before the saints and a certain assembly in this country acted contrary to the truth of that doctrine but claimed that as it was an action of the assembly its action must be recognised. Whereas it was not according to truth and caused a tremendous loss to the saints. So here Abigail is acting, but she is acting according to truth. She makes much of David. Although her influence was to dissuade David from something he had in mind, yet she was recognising him in the remarks she makes. And so she says (verse 25), "Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; and I thy handmaid did not see the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. And now, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah has restrained thee from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal". So that she is thoroughly right as to the whole point. She is right as to the condition of Nabal and as to his conduct towards David. And so she proceeds, "And now this blessing which thy bondmaid has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men that follow my lord. I pray thee, forgive the transgression of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a lasting house". That is to say, she is thoroughly with the truth. "Because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil has not been found in thee all thy days. And if a man is risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out from the hollow of the sling. And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall do to my lord according to all the
{398}
good that he has spoken concerning thee, and shall appoint thee ruler over Israel, that this shall be no stumbling-block to thee". She is persuading David rightly but at the same time asserting the full truth both as to him and his house. So that whatever action is taken it is to be based not simply on any authority the assembly might have but on the truth. What is done is to be according to truth.
Ques. Does the food in this connection suggest the grace with which everything should be done, even in discipline?
J.T. I would say that. And the action is supported. Whatever action is done according to truth it is supported by food, food being an evidence of grace, and Abigail furnishes that.
J.C. Is Abigail here seeking to maintain peace, you might say, through the truth?
J.T. That is the point. Truth is asserted, as well as bloodshed avoided.
E.D. That is the way she handles the truth and uses the truth.
J.T. It shows that she was of good understanding.
It is her character: she understands. And she was of a beautiful countenance. A beautiful countenance of itself would not succeed, but good understanding with it does succeed. Paul says to Timothy, "Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding". We are to consider what is said. The apostolic authority and Paul's doctrine are to be maintained in matters of discipline.
J.W.W. Would you say she was also characterised by faith? She believed the report and she was an accredited witness.
J.T. Very good. So our care meetings are of great importance. The Lord has given them a place which earlier had been taken by eldership. Eldership is right in its place, but we have the care meeting, that is the care of the brethren, the use of the word 'care'
{399}
being attached to what we call meetings-care meetings. And what Abigail does is in accordance with that; it is in accordance with truth. Eldership is of course ordained for the care of the assembly in @Acts 14. That is where we get it first, where the apostles Paul and Barnabas chose elders in each assembly. Whereas earlier the assembly was governed by a metropolitan system. The apostles and elders came together of course, and it was right, but in more recent times God is blessing these care meetings which are held now almost everywhere amongst the brethren, especially as the younger men are brought into them.
F.P. The young men here get food out of this.
J.T. Quite so. That would mean that the food here is understood as supporting strength. As well as indicating grace, food is needed for strength in carrying out discipline.
G.C.B. Is there a special interest in the care meetings on the part of the sisters at home?
J.T. They should ask their husbands at home and find out what has been done. And they should be with them and show their sympathy with them, not having personal feelings about any matter, because sisters as wives are apt to be affected according to the way their husbands are treated. Whereas the truth should govern them.
J.W.W. John writes in his second epistle to "the elect lady".
J.T. Yes, I often wonder about the elect lady. It is very like what was said to Theophilus by Luke.
John is saying that this woman is an elect lady. Peter too at the end of his first epistle says, "She that is elected with you in Babylon salutes you". We have to understand who the "she" is, but anyway she is greeting the assembly.
M.E. Do the raisin-cakes in verse 18 suggest assembly food, as in the Song of Songs: "Sustain ye me with raisin-cakes"
{400}
J.T. I suppose the element of stimulation is in the raisin. These raisin-cakes would help to stimulate as well as build up as food. I think there is an allusion to this in connection with the young man found in the field in chapter 30 of this book.
-.J. Would you say that every element of food is available to us to maintain the rights of Christ?
J.T. I think that is how it is. We need to be fed, to be built up in our constitutions. We need power to act. The Lord says to Philadelphia, "Thou hast a little power". That arises from food.
-. S. As Abigail was coming down by the covert of the hill, David and his men came down opposite to her.
J.T. They both came down and met on the plain, which would be the principle of mutuality. There is no assertion of special priority in either case. And I think the mutual feeling is in our care meetings, because the young men are allowed a place in them. At the same time the old brethren are there and they have their place, but mutual feeling is now recognised. You notice here that the informer of Abigail is a young man, one of Nabal's young men or servants, and also of course Abigail's servant. There is clearly an assertion of what is right in what Abigail says and does, and what verse 32 shows is that David recognises this. He is carried by it. He says, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me. And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou". So the position is clarified and balanced. And then Nabal is dealt with. Evil is dealt with. God does that. It shows that when things are progressing rightly according to the mind of God and according to truth God comes in for us, which is a feature of the assembly.
F.P. And does it show that the exercise of one person can have a great effect in that regard? This
{401}
young man speaks to Abigail and Abigail speaks to David.
J.T. You have often seen that in your history, I am sure. The influence of one man or one woman. How much influence any one of us can exert for good if we walk rightly.
H.D. What should we gather from Abigail's having all this food available? She had it all ready to use, had she not?
J.T. It is wonderful the food we have now! Although it is largely in books yet it is food. And there is also what is fresh: the weekly and monthly Bible readings and the reading on the Lord's day afternoon, such as the present, are characterised by freshness, so that we have a word from the Lord at any given time. Especially at what we call prophetic meetings where the word of God has its place in a prophetic sense, we have a word for the moment; it may be dealing with a local matter.
W. W. Giving this a local setting, does it not show the importance of the food question bearing on the situation?
J.T. I think we should all be impressed with this, that where there is spiritual food there is sure to be influence, and therefore what we have in ministry becomes influential.
W.W. There may be those amongst us who are able to use what the Lord is giving in the locality as spiritual substance, and that would be a great asset. I was thinking of the meeting for ministry.
J.T. Just so. So that it could be pointed to. Fresh food is bound to be influential.
F.P. Is it not striking that following the Supper in Luke the Lord should speak about the twelve apostles eating and drinking at His table in His kingdom before He speaks about the twelve tribes of Israel?
J.T. So it is in all the references to the Lord's supper in the gospels that you have as a preliminary
{402}
thought that the twelve are there. That is a noticeable thing. The twelve were with Him, it says. Although one of them was Judas, the twelve were there. Hence the authority was there, because twelve refers to the power for administration. And so especially in Luke we have, "When the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him". Not simply the twelve, but the twelve apostles with Him, showing that the Lord had that in mind, that the twelve would be there to deal authoritatively with all matters in connection with the assembly. It was in view, no doubt, of the controversy that would arise, especially in connection with the Lord's supper, because the Lord's supper implies food as well as a memorial.
Ques. What are we to learn from David praising Jehovah at this juncture? He says, "Blessed be Jehovah ... who sent thee ... and blessed be thou". Does the thought of Christ and the assembly come in there?
J.T. It is to eulogise what is in the assembly. The Lord's supper involves eulogy. "The cup of blessing which we bless": you speak well of it. Well, it was right that Abigail should be spoken well of; she had done so well. Why should we not speak well of what is so successful? Therefore David says, "Blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou". Sometimes you hear things discredited because other things can be said, but if a thing is successful according to truth, it is deserving that it should be spoken well of.
Rem. The Lord says to Simon Peter in @Matthew 16, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona".
J.T. Quite so. It is in the sense of eulogy. The Lord said to His disciples, "But ye, who do ye say that I am? And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". Peter
{403}
was coming into a blessing in making such a wonderful confession; he says the right thing.
H.D. There was the recognition with David that Abigail had been sent of Jehovah to meet him.
J.T. Yes, he saw it himself. He came round to it. He would have had recourse to bloodshed but it was not necessary. That reduces David here from the level of the qualities which are a type of Christ.
W.R. It says in the last chapter of Proverbs, "Who can find a woman of worth?".
J.T. Yes, and if you do find her you should eulogise her.
-.P. It is interesting to see that he says this to Abigail herself.
J.T. It shows that we should speak well of one another where it is deserving. We do not want to be flattering one another; flattery is dangerous. But speaking well of one another where this is due is right.
C.E.T. Would @Revelation 21 be something like this? It says in verse 24, "The kings of the earth bring their glory to it". Is that recognising the position?
J.T. Very good. Whatever the nations have is brought to the assembly as in that way honouring it. And so the Lord says to Philadelphia, "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee". That is in keeping with what we are saying now. The "thee" is the assembly, and it is a question of the Lord speaking well of the assembly, that He loves her; and those who say they are Jews, and are not, are serving the enemy; He says of them, "I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet". Not 'my' but "thy" feet, meaning that they are forced to recognise what is there and to revere her.
{404}
Rem. I was wondering whether it would be just to suggest that the assembly coming into view before Christ would stimulate Him in connection with the praise of God.
J.T. Well, quite so, only we must of course make allowance for the fact that David at this particular point was below the level of the qualities of Christ, and Abigail has the advantage because she is the one spoken well of, not David. Although Abigail does speak well of David, too-that he would rule. But David speaks well of her, and he says to her, "Blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou". Surely it is right to bless persons whom God is using. Not to flatter, of course, as I said before, but to bless them.
{405}
"LIGHTS"
@James 1: 17; @Acts 16: 29; @Acts 20: 8
These scriptures speak of "lights", the plural thought, and I wish to speak about them. The subject is in the Bible in @Genesis 1, where it says that God made two lights, a greater and a lesser, the one to rule the day, and the other to rule the night. This dual character of lights from God runs right through His creatorial works, His dispensational movements, and His evangelical service. It will be seen peculiarly in the millennial day, as the heavenly city is seen "coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God", @Revelation 21: 10. She will be resplendent with His glory, and of her, that is, of the assembly, it is said, "night shall not be there", @Revelation 21: 25.
In speaking of @Genesis 1 in this relation it will be seen that we have an allusion in @James 1: 17 to the "Father of lights"; it may be an allusion to the sun, which rules the day, and of which the light is taken on by other bodies. We cannot be too sure, for the word in @Genesis 1 is 'light-bearer', nor do we know of what these bodies are made; yet we can see in the creation the idea of fatherhood, God is the "Father of lights".
It is well worthy of the subjection of our minds to bring the truth into our thoughts. We have the word, therefore, that "God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine" (@2 Corinthians 4: 6), as if He would not leave us in the dark; and so it is, that no one should be in the dark. The question is, for anyone here today, whether he is in darkness. So John says in his first epistle (chapter 2: 8), "The true light already shines". It is the light of God, and of Christ too, as Man in this world. John also says in his gospel, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men", @John 1: 4. Of no other being could that be said; it is true
{406}
of God, of course, and peculiarly true of Christ. "The life was the light of men" means that God has brought it down and focussed it upon men.
Here we are, a goodly number of us, all needing light, and I say it again, "In him [Christ] was life, and the life was the light of men". Paul says, "one died for all, then all have died" (@2 Corinthians 5: 14); the question then is as to life, and the light needed for it. What is stated there is of God, and the thought in one's mind is that, as Christ became Man, life was in Him, but that life was the light of men, of our own family, men; the light of the life of Christ was for men, not angels. This would bring down to us the lowliness of Christ as here amongst men; He did not come to judge, but to save them, and that men might live. So the gospel affords life today, not only because we are in the dark, but because we are men, of that family; and so these gospel meetings are current in this country, and they afford light in every room where they are held, where there may be anyone who has, so to speak, his shutters down. The question is whether he will let the light in, just as the eye is the window of the body and lets in the light of day.
The first word I read speaks of "the Father" coming within our range, that the light should shine for all of us. It shines in certain parts of the earth, you say, but for whom? The Father of lights has considered for His creatures. There "is no variation nor shadow of turning" with Him. It is He "with whom we have to do", @Hebrews 4: 13. He is the Originator of light, and the Father of it; and so it is that light is shining in this room tonight. Christ is not here personally, but the Holy Spirit is here; most of us here are christians, and so it is that the light is shining now, the saints being here. As I look down on your faces I see the light radiating from nearly every one. There may be exceptions; maybe you are the exception, but then the light is for you! The
{407}
light of the glory of God shines "in the face of Jesus Christ" (@2 Corinthians 4: 6), and so it does in the saints; their faces are radiant with light and life. It is like Moses¬ face shining, so that Aaron could not look upon him, for he was afraid of him. Think of being afraid of Jesus! No true saint will ever harm you. They tell the authorities they do not want to take life; they ask the king and he grants it. They are saints, and there is nothing in God, or in Christ, or in the Spirit of God, or in the saints, to harm anyone. So it is that God has brought about conditions for the administration of the gospel for the relief of men, and therefore there are constant convictions; I do not say they are always conversions; I do not know how many times a day it occurs. Is there anyone here who has not been convicted of sin? Well, you are not in accord with God, with Christ, or the saints. It is time you changed your mind. You have been living like the world, in its fashions and its ways. Here most of us are believers, and have everlasting life; we will not come into death, but into life, a very wonderful thing! The Spirit of God is here today and He is striving with you now.
For unrepentant people there will be no movement in heaven, as there is over one repentant sinner. However little people may think of these tiny meetings, people are affected inwardly; their faces begin to shine, when they have not been shining; the Father of lights is here to give you light and make you live, so that your face shines too. There is no variation nor shadow of turning with Him, and if you are forgiven today, it is for ever; if you are saved today, it is for ever! If you say you have fallen into sin, I can say to you that no one can pluck you out of the Lord's hand, nor out of His Father's hand (@John 10: 28, 29).
Moses asks Hobab in @Numbers 10: 29 to go with them, "and we will do thee good", he says. The saints can do you more good than even he could; they
{408}
are God's people today, and all the good there is, is dealt out to them. "Come with us", we say, "and we will do thee good". God can do you good, Christ can do you good, and the Holy Spirit can do you good. So change your mind and link yourself up with what God is doing; it is the saving time; everything is in your favour!
Now in @Acts 16, you will see how a sinner gets help. If you are a saint, I want you to remain one, but if a sinner, then change your mind and all will change for you, your ways as well as your mind. The jailor in Philippi changed his mind; he had a hard time, and so will every sinner, unless he changes his mind. God is against the sinner; He will not help him in his business or your other projects; yet He is on the line of saving you. This man had elected himself into a bad calling and bad associations. It is so with some saints, alas, and they find that God is not with them. One day this jailor found he had two men, who were servants of Christ, there in the service of the gospel, and he took them over; he need not have done as he did, but his calling made him hard, he had no feelings; he thought nothing of these men, who were to be put in the stocks. I hardly know how to describe these stocks; the feet were to be made fast in the stocks; and he did his work well, with hardness, and without any love. But it was in the divine mind that he should learn love. What a change awaited him! "Hereby we have known love, because he has laid down his life for us" (@1 John 3: 16), known as nowhere else! Every saint knows love, or he is not a saint at all! A man might give all that he has, and without love he is nothing! If there is a sinner here, then he has not known love. It is in the thoughts of God for him, as it was for the jailor; we are not given his name, his name was "the jailor". It is the only name we know, and it means hardness and cruelty; but in the heart of God, in the counsels of God, he had another
{409}
name. So with each one of us, we were written down to have love in the past eternity, and to have other things too. If you have no love, you are nothing; that is what the Spirit of God says. I may have the greatest number of gifts, even to working miracles, but without love I am nothing, of no value at all; I may even be a good husband, and father, but without love I am nothing! This man did his job, a loveless one; he was paid for it, no doubt; he did his worst to these two men, and bound them up in the stocks.
Now read verse 25: "And at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them". As the prisoners heard, the jail was turned into a temple; the service of God was going on there; it shows how things are done in God's realm: "The prisoners listened to them", notice that! "And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison shook, and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of all loosed" (verses 25, 26). See the change that is coming as the prison becomes the temple, the place of divine operations, led by these two men, whom the prisoners heard. "And the jailor being awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword was going to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had fled" (verse 27). This is another kind of work, the devil's work, for the man to destroy himself. But for the keeper of the prison to see the prison doors opened was God's work! He drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, "but Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here". What I have been saying is that there is no harm in the minds of the brethren; so Paul cries out, "Do thyself no harm"; he has just been using that same voice in praising God. 'No', Paul says, 'you must not do that!'. I have no doubt either, that they sang the proper hymn at the proper time, and turned the whole
{410}
place into the temple of God, a merciful temple. "Do thyself no harm"! It is like the brethren at the tribunals; they want to do good, and would tell men to do themselves no harm. 'Do not commit suicide', says Paul. Suicide is of the devil; there is much of it today. 'No', says Paul, with authority and a loud voice. It is urgent; and so the man is delivered from the suicidal knife or sword; but further, he needs "lights"; that is the word that bears on the position. You may not be saved yet, but why are you here? Maybe your father, or mother, or brother, or sister, has urged you to come. If you now want lights, they are all around you!
So in the next verse he called for lights. Maybe there is one here who is not anxious whether he has the light or not. The jailor wanted lights; all that is necessary to know what he really needed, to know of the Saviour; He is the One the saints speak of, with light in their countenances, for there is only the one Saviour. So in chapter 20 the "many lights" in the upper chamber will tell you about Him. "Do thyself no harm". Paul knew that he would go to the bottom less pit; I have no hesitation in saying that. It is judgment you must learn to fear, like Felix in @Acts 24: 25, when Paul spoke to him of "the judgment about to come". So he also says, in @Acts 17: 31, "He has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed, giving the proof of it to all in having raised him from among the dead". For the unsaved it will finally mean the judgment of the great white throne, when the dead, small and great, will stand before God, and whether you are a big man or a small man, all your things will be clarified there!
Now the jailor calls for lights. Have you ever called for light, or lights? Your brother may have been saved, and this salvation is for you. Paul speaks with a loud voice, "Do thyself no harm"; he could
{411}
speak with a loud voice; "he took the lead in speaking", it is said (@Acts 14: 12). It is an urgent matter; 'Where shall I get light?'. No one but Paul could bring it to him; he was like the sun, the light-bearer to millions today. We are all light-bearers today as christians, and we shall be able to tell you how to be saved, how to be in fellowship, how to be in heaven, so that you will go there by God's power, when we all go up there together. He "has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", @Ephesians 2: 6. What a wonderful thought!
Then in @Acts 20 there were "many lights". I liken it to what is available now. Some young people have not come to the time of knowledge of salvation. There is much for them, for instance in the readings; there are many lights in the upper chamber for them. It is not the singular but the plural word; there are a good many brothers and sisters to help them. But Eutychus fell from the window and nearly killed himself, as many young people do; they look out on the world, and get badly damaged. He "was taken up dead. But Paul descending fell upon him, and enfolding him in his arms, said, Be not troubled, for his life is in him". Maybe one here has given up the brethren, and gone into the world and has been mixed up in worldly things. Paul descending says, "his life is in him". What he needs is to be resuscitated, not raised from the dead. These seven men knew what he was like. Paul was not disturbed, he was a great luminary, and he descends to where Eutychus was, "His life is in him", he says; he needs to be brought back to life; and that is the way, when young men or women get into the world and fall into darkness. The servant of God knows that life is really there, though for the moment they have given up the Lord. Paul is used to resuscitate him, as we were speaking of it this afternoon, how to get the brethren back into the truth. Paul, it says, 'enfolded him in his arms',
{412}
the touch of love was there, and brings him back to life. He may become a good brother and a good preacher. So it says, "they brought away the boy alive, and were no little comforted". He was brought alive into the christian company. The two lights of @Genesis 1 refer to Christ and the assembly, and we must come back to that point in dealing with the gospel to Christians; there is nowhere else. In the world, it is leading "you away as a prey through philosophy and vain deceit" (@Colossians 2: 8), there is no spiritual life, which means no light, for the world is in an awful state, things waxing worse and worse. So the warning to young people is to come into the light; the door is wide open; there are many lights inside. Paul enfolded that boy in his arms, and they came together again, and had a good time; they broke bread, and conversed a long time till daybreak. Things were not quite right at first, hence the need for Paul's long discourse, which led to the boy's fall, but all are happily together now.
If things are not quite right with you, or you have never broken bread, remember that He, the Lord Jesus Himself, has asked you to do it, saying, "This do in remembrance of me", @1 Corinthians 11:24. After that memorable night they "brought away the boy alive, and were no little comforted". Indeed Eutychus was a comfort to them as he was brought back from death into life!
May God bless the word to us all at this time!
{413}
THE HOLY SPIRIT
@Revelation 1: 9, 10; @Revelation 2: 7; @Revelation 22: 16, 17
J.T. The brethren will no doubt be ready for a comparison of the truth of the Holy Spirit as seen in the earliest chapters of the Bible, with that set forth in the end of the Bible. We are in the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. The Lord as having gone into heaven received the Spirit of the Father and shed Him forth, as we are told in @Acts 2; so that He is here and gives character to the dispensation. This is one of the greatest subjects that the Bible affords, for the Spirit Himself is a divine Person and so has part in the Deity; and it is essential that we as christians should know this and read the Bible with His help. The first chapter of the Bible says that the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters, not interfering or taking on any divine service so far as we know, but hovering or brooding over the face of the waters, as if a condition had arisen that required His attention. That is all we get there; and then in chapter 6: 3 Jehovah says, "My Spirit shall not always plead with Man", which would mean that He had been pleading with men, not in any punitive way, but evidently to affect them as to the truth, for the light of God had been commanded. God had said, "Let there be light", and there was light, and the Holy Spirit would operate in the light. The word was that He would not always plead with man, but that man's days would be one hundred and twenty years; meaning that God would continue in patience with him during all those years.
The book of Revelation was written by John. The revelation is said to have been given to Christ "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place;
{414}
and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw. Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written in it; for the time is near", @Revelation 1: 1 - 3. John was thus taken on by the Lord to write this book, and he tells us that he was the bondman of the Lord Jesus, and that he "testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw". Then he begins to tell us in verse 9 that he, our "brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus. I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", he says, so that this verse brings us to what is in mind, that John as writing this book is seen as becoming in the Spirit on the Lord's day. Thus we are here in the same position as in Genesis, that there is a condition requiring attention, only that in Genesis the condition was chaotic and the Spirit was hovering over it. Now there is again a condition that requires the attention of the Spirit, but here it is directed to the service of John. So that what is before us is the service of the Holy Spirit, and how it enters into the book of Revelation: firstly in this passage read; then in verse 7 of the next chapter where He is speaking to the assemblies: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies"; and then in the last chapter, where the Spirit is seen in unison with the assembly-not the assemblies now but the assembly itself, the whole assembly, viewed as the bride-and "the Spirit and the bride say, Come". It seems to me that the brethren will be helped by looking into these sections, especially having in mind the Spirit as linked with the bride in chapter 22.
C.F.E. You mentioned that in @Genesis 6 God said, "My Spirit shall not always plead with Man". Was
{415}
He looking forward to the end of the dispensation?
J.T. He was thinking of the service of the Holy Spirit in striving or pleading with Man. That would be given up presently because the deluge would come in, but God waited in patience on men and entreated them through Noah; the pleading no doubt would be largely through Noah.
A.R. Does the book of Revelation show a chaotic condition in the church?
J.T. There is a chaotic condition, although not such as is contemplated in @Genesis 1, because the churches, seven in number, are viewed as more or less in an orderly relation, externally at least. Thus the Lord begins with Ephesus and speaks to her about certain things, and then to Smyrna and Pergamos and on to the end of the seven assemblies. There is something commendable in almost every one of them; but the point now for us to see is how graciously the Spirit is ready to serve us even though there may be conditions that are reprehensible; and then finally that He is saying with the bride-not simply with the church or the assembly-but with the bride, "Come". He is influencing the bride; He and the bride are saying the same thing; they say to the Lord Jesus, "Come", as He announces Himself as "The root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star".
W.F.K. It says that John "became in the Spirit". Was that a state?
J.T. Yes; he was not always in that state. He was normally, I suppose, in the christian condition in which we are to walk in the Spirit and live by the Spirit; but this was special when he says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day"; it was in view of obtaining the revelation.
A.N.W. What view should we have of the Spirit in the time between @Genesis 1 and @Acts 2, having in mind His hovering in Genesis and His descent in @Acts 2? How should we view Him in the interim?
{416}
J.T. We cannot just say that He had come down in Genesis in the same sense that He came down at Pentecost. He came down from heaven at Pentecost to indwell the assembly and to carry on the service of the glad tidings, and to supply all that is needed by the assembly. He is here still. Perhaps you will enlarge a little on what you have in your mind.
A.N.W. I only wondered if everything that was effected subjectively between those two times was done by the Spirit's operations. I have the thought of what was subjective in mind.
J.T. You would go fully with the remark that the incoming or the coming down of the Spirit at Pentecost was not just what we have in Genesis, nor what is subsequent to Genesis, until He came on Jesus. He came on Jesus in the form of a dove, we are told; but at Pentecost He came with the form of cloven tongues as of fire which sat on each of the saints that were there; and indwelt them. He thus took up His residence in the assembly-for they constituted the assembly-which was a unique matter. It had never been true before that He should indwell. It was true of course when He came on Jesus; He dwelt in Jesus, but not in others. No others joined in the possession of the Spirit until redemption was accomplished, and Pentecost contemplates the accomplishment of redemption. The Lord, having gone into heaven has sent down the Spirit and the Spirit has come to indwell the assembly, and He still indwells the assembly. Therefore the point for us today is as to what we understand by His indwelling and what He is doing.
R.W.S. Does the fulness of the thought involve christianity? It alludes in the Old Testament Scriptures to an Angel of Jehovah. Would that be the Lord Jesus? But that also awaited the fulness of His coming in in the incarnation.
J.T. The Angel of Jehovah, we are told, accompanied
{417}
the people to lead them into Canaan; but that would not be the Lord as become incarnate, but an angel.
Ques. Would you say that in @Genesis 1 and 6 God was intimating that this divine Person, the Holy Spirit, would be the One who would carry on things?
J.T. That is right; God is intimating that, but He is not yet announced as come in. In the gospel He is announced as coming in, the Lord Jesus Himself saying that He would send the Comforter. He said this before He died. He calls Him "another Comforter" and said He would abide with the saints for ever; and that is the unique position now. He is abiding with us and dwelling in us. And so this wonderful grace that is seen in the passages referred to in Revelation is for us to consider: the character of His dwelling and the service He is rendering.
T.E.H. It says in connection with Cornelius¬ house that as many as heard the word received the Spirit. How do we get help as to the hearing of the word?
J.T. There we see the action of the Spirit Himself, "The Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word", @Acts 10: 44. The word 'fell' is used; it is the same word that is used when the Father fell on the prodigal's neck and kissed him. So that the Spirit is ready and available for us now on the principle of hearing the word. Cornelius invited Peter to his house and called his friends together, and Peter opened his mouth and preached the gospel to them; and while he was preaching the gospel to Cornelius and his company the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word. That was the position.
R.D. What was effected in the disciples in @John 20:22 when it says, "And having said this, he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit"?
J.T. That has to be compared with what we have already alluded to in @Acts 2. The Spirit in @Acts 2
{418}
came down-not in the form of a dove-but with the form of cloven tongues as of fire and sat on each of them. It is an action distinct from that in @John 20 where it is said the Lord breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit". Something would have happened when the Lord breathed into them, but we cannot just say that they were sealed as they were in @Acts 2.
Ques. Is the Spirit especially connected with prophecy in this book, as well as with the assembly? The book is called "the prophecy" (verse 3); John was a prophet in that sense.
J.T. Quite so. Of course it is the same John who wrote the gospel; and our brother has just called attention to the fact that John the evangelist tells us that the Lord breathed into the disciples and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit". So you rightly say that the book of Revelation is connected with prophecy; it is prophetic ministry.
C.N. In @Genesis 1 and 6 the Spirit is seen passively. Having @Acts 2 in mind, does what we are reading in Revelation show that since redemption is accomplished He has taken up an active position among the saints?
J.T. He has; that is a very helpful thing to have before us. It is important thus to understand that we can only have the Spirit on the ground of redemption. The Lord Jesus had Him personally; He came on Him personally, not on the ground of redemption but because of what He was in His own Person. But He comes to us on the ground of redemption, the accomplished redemption of our Lord Jesus Christ. But He was in @Genesis 1 and 6 feelingly. He is called the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is God Himself; but the word 'Spirit' being used points to the subjective feeling. The Spirit felt the thing; the water engulfed the earth and He felt the condition.
{419}
R.W.S. As to verse 10, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", would John not then be full of joy? But subsequently there were assembly sorrows to be recognised. Would he be reflecting the hovering of the Spirit as to conditions in the assembly?
J.T. I think it is the same Spirit of feeling as in the hovering or brooding over the face of the waters. The condition there was not what was primal; something had happened. Possibly the devil had acted, but the Spirit of God does not say who was the actor, only that there was something that the Spirit felt; and the same would be true in this chapter in Revelation, that He would feel the conditions, first in the seven assemblies, and then in the general state of the world which, if we have time, we should look into, beginning with chapter 4. I think it is right to think of Him in relation to His feelings. If things go wrong in any gathering, the Spirit feels it and would bring about conditions of self-judgment.
Ques. Does @Romans 8 help? "The Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered" (verse 26).
J.T. That is what we are saying, how feeling He is. He makes intercession for the saints according to God.
J. S. So that we should take up things feelingly with one another.
J.T. Just so. The passage read in chapter 2 is one out of seven similar ones which refer to the Spirit speaking to the assemblies: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies"; whereas chapter 1 is the state in which John was on the Lord's day: "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day". It was the state in which he became in the sense of the possession of the Spirit.
E.A.L. "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". The ear there is characteristic of the believer, is it not?
{420}
J.T. Just so, he is appealed to; so that there is an appeal to every one of us now as to whether we have an ear for these things. Some of us may not have.
C.F.E. Is this hearing in view of the formation of the saints?
J.T. It would be in view of formation, but I think in view of instruction too, because this book has instruction in mind.
A.R. The Spirit is not operating in relation to any special section; it is for all the assemblies.
J.T. Just so, the seven are mentioned. They are said to be in Asia, which is not the continent of Asia exactly, but the province of Asia not far from the European border. The Spirit of God sees well to connect these seven assemblies with that section.
T.E.H. In connection with the speaking and hearing what the Spirit says, should I not be conscious that the person who is speaking is in the Spirit?
J.T. Of course if one is speaking in an authoritative way, he should himself be conscious that he has the Spirit. In this meeting any brother is free to speak, but we cannot just assume that because he speaks he is conscious that he has the Spirit.
Ques. Is there a fink between Stephen in @Acts 7, being filled with the Holy Spirit and John here becoming in the Spirit?
J.T. There is; and it is also important to remember that the fact that we have part in a meeting like this is not a proof that we have the Spirit. Simon Magus, for instance, spoken of in @Acts 8, professed to be converted and followed with Philip, but Peter found that he was not converted at all. I only refer to that because it is just as well that we should make inquiry as to whether we all have the Spirit. We should all be conscious that we have the Spirit.
A.N.W. At one point the apostle says, "I think that I also have God's Spirit". Would he put it that way in order that results might show that he had?
{421}
J.T. I do not think the apostle Paul implied in any sense that he did not have the Holy Spirit. He only applied that remark to the matter that he was dealing with, because it was a question of his experience as a spiritual man. What he was saying was not one of the Lord's commandments. That statement in @1 Corinthians 7 is most remarkable. The subject is marriage, and the apostle Paul distinguishes between the Lord's commandment and his own experience as a christian.
T.E.H. Is it also remarkable that that section should have been put into the canon of Scripture?
J.T. It is right to use that word 'canon', because it might be questioned whether the actual remarks of Paul himself were scriptural; whereas the truth is that he is speaking as inspired of God, and as an experienced christian too; and he is telling us that he has no commandment about what he is saying at this particular point, but that as an experienced man he has confidence that what he is saying is right.
F.H.L. He says elsewhere, without any doubt, that "we have the mind of Christ".
J.T. Just so, he says that expressly, which is characteristic of a christian. But that expression, we have "the mind of Christ", refers to the thinking faculty, not simply that we know something about a certain thing but we have the faculty of thinking as Christ does. That is a very important thing to keep in mind.
G.F. Is there any difference between being indwelt by the Holy Spirit and sealed by the Holy Spirit?
J.T. There is a slight difference. The phraseology is: "Now he that ... has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts", @2 Corinthians 1: 21, 22. So that there are three things there. One is that I am anointed; a believer who has the Spirit may be viewed as anointed,
{422}
which is an external idea. As he is speaking or preaching he has power. But then the sealing is that God owns Him, the seal signifies ownership. The presence of the Holy Spirit is a mark in us that God owns us, very precious too. And then finally He has given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. First I am anointed, then sealed, and then I have the earnest of the Spirit in my heart.
D.A.P. Would the Spirit bring to bear on us a special ministry in every dispensation from Genesis right through to Revelation?
J.T. I would think that, only that when you consider the present dispensation it is the dispensation of the Spirit. That is, it is a dispensation that is marked by the presence of the Spirit. There were earlier dispensations, but these were not marked by the presence of the Spirit; there is that distinction to be maintained. This is the only dispensation that can be regarded as the dispensation of the Holy Spirit; it is the indwelling of the Spirit that marks His present service.
F.N.W. Is His present service marked by a peculiar fulness in relation to the Father and the Son in the economy, what They are above? Your allusion to @Acts 2 seemed remarkable, that the Lord received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, bringing in the full thought of the economy.
J.T. Very good; hence the word in @John 15 that the Spirit proceeds "from with the Father" as coming into the saints.
R.W.S. The Spirit is hindering as to wickedness and as to the nations, but as to the saints it is just the opposite; He welcomes us, as with John here becoming "in the Spirit".
J.T. Just so. The work is positive, building us up in the knowledge of Christ and of God, the knowledge of the Spirit Himself and of the Father, building us
{423}
up in the knowledge that we belong to the assembly. The formation of the assembly is a great thing.
Ques. In @John 7 where it says the Spirit "was not yet", do you understand that to refer to the assembly or to the individual or to both?
J. T. It is a remarkable word, "not yet"; the assembly too was not yet. Jesus was not yet glorified. The word 'yet' means that the Spirit had not at that time taken up the position in the dispensation that was intended. The word 'yet' has its answer now; it is true this very day in this room. The Spirit is here in this room consequent on the glorification of Jesus. The Holy Spirit is available because Jesus has been glorified.
T.E.H. Would you mind helping us as to praying in the Spirit? "But ye, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life", @Jude 20, 21. How does that help us in relation to the assembly?
J.T. Your point is praying in the Holy Spirit. John says here, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day". The word 'in' is a preposition of power, and John was conscious of the moment when he became "in the Spirit". He was conscious of the presence of the power of the Spirit in his feelings and in his ministry.
A.P. How do you distinguish between being in the Spirit, and the believer's body being the temple of the Spirit?
J.T. It is the power involved in the present action of the Spirit.
J.S. So that John was conscious of that power as being the vessel of the Spirit to develop what the Lord had in His mind.
J.T. Just so. He became in the Spirit on the Lord's day. It was not his ordinary state, or the
{424}
ordinary state of a christian; it was a special matter because the Lord intended to impart to him what this book contains. He intended to tell him how to write it, and all that depended on his becoming in the Spirit; so that he became in an ecstasy. He was governed by the indwelling Spirit in the full sense, his mind and affections were controlled for the moment by the presence of the Holy Spirit.
Ques. In chapter 5 he weeps because there was no one to open the book. Do you view him as moving in the Spirit there?
J.T. I think the whole position in the book contemplates a state of abstraction in which he is governed by the Spirit of God in his mind and feelings and affections. So that as under the control of the Holy Spirit he can write what we may call Holy Scripture. The book of Revelation is Holy Scripture, and it is written by John.
A.N.W. In chapter 4 when told to come up to heaven he says, "Immediately I became in the Spirit", confirming what you say, that he was in power in that way to take account of and record what he saw and heard.
S.C.M. It says, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", @1 Corinthians 12: 3. What would you say about that?
J.T. That is the test in 1 Corinthians, because the Corinthians were very much exposed to their natural mind and to the devil getting in; and so Paul says, "I give you ... to know", meaning that he gives them a test by which they should know that they have the Spirit, "that no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit". That is the test. You might say, Well, he could use the words, an unconverted man could use the words. But the apostle does not mean that; he means that a man, speaking feelingly and under the influence of the Spirit, says, "Lord Jesus".
{425}
R.W.S. Would the Spirit's feelings as to apostasy be reflected in the meeting for prayer, and the result of His formation in the saints be seen in the service of God in the assembly?
J.T. Just so. We speak much about the service of God, and of course that usually refers to worship, or our speaking to God in praise. Now we are speaking to one another, but still, it is God's service to some extent, and it is in the Spirit. There is room for the Spirit at such a time, and no doubt we are conscious of it now, that something has been said that has helped us.
R.W.S. That is enlarging. My thought was rather limited, as to reflecting, in the meeting for prayer, feelings as to public conditions, which would be more on the negative side; and yet the result of the Spirit's formation in us would issue in greater service to God in the morning meeting.
J.T. I would go with that fully; so that our prayer meeting becomes the vehicle to convey our feelings as to publicly broken conditions; and as we humble ourselves the Spirit of God helps us, and at our next meeting for worship we have more power. I would say that is the great advantage of the prayer meeting.
Ques. In relation to what you were saying about the Spirit's help, I think we need help in this area that the Spirit may be given room in our ministry meetings and readings to throw light on local conditions. The Spirit's words to the seven assemblies bring to light conditions in the localities. Do our ministry meetings and reading meetings serve to that end, to bring things to light?
J.T. What we are having this afternoon ought to serve us in that way, because it is a question of the Spirit: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies". What you say, of
{426}
course, would cover all that the Spirit may be saying to us.
C.A.M. In @John 16 the Lord in speaking of the Spirit coming in says that "he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment". Would you open that up a little?
J.T. It would mean that the advent of the Spirit historically at Pentecost, and what followed and what is going on still, imply that a certain demonstration takes place. Certain demonstrations have taken place and are still taking place: for instance, Pentecost brought out the remarkable demonstration when three thousand persons at one time spoke to the apostle Peter and to the other eleven apostles and said, "What shall we do, brethren?". They were profoundly affected by the Spirit of God. That was a positive demonstration effected by the Holy Spirit through Peter's preaching at that time, and it has gone on more or less ever since. The power and the presence of the Holy Spirit is a demonstration of what can be seen if we have eyes to see or ears to hear.
Ques. Is the Spirit related in any way to tribulation? I thought of it in relation to Paul and John. We were speaking of Paul's tribulation and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
J.T. Yes, it would work out in us: "Tribulation works endurance; and endurance, experience; and experience, hope", @Romans 5: 3, 4. And that is because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which would bring us to the last verse read in @Revelation 22: 16. The Lord says, "I Jesus"; He is addressing Himself to His saints, He addresses Himself to them in a personal sense. It is not simply that He is the Saviour, but He is personally Jesus, and known to us as such, and He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies. I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". And then
{427}
comes the answer to that appeal, for you might say the Lord is appealing to us to draw out something from us; and that something is in what follows "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come". The Lord by His personal address brings out the word, 'Come' from the Holy Spirit and from the bride.
W.F.K. When does that take place, the Spirit and the bride together saying, "Come"?
J.T. I think it is still future. When it arrives the Lord will assert Himself in some sense, and the whole assembly will be affected; the Spirit will be affected too, but the whole assembly viewed as the bride will be affected.
J.S. Does this show the great formative work of the Spirit of God in the assembly?
J.T. Just so. How our hearts should be moved at a time like this to think that the matter is imminent, that at any moment the Lord may address Himself in this personal sense-"I Jesus"! It is a personal address.
F.N.W. This revelation seems to originate with God. In chapter 2 the Spirit speaks to the assemblies, but here it is, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies". In my mind I was linking with @Genesis 24 where, in type, the Father is seen moving and the Spirit is seen serving, but Isaac is the final thought reached.
J.T. Just so. If you follow up the thought of @Genesis 24 Isaac is finally seen meeting with Rebecca. Earlier Abraham had spoken to his servant and given him a commission, but later on the thought of Abraham is dropped and it is Isaac who is prominent. Hence it is Christ and the assembly as here in our verse. The word 'assemblies' embraces the whole: "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies"; but now the Lord is going to speak about the bride, and that is where Isaac and Rebecca would come in. The Lord says, "I am the root and
{428}
offspring of David, the bright and morning star". The root and offspring of David has to do with the earth; that is what David stands for. Christ is David's Son and He is therefore the King; but He is also the root of David, showing that He is a divine Person. That is as far as the first part of the verse goes; then David's part is finished. But He is also "the bright and morning star". That is no question of David, but of the coming glory and the advent of Christ Himself as He arises with healing in His wings.
J.S. Appealing to bridal affections?
J.T. Quite so; so that it goes on to say, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". That is more in answer to His presentation as the bright and morning star.
A.R. Does the close of chapter 22 view the assembly on earth? In chapter 21 she is seen coming down out of heaven.
J.T. Yes, what is here in our actual conditions today. It is the voice of Christ and His appeal will bring about this wonderful change. The Spirit and the bride will say, "Come". That will synchronise with the rapture: as the saints call for the Lord, He comes.
Ques. "All who love his appearing"; would that synchronise with Paul's thought and John's? It is really a love matter here.
J.T. I would say that. It is an appeal by the Lord. The Spirit's response is first, which is striking; it means the Spirit takes charge of everything subjectively and then the bride comes in in His power.
W.W.M. Would you say something about the earnest of the Spirit? Would that be the enjoyment of a sample of what we are to reach?
J.T. That is a good word, a sample. The earnest is the thing itself, only in a sample. It is a smaller idea, but the thing is there nevertheless. The earnest of the Spirit is what He is to us now.
{429}
R.W.S. You synchronised the idea of "Come" with the rapture. Would the bright and morning star synchronise with the appearing?
J.T. I would think so, because the adornment comes in there in chapter 21: "I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (verses 1, 2). This is the new order of things, a new heaven and a new earth. We are led into the eternal state in chapter 21 but chapter 22 is hardly that, though the Lord is making way for it. He is about to enter on the eternal state of things and the bride comes according to chapter 21 as adorned for Him. She is not seen as adorned here; what is said of her here is that she says, "Come". She is ready for Him.
A.R. In that sense there is something here that suggests the bride, bridal affections for Christ.
J.T. Quite so. It is not a bride, it is the bride; the article being placed before it makes it very expressive. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come"; that is to say, there is only one Spirit and only one bride and they both say, Come.
A.R. She corresponds with what is in chapter 21.
J.T. What it says in chapter 21 is a description of her, she is prepared "as a bride adorned for her husband": it is simply a description of her. "I saw the holy city"-notice it is the city that is the prime thought-"I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". She is new Jerusalem in chapter 21 and she is only likened to a bride because she is prepared; the city is described in the sense that she is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
H.A.S. What was in the mind of John the baptist
{430}
when he said, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom"?
J.T. He does not tell us. That is a very important point to bring up. John does not go so far as to say who she is. The Bridegroom has the bride, but where she is he does not say. She is not in evidence but He has her; she is His property, as it were; she belongs to Him.
F.H.L. Would the work of the Spirit as bringing about in the bride a response to the "I Jesus" be a confirmation of @John 15: 26? There it says, "The Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, he shall bear witness concerning me". Would this be the thought of confirmation?
J.T. Just so. I think we ought all to be clear about this matter of the bride as in chapter 22. In that chapter the term 'bride' has the article: there is only one. The term 'Spirit' has the article too there is only One. Each is distinguished in that peculiar way. Chapter 21 is new Jerusalem; there she is described "as a bride adorned for her husband", so that we have two thoughts there; that chapter deals with the heavenly city, the new Jerusalem, and the new order of things, the new heavens and the new earth. But in the verses we have read in chapter 22 we are dealing with the old heavens and the old earth, and the present situation just as we are in it today; only there is someone who knows who the bride is and someone who knows who the Spirit is. There is only one bride and only one Spirit and they both say, "Come", to the Lord Jesus. They want to leave this scene. They want Him to come into His rights and they are making much of Him; they think everything of Him.
{431}
THE THIRD HEAVEN
Paul says he had visions and revelations for which he was caught up to the third heaven (@2 Corinthians 12). The possibility of reaching the heavenly is thus indicated now. He was there, in the body or out of the body he knew not, but he also speaks of paradise. He was capable of naming, showing intelligence to name what he had experienced-he says "third" heaven. Why "third heaven"? It is proof of the thing experienced, not testimony. If proved by one man-for he does not speak as apostle there-it is open to every true christian. Inference is a thing proved by a man in Christ, the use of the word 'man' shows full consciousness, having all the sensibilities active. It is brought down here and belongs to the treasury of God retained by the Spirit. The idea of heaven has been experienced: there is the first heaven, then the second, an intensification of the thought; this the astronomer never sees. The second involves what is spiritual, the third the thing is proved. He heard unspeakable things, which he kept for fourteen years; he kept them for the treasury of God without mentioning them, but it entered into the wealth of his ministry. I am aiming at conveying the thought that heaven is a reality and within the range of the believer.
{432}
HEAVEN'S VIEW OF CITIES AND LOCALITIES
@John 3: 1 - 21; @John 4: 15 - 24, 39 - 42
J.T. It is hoped that something may come before us for profit as to John, especially the family of God, as calling for concern for each other; all is in mind in the assembly, which God has designed to work out His thoughts of love; that is, in effect, that we should seek each other's good and promote love amongst ourselves, and promote what would be a means under God's hand for working out His thoughts. That is the order of the assembly, because God has not given up any thought of His since Pentecost, and the assembly was designed to afford Him a means to work out His thoughts. His thoughts have a wide bearing leading up to eternity. John has this in mind peculiarly; he speaks of the work of Christ and the things which He did. "If they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written", @John 21: 25.
The book of Genesis contemplates the idea of humanity, the human race, and we can never but be affected as we think of the violence in the early days of the race, the recourse to murder, Cain working from the enemy's side to defeat God's thoughts in love. It is distressing to think of the recourse to violence, the very opposite to love, in the early chapters of Genesis, and the question is now how the wisdom of God can be worked out in the remaining days of the assembly's sojourn on earth. These things are being worked out in the assembly.
These chapters in John, beginning at the third, afford basic principles and facts for the working out of divine thoughts, and the question of new birth has to be faced and understood. It is a common subject perhaps, but may be required now among the brethren,
{433}
the working out of the new birth, not a question of "a man" (as the Authorised Version puts it), but of "any one" being born again, without which "he cannot see the kingdom of God"; and again, "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God". It is not a question of a man, but of any one. Much is made of persons in John, especially in the early chapters. Man is covered under that head, not one particular person; that is not some personality in our localities, but "any one", any person or persons in the locality who can work out the truth; therefore it says, "Except any one be born anew ...". So that we must give up any thought of individuality we may have, and come to the thought of 'one'; that is, God must have His way in working out His thoughts, and we have to see that He will have all to come under His sway in love. John is very wide, and we can only get initial thoughts here, in this chapter.
Ques. It is family love?
J.T. Exactly that, and how it must be worked out.
Ques. Not special ones, but the family?
J.T. In the family certain ones are mentioned at the outset, but new birth makes allowance for the sovereignty of God.
R.R.T. Does "born anew" have in mind the basic material that God will use in the assembly?
J.T. Yes, we must begin there; the Lord says, "Except any one be born anew", and again, "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit", and the individual distinction is not made much of, but it is a question of the Spirit, of God's rights in human beings. There are persons of great distinction in John's writings, but when it comes to the operations or service of God, it is in human beings, as with Adam and Eve we have the idea of God beginning with a family with a view to increase.
{434}
Rem. Nothing else could have given God His way so completely as this idea of being born anew.
J.T. It seems so. The family setting had been damaged through failure in man's hands, and so He comes back to this thought in the third chapter, where it is a question of persons, but God ever reserves to Himself His sovereign rights; "any one", it is what God may do. The Lord "knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man", @John 2: 24, 25. So that what was there was well known to God and to Christ, and hence we have this great subject in chapter 3.
Ques. Is the failure in man involved in the expression, "Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things!"?
J.T. Yes; things are knowable. There has been wonderful teaching continuously since the great revival in which we have part, but especially requiring that we may be governed by right principles. So the distinction of being born of God is the greatest, and any other distinction that may have attached to us is set aside. That is where the distinction lies for the children of God, as it says, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", @1 John 3: 1.
Ques. Does the coming of Christ bring things to light?
J.T. That will come out as we proceed, how the Lord took up the matter. "But there was a man from among the Pharisees"; he was to be noted; the Lord takes him on, and raises the question of birth, not only of new birth, but the fact that it is stated, "who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God", @John 1: 13.
Ques. Is the Lord taking us back to our fundamentals?
J.T. Yes; we have to begin at the beginning, the
{435}
foundation; it is a wide field, and the Lord may help us on that line.
Ques. Is the bearing of being born anew to bring down all that is connected with the old and bring us to the assembly?
J.T. Just so; there is so much in man's mind as to himself and his history and what he is doing, and we can soon find out about him; but then we have to make way for God. Man is always ready to bring in something of himself and what he is doing, but there is very little in his mind as to God. He has His thoughts, and men may listen to us if we have anything to say as to Him; we must be patient and seek opportunity to bring something in as to the assembly, His great vessel of operations, and what affects any locality we may be dealing with. A good many of us have been in the South and have seen what God has been doing, and seen too the need of correction, that the divine mind may have full play, whether in the North or the South. God has put that in our minds, and therefore we should give the assembly its full place in our localities, so that we may use it, for it is His full thought.
Ques. Will you enlarge on that?
J.T. Well, in San Francisco we have to see that the assembly is available for the divine thoughts, and if some have not been included, well, let them in, so that they may have the full benefit of His thoughts.
Ques. What do you mean as to letting them in? Are you thinking of this area with separate meetings? Can they be looked at as a 'city'?
J.T. You know the history of Australia as well as I do, and how 'cities' have been formed. There are many meetings in Sydney, all working together profitably, and there is a measure of order, and a readiness to take in what is given, and they can serve God profitably. There was a time when it was not so. Paramatta was left out, but is now included in Sydney.
{436}
The same applies in many places in Australia and New Zealand, so that God's thoughts may work out. The same applies in America.
Ques. Is it a question whether God's thoughts can be worked out better in a family spirit?
J.T. Yes, and there would be more for God if more room were made for what there is. If it is legal and right, why not make way for it, so that we can have the benefits of each other?
Rem. Peter said in @Acts 10: 14, "In no wise, Lord", but then it was God's thought.
J.T. So the Lord says to him in @Matthew 16: 23, "Thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men".
Ques. Are we weak on the basic thoughts?
J.T. The question is whether it is weakness. Any weakness could be corrected, but is it weakness? Or do the facts show that there should be more opportunity for persons to be functioning in any way?
Rem. Nicodemus was slow to see; he says, "How can these things be?".
J.T. The Lord corrected him. "But there was a man ... he came to him by night"; he was not afraid to go the full way with his thoughts.
Ques. Is it a question of light all the time? John has that always in mind.
J.T. Yes.
Ques. What did you mean as to its being legal?
J.T. Well, it means 'right'. The human mind is capable of taking in certain things, and what we are trying to get at is a matter of righteousness. It is what came out in Noah; it was not late in coming out, but early; and we should see if anything is out of joint, that we are not too late in the correction.
Rem. There is not a long time left in this dispensation.
{437}
J.T. It is not long as I see it. Many are getting old, and it points to the shortness of the time, and challenges us to be making the most of it.
Rem. It is urgent if it affects the assembly.
J.T. I know of no place so much as Sydney. I have watched it, been in it, and I know what has happened there, and I know that certain localities had been kept out. The same applies to Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Auckland.
Rem. It is a question whether the brethren can therefore deal with longstanding matters, in which they have hitherto been powerless.
J.T. Good. And the longstanding matters being dealt with because matters can be dealt with locally; and if it can be carried out in one part, we can get the gain of it and work it out here.
Ques. Is the principle seen in Andrew? "He first finds his own brother Simon", @John 1: 41. Is it the principle of addition?
J.T. It is a question of finding. Nathanael also is amenable to help.
Rem. The family idea is inclusive; we are not to withdraw and hold back.
J.T. Yes, we are to include all that is of God.
Ques. Your thought is that those who are on the other side of the Bay should be in San Francisco?
J.T. It is a matter for you to work out. It is a question of finding the general principle, and the brethren here falling in with it. It is a question of being amenable; let love be the prime thought; "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13: 35. Otherwise we are not known as Christ's disciples. We have had to take matters up in New York, in so far as the different boroughs are concerned. The city stands on the principle of five boroughs, of which Brooklyn is one, and it has worked very well for us. For Brooklyn to work with Manhattan and Staten
{438}
Island as far as I remember there have been no difficulties; there were at first, but they all vanished as we saw the gain of it.
Rem. You put the assembly above municipalities and such things.
J.T. Yes, I think so. It works so in Barnet and New Barnet, in England; they work together; they took counsel and they are working together profitably. New Barnet was the original meeting.
Rem. And so in San Francisco, which was the first meeting, like New Barnet.
J.T. As far as I know J.N.D. went to Australia by sailing-boat, and worked in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere, and also in New Zealand; as far as I know they are going on very happily and profitably. The only difficulty is Sydney, because they are so many.
Rem. In the assembly God is working out His greatest thoughts.
J.T. It is a very agreeable thing to God, and pleasing to Him to find it is in our minds.
Rem. The principles of the assembly transcend all natural boundaries.
J.T. That could be applied to London.
Rem. I was trying to bring in what is in Mr. ----¬s mind, and that we might all get help as to it. The question is as to whether the saints are bound to follow certain municipal boundaries and names of places, or to follow the higher viewpoint that has been indicated.
J.T. I have no hesitation in saying that.
R.R.T. In Sydney do they not recognise certain boundaries, and in London the same? For this reason because of the actual boundary, Beecroft is excluded from Sydney.
J.T. That is so.
R.R.T. The principle on which they came together is the reckoning of the boundary that the government
{439}
laid out for Sydney, so that Beecroft is just outside, and therefore not reckoned in the city.
J.T. That is so, but in that area there is Paramatta which has all the municipal equipment of mayor and corporation, and in Oakland there are several cities, and the question is whether Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco should not be as one, and anything beyond that should not come into that consideration.
R.R.T. The government in Australia laid out the boundary in Sydney (likewise in Auckland) and the government inscribed Sydney and excluded Beecroft, and if we could find out what is the same here, all the brethren would see it. Has the government labelled any specific part and called it San Francisco? Paramatta is included in the city of Sydney by the government and if there is anything like that here, all will bow to it.
Ques. Is the boundary the only consideration?
J.T. No, it never was.
Ques. Do the brethren set the boundaries?
J.T. No; it is a question of God's work, and what it is now.
Rem. Port Adelaide is included in the assembly of Adelaide, but it is not part of the city government's administration.
Ques. Does the question of growth have anything to do with it?
J.T. We must include it; it is a question of what God is doing.
Rem. The remark as to Adelaide is good, and helps.
Ques. In the matter of Sydney, why is Beecroft excluded?
J.T. I cannot say; they may come to it¦. Paramatta was out till quite lately.
Ques. Does any central governmental authority enter into this?
¦Beecroft now works in with Sydney.
{440}
J.T. Not unless it is very definite. But we are dealing with the work of God, and how it serves His purposes.
Rem. In @Acts 13: 1 it refers to "the assembly which was there" at Antioch; would there be a distinction between the actual city, and God's work there?
J.T. Take Detroit; the meeting was long inside, by itself. But now the whole city of Detroit functions assembly-wise; they are taken into it and used, and the same is the case in Winnipeg. The question is, Are the brethren usable? They should support one another.
Ques. Is the work of God the whole point? Take Corinth, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth",
@1 Corinthians 1: 2. Is there anything in Corinth as a city apart from the assembly of God there?
J.T. The Lord said to Paul, "I have much people in this city", @Acts 18: 10. Corinth was about seven miles from the nearest town, Cenchrea, and the Lord had Corinth in mind when He said that He should have an assembly there, and the whole city was in mind as being one assembly. As far as I know Cenchrea was not included.
Rem. In these days things are complicated in the world, but the assembly is the place where they should be worked out.
J.T. God is very liberal. He knows the difficulties, and He says, I will support you; I will help My people.
Rem. The boundary thought would be easily resolved if we included the family idea, the idea of love.
J.T. That is a good way to put it; to include certain ones and certain areas. God will support that; He is very patient.
Ques. Must there not be a legal basis to call it a city as in Sydney? Must we not have a right basis?
{441}
J.T. A considerable correspondence has arisen on this matter. I think Berkeley could easily be included.
Ques. @1 Chronicles 7: 28 refers to "Bethel and its dependent villages".
J.T. That is a good thing to bring up. Villages are dependent on the main cities.
Ques. Would industrial matters and occupations enter into it?
J.T. Cities were very small then as compared with what they are now. Whatever is conducive to fellowship is to be made way for, to work out love.
Rem. That should be the great basis.
J.T. Yes, if there is that to use that is available, then let it be used!
Ques. Does the ministry work downwards from the top, from what God would do, and then down to the boundaries; not to start with the boundaries and work up?
J.T. You mean to work from God downwards. Yes, it is like Peter's sheet coming down out of heaven in @Acts 10: 11.
Rem. "What God has cleansed" would involve being "born anew" in @John 3.
J.T. It does appear that we are not to call the work of God 'common'.
Rem. "A certain vessel descending, as a great sheet" would be God's thought.
J.T. There is complete identification with what is of God; it is brought down and will go through to eternity, and what love says is convenient and right, and God will help.
Rem. The meeting began in San Francisco.
J.T. Yes, I have no doubt as to that. It has gone through many vicissitudes, but now there is a meeting in Berkeley and Oakland, as well as San Francisco itself.
Rem. They already have a combined reading in the area.
{442}
Rem. Would it work administratively?
J.T. Why not?
Rem. In the next chapter, @John 4, the woman goes to the men of the city, as if she was claiming the men for the Lord.
J.T. It reads, verse 39, "But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, He told me all things that I had ever done. When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to abide with them, and he abode there two days. And more a great deal believed on account of his word; and they said to the woman, It is no longer on account of thy saying that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world". The Lord is known as the "Saviour of the world", not because of what the woman said, but because they had themselves come in contact with the Saviour, and maybe that is what we need, and not to leave any of them out!
Ques. Would Nicodemus be one who "comes to the light" (verse 21)?
J.T. It says, "He that practises the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God". We cannot ignore what is "wrought in God". Then we have later in verse 35, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand". That is the Father and the Son working together, so that the saints are in His hands. He would place them where they are most usable.
Rem. So that God would set the boundaries for us as He set "the boundaries of their dwelling" in @Acts 17: 26.
J.T. Quite so, and let the saints see how it is workable.
Rem. So the children of Israel lived within their boundaries in separation from the nations.
{443}
J.T. Just so. The saints must be taken account of, or the enemy will take account of them.
Ques. What does the "sheet" imply in @Acts 10?
J.T. It was "bound by the four corners" so that it should not give way, and if we can use the saints that way, let us bring them all in.
Ques. Is it flexible?
J.T. We are not to use that word too freely; it is a sheet and it is workable according to the divine mind.
Rem. 'Latitude' is perhaps a better word; 'flexible' might intrude on divine principles.
J.T. It might be that God is saying, Let us have as many as possible of the saints together to work out My principles.
R.R.T. Yes, and within certain cities, as at Thessalonica, because they were of that city. "The assembly of Thessalonians" (@1 Thessalonians 1: 1), as also "The saints and faithful in Christ Jesus who are at Ephesus", @Ephesians 1: 1. They were of that city also, and are we today doing the same?
J.T. Yes; but do not shut the saints out of it, and make everything of the governmental side, as men speak. We must think of heaven and the sheet of @Acts 10, "descending", and going back where it came from.
Ques. Would God differentiate between a great city like Corinth, and Cenchrea?
J.T. We have to work it out on the principle of facts; we need to be informed as to them.
Rem. Men of the world speak in Oakland or Berkeley of 'going down to the city', meaning to San Francisco.
Rem. What we have had tonight helps as to it from God's side.
J.T. That is the point.
Ques. Is the right viewpoint that it is lawful to bring others in on the principle of love and not to exclude any?
{444}
J.T. The word 'lawful' is good, because the mind takes it in readily. God is saying to us that He has property here. What governs the world does not simply apply as governing the assembly, which is a thing by itself; it comes down from heaven; we have to see how it works.
Rem. It was not long since one nation was fighting against another, but the assembly is one. It did not matter what the nations were doing.
J.T. Just so. We have gone on with assembly things through two great wars!
Ques. Should we speak of the 'Bay Area'?
J.T. I do not know what that expression means!
Rem. All the cities under the census are called 'San Francisco'; and the same is true of the industrial areas.
J.T. We go above, that is to heaven, and see what God thinks. He is going to use the assembly, and it is a question of how He can use it now.
Ques. So is it to be above all things here?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Do we not need to be engaged with heavenly things and not so much with those of the earth?
J.T. "God, having foreseen some better thing for us" (@Hebrews 11: 40); that is above the political situation!
{445}
READINGS ON HAGGAI (1) (SUMMARY)
@Haggai 1: 1 - 15
It is to be noted that in the minor prophets generally those in public authority are not the people of God. Here Darius, one of the Medes, is in authority, but not hostile. It corresponds in a certain sense with our own times. We are at liberty to pray for those in authority, yet having inwardly the sense that God is with us.
Despite these facts there were certain conditions that the enemy could use, and was using, conditions of ease, and the neglect of the things of God (verse 2). There was neglect of the rights of God in His house, what belongs to Him, as the assembly is His. It is God's assembly, and the Holy Spirit is here in it, but He can be hindered by conditions. We shall see as we proceed how God was ready to come in there, and is ready to do so now. Indeed, not only will God come in, but He has come in. We have proved it week after week for years, but we want more, more spiritual power.
"This house" is what we are as of the assembly. But think what God is losing by want of real interest in the things of God!
The prophetic service is seen nowhere in the Old Testament more distinctly than in Haggai. The prophets were always there and available. The same kind of ministry enters into the whole of the minor prophets, ministry for the last days.
The governor and the high priest are those that are in authority spiritually, not public authorities but those that are in our care meetings. But here they are not functioning as they should. Then "the remnant of the people" is also spoken of; that includes the
{446}
sisters as well as the brothers. The word 'remnant' has a peculiar place in the ministry of the minor prophets, as also the phrase "Jehovah of hosts", which shows that God has plenty even if they are not now available.
Question as to the "signet" (chapter 2: 23). In view of the peculiar place that this man, Zerubbabel, has the reference is undoubtedly to Christ. The signet suggests that God's stamp is to be on everything.
Chapter 1 of this book indicates what was at fault, and chapter 2 gives the great result. Haggai and Zechariah were serving together; "Two are better than one". The Lord sent the disciples out two by two at one time. As a result of the prophets¬ labours in quick time there was a remedy, and the work began to be done. It was not attempted to be done, it began to be done.
What influence the sisters would have in such a matter! We must not leave the sisters out in these meetings. The Lord has given us help on that. The sisters must be there, and in full force-spiritually. Hannah corresponds with this, in the service of prayer. Although her composition is called a prayer, it was really an ascription of praise to God.
Houses come in here much and sisters have much to do with houses, so that instead of wainscoted houses it is a matter of the house of God.
There is such a thing as "standing by", persons not exactly acting, but standing by (@Zechariah 3: 7).
"Go up to the mountain", that means real exercise, and then "Bring wood". In our case we must seek out persons that need help and get them right, so that there will be material for the house. "Bring wood"Bring it! That would refer to persons who are converted and have the Spirit, these are the only ones who can be of any use to us.
{447}
Haggai is the Lord's messenger with the Lord's message. @John 20 tells us that the disciples went to their own homes, but Mary remained behind and she got something. This prophet is a messenger and Mary became a messenger to the brethren. She had a message too, a very beautiful thought, and she delivered the message. What the sisterhood is in this sense! What can be done by them! It is a remarkable matter to look into.
Phoebe was then cited, and J.T. said that she must have gone to Rome on business, and the saints were to assist her in that regard. He then told the brethren that a large amount of money had been given by a sister who is now with the Lord, to be used to reprint about twenty volumes of the Collected Writings, so that they may be available to the brethren, adding, 'and they are to be read, not to leave on our shelves'. He further remarked, 'The sister is with the Lord, but the money is with the brethren'.
Remark as to the scarcity of time for reading. The scarcest thing I know of is time. There is so much to be done, we must addict ourselves to what is profitable.
Verse 8 of our chapter is most stimulating. "I will take pleasure ... I will be glorified". Then the prophet rebukes the people (verse 9). There is no prosperity under certain conditions. We want to see that these conditions are removed. Then they "hearkened" (verse 12). This is the positive side. Note that they hearkened to the prophet as well as to Jehovah.
Remarks were then made as to attendance at the meetings, and J.T. said, I was calling attention to past ministry, in itself valuable, but we also want what is fresh. There is a peculiar blessing in standing in the house of Jehovah: "who by night stand in the house of Jehovah". As to attendance at the meetings, the main end in all these things is what is for God; the main end of the Bible is that.
{448}
The spirits of the brethren are brought in in verse 14, and they are right.
The dates here are very striking, because there was very little time involved, but the results were remarkable. It is remarkable too how dates are given in the book of Acts, for example, Paul was at Corinth eighteen months and at Ephesus three years.
Ques. Can we look for results like this in two or three days?
J.T. That raises the whole question of time. We are now in the twentieth century. God is unwilling for any to perish and He is waiting for what is to come into the assembly. The era has been about twenty centuries and God is not changing His mind. Then the revival has come in. That was nearly one hundred and fifty years ago. We are to take account of that.
Question as to the three services: rule, priesthood and prophecy.
J.T. And then you must add to that the remnant. The remnant is scattered all over the world, and it is working, doing something for God. It is a very fine thought to consider what is among the brethren at this time. They are not specially gifted but they are doing. "She hath done what she could". So the sisters are doing something, and we pray for them as well as for the gifted men. Every one does his bit. Normally the assembly is not lazy, it is active.
Question as to the remnant idea applying to us today.
J.T. I do not think the word 'remnant' is suitable in the assembly; it is rather 'those who form the assembly'. It is not a proper word now, it belongs properly to Israel. We have nothing less than the assembly in mind now, I mean the thought of it; we clothe ourselves with the thought of it.
The Lord says to Philadelphia, "I also will keep thee". It is not a remnant, it is the whole idea.
{449}
READINGS ON HAGGAI (2) (SUMMARY)
@Haggai 2: 1 - 23
We might note at the beginning that the people are referred to as "ye people of the land" in verse 4. We should notice too the covenant and God's Spirit in verse 5, and further it is in mind to see that things are actively in growth.
Five words come to Haggai from God, and each is short, each is effective and everything happens on its day. God has appointed a day in which He will judge the world.
Verse s: "The word ... and my Spirit, remain among you". That is the word for the moment, they remain.
Ques. Are we going to prove that the latter glory of the house is greater than the former?
J.T. I think so, because there is no end to it, and there is the millennium. The work is going forward and is being enlarged. God has mercifully saved us for forty years from a major division, and if we cling to Him He will preserve us.
Question as to "the Spirit was not yet".
J.T. The Spirit of God was there from the beginning of Genesis, He existed from the outset, but the glorification of Christ was needed for His coming. The glorification of Christ affects everything in this dispensation.
Ques. How is verse 9 to be worked out in view of what you said about the millennium?
J.T. The assembly as it comes down from God out of heaven is the greatest idea possible. There has never been anything like it before. It is not presented as going up, nor viewed as having gone into heaven.
These people are called the people of the land. They belong to heaven, typically. If we look into the second of Ephesians, verse 22, "A habitation of God in the
{450}
Spirit"; this is the greatest thing we can come into. Think of the time God has taken to work it out! It took only six days in Genesis to work out the creation, but two thousand years this vessel has been in formation, with Christ in heaven and the Spirit here. If all these things in the Old Testament are types, we can see the magnitude of the assembly.
Ques. Are all christians in the assembly?
J.T. We have to reckon what God can do. He will finish things up very quickly. We shall all be changed in an instant, what brevity!-"the twinkling of an eye". What cannot God do?
Ques. Are all christians to be there at that assembling moment?
J.T. Well, they will be, if they are real christians.
Ques. What about christians in system, how are we to view them?
J.T. "Go up to the mountain and bring wood". We are to go and find them and bring them.
Ques. What about christians who do not have the Spirit? Do they get the Spirit in that brief moment?
J.T. Oh, I think so, but we have to speak abstractly.
Rem. It is to be an "assembling" shout.
Verse 9: "In this place will I give peace". That is in the land of Palestine, not in New York where there are two million Jews, but in the land.
Ques. Is it possible for a believer to lose the Spirit?
J.T. No, I do not think so at all! That would be error. It might be so in the Old Testament, but not now. He has come down to seal us.
Ques. When Jesus was here in the temple the glory was great, but now the Spirit being here, would that be just as great?
J.T. Of course it is-the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.
{451}
Ques. Is the assembly the custodian of all that God has down here?
J.T. No, I would say the Spirit is. The woman in @Luke 15 gathers up everything, she leaves nothing out. "In which are hid all the treasures" refers to the assembly as a vessel, but the custodian is the Spirit, things are held by Him.
"They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another" (@Malachi 3: 16). Jehovah is saying that, but then the Spirit is Jehovah, the Spirit of Jehovah, so "they shall be mine" (verse 17) belongs to Him; not one shall fail to be there. Through the dark ages who took care of things? The Spirit did.
God's house is the biggest thing one can think of. The Spirit is in it. It is a built thing. It involves the Spirit, and He makes us part of it. It has taken two thousand years to build, but God has done it.
Rem. In whom (Christ) ye are built together for a habitation of God in Spirit; the whole Trinity is involved.
Ques. Does "The tabernacle of God is with men" also include the Trinity?
J.T. Yes, I would say so.
The priests were challenged as to how they did things in the section from verse 10. Then in verse 19 the vegetation is spoken of; the principle of life is current. They have not brought forth, but they are bringing forth. Then Zerubbabel is taken up as a type of Christ and God is going to give him this wonderful place of a signet.
"Jehovah of hosts" is a very comprehensive expression. God uses it commonly. It is what is in His mind; He is saying, I have infinitely more than I need, and yet He is taking you up, He is so bent on the assembly.
The Spirit has given one line of thought ever since the revival, only that certain things have been clarified, such as the sonship of Christ and the place of the Holy Spirit.
{452}
DIVINE PERSONS
@Genesis 12: 1 - 3; @Numbers 12: 1 - 3; @2 Samuel 23: 1 - 5; @2 Corinthians 11: 16 - 24
It is in my mind to say something about divine Persons. I use those words carefully as comparing Them with creatures, however distinguished. So I have read about these persons, Abraham first, then Moses and then David and finally Paul, believing that this selection will serve to bring out what is in mind. One has been observant in recent times of great cloudiness in the minds of the brethren as to divine Persons and the comparison to be made between Them and creatures, however distinguished these latter may be.
One desires to set out the truth to the brethren and to do this we have to know the truth and the scriptures that contain it; such scriptures are indited by the Holy Spirit Himself. Every scripture is inspired of God, implying that it is from the Holy Spirit. The question therefore is as to whether we understand the names of the divine Persons and how to speak to Them and how to view Them, and how to worship Them, too. Then, on the other hand, one desires to bring out the great difference between Them and creatures, however distinguished any creature may be.
We get, for instance, in @Isaiah 6, the term 'seraphim' and in @Genesis 3 we get reference to the 'cherubim'. Now I would ask the brethren to consider whether or not these are creatures. My own impression is that they are not. And to this end the inquiry comes up at once whether there are unnamed divine Persons. I am speaking soberly and I believe the brethren will listen and think of what I am saying. Are there any unnamed divine Persons? I am sure that there are none and, as far as I can see from Scripture, there are none.
{453}
There are three divine Persons and three only, and They are to be revered and worshipped and we are to bow down to Them.
Now the question comes up as to these terms that are mentioned. The word 'cherubim' is in @Genesis 3. The cherubim were set to protect the tree of life, "to guard the way to the tree of life". The tree of life in the garden was a tree, it is not a person. Eternal life is not a person itself. Some have thought that it is. It is a term, a term of blessing that we have come into, one of the greatest blessings that we have, but it is not as great as what is to be reached in the assembly. The assembly is the greatest of all divine concepts. The assembly is not a divine Person, it is a creature, however much we may regard it and however great the statements that are made as to it, and I give one citation. The assembly is said to be "the pillar and base of the truth", @1 Timothy 3: 15. Now it might be assumed that a vessel of which that is stated must be divine, but it is not divine; it is a creature. The fact is that eternal life is the name of a thing; "the eternal life, which was with the Father" is a thing. The Lord Jesus was with the Father, but He is a divine Person. But the thing itself is a thing; eternal life is a thing; but I do not continue to speak about eternal life, because that issue has been settled. But fifty years or so ago there were those who assumed and asserted definitely that eternal life was a person, and those who did not believe it were regarded as erroneous, but that is a thing of the past, thank God!
But I come back to these symbolic names, for they are just symbols; that is to say, cherubim and seraphim are both symbolic names. The seraphim are mentioned in @Isaiah 6. The cherubim are first spoken of in @Genesis 3: 24. It is remarkable that they are spoken of early. But no one can prove from Scripture that the word 'cherubim' speaks of a kind of person-not rightly. Scripture does not afford
{454}
light that the word is other than a symbolic thing. It is used as a symbol, something that conveys a certain impression to the mind; it is a symbol. On the other hand angels are creatures, "Are they not all ministering spirits", it says, "sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?", @Hebrews 1: 14. That is said about angels. Angels are not put over the age to come. The Son, the Lord Jesus is put over the age to come, the world to come of which we speak. That is a phrase from Scripture that F.E.R. used frequently and helped the brethren as to it. But angels were created long before man was created. Man's creation is recorded in @Genesis 1: 26. In @Job 38: 7 we are told that the sons of God shouted for joy at the founding of the earth. They are capable of joy. There may be a good many young people here tonight who probably have never thought of these things and I am hoping that they will get help to think over them and weigh the facts of Scripture.
Now we might leave the subject of angels and seraphim and cherubim and come down to Abraham. What I have in mind is that Abraham is a good sample of a creature to be considered in comparison with divine Persons. The way divine Persons speak of Abraham is very remarkable. We have it clearly here in @Genesis 12. He was a most distinguished man, perhaps the most distinguished of any. Moses may have been equally distinguished, but I think that Abraham has peculiar distinction. He is the father of us all, it says-a remarkable thing that could be said of a creature.
Moses is the author of the Pentateuch, the most extensive of all writers of Scripture. We do not have any reference to the Lord writing except when He wrote on the ground. He wrote with His finger on the ground, a remarkable thing, that the Lord Himself did that. He stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground; the Lord humbled Himself to that
{455}
extent. Neither Abraham nor Moses did that, but I would say that Moses was the greatest of all writers. He wrote the Pentateuch and possibly other books, but he was not a divine Person. He was just a creature in spite of all that he did. We should have right thoughts about creatures whom God greatly honours and distinguishes. We will see them in heaven, I am sure, even those who died before the Lord Jesus became Man. I believe Abraham and others will be seen in heaven and we will look for them. What a glorious sight that will be, as the verse says,
<blockquote>'Nor what is next Thy heart Can we forget; <br>Thy saints, O Lord, with Thee In glory met'. (`160:8)</blockquote>
Now I go on to David. He is beautifully spoken of in Scripture. He is called the sweet psalmist of Israel (@2 Samuel 23: 1). And yet he is not a divine Person. The Lord Jesus said, "I am the root and offspring of David", @Revelation 22: 16. That is what the Lord Jesus said about David, and yet David was not a divine Person. But the Lord speaks of Himself as "the root and offspring of David". He speaks of David as His offspring, in the sense that He says that He is the root of David. We have to understand how that can be. David failed greatly, and so did Abraham fail, and I might say, so did Moses and Paul fail. Yet God is regarding these as most dignified persons. So the question is, How can we speak of these persons rightly? and speak of them in the service of God. David is a wonderful person, one of the most extraordinary persons, but he is not a divine Person. That is the thing that I am seeking to bring forward, that we all may be conversant with the truth as to these things, so that we know how to speak of divine things and deal with divine things in the service of God on the first day of the week, particularly when we have the Lord's supper.
{456}
And so I come to Paul, and what he says in @2 Corinthians 11: 5, is "I reckon that in nothing I am behind those who are in surpassing degree apostles". Now I suggest to the brethren that what Paul says there indicates that he is the most superior of all the apostles. There was none like him; and yet he failed; yet he is a creature. I think it is well that we should all have these facts in our minds so that we will be able to converse about them and speak about them and serve God in them.
I might have spoken about John who speaks of himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved. The Lord said to Peter, about John, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?", @John 21: 22. The inference would be that the Lord would leave him here until He came, which would include the present moment. But the Lord did not say that. He said, "If I will that he abide until I come ..". Therefore John, the apostle, has gone to be with the Lord long since, the disciple whom Jesus loved. Yet he was not a divine Person. The Lord loved him, and implied, in a certain sense, that He might keep him as a reserve man, but He has not done so. The Lord is getting on with what He has here on earth today. Some of us are kept here for that purpose and we can thank God that we are here today to edify one another. And we can say that the Lord loves us, too. It is a great privilege to be loved by the Lord.
But further as to Paul: he says, "I reckon that in nothing I am behind those who are in surpassing degree apostles". The footnote in some of our Bibles says that this is an ironical allusion to those who were false apostles. But I think that is a mistake. The editor made a mistake there. The passage implies clearly that Paul was superior to any of the other apostles. He says in @1 Corinthians 15: 9 that he was not fit to be called an apostle because he persecuted the assembly, and he felt it.
{457}
THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST
@Mark 15: 33 - 47; @Mark 16: 1 - 20
J.T. The sufferings of Christ are in mind. What especially is to be noted is the abandonment of the Lord Jesus, which is beyond words to describe by human mouth. There is no passage to be more thought of really, than the one we have read. "And when the sixth hour was come, there came darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour; and at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls for Elias. And one, running and filling a sponge with vinegar, fixed it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down. And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired. And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom". The immensity of the sufferings of Christ are seen here. We should think of it, perhaps, more than we ever have done before, for indeed they cannot be measured in human words. Only a divine Person could fully measure them.
S.McC. Would the fact that in the type the day of atonement is linked with the crown of the spiritual year, the seventh month, show that it is intended to have an effect on that side of the position as the saints come to the crown of the spiritual year? The seventh month was the climax of the festive months; the tenth day of the seventh month was the day of atonement. I thought it would show that the saints in the full joy of the climax of the spiritual year are to be affected by the sufferings of Christ from this viewpoint.
J.T. Exactly. If you follow on to the full thought it is the abandonment. There was no support at all
{458}
directly from the Father or the Spirit; it is complete abandonment. "Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?". Notice the interpretation; it is not simply the ordinary language of the human race, but what is especially used in this matter. So, I repeat again this thought of abandonment, that God abandoned His beloved Son. "Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls for Elias". This is a mistake; it is wrong to say that He called for Elias. How erroneous, with the best of intentions, we may be as to the things of God. It is just as well that we have this before us because it is most important that we should be as accurate as we can be in dealing with the holy things of God.
Ques. Would there be any time in the service of God where we would give expression to the sufferings in these verses? It has been said that we should not bring the atoning sufferings into the service.
J.T. I would repeat what I said this morning, that I would hesitate to say that the sufferings of Christ should not be brought into the service.
Ques. Have you in mind that only a divine Person could endure the abandonment and come through it?
J.T. It was complete abandonment. The Lord Jesus went through it as Man. We are not able to convey what it was, it is only by the Spirit of God that we can consider it properly.
Ques. Are these sufferings a testimony to His deity?
J.T. The Man who suffered was God.
Ques. In @Hebrews 1 the statement is made "Having made by himself the purification of sins ..." ; there is a note which shows that it is an act which throws back the glory on Himself. His having done it alone would bear on who He was.
J.T. I think it would.
{459}
Ques. Would these sufferings be considered as Moses viewed the burning bush? He was told to take his shoes from off his feet for the ground on which he stood was holy.
J.T. That is quite in keeping.
Ques. Do you think that J.N.D.¬s poem, Man of Sorrows, refers to absolute abandonment? One of the verses says,
<blockquote>'O day of mightiest sorrow, <br>Day of unfathomed grief! <br>When Thou should'st taste the horror <br>Of wrath, without relief'. (`190:3)</blockquote>
That is the expression of a human person.
J.T. It is not a divine utterance.
Rem. I thought that J.N.D. had expressed it in those words as well as any human being could do it.
J.T. Quite so; that is, a creature.
Rem. But your thought is that we are to be affected by the Lord Himself saying what He did at that particular moment.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Do you think that there was deliberate intent on the divine side in the choice of the hour in which the Lord entered upon these holy sufferings? When you were reading the verse it appeared that you emphasised "when the sixth hour was come"; and then again, "at the ninth hour". The sixth hour would be midday, would it not? At midday it became as midnight.
J.T. "And when the sixth hour was come, there came darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour". That is simply a fact, we cannot make more of it than that.
Rem. Reference was made to the testimony to His deity. Would there also be the testimony to the greatness of His humanity in One who could say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?".
J.T. The word 'greatness', of course, is a limited
{460}
thought. You want to be sure that your word is infinite, equal to infinity.
Rem. He could say, "My God, my God", in a way that no other man could.
J.T. Quite so; but by 'man', you mean, of course, as no other but a divine Person could.
Rem. A divine Person in manhood.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. The beloved apostle Paul, who was to fill out the sufferings, says, in @2 Corinthians 4, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels". Then he says, "Seeing no apparent issue, but our way not entirely shut up; persecuted, but not abandoned" (verses 8, 9). Paul could speak feelingly, through his experience of the unique position of the Lord Jesus being abandoned.
J.T. That is quite so, but Paul was not abandoned.
Rem. We can hardly say very much about these verses. It is a time for worship, is it not, as this thought is pressed upon our spirits?
J.T. I think that, fully. We do well to do that, because we can worship, if we are equal to it, at any time. God is ready to help us, too, to do it.
Ques. Are we to be impressed with the inscrutability of the Lord's sufferings?
J.T. I think so, fully. All these things that we now are thinking of and stressing so much ought to be in our minds so that we can gain by this conversation.
Ques. In connection with the sufferings, is there any thought as to the cry being in a loud voice?
J.T. That is to give emphasis to it. The Lord was entitled to do that; He is a divine Person.
Ques. Would that loud voice be the extremity of anguish?
J.T. It may be, but there is more than that.
Ques. How is it that such an infinitely sublime matter comes into psalm form in @Psalm 22?
J.T. The Spirit of God is really the author of the Psalms. The Spirit of God is saying it.
{461}
Ques. Would you say that crying with a loud voice in dying would show that He had power that death could have no abiding dominion over Him?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Since Mark is the servant's gospel, is it vital that servants should be clear and accurate in the matter of the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. That is exactly what I have in mind. Mark is very accurate and more explanatory in certain details than any of the other gospels, as far as I can see.
Ques. Would the answer to this question, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" be seen in @2 Corinthians 5, "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us"?
J.T. It is indeed. In dealing with these scriptures, we are urged now to be accurate; the Spirit of God is urging us to be accurate.
Ques. When it is said, in @Hebrews 9, that He offered Himself by the eternal Spirit, would that perhaps have a limited sense, up to this point, before the abandonment?
J.T. I would not use the word 'limited'. I would be afraid of that.
Ques. Would the Lord offering Himself by the eternal Spirit unto God be prior to this complete abandonment by God?
J.T. I am afraid to make those distinctions. You may be quite right, in a general way, and we would just be thankful for it, in that sense. But I would be careful.
Ques. Would you say that the answer to this profound question, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" may be found in verse 3 of @Psalm 22, "Thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel"?
J.T. Quite so.
{462}
Ques. @Isaiah 53 reads, "He was taken from oppression and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of my people was he stricken". Does the cutting off mean more than having died?
J.T. I would think, by comparison, that the allusion is to His death.
Ques. What did you have in mind when you referred to "Behold, he calls for Elias"? Then it says, "Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down". You referred to that as inaccuracy.
J.T. "And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls for Elias. And one, running and filling a sponge with vinegar, fixed it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down". The answer is that it was a mistake; it was an error to speak that way.
Ques. Have you in mind that in our holy and accurate and reverential contemplation of the sufferings of Christ we should all take root downward in view of bearing fruit upward in the contemplation of His glory which follows?
J.T. Exactly.
Ques. Is the centurion brought in at this juncture as an accurate man? He says, "Truly this man was Son of God".
J.T. It seems so, but that is about all you can say.
Ques. In the next chapter there is hardness of heart and lack of faith in those who were nominally believers. Is that the extension of the mistakes and error?
J.T. All I would enlarge on in the last chapter is this tendency to unbelief. Let us read from verse 9 "Now when he had risen very early, the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons. She went and brought word to those that had been with him, who were grieving and weeping. And when these- heard
{463}
that he was alive and had been seen of her, they disbelieved it. And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country; and they went and brought word to the rest; neither did they believe them". Let us be ashamed of ourselves with the unbelieving hearts we have: "Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven, and reproached them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen". In other words, they do not believe the brethren. We constantly find that brethren do not believe each other. We ought to be truthful and transparent in all our conduct and conversation.
{464}
THE LORD'S SUPPER
@1 Corinthians 11: 17 - 34¦
D.L.H. What was in your mind, Mr. J., in suggesting the scripture?
F.W.J. I thought it would be good to see how the assembly was formed and the manifestation of the gifts in connection with the body, and the measure of each one in assembly in connection with chapter 13.
J.H. There seems to have been a definite idea in saying, "When ye come together in assembly". Would they come together in assembly as Christ's brethren?
P.R. Is the thought of the brethren of Christ in 1 Corinthians?
S.H. I do not think you get it there, but on the other hand it would not do to answer the question in the negative and say that you were not there as Christ's brethren.
J.A. Is He more presented to us as Lord?
J.T. It would seem so in 1 Corinthians; therefore the thought of Christ's brethren could hardly come in.
S.H. Was not the lordship of Christ referred to in 1 Corinthians on account of the discord that was there? The proper relation of the assembly is to Christ.
J.H. That was rather my thought, and also that it was necessarily His brethren that come together in assembly; but of course the Lord is very prominent in the assembly on account of the disorder, as you say.
E.H.C. The apostle addresses them as brethren in verse 2, but after as Christ's.
D.L.H. The word 'brethren' should not be there.
¦Note. -- This reading has come to light only just in time for inclusion in the New Series, and although out of date order it is felt to be of general interest and to justify publication here.
{465}
Rem. The saints there are regarded as in Christ.
D.L.H. I do not myself understand on what ground saints can come together in assembly unless it is in association with Christ risen.
S.H. I suppose the aspect of the brethren of Christ is rather John's side of it. I think that is necessary for our understanding of the assembly of Christ, since the light lost in respect of the assembly is recovered by way of John. I suppose the first thing we would understand would be that we are the brethren of Christ, and the next thing we would apprehend therefore is our suitability for union, and that the assembly is regarded in that way as "the Christ". I think John gives us in that sense the moral suitability, and that is the only way of recovery. We do not get recovery to the truth of the assembly by the intelligent understanding of the epistle to the Ephesians. We are brought first practically to the understanding in our souls of John's teaching.
J.T. Yes; the only question in my mind is as to the way things are presented in Corinthians. My understanding of it is that the assembly is viewed as in the wilderness.
S.H. Would that not rather be the first part of the epistle?
J.T. When I say the assembly as in Corinthians, I mean that it is convened as in the presence of the world, and that male and female and the like are here, two things that refer to our life here and our present condition; whereas the idea of the brethren of Christ is connected with new creation.
J.H. In what sense do you speak of the wilderness, because the wilderness is spoken of in the Scriptures up to the brazen serpent, and then there is the wilderness after that point?
J.T. The wilderness after the brazen serpent is connected with the work of the Spirit in the saints; the ordinances and sacraments are not connected with
{466}
that in the wilderness, but more with the order of God in the wilderness, which I think we have in the first part of the book of Numbers.
J.A. What connection have the house of God and the assembly of the living God with the wilderness?
J.T. The house of God has its bearing towards the world; the assembly of the living God is where all the vitality is.
J.A. I thought the house and the assembly are both of God, and that the wilderness, which has to do with the individual and his path here, is out of sight in the assembly aspect.
J.T. Yes, but I was thinking of the bearing of the assembly with what is without, and the testimony, where God is always seen.
E.B. How far do you carry the thought of the testimony in that connection?
J.T. The important thought in Corinthians, especially in this chapter, is divine order, how things should be done. Chapter 10 shows the bearing of the Supper on our associations and our daily walk; chapter 11 is a question of order.
F.K. What really constitutes coming together in assembly as spoken of here?
J.T. The people coming together to the Supper, I take it; because he says, "This is not to eat the Lord's supper", for what they were doing was not orderly.
F.K. Does it allude to the Lord's people assembling together? Is it the character of their coming together?
J.T. It is the assembly, and the apostle indicates that the Supper is the object in view. The Supper is that which, as F.E.R. used to say, rallies the saints.
J.H. Is it similar to the thought in @Acts 20?
J.T. But there you do not see the assembly. The Spirit of God is emphasising here the assembly of God; it is a question of what is suitable to God.
{467}
F.K. And are we only gathered together in assembly when we come to take the Lord's supper?
J.T. It is presented that way here. What they were doing, the apostle says, was not to eat the Lord's supper.
F.K. What about chapter 14?
J.T. I suppose the teaching of chapter 14 hangs upon this chapter. The Spirit puts us in order, regulates us.
W.J. Corinthians presents the side of responsibility rather than that of privilege.
P.R. May it not be a serious objection: how can we come together in assembly in the present broken state of things? You think it would still be possible in view of the Supper?
J.T. All I can say is that you can come together in the light of it and endeavour to maintain the order suitable to it.
P.R. Without any assumption.
J.T. This epistle is supreme at the present time because it is a question of divine order; it is a most important epistle.
D.L.H. What is the standpoint from which we contemplate the Lord Jesus Christ and call Him to mind?
J.T. I think you begin with the Lord. As we come together from our varied associations and responsibilities it is suitable that the Lord should have His place as such.
D.L.H. But "Lord" is individual. At least, I have always understood that.
J.T. It is said to be "The Lord's supper".
H.D'A.C. He is the gathering point. In @Luke 24 you do not first find them meeting together as brethren but rather as disciples, but one blessed Person gathered them, and there He was in the midst; in John you find the same company but gathered as brethren and in the Father's name.
{468}
J.T. The disciples came together to break bread that is important.
J.H. How do you connect this chapter? Luke and John together?
H.D'A.C. The Lord surely when He brings His own together would bring them all. Everyone does not at once enter into the question of christian relationship and therefore in Luke you have the simplest elements as to coming together-Christ, the Lord as conqueror of death took His place as Head and Host and what they all were really after was Himself; they were together without any message, without any great intelligence of christian relationship.
J.T. I understand the Supper is left to us and we come together to break bread. It is not presented that He brings us together. The Lord gave the Supper to us as a rallying point for those He loved. It says, "The disciples came together".
H.D'A.C. They could not help it.
S.H. In Luke we see the Lord's activities in each one in order that He might find them together, and the gospel of John gives us the pattern.
H.D'A.C. You would not leave anyone out as to coming together. In Luke's gospel what is presented to us is what I may speak of as general, the Lord's activities and so on: in John we see them so gathered. Behind the word of Mary are the Lord's activities and those activities are carried on in each one of us today.
J.T. They came together, and that I think you will find is connected with the breaking of bread in the early chapters of the Acts. I was referring to @Acts 20.
S.H. I was thinking more of the remarks of Mr. C. and of Mr. H.
W.J. I suppose it is only in Luke's gospel that we get the institution of the Supper, not in the other gospels. It is, "My body which is given for you".
{469}
I thought the point was the status of those who were gathered. Were they coming together as brethren, disciples, or what? Do you leave out the instructions previous to this in the thought? Is there not some moral connection between what is set forth here in the early part of the chapter? Why does that come in there?
S.H. If there is not order in respect of those things there will not be order when we come together in assembly. If natural order is ignored there will be disorder when we come together.
J.T. There were some things he could praise them for, but he could not praise them for the way they came together in assembly.
D.L.H. Is not the idea of the Lord's supper that He is supreme there?
J.T. That is what I alluded to in regard to the lordship of Christ and the assembly and the relation in which the Lord is in regard to it.
D.L.H. He is the Host.
J.T. The Supper is in view of His absence.
D.L.H. When the assembly is convened, He is in presence.
J.T. If He is the Host, to use your figure, He would necessarily do what is done. Whereas what He left was that we should do it. He did it once.
D.L.H. But I think you will find the apostle referring to the divine order and what the Lord Jesus did: "I received from the Lord ... that the Lord Jesus ... took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup ... For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come". It seems to me as though the Lord gives it.
{470}
J.T. The Lord gave it to the disciples and He gave it to Paul. Paul gave it to the Corinthians, but they were not using it rightly.
D.L.H. But there is a great deal about the Lord and there is a great deal to be corrected; the whole epistle is corrective.
S.H. The Supper is brought in correctively here. It is really a reminder of what has been instituted rather than the institution of it. Did I understand you to make any importance of our breaking the bread?
J.T. No; I was thinking they did not have the Supper because they were recognising parties in the meeting, and the like.
S.H. Mr. H. said the Lord was the Host, and you said that if He were there He would do it.
J.T. I mean that He did it first as the Host.
S.H. I think it has only been done once. He only divides the loaf. What I have understood is that it is broken for convenience and the Lord has given it to us in that way.
J.T. I find it difficult to work that in with chapter 10, the one loaf!
H.C.A. Do you think the Lord's act avails for all time here, and we take it up in response to His word?
D.L.H. All it says here is that we eat it; it says nothing about our breaking it.
S.H. Except in chapter 10 and that is the teaching of it. We break it; that is, we each eat of it.
J.T. But the Lord breaks it, and He told them to eat of it.
H.C.A. Do not we break it necessarily in obedience to His word here?
D.L.H. That is partaking of it.
J.T. The breaking of it is that act which recalls Christ to me.
H.C.A. I thought that had caused trouble, and made the breaking of bread the act of a minister.
{471}
J.T. It ought to be the act of one who manifests the spirit of Christ.
-.R. You look upon the breaking of bread, the vital part of it, as that which we, each one, do?
S.H. Yes; it is "which we break"; that is, we all put our hand to it. Chapter 10 is the teaching of it and that is the table and that is what is to characterise us all the week, and in that sense we come afresh to it. It is not exactly something new.
-.R. So that the simplest saint present breaks bread just as truly as the one who breaks the loaf.
J.T. It does not appeal to me so; it seems to me the breaking is an act of one, that which one does.
D.L.H. There is no assembly in chapter 10.
J.T. I do not think you will find in the institution anything about the disciples breaking. The Lord did that. I look for that act. The Lord always did it, and that act suggested Him to their affections in @Luke 24.
D.L.H. That is all I see in it, but I do not attribute that to the Lord's supper.
J.T. It was the most familiar thing possible.
S.H. Yes.
D.L.H. I never myself attach importance to the breaking of bread by the individual, though of course one must needs do it. He does what is necessary in order that each one might do the same.
A.S.L. I thought that in the one breaking the bread the saints gathered together were doing it. He is simply doing it as for the assembly.
J.T. To my mind the word 'break' is not suggested, I think it refers to the Lord's act, whereas eating of it is our appropriation of it. I do not understand the eating to be the breaking of the bread.
D.L.H. How do you understand, "We break" in chapter 10?
J.T. That is we are all committed to it.
H.D'A.C. It is His supper; it is not spoken of as our supper.
{472}
S.H. It is His provision and His appointment.
F.W.J. The Lord Jesus instituted the Supper, and is the one who breaks the bread the continuance of that institution?
J.T. Yes; I think there is a suggestion of what characterised His act on the night of His betrayal.
H.D'A.C. No one could give it to us but the Lord.
J.T. Paul received it of the Lord.
D.L.H. It seems to me the bread must be broken in order to present the thought. That is the Lord's body has been given for us, and therefore it is necessary that someone should do it, but we take it from the Lord.
J.T. Oh yes, it was given to the Jewish disciples and then it was given to Paul to carry it on, and he gave it to the Corinthians.
E.B. Then the giving of thanks and breaking of bread recalls what the Lord has already done?
J.T. That is what I understand. It is suggestive of what He did. It is that act that suggests Christ to me.
S.H. Scripture says we partake of the one loaf, not broken bread.
J.T. But it says, "The bread which we break".
S.H. What is set forth in that is that there is the responsibility to walk in respect of what is set forth in that loaf.
G.W. What the disciples received on the night of the Lord's betrayal was a broken loaf and that is what they partook of.
S.H. It was a loaf that was broken.
E.B. In @Acts 20 I notice that J.N.D. gives "We being assembled to break bread", and later in the chapter, "And having broken the bread, and eaten".
S.H. The term 'breaking of bread' applies to the whole thing, to the drinking of the cup as well. The whole act is called the breaking of bread. The Supper itself is spoken of as the breaking of bread.
{473}
J.T. Would 'the Supper' not be a more adequate term for it?
P.R.M. "They continued ... in breaking of bread".
S.H. The general term in connection with it is the breaking of bread. It does not say they partook of the Lord's supper. It is evidently a term which passed into use. The cup is not a fresh pouring out.
A.S.L. So it is unsuitable to be pouring one out in the middle of the meeting. Before the bread is broken the assembly gives thanks through its mouth piece, so to speak. What is the thought there, for it is universally done?
S.H. It is after the pattern of the Lord; He gave thanks.
J.T. It is very important that should be made clear.
S.H. The whole thing is expressed in that: it is the eucharist.
Ques. Do you agree with that, Mr. T.? It is after the pattern of the Lord, the One who gives thanks for the saints.
J.T. That is how I have always taken it.
S.H. I was referring to the giving of thanks. Why do we give thanks? Because the Lord gave thanks.
G.W. Do we give thanks in the same way as the Lord gave thanks? How did the Lord give thanks? What is the force of the Lord's giving thanks? What did He give thanks for?
A.S.L. Was it not that habitual act? He never took bread for any purpose without giving thanks.
G.W. Well, what do we give thanks for?
J.T. Would He give thanks in connection with His prospective death?
D.L.H. If Scripture does not give us details we must leave that question.
G.W. What is the standpoint from which we give thanks?
D.L.H. It appears to me that in the giving of
{474}
thanks we are calling the Lord to mind, the Lord as having gone into death and there having dealt with the whole question of sin to God's glory, having removed all that was contrary to God on the one hand, and on the other as having established everything that was according to the will of God. It appears to me that those are the thoughts that are brought before us in the breaking of bread on the one hand, and the drinking of the cup on the other. In the cup we have the new covenant in His blood, which brings the will of God primarily before our souls. In the breaking of bread it appears we have much more the thought of what has been removed, and the love of God that has found One competent to remove it; and in the cup we have the thought of God's will as having been established.
S.H. It is wonderful that the Lord could give this at such a moment. He could do so knowing that He was going to remove man after the flesh in judgment in His body. What do we give thanks for? We cannot go beyond our own standpoint, and if we give thanks intelligently according to the Lord's mind it is that man after the flesh has been removed from the eye of God. In the cup there appears under the eye of God all that has come in for His pleasure. No doubt what the Lord contemplated was not only the removing of man after the flesh but what He was going to acquire for Himself.
G.W. Two thoughts came before the Lord at that moment, and in view of the accomplishment of what was in His mind He gave thanks. Our thanksgiving, in retrospect, must be in some measure on the line of the Lord's thanksgiving.
J.T. I add that the Lord, in a sense, was Head of the house in the institution of the Supper. You may term it 'host', but it is more His family: I think that it is a family suggestion. The Lord was very simple, and was accustomed to take the place of Head in the
{475}
home circle. He always gave thanks, and so on that occasion (and I always refer to it in that way) it is that which Christ presents to me as having to do with His own and surrounding Himself with them on that memorable night. It is a most affecting scene: the Lord's affection going out to His disciples in all He is saying and doing: that is the comfort to my soul.
J.A. Nobody but Himself could have broken that particular bread on that particular night.
S.H. They all happily gave Him that position. He said, "Ye call me Master and Lord: and ... so I am".
E.H.C. Would it be right to say, 'We receive this bread from Thy hand'?
D.L.H. But is not the Lord Himself the prominent Object before the assembly at the commencement and in the breaking of bread? When I speak of the commencement I refer to the breaking of bread, when we come together to call Him to mind, to remember Him: therefore He is evidently the prominent Object before the assembly. But in the cup we have the will of God suggested, the good pleasure of God and that is the last point in the Supper, and it leaves us with the impression engraven upon our souls that God has found a way of bringing to pass all His pleasure now. That seems to me to lead us rightly, I would almost say inevitably if things are right, to worship. In a sense it promotes worship.
S.H. The moment there is the apprehension of the glory of His Person there must be worship.
D.L.H. Yes, but would you not say that then He takes His place not as the prominent Object exactly but as the Leader of the whole assembly?
S.H. And that is the aspect of His death that ought to be more prominently before us. When we think of His death, we often think of what He has lost, but I think we ought to think more of the acquisitiveness of His love.
{476}
D.L.H. I should like to ask how we can look back and call the Lord to mind unless we are at the standpoint of the other side of the Jordan.
S.H. That is the standpoint F.E.R. contended for, and he made a remark which has been a good deal misunderstood. That is, the breaking of bread was an incident in our history, not in the wilderness exactly, but in our history, for in one sense we are always in the wilderness. That is, our position is an abstract one. In its true, proper, abstract thought, all these distinctions, men, women and so on, are gone.
J.T. The assembly viewed as in the land requires state.
S.H. Whether we have state to take account of it as such, it is how the Lord regards the assembly. In the epistle to the Hebrews you have the great thought of the house of God, Christ in the midst, and He is continually there and praise is constantly ascending up to the Father by Him. You have the idea of the house of God over the whole of the universe and praise going up to Him (chapter 2).
-.R. There is to be the state of soul to reach that.
S.H. I quite admit that, but because there may not be the state it does not do away with it.
J.T. The assembly of Christ in Canaan necessitates the work of the Spirit. The Supper is connected with our position here. The youngest believer participates in it, but all do not go on to that which is proper assembly privilege as far as the subjective work goes.
D.L.H. I want to say another word upon what I understand 'over Jordan' signifies. It does not necessarily bring a person of itself into what you were speaking of as Canaan. It suggests a peculiar position. Just over Jordan was not exactly in the land. The saints were not exactly in the enjoyment of their heavenly position until such time as they took possession, but they were over Jordan nevertheless and that
{477}
seems to me to signify the true standing and position of the assembly in association with Christ risen.
S.H. Then there is another point connected with it: are the wilderness and over Jordan to be regarded as successive?
D.L.H. I think you would say they are not necessarily successive.
S.H. They cannot be: the two coalesce. Although we are in the wilderness, and shall be till the Lord comes, yet there is another side, resurrection, Gilgal and the passover at Gilgal, which I suppose typifies the Lord's supper. Concurrently in our actual position here, there is our place of privilege in connection with a risen Christ: we take account of ourselves as over Jordan, and that is the position we occupy.
J.T. Whilst Canaan and the wilderness are, in one sense, concurrent, the believer is not in both at once, not in the same instant.
S.H. True, the one is abstract.
J.T. 1 Corinthians does not deal with risen with Christ: it deals with the position of the saints here in the presence of the world, and the Supper is before the world. There is that which goes on amongst the Lord's people which the human eye cannot see, and which is our highest privilege. We pass over to association with Christ and that is not abstract; it is real. There may be those in the assembly who do not do it, but the thing is done. That side of the truth is Colossians and Ephesians.
S.H. Exactly: that is just where the Supper comes in.
J.T. Therefore the great exercise one has is the necessity for the subjective work so that we should be in accord with that which is external. Corinthians does not deal with subjective work; it is what is external.
S.H. The epistle to the Corinthians is corrective it is impossible for us to understand the true nature
{478}
of the truth from it. It is to recover them to the normal truth which they had under the eye of God. Therefore in the epistle to the Corinthians we get a line of truth presented to us not on the line of the gospel, which relates to the world, but on the line of the assembly, which recovers the saints to the true assembly position. If we are to understand the Supper we have to understand the object which the Spirit of God has in view in the epistle.
J.T. The Spirit of God has left this epistle on record for us and manifestly it is the epistle of order, and the Supper is in connection with that order.
S.H. The Supper is brought in correctively: it is that things may be adjusted in our souls.
D.L.H. That is because we are actually here; we have to take account of that, so women have to keep silence and so on.
J.T. All I had on my mind is the place in which the Supper stands. In the Supper rightly taken up you have Colossian and, indeed, Ephesian truth.
Rem. The epistle starts with the assembly sanctified in Christ Jesus and you must be over Jordan to be in Christ Jesus.
J.T. We are entitled to take account of ourselves in that way at all times.
S.H. These Corinthians were not able to do it, but if they had understood the Supper (and that is why he brings it in) how dare they allow that for which Christ has died?
Rem. As to risen with Christ, it is a matter of faith, it is part of the gospel which brings you to that point. It is not only that He is raised but that we are raised with Him through faith of the operation of God. You could not speak of being quickened together with Him by faith.
S.H. Because the Corinthians were not at that; it seems to me a difficult matter to say that on that
{479}
account the Supper was connected with the wilderness. It is to lift them out of their wilderness condition.
J.T. This is a scripture left on record for the ordering of the assembly, and we ought to leave things as the Spirit of God places them. He has placed the Supper in connection with what is visible.
S.H. But then it is the teaching of the Supper.
J.T. If you have the teaching of the Supper that requires a subjective work. I have no difficulty about over Jordan provided you mean by 'over Jordan' a wilderness condition. The manna went over Jordan. Risen with Christ and new creation ground go together, and risen with Christ is the platform faith lays hold of, and quickening with Christ puts you there.
A.S.L. Is that proper assembly ground, and is there any other than resurrection ground?
J.T. There is no other ground for the assembly than heavenly ground. The point of God's assembly is that it is a place in which God's order is seen, and therefore an unbeliever might see it and be affected by it.
S.H. But that would not bring the assembly down to the wilderness side of things.
J.T. Far from it. Within the circle of the assembly, that is not the wilderness: what I am thinking of is the bearing of it.
Ques. When we come together at the beginning of the meeting is it not as those that have affection for the Lord?
J.T. I think so. We are in the presence of the wilderness: we are in the presence of that which is outside.
Rem. I have said to such as have said that, 'If that is considered to be the wilderness, I would like to be there'.
J.T. The breaking of the bread is physical action it is not spiritual.
{480}
S.H. We need death and resurrection because w are here.
A.S.L. That being so puts us in a spiritual sense on other ground while still in the wilderness.
D.L.H. I have always thanked God that there is a spot where we are free to leave what we call the wilderness, its circumstances, anxieties and difficulties, by the priestly grace of Christ on our own side and where we can be together on the new platform.
J.T. At the same time there are things that are not connected with new creation that we do, such as breaking the bread and passing the collection box round.
S.H. That would not be the exercise of the gifts.
J.T. "Until he come" has the outside world in view as testimony, but there is that which is spiritual where we know divine relationships: that is what I call Canaan.
H.T. When you speak of risen with Christ do you see anything beyond that, association with a glorified Christ?
J.T. That is the only way we can be in association with Him now, because He is glorified.
S.H. There is a point in connection with resurrection that is of importance: it gives us a heavenly position on the earth. The line of truth connected with resurrection no more takes us off the earth than the fact of resurrection. That is actually where we are in assembly. We know of the other side which comes in on the abstract line: we are united to One who is in heaven, and we take account of ourselves as being in Christ Jesus, but the blessedness of the truth that is connected with resurrection is that we are with Him.
J.T. I do not think that we can take any more ground in the sense of our souls than God gives us, and that is Ephesian ground: therefore however little we may be up to it, it seems to me we maintain the
{481}
full position of the assembly. Colossians is collective, but it is not full assembly position: Ephesians is, and if we want to get on to what is brought before us we ought to have the faith in our souls of the full position.
S.H. There is the whole order of things that is connected with resurrection and our place there in Christ Jesus.
J.T. But Israel will be on resurrection ground. @John 12 gives us the resurrection platform.
S.H. I fully admit that: the reason that it is possible for us to maintain it is because we have got it.
J.T. We have got the ascended Man. You do not want wings for resurrection.
S.H. It is change of place; ascension is not change of things. 
J.T. You are associated with a Man who is ascended and we ought not to go from that as the height of christianity.
Ques. Could we come together as conscious of our full assembly position?
J.T. It is in that light that we come together. I think it is a very important thing that we should have the full height before us.
S.H. There might be a simple soul breaking bread who knows nothing more than the forgiveness of sins, and as to the state of his soul does not go beyond that but those who are more advanced can take account of such in their full relationships, and I think it is necessary for us to maintain the full standard of the truth, allowing at the same time for every condition of soul, and dealing with the utmost patience over everyone so that they may be led on.
A.S.L. Allowing for all the states of soul, what is the proper light in which the assembly comes together?
S.H. In the light of Christ, risen with Him, raised up together and seated together in the heavenlies in Christ; but that is an order of things that is presented to us in the resurrection platform. We are here, but
{482}
we may take account of ourselves as having these things in Christ by the Spirit, we cannot pass from the resurrection plane for the simple reason that we are on the earth whatever light we may have that is beyond.
D.L.H. Now there are two words which we ought to take account of: 'with' and 'in'. If it is a question of resurrection it is 'with' Christ but if it is a question of ascension and association it is 'in' Christ.
S.H. It is that that makes the truth of resurrection so important, because it makes all these things possible for us if we find the resurrection plane here. It is not on the earth but it is here, and if we have not that plane, we have nowhere where we can enjoy these things.
J.T. Resurrection is a matter of faith just as much as ascension.
D.L.H. Only our ascension is in Christ and not 'with'.
S.H. It never says we are seated with Christ, but we are risen with Him.
A.S.L. Though we are on the earth these things are not on the earth: they are outside of the earth. That word in @Ephesians 2: 6 is also important; it is "heavenlies". There is no such thing as 'heavenly places': that is material.
-.R. Is all this involved in the words, "This do in remembrance of me"?
D.L.H. I do not think that is a question of position at all: it is Himself.
J.T. The absent One.
