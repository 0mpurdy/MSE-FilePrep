THE WAY (1)
@Acts 9: 1 - 21
J.T. It is in mind to speak of "the way", an expression which is found several times in the Acts. It is thought to refer now to Paul in chapter 9, but the expression is also used in relation to the assembly at Ephesus and also that at Corinth. The thought of the way requires some consideration on our part so that we may understand it. It is found in @Mark 10, but in Acts it has a particular significance, being used in a sense not generally employed or understood in ordinary language amongst men. It is there used as denoting God's ways in Christ or God's way in Christ; His way although the world and out of it. In Paul's whole experience undoubtedly it had a great place, and the idea is seen in what is known as the Appian Way, which records what the Romans had in mind in pursuing their way in the world. In a system like Mohammedanism, or any other religious system such as is recognised in the world the term is not used, as far as one understands, in the sense in which it is used in Christianity, in which sense we shall consider it at this time.
It is thought that it would be suitable to speak of Paul first, who as unconverted, was opposed to the way. Therefore, we have to speak of it negatively in regard to him until he was converted, as recorded in this chapter. The Spirit of God refers to the way on several occasions after Saul was converted, as we see in chapters 18, 19 and 22, so that it has now acquired the significance of which we have just spoken; that is, as denoting a system as in Christianity; a system of doctrine and principles and manners, which should mark us and govern us as distinct from any other system of things in the world. Christianity denotes essential qualities and not
{2}
simply confessions, the word itself being derived from the word 'Christian'. In @Acts 11 the disciples were first "called Christians". @Acts 9 records the conduct of Paul, the persecution which he conducted for a considerable time under the guidance and authority of the Jewish priesthood. As is well known, Christianity has suffered down the ages on the same principle from the accredited religions of the world, especially from those professedly Christian but who are nevertheless apostate.
Ques. Would we gather from @Acts 9: 2, that "the way" was already a known course of things? It says, "so that if he found any who were of the way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem".
J.T. I think that confirms what has been said. The word says, "so that if he found any who were of the way". The article indicates that the term was well understood as denoting the profession of Christianity, as we speak of it now.
Ques. You distinguished just now between Christianity and Christendom. Is it not very necessary for us to appreciate that Christendom has departed from the way?
J.T. Hence the necessity for separation so that as the way comes into our minds and into our phraseology it is quite intelligible. It includes the fellowship of God's Son, the fellowship of His death, the fellowship of the Spirit, and of the saints.
Ques. Does the expression "the way" suggest what is distinctive? I was thinking of the reference in the Acts to the Epicureans, Stoics, the Sadducees and the like? "The way" suggests something very different from all such.
J.T. It does. It is not that we designate ourselves, but as Paul says, "In the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers¬ God". It would be so regarded as over against those elements that you mention.
{3}
F.B. In @Genesis 24 Abraham's servant says, "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren".
J.T. That corresponds with what we are saying. Then in @Acts 18 it is said of Apollos, that he was instructed in the way of God more exactly, by Aquila and Priscilla. That confirms what has been said; it amplifies it and makes it most definite.
J.C.T. They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles. Is that characteristic of the way?
J.T. That would be the idea. The apostles as a company, as a set of ministers, were twelve. The Lord Jesus unfolded the truth, and instead of saying the teaching of Jesus, or the teaching of Moses, or David; it is the teaching of the apostles. "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers", and that, of course, held its ground for a long time. Paul and others came into it, but the primary reference is to the twelve, showing that Christianity is a system, and as we had yesterday it is set forth in persons qualified to join in the service. The Lord Himself inaugurated it and in doing so we are told He appointed twelve. Matthew tells us that, also Mark and Luke, but Mark says, "that they might be with him". He sent them forth to preach, and we are old also that He sent them forth by two and two. Then following on that we have seventy others, showing how the system became extended. The principle of twelve governs the position as setting out the manner, the Lord's way of inaugurating Christianity and establishing it in this world.
R.D. Is what you have in mind referred to in Hebrews as the new and living way?
J.T. We shall have to consider that a little; "the new and living way which he has dedicated for us", alludes more to the order, we might say, of the service
{4}
of God. That, of course, enters into the way, but more as dealing with certain features of divine service. The way is dedicated for us through the veil. The Lord has designated it for us in that way. I think it is well to differentiate. In @Hebrews 10 the special order, or, as I may say, the ritual of the service of God is in mind, whereas what we are dealing with now includes the preaching, and the unfolding of truth and principles publicly in the world.
J.M. Is that why the way, and those who are of it are exposed to persecution?
J.T. That is what we get here. Whether there was persecution at the beginning we cannot say; it arose very early, but the service was set up and the preaching was inaugurated by Peter, and @Acts 2 describes the facts relative to it and how the Lord added to the assembly, the term "assembly" being implied although not actually stated. "The Lord added ... daily those that were to be saved"; so that it is a matter of the public system of salvation which I think is more particularly in mind.
Ques. Is Paul, this great servant, brought into that in a special way, and for a special reason?
J.T. Yes, and that will come in more fully later. We are now dealing with Paul as opposed to the way and as attacking it; understanding what it meant and attacking it. It is not unseemly, I think, that we should take account of him thus because he is our apostle; that is to say, the apostle of the gentiles, he takes account of himself in that way. He says, "For *I* am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God", @1 Corinthians 15: 9. He disqualifies himself and makes out that he is the least of all on this line, so that he becomes an example to us in service in that sense. He violently attacked the way. He had been doing so for some time, as
{5}
it says, "But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest and asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem". He was an instrument of the devil who is the destroyer, and he does not endeavour to disguise the fact.
Ques. I suppose the attack against the way is kept up continually?
J.T. "Still breathing out" shows that it was an inward thing. The idea of breathing has to be linked with the use of the word in this book. The Holy Spirit coming in to inaugurate this way, to set it up, is viewed as the very breath of God. The very inwards of God are involved, so that we can see how Saul's attitude shows antagonism to God Himself, not only to the saints, but to the whole system of Christianity. It was expressed in those "called Christians". The word so used would not then include unconverted persons. People now refer to Christians meaning that they are not Jews, but the word 'Christian' in @Acts 11 denotes a really converted person, a true follower of Christ.
Ques. Is that seen in Stephen?
J.T. In him we come to something that marks an outstanding servant, one who, in a little while, though not an apostle, purchased to himself a good degree and much boldness in faith, and he became most efficient in setting out the whole truth that led up to Christianity. According to the record in @Acts 7 he ably set out the whole position from the beginning, from Abraham being called out by the God of glory; it is a wonderful unfolding, made with feeling, leading up to the first martyrdom of Christianity. I am sure you are right in saying that he is marked by all this of which we have been speaking.
{6}
Ques. Would those who were in the way be such as were seen walking with God before?
J.T. Well, that is so. You see it in Mark in blind Bartimaeus. It says he "followed him in the way". He was converted, and he recognised the claims of the Lord Jesus. It was a peculiar position, it was near to the crossing of the Jordan as entering Canaan proper. It says he "followed him in the way", not simply that he followed Jesus, but he followed Him in the way. No doubt primarily it would be the ordinary idea of a way, but the significance of it enters into what we have been saying. It was the way of Jesus, all that would mark Him.
A.C.S.P. Does the expression *the way*, as you have been referring to it, involve a beginning and an end, and would the beginning be in all the things that Jesus began both to do and to teach?
J.T. I would think that was so; a beginning and an end. The word *end* is not to be overlooked for it says, "Then the end", (@1 Corinthians 15: 24); that is, the end of all revelation, as it were; God Himself being the end.
P.S.P. Would the way, in the sense you are now speaking of it, be God's great answer to the exercise of the prophet when he said, "I know, Jehovah, that the way of man is not his own; it is not in a man that walketh to direct his steps" @Jeremiah 10: 23?
J.T. That is quite apropos to what we are saying. It is not in man, it is in God. The way comes out from God, and, therefore, the Spirit comes in @Acts 2 as violent breathing. It says, "And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting". Christianity thus emanates from God, its power from the very inwards of God, speaking most reverently. In Saul the breathing was on the line of destruction and violent opposition to God.
{7}
T.G. Would it be right to say that the Spirit of God is in the way as seen in Abraham's servant in @Genesis 24? He says "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren".
J.T. Just so. "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me", @Genesis 24: 27. It is a type of the Spirit of God. The servant in Abraham's house is unnamed. It is the Spirit that is in mind, really. It is a remarkable thing that it says "the man was astonished" at Rebecca. Her way was heavenly, I would say, and she is a type of the assembly. What we are speaking of is a question of the assembly.
R.A. It would appear from @Acts 9 that though the Lord is on high actually, yet in another sense He is here, for He says to Saul, "Why dost thou persecute me?"
J.T. Exactly. He is here. According to this record it is not simply that the Lord is coming in in the way He comes to us in assembly, as we say, which is by the Spirit no doubt. It was not by the Spirit that He came to Saul, but He was there Himself. It says, "Suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven, and falling on the earth he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, *I* am Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest". The Lord doubtless is active on earth, especially on the first day of the week, but in general that would be impersonation by the Spirit. He would use the Spirit in that sense, but that would not apply here. It is the Lord personally coming out from heaven to Saul. @1 Corinthians 15, verses 5 to 8 say, "He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also". So it is a real
{8}
appearing, a personal appearing of the Lord to him, hence making grace more evident.
Ques. Does the Lord appearing to Paul show that henceforth the movements on the way are directed from heaven and not from Jerusalem?
J.T. Quite so; from heaven and not from Jerusalem. The Lord Himself came out of heaven, which is another thing. I would say that it was a physical appearing of the Lord Jesus in His own Person, and nothing less than that.
G.H.P. Did Paul have a similar experience as recorded in @Acts 23? "But the following night the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage".
J.T. I would say the same thing happened. The Lord personally came to meet him and to speak to him. He made a great point of distinguishing Paul in view of all that He would use him for; the Lord had in mind that he should be thoroughly imbued with the truth.
J.O.S. Is the same thought in @Exodus 33 where Moses says to Jehovah, "Make me now to know thy way"?
J.T. I think it is similar. God answered Moses, "My presence shall go with thee", @Exodus 33: 14. Judaism as a system was not equal to Christianity, an angel being sent before to accompany them; whereas the Holy Spirit Himself is here on earth as sent down by the Lord Jesus personally from heaven. There is no other system or dispensation to be compared with Christianity.
A.W.R. Does *the way* involve Christ appearing now in glory?
J.T. He is appearing now as in the glory. John says of Him, "We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him", @1 John 3: 2. That will be as He is now in the glory. His body of glory is involved. We could hardly speak of it thus during the forty days after He rose from the dead, while He
{9}
was here during that time. It is after He went up into heaven that He is spoken of as having a body of glory; "who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory", @Philippians 3: 21. That our bodies should be like His body of glory is a wonderful thought, and is characteristic of Paul's ministry to the Philippians.
C.H. In @Mark 10 the expression the way appears in connection with the Lord's going up to Jerusalem, as though this way would take character from His anticipated glory there.
J.T. That is quite in keeping, I think, with what we have been saying, for what glory is involved! Saul had in his mind particularly, to persecute those who were of *the way*. It means Christianity in its fullest sense; that is, the testimony here of Christianity as in the Person of Christ, as He now is glorified and known by the Spirit here, not physically, or as He came out of heaven to meet Saul and to convert him. We should greatly value such a man as Paul, perhaps of whom there is no like.
Rem. Paul said, "Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?"
J.T. Well, exactly, and he saw Him as He is in the glory.
H.B. You distinguished between the corporeal appearing of the Lord Jesus to Paul, and His coming to us at the Supper. Would you mind saying a little more about that?
J.T. Well, one has often used the word corporeal, saying that the Lord is not with us at the Supper corporeally. The Roman Catholics would say, His real presence is there, and they make great assertions that they have the physical presence of the Lord, which, of course, is derogatory to the Lord. Nevertheless, the real presence is to be known at the Lord's supper, but in a spiritual sense, not a corporeal sense; this has to be distinguished. That is what is
{10}
so precious about the Lord's supper. "I am coming to you", the Lord says in @John 14: 18, and whilst it does not speak of the Supper there, yet it is in keeping with the thought. The Lord would come to us as we are ready. He would not take us by surprise.
G.H.P. Is the Lord's appearing to Saul here, and later when he came into the service, peculiar to him, or is there anything of that nature now?
J.T. I should not think there is. I should not like to assume that a corporeal appearance takes place. It could not be denied, of course, that it is possible, because divine Persons are always free to do what They will. I thought, however, that John's gospel shows that the appearings of the Lord to us in assembly would generally be by the Spirit, the Spirit being used for that purpose, and yet the Spirit and the Lord are to be distinguished. The Spirit is not to be discerned as the Lord personally; the Lord is the Lord, the Spirit is the Spirit. Although Paul says in @2 Corinthians 3: 17, "Now the Lord is the Spirit", that is not the Holy Spirit exactly. The Persons of the Deity, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, each have to be recognised severally at all times.
Ques. Why does Saul use the word 'Lord' so early in his experience?
J.T. Well, it might suggest how quickly the work took place. We shall be changed ourselves in the twinkling of an eye, so that there is nothing to wonder at in the rapidity of Saul's conversion and the effect of it. I do not know whether that is in accord with what you have in mind.
Ques. Would, the God of glory appearing to Abraham, as referred to by Stephen, bring him into the way and into the light of glory?
J.T. It is a question of a divine Person, the God of glory, there. Of course, the Father and the Son and the Spirit are not distinguished in the Old
{11}
Testament, although the Son is referred to. When God is spoken of, I would say, the Deity is in mind. It would be Jehovah; although when Stephen said "the God of glory" he meant the God that we know.
The idea of appearing is contemplated in the Scriptures from the outset, and we certainly should not be strangers to it, we should know something of it. The Lord had been moving in that way, according to @Acts 1: 21; Luke says, "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us". I suppose that allusion would mean that He was going to carry on in that way spiritually with the assembly.
We should now look at the remaining verses we have read. The Lord said, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, *I* am Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest. But rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. But the men who were travelling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but beholding no one. And Saul rose up from the earth, and his eyes being opened he saw no one. But leading him by the hand they brought him into Damascus. And he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank. And there was a certain disciple in Damascus by name Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, here am I, Lord. And the Lord said to him. Rise up and go into the street which is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas one by name Saul, he is of Tarsus: for, behold, he is praying, and has seen in a vision a man by name Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him, so that he should see. And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem; and here he has authority from
{12}
the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name. And the Lord said to him, Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel: for *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name".
These facts are mentioned, I believe, to show how much care was expended on Saul so that he should be qualified for the great work in mind, that he should be thoroughly qualified, especially to suffer. It shows how much the idea of *the way* enters into his life. What he was opposing, he now espouses. He is on the way. The Lord was on the way, but the apostle now espouses the idea and it characterises him throughout. He says later, "in the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers¬ God". It seems to me that this should come before us now, so that we should understand what Christianity means in the man who was specially intended to represent it; that is Paul.
J.C.T. Is the idea of authority linked up with *the way*? The chapter begins with the disciples of the Lord, then there is the recognition of the Lord by those in the city and then Saul comes under it himself.
J.T. That is a good point. The Lord said to him, "Go into the city", as much as to say, I have my people there. He had already said, "Why dost thou persecute me?" and that *Me* included Ananias and others of the disciples; so that the Lord, in taking up this great vessel, is stressing the idea of the assembly, which is His body. That thought runs into the Lord's supper, "we, being many, are one loaf, one body", @1 Corinthians 10: 17. The Lord said, "Go into the city". Saul might think that the Lord knew all about him and that was so, but the Lord wanted Saul to know that He had others in the city. An important feature of the dispensation is
{13}
that the Lord has others to associate with Him in the great operational matters He has in mind. Paul had to learn that and that he was to assist the Lord. In fact you almost wonder at the terms he uses denoting the Lord's own experiences.
Ques. Does the mention of the title 'Lord' about 13 times in the chapter suggest on the one hand that if we are to be found following in the way we must be subject to Jesus as Lord, and then on the other hand that the power of the Lord is on behalf of those following in the way?
J.T. I think that is clear. How the Lord took up Ananias is to be noted. "And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, here am I, Lord". The Lord is so far honoured in the conversation with Ananias, but we have to admit that we are often like Ananias. He says to the Lord, "I have heard from many concerning this man how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name. And the Lord said to him. Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel: for *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name". That is something to take account of. Do we question what the Lord says? Do we question what He does? Unless the Lord himself intervenes and insists on having His way how much damage may be done! I think it is a voice to us. In the case of Peter at Jerusalem, when he came out of prison they did not open the door to him immediately; it is evident that they were not ready. We do not travel with the Lord as fast as He does; there is a need of quickness, of doing things immediately. There should be no waiting; if the thing is clear, do it. There is so much that intervenes to
{14}
hinder what is of God in the operations He is carrying on, and were it not for His own special intervention how much havoc would be wrought; so it is here that the Lord intervenes and has His way. It says, after the Lord speaks to Ananias, "Ananias went and entered into the house; and laying his hands upon him he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me, Jesus that appeared to thee in the way in which thou earnest, that thou mightest see, and be filled with the Holy Spirit. And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he saw, and rising up was baptised; and having received food, got strength". We see how the Lord, if He is forced to it, will insist on having His way, and that means positive blessing; in this case, the positive blessing of the greatest servant. The Lord put Ananias right, and I believe it is characteristic of the way that difficulties, which seem hard to overcome, will be settled, if the Lord has His way.
J.C.T. Was this feature seen practically with Paul? It says, "And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God".
J.T. The thing should be done at once if it is to be done. With regard to creation we can understand how much would be done quickly, and what a wonderful product we have. So in the moral system, as the work of the Lord has to be done, it should be done quickly.
C.H. It would appear that Ananias got the gain of the Lord's adjustment, for he himself said to Saul, as recorded in @Acts 22, "And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name". He would help Saul on this line.
J.T. It shows how Ananias got help. What he says to Saul shows that this matter of washing is another thing that enters into the way.
{15}
J.M. Ananias was characterised by the grace which was operating. He speaks to Saul of the Lord "that appeared to thee in the way in which thou earnest". That way was not the Christian way.
J.T. So that Ananias, no doubt, is typical of subjection. We should all be glad to be like him, because he immediately did what the Lord told him to do. It was very necessary, because the Lord had already made an allusion to Saul regarding him. The city was where Ananias was, and if Saul went into the city he would be attended to.
J.H. You spoke of the importance of hearkening to the Lord's voice as to what we should do. Is it in the ministry we hear that voice and might we hold back and not answer to it?
J.T. There is much to be said about that, especially for those who minister, as to getting the right word. The Lord says, "Whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak", @Mark 13: 11. There is more than that in our own case now; we need to wait on the Lord for a word and be sure that we get it; and we should be ready to change if something happens which would indicate that another word is needed. There is much to be said about levitical service at the present time.
J.W. Does Mary the mother of our Lord excel in this matter of readiness? She says, when a very important communication is made to her, "Behold the bondmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word".
J.T. Very beautiful. It shows what a woman she was, and how perfectly she exemplified Gabriel's remarks as to her.
{16}
THE WAY (2)
@Acts 19: 1 - 20
J.T. There are certain further features which occur in @Acts 9 which should be noted as they also enter into the idea of *the way* and the bearing of it on those who serve. So we have these attempts on Paul's life in the paragraph beginning with verse 22, the saints coming in to help him. It says "the Jews consulted together to kill him. But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched also the gates both day and night, that they might kill him; but the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket". On his arrival at Jerusalem, we learn that the brethren were in doubt as to him. It says "all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple". Then we have Barnabas introducing him to the apostles, as if to remind us that leading men among the brethren are to be known; younger men are to make their acquaintance. We learn elsewhere that Paul went to Jerusalem specially to see Peter and spent fifteen days with him. Then another attempt to kill Paul occurred and "the brethren knowing it, brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus". In these occurrences the Lord is showing what He can be to those who serve Him, even in regard to their bodily condition and the danger of possible damage through satanic attacks. Then we are told, "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit".
It is to be noted here in @Acts 9: 31, that we have a definite section reached. Paul is secured personally by the Lord and taken care of by these brethren, and the Holy Spirit comes in in the way
{17}
of comfort. We are also reminded here of the metropolitan feature of the testimony at the beginning, how the assembly was regarded from that point of view. This section would seem to end it, although there is some doubt as to the plural word "assemblies" here. The definite change which affected the assembly as set up locally is seen in @Acts 14, when Paul and Barnabas definitely chose elders in *each* assembly. The idea of local assemblies, beginning with Antioch (@Acts 13), was definitely recognised in chapter 14, and the means of their support through eldership. This is the first reference we have to eldership in the assembly and it would be a part of *the way*. In @Acts 9 there seems to be a doubt about the use of the plural word "assemblies", so it is important to bear in mind that the Lord still maintained in Jerusalem something in the sense of control, which ultimately would be replaced by eldership in each local gathering.
A.H. Is the assembly to be guarded against this feature of metropolitanism?
J.T. The Lord was still recognising Jerusalem, but the probable use of the plural word "assemblies" may signify that the local idea was coming to light. Chapter 14, however, is definite; "having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed". Then Paul and Barnabas moved on as if the work were finished.
M.A.W. Has eldership in mind the preserving of things in an assembly way?
J.T. I think so; the local assembly character, rather than the unifying of assemblies, which the apostle speaks of to the Corinthians in saying "thus I ordain in all the assemblies". At the beginning of the revival in which we now have part, the gatherings were large, and were not at all limited in size,
{18}
but in recent times the Lord has raised with us the question of the size of gatherings. It has become clear that the matter was of Him and it has proved profitable that there should be limitations as to size. In the gospels it is said that the Lord divided those whom He would feed into fifties and hundreds, but fifty would apparently be the lower limit and would be the most profitable number for the exercise of assembly service God-ward. I think brethren have proved this, and it is to be hoped that it will continue. Years ago in this city there were only two or three gatherings, and in fact at the beginning there was only one, and it was large, and this was the case generally throughout large cities, but it has been found that limitations in the size of gatherings has proved helpful.
Ques. Do you think it wise to adhere to that even at special meetings when there is a large influx of visitors?
J.T. If it be a question of assembly service I should say, By all means. The gatherings should be kept small, as near as possible to what the Lord indicates, that is fifties; so that one was added here during this week-end because of the influx of brethren from different parts. In America the same thing is done and has proved to be profitable, for large meetings in these special times become unwieldy. Years ago at large meetings we used to have two or more cups, and more than one loaf, but the Lord has helped us as to the order which should govern assembly service, involving the size of meetings. I mention all this because of the reference we have made to the use of the plural word in @Acts 9: 31: "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit".
{19}
F.I. In what way would you say is assembly service increased by meetings of smaller size?
J.T. Well, take the prayer meeting here tonight; we shall have companies in the different rooms, but if we were all together in one room we would not have nearly so many prayers in the space of an hour or so. So too, in all services God-ward on the first day of the week, the increase is very great in what is for God.
F.I. The increase therefore is because a much larger number take part.
J.T. Yes, particularly in relation to the service of God, but a meeting for the ministry of truth like the one we are now engaged in may be any size.
C.H. How does all this bear on the subject of *the way*? Is it in view of the continuation of the testimony of the assembly in it?
J.T. What has been said is to indicate the link with the way. @Acts 19 is selected now, because of its allusion to the way. The word appears in verse 9. "And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly during three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus". The idea is also in chapter 18, and other chapters, but chapter 19 is particularly instructive in regard to the way, because evil was spoken against it. The chapter records the full thought of Paul's ministry and his way of carrying on, the wisdom that marked him, as we shall see. But first, it is to be noted, that the heavenly side of the truth is particularly in mind in this section; it is the Ephesian section, that which rises to the full height of God's thoughts. "God ... has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ
{20}
Jesus", @Ephesians 2: 6. That is a matter of great importance in *the way*, for it involves God's preparation for our heavenly place. That will be our ultimate position in eternity, of course, but God is preparing us for it now, and it enters into the way things are done.
In verse 1 we read, "And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus"; that is an allusion to servants serving in certain sections under the Lord, Apollos being a sort of free servant, not specially linked up with Paul, such as Timotheus, Titus and several others were. What is said as to the labours of Apollos brings out the independent action of the Spirit in the service. He was a man brought in at a particular time, who served on the lower line; the Corinthian line, which is to be looked at later. It is a line which has to be attended to, but Paul is serving on the higher line, the upper line; as it says, "having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus". So that what we have to say at this time will deal with the heavenly side of the truth, and the ministry that bears on that.
G.H.P. How is Paul's entry into the synagogue, as referred to in verse 8, to be understood? What is the force of it and has it any application to us?
J.T. It would be in accordance with *the way* beginning with the first chapter; indeed we might refer back to the end of Luke as regards the ascension. Luke reports the ascension in his gospel, and he also records it in this book, but in the end of Luke, as pointed out already, the ascension seemed to have taken place the first day that the Lord rose, as if the Lord would hasten it on account of the great matter before Him; the evangelical feature, and the gathering feature of the dispensation. So @Luke 24: 50 - 53 says, "He led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed
{21}
them. And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven. And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God". That seems to be an example for them in later years. The temple was recognised in the beginning, as it says in @Acts 2: 46; "and every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people". God, in mercy, I would say, and in patience toward Israel, continued to have His apostles and others serve in the temple with a view to securing a remnant. It would be a matter of sovereign mercy, the Lord securing a remnant, and so it is said of the Lord that He "added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved"; meaning the remnant of Israel. (See footnote in the Darby Translation). Paul constantly alludes to them, and that the gospel was for the salvation of the Jews, and I believe that is what is meant here. "And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly during three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God". But then the time had come to discontinue this practice, as we see also at Corinth. Here it says, "But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus". We should notice the word daily, it occurs in the second chapter, too.
Rem. He teaches two years in the school of Tyrannus, but he only stays three months in the synagogue.
J.T. Well, that would be a matter of apostolic or levitical wisdom in these matters, the way things
{22}
are done. The Lord helps the levites in what is done so that they act wisely. I should think the school of Tyrannus was an advantageous position. We can see what great work was done there.
A.M. The separation of the disciples here looked like a break-up. I wondered if there was anything like this in the present movement of the testimony; for instance in the stand that Mr. Darby had to take against those who opposed the truth.
J.T. It was a principle belonging to the way, and is so still. Paul speaks in @2 Timothy 2: 18, 19 of certain "men who as to the truth have gone astray, saying that the resurrection has taken place already; and overthrow the faith of some. Yet the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". He speaks of withdrawal, and that is what the apostle did in Ephesus. It was not a break-up, and we have had what looked like that during the last one hundred and fifty years or so. We had what might be called a very great break-up about 1845, but it proved to be part of the way. Brethren, especially Mr. Darby, withdrew at Plymouth on account of evil there, and then they withdrew at Bethesda in Bristol. Since then we have had other such withdrawals, for the word is, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".
F.K. Each separation, instead of being a break-up, really strengthened the position.
J.T. Certain had "gone astray, saying that the resurrection has taken place already"; and had overthrown the faith of some. "Yet the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only gold and silver
{23}
vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work". And then to complete that point the apostle says, "But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart. But foolish and senseless questionings avoid, knowing that they beget contentions. And a bondman of the Lord ought not to contend, but be gentle towards all; apt to teach; forbearing; in meekness setting right those who oppose, if God perhaps may sometime give them repentance to acknowledgment of the truth, and that they may awake up out of the snare of the devil, who are taken by him, for *his will*". As the separation takes place under these principles, I would say that the position is strengthened.
C.H. Is your thought that a feature of *the way* is the development of the truth of the assembly and the opposition that arises only leads to an increase on that line?
J.T. That is what we get here. The effect of the separating is clearly indicated. But it is well that we should go back to the beginning of the chapter, to look at the persons whom the apostle encountered. It says, "and finding certain disciples, he said to them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" Now before going to that point we should note the "upper districts". We have already touched on that as alluding to what is heavenly. The work of Apollos would be at Corinth, and on a lower level. Ephesus is on an upper level, alluding to the heavenly side of the truth. In this chapter Apollos is at Corinth and "Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus", and the sequel shows that Ephesus itself alludes to the
{24}
heavenly side of the truth, both as to Paul's ministry personally while at Ephesus, as well as the epistle he wrote to the Ephesians. So he says "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" This is a matter of great importance as an element in the way; that is, the reception of the Holy Spirit, and whether there are those who have in some sense believed, and yet have not received the Holy Spirit.
H.B. Do I understand that the reception of the Holy Spirit has to do with the heavenly side of the truth?
J.T. Well, not necessarily, because it has to do with Christianity as such in all phases. The Holy Spirit is essential to Christianity, and it is essential to the proper state of the believer under all circumstances. So that it rather comes up as a matter of importance doctrinally. Whether we all have the Holy Spirit is a practical challenge, just as the apostle challenged these brethren who were disciples of John.
C.H. So it is essential in order that we should have an intelligent part in all assembly matters.
J.T. Exactly, and then another thing, the lack of full light as to the Christian doctrine, which corresponds with what is current today among the so called sects, in which there is also much teaching that is not scriptural, and the persons affected are the subjects of the work of God, but they have not received the Spirit, because of the effect of that teaching.
F.I. I would like to know the difference between what is said of Apollos that he was "instructed in the way of the Lord", and then Aquila and Priscilla unfolding to him "the way of God more exactly".
J.T. Apollos comes into chapter 18 which is on the lower line as already remarked. Apollos had part in that lower line in his service, whereas Paul is now on the upper line. The question of the Holy
{25}
Spirit raised here involves both lines, Corinth as well as Ephesus, but in Paul's ministry at this particular point he raises this question, and undoubtedly it was in view of the remnant, the Israelitish remnant, that they might be added. And not only so, but that he might have a working set of circumstances in the work he was engaged in, which was part of the way. God has come out to work and He is taking on these people: He is not working by Himself. Divine Persons are not exactly working by Themselves independently; God would link on with His people. As persons are converted, born again and receive the Holy Spirit, God would link them on with what He is doing. I think we see that in @John 4, where the Samaritan woman is converted and comes to know the Lord as the Christ; she left her water-pot and went her way to the city, meaning she was herself a vessel, she belonged to the system immediately. I think that is the point in this chapter. He would have every one of us as fully fitted in the power of the Spirit, and Apollos was to be fully fitted.
Jno.G. Is it possible always to distinguish between a believer who has the Spirit and one who has not?
J.T. Well, it is not always simple. Speaking from experience it is certainly difficult. The confusion brought in through unscriptural teaching in the sects renders the position most difficult, and therefore we have to be more careful as to persons who are to be added. "The Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved", these are to be regarded as genuine.
A.C.S.P. Do you think we should be concerned to speak of the gift of the Holy Spirit in the preaching of the gospel?
J.T. I should say so. The word is, "and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit", @Acts 2: 38.
{26}
Some thirty-five years ago we had real conflict about this among the brethren, as to whether the Spirit was an element in the gospel. It certainly is so presented in Scripture.
F.B. Is the reception of the Spirit conditional? I was thinking of the scripture in @John 14, "if ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you".
J.T. And again Peter at the very beginning says, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit". That certainly is an evidence that the gift of the Spirit is part of the public proclamation of the gospel. The Holy Spirit is available to faith.
Ques. What place has baptism in this matter? It says, "they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus".
J.T. We are dealing with *the way*, and the matter of baptism comes into it, as well as the reception of the Spirit. So the apostle here raises this question, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed? And they said to him, We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come". I would say that these men were careless, because John the baptist himself spoke of the Holy Spirit, and from that time until the very time we are reading of, the Holy Spirit had been announced as a gift from God on the principle of faith. Why did these men not know? Is it not like what we have to do with just now? How ignorant people are of the things they should know!
G.H.P. Would the baptism of John link on with the previous dispensation, and is the point here that
{27}
we have to be careful to get the unique and distinctive feature of the present dispensation?
J.T. That is what I thought would come up at this particular reading, because it is concerning Ephesus, the most exalted feature of the truth. In Paul's letter to Ephesus he says, "That we should be to the praise of his glory who have pre-trusted in the Christ; in whom ye also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of his glory". Paul writes as he does, after having had opportunity in the prison at Rome of looking over the whole range of truth, and I believe it was ordered of God that the prison should fit into *the way*. We should all learn to be restful in meditating on the truth in view of ministering it and to weigh it all very carefully. This epistle written from Rome had, I believe, all these advantages, and Paul deliberately alludes here to the Holy Spirit, and how the Ephesian saints, as recorded in chapter 19, had received the Spirit *after* they had believed, not *as* they believed. It was not an automatic matter on their having believed, but was in the order of one, two, three, so to speak. First believing and then receiving the Spirit.
E.W. Is there a progressive link between the way of the Lord, the way of God unfolded more exactly, and the way of the Spirit here in view of the heavenly side of the truth?
J.T. Well, there is. The Lord is more prominent in chapter 19. God is more prominent in chapter 18. Hence we have the "way of God", but in this chapter it is more the Lord, and I think therefore it is a military chapter; that is to say, the truth is brought out on the principle of conflict, great conflict
{28}
as we have had it already, and the chapter unfolds it.
F.B. Would the scripture in Isaiah be in line with your thought -- "And a highway shall be there and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness", @Isaiah 35: 8?
J.T. Quite. And again, in the same book, "... thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it". It is as if God would say to people who are going in the other direction, "This is the way", @Isaiah 30: 21.
E.C.M. Is the Spirit essential to enable us to move intelligently to the heavenly side of the truth?
J.T. Well; and I would bring in such as the men in @Acts 20 who accompanied Paul in his labours and travels. Among them was Sopater, son of Pyrrhus a Berean. He would be careful about things, weigh matters over, and consult the Scriptures which for us now would be the Old and New Testaments. These men accompanied Paul, and among them was a Berean. Such would challenge things that might be said and if doubtful questions were raised a Berean would say, Where is the scripture? Paul says in writing to Timothy, "cutting in a straight line the word of truth", @2 Timothy 2: 15.
S.G. Would this heavenly aspect of the way correspond with @John 14, "I go to prepare you a place; and if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again and shall receive you to myself, that where I am ye also may be. And ye know where I go, and ye know the way"?
J.T. The Lord says in the same chapter, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life".
A.H. Is manhood in view of the ministry? It says the number of the *men* was twelve.
J.T. Quite so. So Paul asks, "To what then were ye baptised?" This also raises the question whether
{29}
household baptism is rightly understood. "And they said, To the baptism of John. And Paul said, John indeed baptised with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus. And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus". Notice "to the name"; not 'in the name', but "to the name" as in @Matthew 28: 19. Someone might say that ought to finish it, but it does not, for it adds, "And Paul having laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them". That is part of the way, the laying on of hands. We shall have it later, doubtless, in regard to Paul and Barnabas, that the brethren lay their hands on them. But here it is the laying on of hands in view of the coming of the Spirit.
Ques. In @Luke 11 the Lord speaks of the Father giving the Holy Spirit to them that ask him. What is the difference between the reception of the Holy Spirit on the ground of asking, and what is suggested here?
J.T. I would say that in that section in Luke prayer is the leading thought. The Lord was praying, we are told, "in a certain place". It came in immediately after the incident of Mary and Martha. Probably the Lord felt the peculiarity of Martha's case, and how pleasing Mary was, and how easily instructed in the truth; she sat at His feet and listened to what He was saying. But the Lord is seen as praying, and the inference is that He was concerned about Martha. If we had only Luke's record we might wonder whether Martha ever came into the truth, but if we consult John we see undoubtedly that she did, but the prayer recorded in Luke probably was the cause. So the disciples see the Lord praying and say, "Lord, teach us to pray" and the Lord immediately says, "When ye pray, say, Father". That is to say, He links them on with
{30}
the Father. And the passage runs on quoting the Lord saying, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" The idea of prayer therefore ought to be stressed in dealing with souls who have not received the Spirit. It is a question as to what their relations with God really are.
Ques. In @Luke 11 immediately after the reference to the asking for the Holy Spirit we are told that the Lord Jesus was casting out demons, and one is dumb. Would there be in that any indication as to the reason why some are not free to address divine Persons?
J.T. I think that is a feature of Luke, too. You wonder at times at the prayer meeting why people are not praying; you think they are dumb. They need to get the power of speech. Luke does not say that the demon was cast out, but that the Lord was doing it; He was casting out a demon, but the inference was that it was cast out.
E.C.M. It is said of Paul, "Behold, he is praying". Does that indicate conditions suitable for the reception of the Spirit?
J.T. Very good; "Behold, he is praying". It fits in with what we are saying now, and our brother's allusion to the Lord casting out the demon is important as following on what we, have already had as to prayer. "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" I was thinking of the apostle's remark in Romans, that the gospel is for the obedience of faith. That is, obedience in persons who had faith. Obedience and faith must go together. In @1 Corinthians 13 it is said that one might have power to remove mountains, but that would not be obedience. There might be faith, but it would not be obedience. Obedience of faith is what is needed.
{31}
A.G. In the gospels the narrow way is referred to and it says that it leads to life, and then life would be enjoyed in the Spirit.
J.T. Yes, the fruit of the Spirit.
C.H. Is faith linked with their hearing? It says, "And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus". Did they apprehend by faith that He was the centre of another sphere?
J.T. Yes, John directed people away from himself. It says, John stood. He had been doing things, but he now stands, and that would make way for Christ. It is Christ who now does things.
F.B. Is the recipient of the Holy Spirit always conscious of the reception?
J.T. I would say he is, in principle. It is difficult to see that he would not be in some sense conscious of it when such a great thing is happening in the soul; there must be something in the sense of consciousness.
Ques. Would you please say a little as to what is in mind in connection with the thought of baptism to the name of the Lord Jesus?
J.T. Well, it is just to bring out that the faith system is to the Lord -- to the name. There is also baptism "in the name of the Lord" (@Acts 10). That is to bring power into the soul. But "to the name" is making the Lord the object of faith. He is the centre of the system that has been established.
C.H. This seems to connect with Paul laying hands on them. It adds, "And all the men were about twelve". Is that a suggestive number?
J.T. We should not pass that, the number twelve, because Paul is now labouring in the light of divine operations, and Ephesus is especially in mind. The greatest thoughts are now in mind. When we consider the facts that are recorded here, and his epistle to the Ephesians, and what is said as to Ephesus in Revelation, we can see that the greatest facts are
{32}
in mind in the Ephesian sphere of operations. The number twelve comes in designedly in view of this, that Paul should have that number to instruct; he needed every one of them. It is a great operational or administrative number, and the laying on of hands means administration. "And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus. And Paul having laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied. And all the men were about twelve". It seems as if the stress is laid on the number, because it was in view of administration, and for that the Holy Spirit came upon them.
Jno.M. Are we to regard the laying on of hands as purely apostolic?
J.T. I suppose that is so with Paul, as also with the twelve.
A.H. Would the twelve men provide a concrete expression of the truth of the kingdom of God about which he reasons?
J.T. Just so. They were now constituted an administrative company, and Paul needed all that. I am sure he welcomed these men. How quickly they were brought into the thing! How careless they had been before, in that they had not even heard that the Holy Spirit was come! But when they heard what Paul had to say, they were baptised and were ready for it. There was immediate action.
A.W.R. Is the way perfectly furnished with the grace of the Holy Spirit; the name of the Lord Jesus and the personnel, the number twelve suggesting love's activities?
J.T. I believe love comes into the matter of twelve peculiarly, it really begins objectively.
{33}
THE WAY (3)
@Acts 18: 1 - 28
J.T. It is thought that what is recorded of Apollos will help us with the general bearing of this chapter which is on the lower line as compared with Ephesus which, as we have seen, is on the upper line, and it affords opportunity to speak of "the way of God". The chapter also speaks of "the way of the Lord". The way of the Lord doubtless would lead to the Lord's supper, but the way of God would lead to His service generally. The epistles written in prison by the apostle, that is, Ephesians, Colossians and Philippians, speak of the heavenly side of the truth, but do not deal with the Lord's supper or the service of God in the more public character of it, as the epistles to the Corinthians do. We shall need to come to that side, God willing, in the afternoon, because it belongs to *the way*, the Lord's supper being attached to the public testimony from the outset. We see this in the end of @Acts 2 where the disciples broke bread in the house, showing that it was never connected with the temple, but it is connected with the public character of the service of God. @Acts 20 would help us as to this, where it is said that the disciples were assembled, "we being assembled to break bread", implying the public character of the service. @Acts 18 is more initial, and refers to the roots of the work of God at Corinth. Apollos is seen in this chapter, and in the next chapter too, where it is said that he was at Corinth. The way of God is linked up with him in chapter 18.
We have much relative to Paul personally in chapter 18, and there is importance in its coming after Paul's visit to Athens; this should be kept in mind as dealing with the public character of the work of God. In what is said at Mars¬ Hill, Athens,
{34}
the creation comes into the way of God. Creation teaches us, as we see in @1 Corinthians 11, where it is said that nature teaches us. Our public or personal appearances, our clothing, our behaviour, all enter into the way of God. Clearly, the way of God is not intended to promote the fashions of this world.
H.B. Why does John's baptism come in here and in the next chapter also?
J.T. It shows how the Spirit of God links on with previous testimonies in the unfolding of the way of God. In the matter of clothing Peter tells us as to what is suitable in women and that necessarily includes the creational facts as to men and women. The man was first formed, an important matter, and although the word *man* represents both men and women, yet the man is also spoken of in contrast to woman, and he was made first. His ability and his great intelligence are seen in @Genesis 2. So that all the previous testimonies are involved in these scriptures and particularly in @Acts 17 where we have the record of Paul's discourse at Athens, a city which represented the learning of this world. This chapter following on that, clearly upholds the way of God, and Paul in his discourse at Athens calls attention to the way of God. He said, "For we are also his offspring". Men as such are that and consequently should represent God in their clothing and deportment. Then it is not only the way of God, but Paul also speaks about "my ways". He sent Timotheus to Corinth so that they might learn through him what Paul's ways were in Christ.
J.P. You referred to Apollos as representing an independent action of the Spirit. Would you mind saying a word as to how that stands in relation to Paul?
J.T. He is never seen as a product of Paul's ministry. We shall see in chapter 20 that the products of Paul's ministry accompanied him, but
{35}
Apollos is always viewed as by himself. It says that Paul had begged him much to go to Corinth, but his will was not to go. There were apostolic representatives or delegates, but Apollos never was such and therefore he should be taken as representing what is independent; not of course independent of anything that is right. We see how God can take up a man like him from Alexandria, that is, from Africa, an area which is not particularly distinguished in connection with the work of God, but the work of God was there and Apollos represented it, I think.
F.I. He comes in as one who waters what Paul had planted?
J.T. That is what is said, as if Apollos were recognised as a distinguished workman alongside of Paul himself.
F.B. Would you say that Priscilla and Aquila being found at Corinth was connected with the ways of God?
J.T. Yes, the governmental ways of God, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. They are regarded as Jews evidently so far, but whether they were Christians is not stated. There may have been something there, but they were in Rome and all Jews were commanded to leave Rome, not all Christians, but all Jews. They may have had some light, but it seems clear that they were enlightened through Paul.
G.B. Is there anything today that answers to what you have suggested as to Apollos?
J.T. It is remarkable how certain things have happened since the Reformation; the great work on the Continent both in Germany and Switzerland and in France and extending down to Italy -- a great many were affected, especially in France and Germany. That would not be an independent action, but would be in keeping with the testimony as it came into Europe. The testimony came into Europe
{36}
evidently at Philippi, apart from what there may have been at Rome. Paul had a vision, and he saw a man in Macedonia who was saying, "Come over into Macedonia, and help us". Paul was assured that he should go in that direction, which he did. These things that have taken place in Europe are in keeping with that. But in the sovereignty of God Africa also came into blessing. Then in more recent times the work extended to Australia, North and South America, and the West Indies; there may have been a suggestion of all this in the Lord's reference to "The queen of the south". This would point to sovereign action, independent action. The Reformation began in Europe, but the work of God in later years extended through other persons in England. Then America was opened up and Australia has been opened up since, and I would say that that is the kind of thing that we should be ready for; what would seem to be independent action, but capable of being linked up with the work of God as already existing, especially in Great Britain and this country.
C.H. That seems to be an important thing, that whilst there is the independent action of the Spirit, the thought is that it should be linked on with what God is already doing. There would seem to be no result unless this is done.
J.T. Well, that is what I thought exactly. The principle of co-ordination must be with us or else we shall become national. The work of God is one, and the centre of it is in heaven, which the epistle to the Ephesians opens out.
J.M. Have the authorities as ordained of God anything to do with the way of God, as we see in Claudius and Gallio in this chapter?
J.T. Yes, it is stated in @Romans 13: 1, "the powers that be are ordained of God", and we are to be affected in our consciences regarding them too. We would require, however, to proceed to consider
{37}
Priscilla and Aquila, and the facts in relation to them show that servants may go on with their ordinary employment and yet carry on in the work of God. Paul came to them, and because they were of the same trade, abode with them and wrought. So that we see how brethren can carry on the work of God, and yet go on with their business for necessary purposes.
J.C.T. Priscilla and Aquila were moving in relation to their ordinary occupation, but as available in it to God they are able to help Apollos into the way of God. They appear to come into contact with Apollos and later with Paul as moving in their ordinary occupation. Would God help us in this same way, do you think?
J.T. They came in contact with Paul and with Apollos in that setting. Paul was working in the same trade as Aquila and Priscilla, showing that God does not necessarily employ trained men for special purposes in the services, but servants can go on in their business and at the same time be with God in His work. God would be pleased to have them in His employment, and being in their ordinary business helps in a disciplinary way.
Rem. It is rather remarkable that Paul takes up this trade of tent making. He speaks in another place of being brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, which might suggest what we would call a university man.
J.T. He was a highly educated man as we see, but in the government of God he was brought down. At Corinth they said of him that his speech was contemptible. He refers later to the greatness of the revelations given to him, but the Lord causes him to be affected physically by having a thorn for the flesh, and although he besought the Lord that it might depart from him, the Lord indicated that it would have to stay.
{38}
Ques. Would the reference to Paul being with Priscilla and Aquila in their home and also in their business suggest that in the ways of God a good deal of our spiritual education in view of the assembly is obtained in those spheres?
J.T. Very good. Paul is the first to bring in household baptism. We are told that Paul and Silas spoke the word of the Lord to the jailor with all that were in his house, and they would greatly enjoy the transfer from the prison to his house. They were immediately brought in there and attended to in all the things they needed, the dressing of their wounds and so forth. Then we are told earlier in that chapter that Lydia had said to Paul, "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there". We are told too, that when Paul was let go from the prison, he went to Lydia, showing that the household enters into the service, and the conversations that take place in it enter into the service.
C.H. Does this chapter suggest that the ways of God with us are intended to contribute to our being in the way of God more effectively and more intensively?
J.T. Quite so. It must have been a disadvantage to Aquila and Priscilla being ordered to leave Rome, but they no doubt would be fitted for the great advantages that accrued through coming into contact with Paul at Corinth. They would no doubt accept the discipline and no doubt they grew in the truth on account of it. We can see how, from place to place, they are identified with the testimony, even in the use of the houses they had in the different places. The assembly was apparently in one of them.
C.H. Would the turmoil which arose under Gallio and the taking of Sosthenes and his being beaten
{39}
stand over against the comfort there would be in the households at Corinth?
J.T. Paul, having spent at least eighteen months at Corinth, would have become acquainted with household conditions amongst the brethren, and those of us who are moving about amongst brethren, endeavouring to serve, would have impressed upon us the value of household conditions. The jailor, at Philippi would normally be a hard kind of man but how beautiful the way he attended to Paul and Silas and set the table before them. It would look as if he laid the table himself. How beautiful it is that Christianity affects us in that way, in our houses, the household sphere being adorned in the case of the jailor to the extent even of setting the table.
A.H. Would the apostle have that in mind in what he says to the Ephesians that he taught them publicly and in every house?
J.T. Well, that corresponds with what we are saying, and Ephesus corresponded in Paul's service.
A.H. In making the remark I had in mind what was said earlier that at meetings like these we should not simply enjoy the time together and then go away and forget it, but what we enjoy together should have a place in our conversations in our houses.
J.T. Quite so. These occasions of three days and three nights, eating and drinking together, and living together, and conversing together, are blessed of God. They are more frequent in the Dominions than in the home country here, and I believe God would promote them, and the brethren would be thus thrown together. The truth is usually brought to bear on the households so that right conduct should be there.
A.C.S.P. Should it be noted that whilst Priscilla and Aquila moved to Corinth in the government of
{40}
God, it was as a result of their contact with Paul that they move on to Ephesus. I wondered if that would suggest that as the testimony has a greater place with us we hold things here more lightly?
J.T. Quite so. It is noticeable that they did move. We should note verses 18 and 19, "And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea; for he had a vow. And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews". You can see that Paul was peculiarly linked up with these two, and henceforth we shall sec that these two persons were equally profitable in the service, and wherever they went they were noted as having a house. Each is mentioned first equally often, which is remarkable, as illustrating what these two meant as linked with Paul here. It seems as if he took them with him as far as Ephesus.
J.E. What is in your mind as to Aquila and Priscilla being left at Ephesus?
J.T. Doubtless Paul had them in mind. He came back to Ephesus of course; it says in chapter 19, "And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus ..." It is difficult to say much beyond the facts that are given, but these two persons were distinguished in the service of God, especially in the question of care. We can see how skilfully they dealt with Apollos. It says of him, "*He* began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly". It would look as if they were linked together in the work and were useful persons.
{41}
J.E. Would the household serviceability at Corinth have anything to do with this move to Ephesus and help them in relation to it?
J.T. I would think they took Apollos to their house. I would not think they took him aside in the room. They were household people and they had experience in dealing with persons in that way.
J.C.T. Would the way of God be set out in their household?
J.T. I think so. What a great thing it was to have these two persons, and how the way of God in the house would be exemplified by them. Doubtless they would allude also to the time that Paul lodged with them.
S.G. Would Priscilla be an exemplification of the feminine quality as over against the twelve men at Ephesus?
J.T. Quite so, both are needed. You need the masculine and the feminine to bring out household qualities, although Lydia was by herself apparently. We cannot say whether she was a widow or not but she had the house and was a woman of business, a seller of purple. But Priscilla and Aquila represent both ideas, a man and woman in the house, which is the divine thought. The word is, "It is not good that Man should be alone", and that is always true.
E.C.M. Is that how the truth of the assembly is worked out? Both the man and the woman in the household?
J.T. I thought so, and it would fit in with Ephesus, because the truth of the assembly undoubtedly came out there.
H.C.L. Aquila is mentioned first here, would that be in connection with the way of God? In Romans where it is stated that they staked their own neck, Priscilla is mentioned first.
J.T. They both did it. It would appear that they were thoroughly one. It is an example for us,
{42}
especially to brothers and sisters who are married, as to what terms we are on with each other. I think Aquila and Priscilla set out the idea for us, and no doubt they were helped by the fact that Paul abode with them and worked with them.
Rem. The work of God moved out from this house as Paul served at Corinth. The work of God extended there, the Lord saying to him that He had much people in that city.
J.T. Paul abiding with them would augment what he was doing. He would find encouragement and strength in what he was doing. In @Romans 16 he alludes to Phoebe, a sister who lived at Cenchrea, and notes her characteristics.
E.C.M. Is it a point that, not only is the service of Aquila and Priscilla brought forward, but there is the readiness of Apollos to be adjusted by that service?
J.T. That is what is in mind in this chapter. How these two persons served Apollos and then the place he has, as we see in @1 Corinthians 3 where Paul refers to him. It says in that chapter, "for ye are yet carnal. For whereas there are among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man? For when one says, *I* am of Paul, and another, *I* of Apollos, are ye not men? Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each". These questions raised by Paul by writing to the Corinthians were intended to rebuke partisan feeling, as if the brethren were unduly influenced by certain persons; not Apollos and Paul perhaps, but certain local leaders, for there were local parties at Corinth that influenced the brethren generally. Then he goes on to say, "Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each. I have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase".
{43}
It is to bring God in. The apostle speaks of these servants just as servants although he goes on to say we are God's fellow-workmen, showing how the servants may be elevated to that position, even persons such as Apollos as well as Paul.
This whole chapter should be in our minds in considering our subject, so we should touch on the vision. Verse 6 touches on what servants have to go through in the ways of God. It says, "But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head; *I* am pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations". I allude to this, because it seems that those who are in service should bear in mind that it is the last moment, and matters are going to turn against men. I speak of judgment, that is what it means when it says, "Your blood be upon your own head". The judgment of God is serious. Then it goes on, "and departing thence he came to the house of a certain man, by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue". Notice here that this man's house is in view. Then it says, "But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptised". That is, the household is seemingly now in evidence; household baptism included.
J.G. Some have difficulty as to household baptism and I wondered if such could see that it enters into the way; it would help them to the acceptance of it.
J.T. Quite so. In Christianity there are the two ordinances, namely baptism and the Lord's supper. Baptism should be in the households of the brethren, but not the Lord's supper, except as a matter of physical convenience in providing a room for the brethren. The Lord's supper stands by itself, it marks us out for the service of God, but baptism
{44}
detaches us from the world, and the household is to be included in the whole position, not merely the head of it, but the whole house. Then it goes on to say, "And the Lord said by vision in the night to Paul, Fear not, but speak and be not silent; because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city". The Lord is now coming down to the actual locality and we have arrived now at what we spoke of yesterday; namely, the idea of elders. We see that local assemblies were set up on their own footing, as it were, and are able to continue. The apostles Paul and Barnabas had chosen them elders in each assembly so that the local assembly idea was set up. So the Lord says here, "Fear not, but speak and be not silent; because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city". The idea is that they must all be secured and Paul would not be content until he had secured them all.
A.H. What is the bearing of the word of God on the way of God? It is referred to in verse 11.
J.T. "And he remained there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God". I think we have already alluded to the work at Ephesus and the work at Corinth. The work at Ephesus takes on rather the militant idea, whereas the word of God in itself expresses what His mind is; and so it must work out in the way it governs the assembly; it would be the law of the house, for the word of God must enter into that; it sets out the principles that govern the assembly. Paul remained there teaching the word of God; teaching here is very important, teaching the word of God. John's gospel, as already remarked, is mainly marked by teaching, and in that gospel we see the Lord is first addressed by converts and is called "Teacher" and they desire to be with him, saying, "Where
{45}
abidest thou? ... and they abode with him that day". Mary Magdalene likewise recognises that He is her Teacher. Then we have a message sent by Him to the brethren, as if the Lord would take us on and send messages through us as we are taught.
A.H. Would the word in @Deuteronomy 33 as to Moses being king in Jeshurun illustrate it? The word is, "Yea, he loveth the peoples, all his saints are in thy hand, and they sit down at thy feet; each receiveth of thy words".
J.T. Very good. What a chapter that is! Yet the twelve tribes refused to go on in the light of purpose. Still the work of God stands and it can be said, "What hath God wrought!"
J.E. You referred to eldership. Would that be seen in the house of Stephanas? The saints were to be subject to such. Were the moral features of eldership seen there?
J.T. Very good. You are alluding to @1 Corinthians 16: 15. "But I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the saints for service), that *ye* should also be subject to such, and to every one joined in the work and labouring". That shows how households acquire power, moral influence and respect because they have been devoted to service.
Now it goes on to say in @Acts 18, "The Jews with one consent rose against Paul and led him to the judgment-seat, saying, This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law. But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, if indeed it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, of reason I should have borne with you; but if it be questions about words, and names, and the law that ye have, see to it yourselves; for *I* do not intend to be judge of these things. And he drove them from the judgment-seat".
{46}
Gallio was used in that way and so the apostle was thus relieved. These things are to be taken into account. It refers to the powers that be what they may do and what they may not do.
J.C.T. As being in the way can we rely upon the operations of God to restrain the powers that be? I was thinking of the word, "He ... reproved kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm".
J.T. Quite so. We get that throughout Acts. We shall see it in chapter 19 where the town clerk at Ephesus helped the apostle. The work of God went on and God was watching over everything and overruling.
J.W. Might we be helped in that connection by what we *are*? The town clerk at Ephesus testified as to Paul and those with him saying, "Ye have brought these men, who are neither temple-plunderers nor speak injuriously of your goddess".
J.T. Quite so. He becomes apologetic for the servants of God. 'They are not temple-plunderers', he says, and yet he says that the goddess fell down from heaven. That was a lie, but we can see how God overrules things. It says that "he who now letteth [or hindereth] will let, until he be taken out of the way", @2 Thessalonians 2: 7.
J.W. I thought that as we are faithful, our conduct and conversation should be a help if the authorities have to do with us in any matter.
J.T. Quite so. So that you have to regard the powers that be and be thankful for them. We have had evidence of the truth of what you say for the past number of years, and we have seen that God came in and affected certain men in the right direction. They are not with us, but they moved in the right direction, and everyone who knows the facts knows that God was in it.
{47}
J.C.T. God came in for Abraham with Abimelech in @Genesis 20. God said to Abimelech in that in, stance, "He is a prophet, and will pray for thee".
J.T. Quite. So that the word is, "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm".
{48}
THE WAY (4)
@Acts 20: 1 - 12; @Acts 2: 42 - 47
J.T. The verses in chapter 20 are read to link our subject with Paul's ministry, and it is clear that the Lord's supper is part of "the way". The verses read in chapter 2 may be taken as a primary indication of "the way"; that is, the way things were done. It refers in that section to the Lord's supper twice; "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (verse 42); and then, "every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people; and the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved" (verse 46). These remarks may be rightly linked with the references to the Lord's supper in the gospels, showing that it was an essential part of the divine way of the testimony. It is mentioned by Matthew, as is well known, also by Mark and by Luke, and then Paul in his epistle to the Corinthians mentions it very fully. It may be noted, that there it is a further communication from the Lord, and should be taken as the final word as to the Lord's supper. It eliminates some of the things mentioned in the synoptic gospels and it adds other things. This thought should be particularly under our notice on this occasion, because the Lord has revived the truth as to the Supper, and greatly enlarged on it for the edification of the brethren, and peculiar reference is to be made to the instruction furnished by Paul.
The section in chapter 20 is very formal, we might say, and has some particulars that should be specially noticed, calling attention to the length of Paul's discourse. Evidently his understanding or fight as to the Supper should be known in connection
{49}
with the mystery, as if the sections of Europe and Asia under consideration were somewhat defective in the matter of the Lord's supper. Indeed it may be said, that from the very outset of the testimony in this dispensation the Lord's supper has been a matter of controversy, and it is so yet. In hardly anything is the human will more in activity than in the matter of the Lord's supper. Whether it be in the mind of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, Presbyterian or Nonconformist bodies, or the many independent bodies, there is much misunderstanding and error connected with this truth. So it is of the very first importance that the brethren should be clear as to what Paul says -- what he says which is also in the Gospels, and what he adds to what is said in the Gospels. It is of all importance that we should be intelligent as to the Lord's supper, because it bears on the service of God.
E.C.M. In what way does Paul's discourse link up with the mystery?
J.T. Well, in using the word 'mystery', I mean the assembly of course. It is clear that the celebration of the Supper was to be in the assembly and not in any independent setting. The assembly is assumed to be there. So in the letter to Corinth the apostle makes some severe remarks as to what was being done there. He says in verse 17 of chapter 11, "But in prescribing to you on this which I now enter on, I do not praise, namely, that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse. For first, when ye come together in assembly ..." We should notice that it is "in assembly"; that is the reason why it has been linked up with the mystery, because the assembly is contemplated in the coming together. He goes on to say, "When ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit to it. For there
{50}
must also be sects among you, that the approved may become manifest among you. When ye come the together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper" [meaning that it should be, but it was not in practice]. "For each one in eating takes his own supper before others, and one is hungry and another drinks to excess. Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this point I do not praise. For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come. So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. For the eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body". It would be hard to point out anything that is so divinely instructive as that scripture, and it is very important that it should be understood. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding as to the Lord's supper; that has been the case from the beginning and is still so.
Ques. What is suggested by the term "in assembly"?
J.T. That the brethren are *so* gathered; they are not simply together as so many persons, but "in assembly", meaning that the idea of the assembly
{51}
enters into our being together. We are all governed by the truth of it, and so it says, "We, being many, are one loaf, one body". The assembly is assumed in the celebration of the Supper.
Ques. Is it the thought of Christ's assembly or the assembly of God referred to further down in @Acts 20?
J.T. I would say Christ's assembly, "my assembly" as He calls it, as if He regarded it as a special matter with Himself, and with us too. He says in @Matthew 16, "On this rock I will build my assembly". The Supper is said to be the Lord's supper, not God's supper, nor the Father's supper, nor the Spirit's supper, but the *Lord's* supper. I believe it is to this end that we have the statement as to the saints being viewed as priests of the Christ, as it is said in @Revelation 20, "Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no power; but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years". So that we can serve with Him, and He with us, as it were, on His own account. This is confirmed by the fact that it is called the "Lord's supper".
F.I. As to coming together "in assembly", is it that we are set together in the light of the assembly in an abstract way, or is there to be what is concrete?
J.T. Well, it is concrete, I would say; that is so as the brethren are there, or there could not be the Lord's supper.
F.I. It is not quite the same thought as in @1 Corinthians 14 where the whole assembly is said to come together in one place.
J.T. No. The Lord's supper can be celebrated in sub-divisions of the assembly, but each subdivision in principle is the assembly; it is only a matter of convenience to sub-divide. We do not need to
{52}
sub-divide for a meeting like this, or an address, or other meetings but for the Lord's supper.
S.B. Does the latter clause of @1 Corinthians 11: 34, show the importance of the truth of the assembly and of the Supper, and also the urgency of the matter? The word is, "But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order". There were other things evidently to be put right but as to the Supper they were to be adjusted at once.
J.T. That is to say, he eliminates other things which would be attended to in due course, but the matter of the Lord's supper was urgent.
Ques. Would you say what you understand by our being "priests ... of the Christ"?
J.T. It is so stated in @Revelation 20. Certain ones are said to be blessed, and they are priests of God and of Christ. In general the service of God is carried on towards God.
Ques. Are they available to Christ so that He can use them in the service of God?
J.T. That is right. They are available and usable, the qualities and characteristics of priests being attached to them; they are priests of God and also priests of the Christ. That would mean that Christ is God, but in a mediatorial position; He can be seen as serving, and they serving with Him.
Ques. In chapter 1 it is said He has made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, but in chapter 20 it is priests "of the Christ". Would you distinguish between the two?
J.T. I should. The preposition *of* I think is characteristic.
Ques. Would priests to His God and Father be more their function?
J.T. It would be that the object of the service is towards the Person, that is, God or Christ, but *of* is more a characteristic thought.
{53}
C.H. You connected the Supper more with the way of the Lord. Is that the thought in @1 Corinthians 11, the Lord's supper, or the lordly supper?
J.T. Well, that is further confirmation of what has been said, and so the Lord's day has the same character. The Lord's supper and the Lord's day are clearly linked together in that sense.
A.McK-p. Has the Lord in mind that His word as to the Supper through Paul is to take precedence over the account in the gospels?
J.T. That is right. Paul has the last word; it comes specifically from him. He says, "For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread", @1 Corinthians 11: 23. The "I" is emphatic, showing that it is the last word; and, of course, that comports with what has been said elsewhere, that the apostle had the ministry of the assembly and he completed the word of God.
Ques. Does the last verse of @Acts 2 indicate heaven's approval of the action taken in the preceding verses?
J.T. Yes, it is, you might say, a formal epitome of what transpired after all that had been said in Peter's address and the number of converts which followed. The whole matter is finished. Then we have in verse 42, "And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". The order would be that which is found elsewhere, "that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me", @1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 25. What is to be said further is, that in all matters relative to doctrine
{54}
where the apostles have to say to them, they are to be regarded as final; apostolic pronouncements or statements are final, and where they appear they should be first consulted in matters of discipline. Indeed in all matters they should have the priority, for we have in them the final word of the Lord, and in Paul's case it was the completion of the word of God. I do not know whether the brethren generally have recognised this, but it seems to me that it should be for us; and what is said about the Lord's supper is illustrative of the whole point of apostolic authority, that it is final and must have priority in all matters of doctrine, and indeed in everything.
F.I. Does Paul emphasise that in saying that he received it from the Lord *in glory*?
J.T. Quite so. The matter of the Lord's supper is illustrative of what has been said about all the Scriptures, that the apostolic epistles are final. The word of the apostles as representative of the Lord on earth in any matter must be final and have priority over all others.
A.B. Do the gospels relate also to a transitional period whereas what is in the epistles is final?
J.T. Exactly. Much in the gospels was transitional. They were probably written after the epistles. Another thing to observe is that the bearing of the gospels goes over the wall as has often been remarked. That is to say, they extend generally beyond this dispensation, whereas the apostolic epistles do not, but properly speaking belong to this dispensation and are intended specially to regulate it.
A.H. Does the close of @1 Corinthians 14 support what you are saying, "If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment"?
{55}
J.T. Quite so. It is remarkable how much Paul wrote and especially whilst he was in prison, as if the Spirit of God would give him the advantage of quiet and meditation for the great matter which was entrusted to him. The greatest epistles according to their spiritual authority or importance were written in prison.
A.W.R. Should Paul's writings colour all our thoughts?
J.T. Yes. If matters of doctrine or discipline come up or those relative to the Lord's supper, we must consult the apostles first, especially Paul; the Lord says as to him, "This man is an elect vessel to me". The Lord made a speciality of him; no other apostle had such advantages and privileges as Paul.
G.H.P. In that connection, would you say that in matters connected with assembly order or discipline, it would not be the thing to build any action on the Old Testament alone?
J.T. Not if it could be dealt with through the New Testament. There are things in the Old Testament of course that are not treated of in the New, but *wherever the apostles treat of a matter* their writings should be considered first, especially Paul's.
D.B. The apostle says in @1 Corinthians 10: 15, "I speak as to intelligent persons".
J.T. That confirms what has been said.
J.M. As to our being in assembly, is it what we are vitally and constitutionally as in @1 Corinthians 10, "we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf"?
J.T. Quite so. We have to recognise that, in the partaking of the loaf, it is representative not only of the Lord's own body according to @1 Corinthians 11, "This is my body, which is for you" but also of the saints as one body, and there is such a thing as our appropriation of them as well as of the Lord and His body.
{56}
E.C.M. Does that involve what is inward and promote body feelings amongst the saints?
J.T. I would say that. "We, being many, are one loaf, one body". The bread being alluded to in that way as referring to the saints would mean we have to appropriate the saints. I am using the word appropriate in the sense in which we would appropriate food. Hence the question is raised, Are brethren worth appropriating? persons nominally Christians, are they worth appropriating? are they clean? In the types we have food that can be eaten; animals that are clean and can be appropriated. Hence the word 'fellowship' implies that we appropriate one another.
D.I. There is a word in @1 Corinthians 11, "not distinguishing the body". What would you say as to that?
J.T. I would say it is the Lord's body, they might be erring as regards the Lord's own body. We may appropriate the saints, but we may fail in the matter of the Lord's own body, and so it is spoken of very seriously in chapter 11: "So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord". These remarks would have to be carefully kept in mind.
J.P. Would it be right to say, that it is necessary for us to appropriate one another in the way that you suggest before we can rightly proceed in the service of God in the assembly?
J.T. I think that is what is meant according to what we had yesterday, that the Lord in the days of His flesh constantly came in and went out amongst His own. When we come to the Lord's supper He waits so as to give the opportunity for us to appropriate each other. He gives us the opportunity to do things as if He would have pleasure in their being done by us, and then He comes in and acts with us.
{57}
In the service of God He leaves things to ourselves at first.
W.B. Were the divisions at Corinth the very opposite to the thought of their appropriating one another?
J.T. Just so, that is why it is stressed here. There were different companies there, which implied sectarianism: *sects* he calls them.
F.I. The appropriating one another would be in the way we come together in assembly, and we view one another as moving in fidelity to Christ, and there is no difference in our affections.
J.T. Quite so, except that in a practical way you make a difference in the capacity, spiritual qualities or growth of the brethren. The question is, What do we think of each other? We are bound to think of each other as the fruit of the work of God, and that implies that each one has the same status as a person, but when we come together we have to think of growth and stature, because the assembly implies that. The assembly is to be used in the great operational matters of God, and spiritual stature is of great importance in that.
Rem. So that John speaks of babes, young men and fathers.
J.T. Quite so. The scripture says for instance, "What hath God wrought!" You have to think of what that implies as to persons. There are differences in persons as we see in Moses and Aaron for instance, as compared with others. Paul and the apostles likewise as compared with others.
H.B. Is that why in @Acts 20 we get the names of the various brethren who were present. Is that the personnel and what they were?
J.T. Well, that is just the point. It is remarkable that you have those seven brothers spoken of. They are evidently what Paul would regard as his own work, and what heaven would regard as well. What
{58}
a work they represent, and their names are given. I think it bears just on what we are saying, "What hath God wrought!" What has He wrought in our time, and what use are we making of it, or are we declining? Can it be improved? All that enters into this matter.
G.B. Is the appropriation necessary in view of marital response to Christ?
J.T. Quite so. All that must be thought of. Paul speaks of certain saints as "my joy and crown", @Philippians 4: 1. What suggestions there are in that! Various statements are made pointing to the general thought of the work of God. What variety there is in it! what variety of stature, and of beauty and attractiveness too, but variety of stature. We should think well as to what we have been saying as to growth and stature and attractiveness, because when you come to the assembly personnel it is of great importance. In the types we have Rebecca, and then Abigail who is spoken of as a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance. The Lord surely has a right to think of that with us as to what there might be in each one of us, and in all of us together.
G.E. Are the persons brought in individually in their distinctiveness in @Acts 20 before we get the idea of being assembled?
J.T. Well, it certainly goes on to "we being assembled". We spoke of it on Lord's day, that divine Persons allow time to bring out what there is in formation. In @Luke 24 it says that the Lord stood in the midst: He allowed them to say so much, then the others that came in from Emmaus said something, and then the Lord stood there as if to approve what had been done so far. In John there is no question at all as to any irregularity, and the Lord says to them twice, "Peace be to you" as if to confirm what was there. It says, "When therefore
{59}
it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst". This means that the brethren were intelligent in the position, and were carrying on themselves before the Lord joined them. That I would say applied at Troas (@Acts 20). We have these brothers mentioned, referring to the work of Paul, and then we are told, "We being assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, about to depart on the morrow. And he prolonged the discourse till midnight". He evidently had in mind that something was needed there. According to Luke things were not quite right at Jerusalem, nor were things quite right at Troas, else why should the apostle have to say so much? Why should the Lord's supper have to be deferred? Why did they not break bread at once? It means that they were not up to it.
C.H. Is what you are saying as to personalities confirmed by what is said in @Luke 24 that Jesus stood in *their* midst, whereas in @John 20 it is *the* midst?
J.T. "The midst" in John would mean it is a general allusion to the assembly, but in Luke it is local, wherever the locality is. At Corinth things were not right and the apostle had to speak about the Supper; and in Troas Paul had to say a great deal and the breaking of bread was deferred. Eutychus fell down; he fell asleep, showing that things were not right.
F.I. Would that be the same as in @Luke 24, for apparently as the Lord came in these things were not quite right?
J.T. I think it would. @Luke 24 shows that things were not right. They were perturbed when they saw the Lord, whereas at first they were able to speak rightly to each other, and the two that came
{60}
from Emmaus said something which was good. The Lord *stood* in the midst. He did not sit, but stood, which would mean that He was there to look after things and to put them right.
A.C.S.P. Do the many references to time in Acts suggest the urgency of matters connected with the way?
J.T. Quite so. How urgent they are. I referred to @Acts 2 to bring out the primary position, that the breaking of bread should be considered as part of the way of God. It is part of the way of God that the christian dispensation is characterised by the Lord's supper. It is not that so many persons are there but they are governed by the thought of the Lord's supper, and it is mentioned twice in @Acts 2 "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". And then again in verse 46 to point out to us that the breaking of bread was in the house; it was not a temple matter, although other things were done in the temple, but that particular thing was not, it was reserved for the assembly.
F.I. It was not an ecclesiastical matter?
J.T. Just so. When here the Lord had done things Himself. He was working when He was here and continued after He rose from the dead. The great work of redemption is of course assumed, but He is doing His own personal work which included the subjective work of God in His own. According to Luke's first treatise He hasted to go to heaven, and it seems there as if He went up the very day He rose, but it is clear in the second treatise of Luke that He remained forty days. Then again, He is said to have been ten days in heaven before the Spirit came down. So we have first, the forty days, and then the ten days, which would be fifty in all. Why should that be? Why did He not send down the Spirit immediately after the ascension? He was
{61}
waiting for the perfecting of what was here in the disciples, His own work, what He had accomplished and then what He would do after He got to heaven. So now in @Acts 20, "the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed". Why did he discourse? Why did they not break bread immediately? There is the idea of divine Persons leaving things to show what they are, as in the case of Adam when Jehovah would have him name the creatures. God had pleasure in it for He did not change any of the names. So in Jerusalem the things they did were right and the Spirit came into a state of things which heaven could approve. That is a principle we all have to bear in mind.
S.R. Would you say that the features of Abigail were found with the apostles in @Acts 1 before the Spirit came down?
J.T. I would think so.
D.I. Do you mean that the assembly was in expression there?
J.T. I would say so. The interest of heaven must have been wonderful; it was occupied not only with what was up there, but also with what was going on down here, the Spirit being sent down by the Lord Jesus to augment it. Perhaps we do not think much of what is going on in heaven in alluding to what is going on on earth. There is the assembly, the greatest thing that God has devised. Paul enlarges on it in the epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians, what God devised in the assembly and the pleasure He would have in it from Pentecost after the Holy Spirit came down.
G.E. Is there some link between the necessity for Paul's discourse as indicating some defect and what is seen in Eutychus? Is it a question of our arriving at matters constitutionally and by growth?
J.T. Quite so. Therefore the ministry includes all that. One ministering is representative of the
{62}
Lord in principle; one who is gifted and is seen as caring for the saints with a view to the work of the ministry. The gifts given include shepherds and teachers who would care for the saints, and the ministry goes on with a view to the perfecting of the saints. So the breaking of bread being deferred in @Acts 20 means something was out of order, and the thing has to be held up till matters were adjusted. I believe Paul's long discourse meant that. What happened in the interval would show there was a state of things to be corrected, and when it was corrected they were comforted. It says, "And they brought away the boy alive, and were no little comforted". Paul himself went away after the breaking of bread.
J.C. Is there any significance in what is recorded as to Paul leaving certain things at Troas, his cloak, books and parchments?
J.T. Well, there may be, but the main thing now is a matter of prime importance. The creation in itself is not to be regarded in the same place as the assembly. The assembly is the great ideal of God and is what pleases Him. He is to be glorified in the assembly. "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages", @Ephesians 3: 21. When He was inaugurating it at Pentecost what pleasure He had in it, and that too before divine Persons come in. Before the Lord comes in, He waits, as it were, to see what is there; He comes in as we are assembled, but not immediately. The word in @John 14 is, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you".
W.B. Is Paul's embrace of Eutychus on the lines of our appropriating one another?
J.T. It is indeed. What a comfort it must have been to him. He says, "His life is in him", as if he were able to discern that. That is another matter,
{63}
persons able to discern where the brethren are. A spiritual person is able to do so.
J.P. Has God peculiar pleasure in the assembly because of its derivation from Christ?
J.T. Well, quite so. It is a divine matter and involves divine formation. It is the greatest thing in the universe. @Acts 2 tells us that the Holy Spirit came down and took the whole matter up and formed it and then the service proceeded, but there is development after that. Many years elapsed before the development was completed by the introduction of Paul.
H.B. Does the long speaking or conversing suggest that the adjustment had taken place?
J.T. Well, I suppose the conversation may have been needed in addition to the discourse. The discourse was interrupted by what happened, and then we see what Paul is capable of, what he did in the assembly in the way of putting things right. The conversation would include all that. Apart from what he said as being needed, they took the boy away, which is a beautiful thought, and they were comforted. He is only a boy, a young person.
C.H. Is the power of recovery seen both in @Luke 24 and in @Acts 20? In Luke it is the Lord Himself acting, and in Acts it is by the presence and activity of Paul. Is there encouragement in that there is a result?
J.T. There is a result. I suppose while we are down here the necessity for all this is present, but the idea of perfection must be waited for, as Paul says, to "present every man perfect in Christ", @Colossians 1: 28.
E.C.M. Would this be the way of more surpassing excellence?
J.T. Quite so.
{64}
Ques. During what part of the Lord's supper are the saints left free to act of themselves before the Lord comes in?
J.T. From the time we come in and assemble. The word *assemble* is used, and the Lord Himself assembled according to @Acts 1. Here the brethren are doing it; "we being assembled to break bread".
Ques. Would there be some part taken by the saints before the Lord comes in?
J.T. I should say there would. I think it is suitable that there should be a hymn, and perhaps something more, but there ought to be evidence that in a general way we are ready for the Lord.
W.B. Would the suggestion as to our being priests of Christ as well as of God support the thought of worship to the Lord Jesus personally?
J.T. Quite so. We are priests; it is a question of the spiritual ability that is there at the Supper. We are not simply believers, or members of the body of Christ, but we are priests as well, meaning we have skill for carrying on the service.
{65}
THE FEMININE SIDE OF THE WORK OF GOD
@Numbers 26: 33; @Numbers 27: 1 - 11; @Numbers 36: 1 - 13
J.T. I thought that the book of Numbers speaks of the work of God and hence we have references to the ages of the people. Whilst the family side is not so stressed as in other books, yet it is found in the passages we have read. The early part of the book speaks of persons being numbered from twenty years old and upward for military service, and from a month old and upward for levitical service, and later from thirty years to fifty years. These facts call attention to the latitude afforded to the work of God. The Spirit being here ensures that the work of God will proceed, and so the persons were numbered according to their ages and work given to them which was suitable to such ages. There is the equipping them for military service and in connection with that the idea of walking. Jehovah said He taught Ephraim to walk, which is a mark of growth. In going through the book the brethren will see that typically there is great latitude for the work of God in its variations, freshness and features of life.
It was thought now, that we might have opportunity to speak of the feminine side of the work of God which the daughters of Zelophehad suggest. It is a most interesting side, and necessarily leads to the truth of the assembly, but chapters 26 and 27 give us the thoughts of God as to marriage, and other family features in which God has His rights. It was thought that the Lord would help us to look at these scriptures having in mind what has been said. The subject itself, apart from the contents of the book generally, is of the greatest importance at the present time, because of certain looseness amongst the brethren. Firstly, there is the inheritance itself and how these women show an appreciation of it. And then the thoughtfulness and a sense of
{66}
responsibility in the fathers of the tribes in chapter 36, with a view to maintaining the inheritance of God intact according to the number twelve, into which it is seen divided up so often in the Scriptures. We see that in the twelve tribes, their relations affording so much latitude for love; love in the working out of divine rights. It is important to note that these women had a sense of the moral side. Their father had died in his own sin, he was not with them that banded themselves against Jehovah in the band of Korah; that is, he was not a man who would be led by a party spirit, and Jehovah recognises that, for sin is graded. He recognises what they say, and says, "The daughters of Zelophehad speak right". And then later we have the care of the fathers so that the inheritance should not be in any way dislocated, that the inheritance of the tribes should be kept to each tribe and the divine idea in the tribes, which involves love, should be thus maintained. Earlier we get the thought in the sons of Jacob, they are recorded as being 12, the numeral which involves the activities of love among them.
G.H.P. In referring to the feminine side, do I understand that you are referring to a certain feature of the work of God that should be seen in all the saints, not in sisters alone?
J.T. Quite so. I think that is one feature that runs through Numbers. The work of God is contemplated in its varied features, and we see the beautiful traits of love in which the rights of each and all are recognised.
G.H.P. Does what is suggested in the feminine side lead on to the enjoyment of the inheritance, whereas the masculine side is connected more with the military position?
J.T. I am sure of that. It is not only a matter of marital relations, but the larger and greater thought; the tribal thought is involved, and how the
{67}
inheritance of God is treasured in it. Selfishness is shut out by the working of love. In marriage and such like matters there is a tendency towards selfish ness, whereas love thinks of others, and that is what the fathers in chapter 36 represent, I think. The women were regulated as is seen in the fact that they were married according to the word of Jehovah.
H.B. What would answer to the thought of the inheritance today?
J.T. That is a leading point. It is said in verses 53 to 56 of chapter 26, "Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Unto these shall the land be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names; to the many thou shalt increase their inheritance, and to the few thou shalt diminish their inheritance; to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him. Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot; according to the names of the tribes of their fathers shall they inherit; according to lot shall his inheritance be divided to each, be they many or few in number". The lot requires that God's rights are maintained. It is not a question simply of each of the tribes, each to himself, or each to his family, but the lot decides, and that makes room for God's rights. In the size of the tribe there is the suggestion that the work of God is in mind. If there be any defects which might tend to reduce the number, all that has to be provided for. So that the work of God is bound to come into it, no matter how we look at it.
Ques. In what way are you viewing the tribes here? I can see that they are connected with the idea of love, there being twelve tribes, but practically for us what do they represent? Is it the saints in a local setting, or are you just applying the thought to the principle of love in its working?
J.T. It would be more the local idea, I thought, but all the tribes are in mind. They came into evidence
{68}
at the outset under extraordinary circumstances, having different mothers, which reminds us that no matter how incongruous we may think things are outwardly, there is nothing incongruous inwardly. In the book of Revelation we have a reference to the twelve tribes of Israel in chapter 7; then in chapter 14, where they are seen with the Lamb, and again in chapter 21.
F.I. Have you in mind that the administrative side as suggested in the twelve tribes goes through to the end, but that it is governed by the feminine thought?
J.T. Well, that is so. We see therefore the subjective side, and the work of God would peculiarly enter into that. It is the rights of God, His authoritative rights in the assembly. We have the presence of the Holy Spirit with us, and that will continue from the outset to the end of the dispensation; this results in the subjective side being maintained, and room must be made for that side. That is what these women represent, and God was pleased by their statements; they justify themselves in their words, for God says that they "speak right". This is a great matter as to the feminine side, that things that are said are right and free from selfishness.
A.E.D. The chief fathers would suggest that a mistake on the feminine side could have upset things; so that side seems to be very important.
J.T. The results of the choice made by these women are remarkable, and show how they were regulated by what is right; that is, by what God had prescribed. It is said of these women, "Even as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad; and Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their uncles¬ sons", (chapter 36). Their names are all mentioned and these verses show that they were regulated by the divine word, by the commandment of God. The subjective
{69}
right of the Spirit of God is shown in the commandments, as Paul said, "If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14: 37. That governs the whole of the epistle to the Corinthians.
Ques. In @Numbers 36 there is restriction to the one tribe; how do you understand that?
J.T. They are to be governed by divine regulations. They are to keep within their own tribe, and, of course, if each tribe followed the divine commandment they would all be governed aright. There will be no dislocation or one tribe having more than another unduly; the divine mind comes into it. We must remember that the tribes were not a mere accident, what happened was exactly what was in the divine mind.
J.W. Would we be encouraged to see here that there is true liberty under obligations? They can marry whomsoever they please, only in their own tribe.
J.T. Quite so. It is liberty under obligation. We see that worked out in @1 Corinthians 7: 39; where a widow is said to be free to be married to whom she will; "only in the Lord".
Ques. Each one is to marry in his own tribe according to @Numbers 36, how do you view the tribe in that particular setting?
J.T. I think it works out in relation to our responsibility; their responsibility was in the tribe, ours is "in the Lord". We must recognise that God's will enters into the smallest detail as well as into big things, and hence, whether it be a brother or a sister, and the question of marriage arises, there must be some recognition of God in what is happening, so that love may be seen to comply with the will of God. It is no accident. In @Romans 8 the Lord is said to be "first-born among many brethren". Well,
{70}
we may be sure that the word "many" means many, but it fits exactly with the divine mind. So it says in the previous verse, "All things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose". It is "work together"; the working goes on. It is a tribute to the power of God; what is of God goes on and it works together for good. The love of God is seen in the fact that all in our lives works together for good.
C.D. It says in @Exodus 2, "And a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi". Did he consider for his tribe in that way and do we see things maintained in Moses as a result?
J.T. Yes, you are speaking about Moses¬ father. What comes out there bears on this very point. It is a question of the levitical tribe and the accuracy of the mind of God working out in it. It says later on, "This is that Moses and Aaron". They are a product of the mind of God, they were needed in the testimony, and they were there, and though Aaron was three years older than Moses, which might entail some exercises with him, yet Moses had the lead.
S.B. These five women got light from God as a result of feminine exercise, and would not further light as to maintaining the inheritance in the tribe be forthcoming?
J.T. Quite so. These tribes run down the line for centuries, and God is watching over them from the very outset, for the result has to be in accordance with the divine mind. We can test that out by reference to the Scriptures and we shall see that the divine mind ran through and all that had to do with it were subject. It is a question of subjection.
J.M. Are these restrictions as to the tribes to conserve what is for God in its own setting?
J.T. Just so. God did what He had in His mind. Things happen in our histories that are incongruous,
{71}
but we can be sure that God will reach the result. The time is, however, long, and the divine thought as to the tribes runs through the Old Testament from Jacob. It runs through on the official side in Moses and Aaron, the royal side in David and Solomon, the prophetic side in various prophets, the apostolic side in Paul. These all touch on it. Then it is tested out in the book of Revelation, where in chapter 7 we see the number out of each tribe sealed. How interested God was in the sealing. Then in chapter 14 there were one hundred and forty-four thousand who are with the Lamb on mount Zion. There can be no doubt that the exact number are there. Then all that follows in chapter 14 is the moral side. How perfect it all is, as answering to the position of Christ Himself in view of the millennium. In the book of Ezekiel too, the same thing comes out. It says, "these bones are the whole house of Israel" (@Ezekiel 37: 11), and although they are all dead they are made to live. All this affords much food for the brethren as to the accuracy of the mind of God and the excellency of the work of God, and how important it is to be in the light of God's counsels and to be governed by them.
Rem. The apostle Paul in the Acts refers to "our whole twelve tribes serving incessantly day and night".
J.T. That is a remarkable reference. The question arises when we arrive at a peculiar crisis in our history, not only in humanity, but particularly in the assembly, as to whether things are working out in our souls and in our bodies and in our minds, to throw aside the enemy's work and to maintain what is of God in the testimony.
Ques. In chapter 36 the inheritance of the fathers is referred to several times. Does it suggest that we should value what has come down to us through the
{72}
labours and conflicts of our fathers, especially in connection with the truth governing marriages?
J.T. Well, that is good. The question of marriage is important. We use the words *mixed marriages* which is a reproach of course, but it is brought into evidence so frequently amongst the brethren. It is important that the will of God should prevail in our households, and that the principles of the world should be shut out, so that there is no seeking after money and the like, but the matter before us is households in the testimony. We see later how the widow had enough so that the man of God might live in her household. The Lord is helping us on these lines. God is taking care of these sisters. So as regards marriage, sisters may count on God to do the best for them, because He can do better for them than they can do for themselves. These women came out well and in a victorious way morally and they spoke well, as Jehovah says of them. They spoke in the presence of Moses and Eleazar and before the princes and the whole assembly. They were not afraid to say what was right and God approved it.
G.H.P. Is chapter 27 more the personal or individual setting, suggesting perhaps the family side, too? It says, "The daughters of Zelophehad speak right". Then is chapter 36 more the tribal setting? "The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well". Is that the truth carried forward to the assembly position?
J.T. It is the idea of nobility and intelligence -- Joseph's tribe. God would exalt His own thoughts in these tribes. We see here that spiritual men are acting, so that you have God's word confirmed in what they are doing.
Rem. These women must have been very lovable to God as coming forward here. In chapter 27 they were not looking for husbands, but for the inheritance
{73}
that God was bringing them into and they wished to have their part in it.
J.T. Very beautiful. The word is, "Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad ..." Then in verse 7 of chapter 27, the inheritance is spoken of and those who are to inherit. These women were seeking the mind of God. God's mind has been active on the point, and we want to be in it. We do not want to be selfish, but we do want to have part in the inheritance. They say, "Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the band of them that banded themselves together against Jehovah in the band of Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons". And then the question, "Why should the name of our father be taken away from his family, because he has no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father. And Moses brought their cause before Jehovah". We can clearly see that heaven is pleased with this whole position. "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, The daughters of Zelophehad speak right; thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them". It seems as if God was saying that they are entitled to credit. If a man fails as their father did, there may be blemishes and faults, but at the same time there is something good, and if God can approve us in any way He will do so. That is a great comfort to children. God is noticing here what the daughters of Zelophehad are saying and He would bring their father into prominence even after he died. It comes into evidence that there is something there that God can approve.
H.B. Do these sisters stand out as an example of the generation that goes into the land, and which had been produced by the exercises of the wilderness?
{74}
J.T. Well, exactly. We have the subjective idea there. Although they came by themselves they are insisting on the inheritance of their father, and God says that they speak right. The mind of God is maintained in that sense. The Spirit of God works in the saints thus; it is the power of God, and this is the way it works out. The result comes out in these women, and the Spirit of God refers to them again in chapter 36. In chapter 27 they are seen moving toward Jehovah, as it says, "Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad ... and they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, saying, Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the band of them that banded themselves together against Jehovah in the band of Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons". They are in a public position, but not in the sense of being before the world, but it is in the sight of heaven.
S.G. Is it not a great matter that these sisters spoke right? In relation to a crisis is it not important that there should be right speaking continually?
J.T. Very good. We are apt to speak loosely and when sisters get together, and brothers too, they do not always say what is right. We see in the book of Esther a group of women in the king's house, and they did not say what was right. It is better for brothers and sisters to be together and to speak one to another, for in that there is regulation and safety. This chapter is signalised as indicating the work of God, how it works out in asserting the mind of God; the inheritance goes according to lot, but it is according also to the comparative size of each tribe.
Ques. Would you say that, speaking practically, the exercises indicated in chapter 27 would need to
{75}
be taken up and entered into before we would be prepared to accept the restrictions mentioned in chapter 36? There is the desire for the inheritance but there is truth also in what is said and acknowledged.
J.T. Well, we come now to the fathers, the fathers of the tribe of Joseph in chapter 36. It says here that "Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well". It is a similar statement to what had been said about the five sisters earlier. Then it goes on to say in chapter 36, "This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry whom they please; only they shall marry one of the tribe of their father". They may marry 'him who is good in their eyes', as the footnote reads. @1 Corinthians 7 would correspond to this, that a sister is "free to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord". So that there is the idea of a personal choice, at the same time the divine regulation of "in the Lord" which must govern us at all times. Many stumble at that, and sometimes it is said that the person concerned is a Christian, but then are they in fellowship? That is the test. This is where the crisis lies. So it says, "Let them marry whom they please; only they shall marry one of the tribe of their father". Then the general idea comes in as applying to all, but "The children of Israel may possess every one of the inheritance of his fathers, and the inheritance shall not pass from one tribe to another tribe; for each of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep to his inheritance". The portion of each is part of the whole inheritance, and it is his, but he must keep to it. Then it says, "Even as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad".
{76}
Ques. Would you say that "in the, Lord" is to be understood in the light of what you have just been drawing our attention to?
J.T. I would say that. It is not simply that the person is a Christian, but that the bond is to be in the Lord, and that brings in the authority of the Lord.
J.C.T. Is it important that it is the tribe of the sons of Joseph in this chapter? I thought Joseph would be in principle the overcomer and would link on with the word in @Revelation 21, "He that overcomes shall inherit these things".
J.T. You are stressing the point that it is the sons of Joseph in @Numbers 36.
J.C.T. I was thinking that in Joseph we see very much the spirit of the overcomer and such comes into the inheritance.
J.T. We are told in @Genesis 48 that Joseph has one tract of land above his brethren and in the book of Ezekiel also we see that Joseph has two portions (@Ezekiel 47: 13).

RECOVERY AS SUGGESTED IN SAMSON'S HISTORY
@Judges 13: 24, 25; @Judges 14: 1 - 20; @Judges 16: 22 - 31
J.T. Inquiry was made as to Samson last evening, and it was thought that a consideration of his history would help on the line which has been before us already, especially the feminine side of the truth. There is no section of the book of Judges more interesting or more important than that which treats of Samson, especially from the standpoint of his birth and what led up to it, Manoah's wife being presented as more spiritual than her husband. The spiritual side was before us last evening as seen in the daughters of Zelophehad who knew how to "speak right" in the presence of God, also in the presence of Moses and the elders of Israel. Manoah's wife discerned that an angel had visited her, and while her husband said that some mischief would befall them, she asserted that, "If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and an oblation at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would he at this time have told us such things as these". She is a discerning intelligent woman, which in the main was in mind yesterday, and it is in mind now. The history of Samson proves the feminine side in that sense.
The enquiry last evening was as to whether Samson's exercises about marriage were of God; that is what should engage us first now. It is said in chapter 14 that "his father and his mother did not know that it was of Jehovah, that he was seeking an occasion against the Philistines". The inquiry yesterday had in mind the difficulty of connecting Jehovah's guidance with the matter, because of the
{78}
person being a Philistine. It is to be noted, among other things, that we have to consider the results, as recorded in the scriptural account, of facts bearing on the testimony. We have to take account of the *results*, and here they are very remarkable, and, indeed, triumphant, for Samson had a crown of life. His hair began to grow. The suggestion is of a great failure of a great servant, or we may say failure in the history of the assembly, and yet the recovering grace of God leads to the crown of life, because the growth of the hair implies life. Clearly the suggestion of a crown is there in the power that is seen in the servant after his recovery. It marked him at the beginning and it marked him at the end. We have at the end of chapter 13, "And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him. And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him at Mahaneh-Dan, between Zoreah and Eshtaol". The translator tells us that the Hebrew word for *moved* is expressive of powerful emotion, and the significance of this word being used in relation to Samson in his early days is very remarkable. What has been said about the crown of life should be before us now. Great failure has taken place in the assembly, but there has been recovery, and this recovery is marked by life, life in a subjective sense in the saints. So that the assembly will go to heaven triumphantly. There will be the overthrow of the world and that is taking place even now in principle.
Ques. It says, "the boy shall be a Nazarite of God from the womb". What bearing would that have on the matter?
J.T. Well, the truth of nazariteship is wrapped up in it. The book of Numbers teaches us about nazariteship. The Lord Jesus Himself was a Nazarite, and the truth of this is greatly stressed in Scripture.
{79}
Samson is clearly an illustration of it, especially in the great evidence of power flowing out.
Ques. Are you suggesting that the same spiritual vigour that marked the assembly in the early days is to mark it at the end?
J.T. That is exactly what I was thinking. The Spirit of God has brought about revival, and indeed that is the suggestion in the book of the Acts, for as early as chapter 9 the assembly had begun to wane and Paul is brought in there. The Lord said of him, that he was to be "an elect vessel to me" which reminds us of revival. The Spirit of God moved in Saul, and immediately there was freshness in the sense of revival, and the great features of the assembly came into evidence, implying power.
Rem. I have observed that in Mr. Stoney's reference to Samson in his book, 'Discipline in the School of God' he remarks that it was not the marriage which was of the Lord, but the fact that he was seeking an occasion against the Philistines.
J.T. Well, that is quite evident. It does not appear that the woman ever became his wife.
Rem. Mr. Darby remarks also that the desire to marry the woman was sin, but it would appear that he never married her.
J.T. Well, God watches over the history of His servants and prevents them from doing what they might proceed in; to that extent anyway, Samson is preserved until he actually discloses his secret of nazariteship. We cannot deny that Samson was a Nazarite until God forsook him. The fact that God remained with him proves he was a Nazarite until he disclosed his secret; indeed he did not know that Jehovah had departed from him. But his hair began to grow, and this would correspond with the history of the assembly at the present time, with the evidence of life, the realisation of life as amongst the brethren.
{80}
Ques. Do I understand that you regard this history as having a dispensational bearing rather than providing a precedent for individual action?
J.T. Just so, and it is a very important thing to see that there are such examples of God's overseeing care so that the truth of the dispensation is maintained. That is really more important than anything else. This dispensation should be understood, it is the longest of all the dispensations, and the most prolific, the most resultful, bringing out what God is in His grace and love and particularly in the preservation of His people.
Jno.G. Does the little power of Philadelphia correspond with Samson's hair growing?
J.T. I would think that. "A little power"; and "that no one take thy crown"; that is another thing to be on our guard against.
Ques. Earlier it was said to Smyrna, "Fear nothing of what thou art about to suffer". Might that be a word for us at the present time?
J.T. Well, I am sure that is a word. One has felt it lately in certain events that one has had to do with, that God says to us, "Fear not". It is a word that runs through Scripture, addressed to those who are on God's side. It is said to Joshua, and it is a necessary word in our disciplinary meetings, so that we are not afraid of consequences. We are apt to be too much afraid of how things will affect certain ones and to be influenced by personal feelings and the like; hence the importance of being courageous in carrying out the behest of God in His judgment in the assembly, whatever consequences may arise.
Ques. Would you say a word about Samson revealing the secret of his strength?
J.T. Well, it is the most sorrowful part of the history I would say, and shows that he was a man of like passions with ourselves. He is therefore an
{81}
example to warn us, that even although God may continue with us, there may be faults that ought to be judged. The presence of God is in evidence, for He is merciful and watches over us in all that happens. Yet He would insist on individual self-judgment, and collective self-judgment, because if individual self-judgment is maintained, God would say, 'I will be with you'. What He says in such circumstances is, 'I will be with you if you are with Me'. But He bears with us. Some day we may find that He departs, that while we may carry on the outward form of the service of God, He has departed from us.
M.B. Do we see a similar thing in Hezekiah's day when he disclosed what was in the house, (@2 Kings 20)?
J.T. God was very merciful to Hezekiah, yet He did not fail to judge the evil. So it is now, though He bears long with us. Indeed the history of the assembly at Corinth is the best example we can get of how God can bear with His people; and yet in time the judgment falls, so that Paul has to say, "Having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled", @2 Corinthians 10: 6. There were many individuals who were disobedient at Corinth. When the saints generally get right, then God will exercise judgment against the offenders.
As to the action of Samson and the part his father and mother had in the thing, we see that God prevented him taking the wife that was allotted to him first, before she is given to another. God intervened in all that, and Samson retained his power and is able to encase it in a secretive way so that it should be there and yet not understood. It has the character of the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. Parabolic ministry hides the truth, but the truth is there, and those who have a conscience, and who
{82}
have discernment, can see it, whereas the delinquents cannot, and do not, see it. That, I believe, is the principle of parabolic ministry, especially in Matthew's gospel.
J.M. Would you say something about the riddle in chapter 14 in that connection?
J.T. Well, it is clearly an allusion to the death of Christ and the sweetness of the ministry; and then following upon that the Spirit of God implies in chapter 16 the resurrection of Christ in what Samson did when he "seized the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and tore them up with the bar, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron". Added to chapter 15 this is a remarkable testimony to the power of God operative in His servant. In chapter 15 we have the great exploit of Samson. It says, "the Philistines shouted against him. And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and the cords that were on his arms became as threads of flax that are burned with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands. And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand and took it, and slew with it a thousand men. And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, a heap, two heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men. And it came to pass when he had ended speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-Lehi. And he was very thirsty, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou hast given by the hand of thy servant this great deliverance, and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? And God clave the hollow rock which was in Lehi, and water came out of it. And he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day".
{83}
It seems to me that chapter 15 suggests the thought of power, especially the Spirit's power, in the water by which he was refreshed. And then in chapter 16 the exploit at Gazah would point to the resurrection of Christ, and not only that, but to the purposes of God reached through it. It says at the end of the third verse alluding to the gates, that he "tore them up with the bar, and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron". The shoulders suggest strength, and Hebron alludes to what antedates the world and to the greatest thoughts we can have. All this lies in the Spirit, but then it is real power too, the masculine thought of power -- the two shoulders. Then we have the failure, which is of course distressing, but at the same time the chapters provide a great delineation of the truth, it may be in relation to the individual, but particularly dispensational truth. So it says the hair began to grow.
H.B. The principle of betrayal comes out twice in connection with Samson and the Philistines. Is that a feature of the world that we should be on our guard against? In the first instance he says, "If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle"; then too in the case of Delilah they got at him in a cunning kind of way.
J.T. Quite so. That all links on with what we are saying, and the heifer is a very suggestive thought; "my heifer" he calls her, although he never really secured her. The heifer is typical of great affection. It is a female thought suggesting great affection. In @Genesis 15, Abram was to secure a heifer amongst other creatures there, and I believe that whatever Samson may have understood, the Spirit of God means that the feminine thought was there, and in due course Christ would secure it; Christ would have the assembly. But God uses the Philistines to deny Samson what he sought. It must
{84}
be the assembly that is in the divine thought. And then Delilah is the wicked person. She is found in Revelation, in Thyatira. We have there an allusion to the wickedness of the apostate assembly. The Lord says, "Her children will I kill with death". Moreover she says, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow; and I shall in no wise see grief", but the Spirit of God asserts that her sorrow will be terrible.
H.B. So these two women would represent a feminine element that is in direct contrast to what we were looking at last evening in the book of Numbers in connection with the daughters of Zelophehad.
J.T. I think so; the link would be strong. It occurred to me this was an extensive subject which ought to be looked into.
Rem. It will be noted that with both these women there is a downward movement. In chapter 14: 5 it says, "And Samson went down" Then in verse 7, "And he went down"; verse 10, "And his father went down". In chapter 16: 4 there is reference to the valley of Sorek in contrast to the mountain in the previous verse. Is there a significance in all that?
J.T. Valleys are dangerous in that sense. All this downward movement is very suggestive, and probably refers to the history of Christendom, because it is all downward from the early chapters of the Acts. Paul began a revival and the Lord took him up in view of it, and then the long period of deflection, until the assembly got on to the level of the world; then the revival we have already spoken of. The Reformation was, of course, a little movement, something of God, but at the same time it did not go all the way. Protestantism does not go all the way. But it is a feature of the actings of the Spirit of God as here, that He will go all the way.
{85}
"He shall guide you into all the truth"; not simply what it is partially, but what it is as a whole.
Ques. In connection with Samson it refers at least twice to his avenging himself, whereas with Gideon he spoke of delivering Israel. Is that not a better thought?
J.T. It is indeed. Gideon is certainly set over against Samson in that sense, setting out the service of God before the Angel. Manoah's wife was more in it than he was and it is well that we should not forget that. It comes into Samson's history as well, as we see in chapter 14, and his father being mentioned by himself at times, would, I think, point to defectiveness in the position. It is necessary that the sisters should apprehend all this, so that they may not be onlookers, and simply followers of the brothers. They are to be fully in the truth, and there is no reason why they should not be. The Spirit of God makes much of women who have been leaders in the truth. Manoah's wife's name is never mentioned, but I think she represents the sisters as it says, "Let the women learn in silence". But she does not fail to meet a situation when it arises and to correct her husband.
W.H.T. Certain instructions are given to the women in Scripture.
J.T. I suppose that would be the subjective side. What we have in these Bible readings seems peculiar to the dispensation in our own times. Not that there is any difference in what we have from what they had in the early days, but I think the conversational idea would be more stressed now, and it has given great opportunity for instruction. Whilst it says that the women are to learn in silence, yet they are to learn. They are not to be ever learning and never coming to a knowledge of the truth. I believe in this passage in @Judges 13: 23, Manoah's wife alludes to the sisters because she asserted what
{86}
is right and it was in reference to a remarkable movement which is said to be wonderful, really foreshadowing the service of God.
Rem. One of the instructions given by the angel to the woman is, "and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines". That evidently was what God had in mind.
J.T. That was what was intended and it is said twice over of Samson that he judged Israel twenty years. Firstly in @Judges 15: 20, meaning that he was doing it then, and secondly in @Judges 16: 31. "He had judged Israel twenty years". So that he was not always slaying Philistines, for he was judging; it is a very great matter to have judgment executed and made clear amongst the brethren; things are to be made right and regulated by the truth.
Ques. You were speaking of exploits; would that be seen in some of the exploits of the men of God, in the history of the church, who yet had not the full light of the assembly?
J.T. There were exploits before the Reformation by many dear men of God whose hymns we have, showing what they were. Then in the Reformation itself, how much there was! But not until the Spirit of God asserted Himself amongst the saints do we get the truth of the assembly.
A.B. Do we see Samson's history closed to some extent in verse 20 of chapter 15? It says, "He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years", and then in chapter 16 we see he immediately turned from a straight path.
J.T. I think God is showing how thoughtful He is of His servants, and that although they may fail grievously, yet He is pleased to say of Samson before his failure and imprisonment that he judged Israel. It says, "He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years".
{87}
A.B. Does the Spirit of God in that way give him credit for what he did?
J.T. And then in the end of chapter 16, "He had judged Israel twenty years". The exercise of judgment is stressed in this servant, and the mention of it reminds us how considerate God is of us, and how ready He is to give us credit. Even if there be failure, the things we are credited with are present and asserted and indeed emphasised.
J.M. What does Samson's remarkable death mean for us?
J.T. I think it is the humiliation that belongs to the position, but we should carefully notice what is said. "But the hair of his head began to grow after he was shaved. Then the lords of the Philistines gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands. And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god has given into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, even him who multiplied our slain. And it came to pass when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house, and he played before them; and they set him between the pillars. And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Let loose of me, and suffer me to feel the pillars upon which the house stands, that I may lean upon them".
I think we have to learn a little here as to the man himself, in view of his death, the humiliation attached to it, dying with the Philistines, although there is victory in that. He died a prisoner, a blind prisoner, but as to himself he was personally free, and I believe that is what he means when he says to the lad that held him, "Let loose of me". He was free of the world's limitations. The presence of
{88}
this lad, of course, was a suggestion that he was a prisoner, a blind prisoner, needing to be guided, but he says, "Let loose of me". He shook off whatever elements of the world remained with him, so as to be free in the exercise of the power of God. I think we will do well to think of that, and to consider whether we are free in our souls and able to shake off whatever elements of the world remain with us, so as to use the power of God as granted to us.
F.B. It was nazariteship that did that.
J.T. Quite so. Samson did it himself. His word, "Let loose of me"; would be as much as to say, I do not need you any more. He knew he was going to die, undoubtedly.
F.B. In connection with the present phase of this dispensation does nazariteship not free us from anything binding?
J.T. By our failure we may lose the characteristics of nazariteship, but as returning to them, as I believe Samson returned in his soul, we free ourselves from what hinders God's power working in us. He knew what was going to happen and said, "Let me die with the Philistines!".
Ques. Would his return to nazariteship be indicated in the hair beginning to grow again?
J.T. That was the beginning of the thing. The revival we have part in now involves that features that are distinctively of the world are to be shaken off; for instance, clericalism, which is a sorrowful feature of the declension, had to be repudiated. This little lad is, so to say, a suggestion of that. Samson was to be free of all that now. We ought to be entirely free of that element.
W.A-s. There is a resumption of liberty with God indicated in Samson's prayer.
J.T. Yes, it is very beautiful. He says, "Suffer me to feel the pillars upon which the house stands, that I may lean upon them". He had in mind to
{89}
exercise his power in leaning on them. "Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and upon the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who looked on while Samson made sport". It is a most distressing thought! Samson making sport for them! "And Samson called to Jehovah"; he is now free; "and said, Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may take one vengeance upon the Philistines for my two eyes". He is rather small, but still he is speaking to God; he is asking for vengeance for his eyes. He is going to die, of course, but he is praying to God and seeks to exercise the power he had been accustomed to. "And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood (and he supported himself upon them), the one with his right hand and the other with his left. And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines! And he bowed himself with might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain in his life". It seems to me, that there is great victory in this, whilst fully recognising the humbling circumstances; and we must discern that we are in very humbling circumstances since the revival.
J.O.S. Does the fact that the Spirit is not said to have come upon him imply that now there is inward power in Samson?
J.T. I think @Judges 16:3, presents a Colossian thought. Hebron is in view; that which is before the world. In Colossians the Spirit is not mentioned in a personal way, the power of the Spirit is more in view.
J.W. Why does the loss of his eyesight weigh so heavily upon him at the last?
{90}
J.T. Well, I suppose he felt that was the great shame of his position; "my two eyes". He spoke of them both. He evidently had a judgment in that sense, which we all should have if we are awake. "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee", @Ephesians 5: 14. It is a question of the light that belongs to the position which we are in.
J.C. Samson's name is mentioned in @Hebrews 11 as one who was an overcomer.
J.T. He is amongst those who come in toward the end, where the writer says, "the time would fail me ..."; there is so much to say. Another beautiful thing is, that there is so much to say, we have hardly time to say it; so much to be done too. The servants of the Lord have not the same latitude or opportunity that they used to have. Time is one of the scarcest things.
Jno.G. Is the hair growing again, and the power which is subsequently seen, an answer to the feminine side that you have been stressing? They refer to the subjective inward side.
J.T. I think it would; a suggestion that the assembly is coming to light; and there is power. Philadelphia, I suppose, would be that phase of the thing, as the Lord said, "Thou hast a little power"; and then what goes with that, "and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name". Further He says, "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown"; He has the assembly itself in mind, and says, "Behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet", (*thy* feet, not my feet), "and shall know that I have loved thee". That is a beautiful touch in Philadelphia.
{91}
LOVE UNDERLYING PRIESTHOOD
@Exodus 4: 12 - 17; @Exodus 21: 1 - 6; @Exodus 28: 1 - 4, 40 - 43
J.T. It is in mind to consider love as the dominating element in priesthood. That is why the verses in chapter 21 were read because in Exodus Aaron is not formally called a priest until after love is introduced. This is according to a principle which was set out in Adam in naming the creatures of God as they came to him, for the thing was named as it was there characteristically. Aaron is much spoken of before, but is not formally named as priest until chapter 28. This comes in after chapter 21 which refers to love. Aaron is introduced because he had suitable qualities, but particularly brotherly love as seen in chapter 4. Love is seen in chapter 21, and it is to be noted there because of its ascending, descending and horizontal activities. Aaron is seen as having a quality that Moses professed to lack, that is, the power of speech. God said to Moses, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God". What is in mind to consider now is the love system, a system in which there would be God, and Moses representing the word of God, and then Aaron, not the priest, but the prophet. It is a question of speaking, of what God would say in a public way in order to make His mind known and to assert His rights. It is important that things should be said rightly. It will be noted that in chapter 7 Aaron is
{92}
seen as a prophet. As it says, "And Jehovah said to Moses, See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet". Thus a system is set up in view of the deliverance of the people out of Egypt, and so that, in that deliverance, God is rightly represented systematically. In Aaron God would have one with the ability to speak so as to convey in words what Moses thought. Then we learn in the history of the book that there were priests in Israel; we are not told who they were or what qualities they had, but there were those who had that place in Israel (@Exodus 19: 22 - 24). When the time came for performing the service of priesthood, Moses selected youths to do it, as seen in chapter 24, but they were *not* called priests, as if God were saying that youths are not the full idea. Aaron is to be the full idea, because of his power of speech and his being a Levite. It is not simply that he was a Levite, but he was *the* Levite, and also he was more than that, he was the brother of Moses, and that is the point which is brought out in chapter 28. The thought is not simply that Aaron should perform the office, but that he should serve God as priest. The thing was there, not simply that he was officially that for convenience, but the thing was there. He was to serve as a priest, and his sons were to serve as priests. That is what is in mind and that we may have before us that love is to prevail, also skill and intelligence; that is to say, all the qualities of priesthood are to prevail. We should acquire skill, which is the ability to do things for God, to represent Him here to men. That is something which is essential to the service; God giving ability to us and the power of speech, for He has made our mouths, He has given us too of His Spirit; and, we are told that no one can say Lord Jesus but by the Spirit. So that the Spirit is really the power of priesthood. If we are to carry on the service of God it is to be in the power of
{93}
the Spirit; not simply that we know the doctrine, but that we are to have spiritual power.
H.B. God is able to take account of what Aaron would feel in his heart when he met his brother; "He will be glad in his heart", God says. That may perhaps be somewhat testing for us.
J.T. Quite so. It is not that he was just glad in a formal way, which is often the case, as may be indicated in a formal shaking of hands, but the greeting was to be the result of the condition of the heart.
Rem. Peter in his first epistle seems to follow the line you suggest. In the first chapter he speaks of the soul, "Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to unfeigned brotherly love, love one another out of a pure heart fervently". Then in the next chapter he speaks of the priesthood.
J.T. I was thinking of him, because he is the one among the apostles who uses the word *priesthood* and distinguishes it in the sense of what it is to God. The service is Godward. It says, "A holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2: 5. Aaron is clearly intended by the Spirit of God to represent the idea, not simply that he had the office of a priest, but that he was a priest. We know well enough from the facts recorded that Peter went through severe exercises of self-judgment which lead up to priesthood; he was brought to the acknowledgment of sin so that he could act thus for others. No doubt, the apostle Paul had this in mind in connection with him. @Galatians 1: 18 says, "I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days". No doubt he would gather up an idea of what was current among the brethren in those times, and of what priesthood meant in Peter. Peter on his side spoke of Paul as "our beloved brother Paul" (@2 Peter 3: 15), and he made
{94}
much of his writings. Paul had to rebuke Peter and he accepted it. These things are to be understood and practised amongst us if we are to proceed in the testimony. When he had to speak to the Galatians as to the wrong doctrine that was current among them, he said, "and all the brethren with me" (@Galatians 1: 2). If there are matters amongst us which are questionable, and which required to be adjusted, then the brethren ought to be brought in. It is a question of love, and we will only descend to argument unless we love, but if we love we can act like Peter and Paul towards each other.
F.I. Is that principle seen at the end of Galatians where it says, "considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted"?
J.T. Very good. "Ye who are spiritual", it says in @Galatians 6: 1. It is clear that the judaizers were not spiritual. They would demand the last farthing, whereas the Lord shows the need of accepting repentance, and that "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them" (@John 20: 23), showing that one who has sinned is set free by forgiveness.
F.I. What you quote from @John 20 follows the Lord breathing into them and saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit". Does that mean He breathed into them His own Spirit?
J.T. That would be the idea exactly. What a lot there is in that, the breath of Jesus; how the Spirit of Jesus would disarm resentment of an offender, because we are to forgive one another.
A.M. Paul speaks at the end of @1 Corinthians 12 of the way of more surpassing excellence and opens up that way in the next chapter which speaks so much of love.
J.T. Well, that is the point, I believe. Chapter 13 is morally the greatest chapter in the epistle. He is speaking about gifts in chapter 12 and, of course, gifts are important, but sometimes assume too much
{95}
importance in our minds, for we may exercise gift and be short of love. Paul says, "And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing". So, if we have not love, however much we may have in other ways, we are nothing.
C.H. So chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians, which deals with love, comes between chapter 12 where we have the gifts and chapter 14 where we see the gifts, especially the gift of prophecy, being exercised.
J.T. That is it. The apostle had in mind to write much, and had already written much, but in the ministry he was thinking of the persons who were involved in the discipline. Chapter 5 brings out the discipline and Paul told them what to do in the exercise of it, but then there was really more in the man than even Paul intimated, because he was restored quicker than it was expected he would be. He had sinned grievously, but he was able to meet the thing in confession and so quickly was he restored that the brethren did not keep pace with the restoration, and this is often the case. We must keep pace with the recovery and confirm it. So the second epistle is to bring out the need of confirmation and that should be in the judgment of the brethren at Corinth, so that the brother should be set free in freedom, and be allowed to breathe, as one might say, the Spirit of Jesus, the spirit of forgiveness. The Lord breathed into them so that they should be qualified to forgive. Why should we continue in hardness and in legal exaction amongst ourselves when the Lord's mind is that we should all be set free?
C.H. In the second epistle in connection with the man Paul says, "On the contrary ye should rather shew grace and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief. Wherefore
{96}
I exhort you to assure him of your love". Would that be what is in your mind that true priestly activity was shown towards that man?
J.T. That is what I had in mind. Before Aaron is named as priest we see love is an established principle amongst the people; love in all its features. It is seen in the Hebrew bondman who is typical of the Lord Jesus Himself. In spite of all the restrictions He could say, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free". He can say it plainly. Love as a principle is not set up by statutes, but it is there as evidenced in what the bondman said. The Lord says to the disciples, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13: 35. The thing is there in quality and quantity too.
C.H. The assurance to Moses that his brother had love in his heart would help greatly to remove the spirit of rivalry. They each had their distinctive part in the system.
J.T. The sovereign action of God is seen in the selection of these servants; Moses would be a real test to Aaron because Aaron was his senior.
S.B. Do you think that love in activity would bring the brethren into any matter current amongst us in order to confirm it?
J.T. Quite so. We should not reach a conclusion to any matter if we did not bring the brethren into it. We must bring the brethren characteristically into it.
Rem. If we did not do so we would be on party lines.
J.T. It is objectionable to heaven if we hold to certain things and do certain things in any legal way. Love is the antidote to all that and it never fails.
F.I. If a brother moving on priestly lines and acting in love goes to an erring brother and as a
{97}
result there is restoration, is it necessary to bring that to the brethren?
J.T. No, not necessarily, but that raises the question of priesthood. Where there is a leprous condition the priest is to come to the person involved or he may go to the priest, but the priest is always supposed to be available. If the priest be there then there is hope of recovery, and hence where it is the case of a brother who has perhaps been withdrawn from and he is restored in measure, that is to say, restoration is progressing in him, the next question is, Who shall take the lead in the case? It is a case for the priest, not just a priest, but *the* priest, whoever he may be that takes the matter up let him show that he is a priest. It is said of Aaron, "That he may serve me as priest", not simply to serve as an official priest, but *as* priest.
J.S. Do we see the thought in Paul towards Philemon and then in the brotherly love of Philemon towards Onesimus?
J.T. Quite so; "If he ... owe anything to thee put this to my account", Paul says. That is important as showing that the thing is there before it is named. There was something in Philemon of which Paul knew, and on account of this he approached him as to restoring the slave Onesimus to his place, not only in his household, but in the assembly. That would be the great point that he might be restored as a brother in the assembly.
C.D. In @Luke 7 the Lord could say of the woman, "She loved much". As she came to Him, the Lord as Priest could discern what was there, but Simon could not understand it.
J.T. It is a case of what was there. The Lord says, "Seest thou this woman?" (verse 44). The person who is in question is there and that is a great point. There are priestly qualities there too and the Lord says, "Her many sins are forgiven; for she loved
{98}
much". The idea of forgiveness must precede the idea of recovery. She, at any rate, had loved and it was seen in Simon's house. It was a chilly place for such a person but she was there nevertheless.
D.I. In @Deuteronomy 15 the idea of a creditor comes in relative to the year of release and he is to relax his hand. Would that come in here?
J.T. Very good. The idea runs through Scripture; it is the power of love. So in that quality we have the idea of the priest set out. It is not only that the thing is there abstractly, but the person in whom it should be seen is there.
R.A. Would you distinguish a little more between the idea of an official priest and what is said of Aaron, "He shall serve me as priest"?
J.T. I was referring to the history of Aaron in Exodus. God took him up to set out this great thing. He is brought in as a necessary substitute, because Moses was not equal to the important part. It shows what God is. He is not giving persons up. He is making the most of them and if Moses cannot do what Jehovah requires He affords a helper who is his brother. He says to Moses concerning Aaron, "When he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart", @Exodus 4: 14. That would set Moses free in his soul, and then God enhances the whole position in chapter 7 by saying to Moses, "See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh", not a god, but God. God is to be represented in that man personally, and then speaking of Aaron it says, he "shall be thy prophet" (or spokesman). It is not thy *priest* but thy *spokesman*, for that was the thing in which Moses said he was defective, that he could not speak. Afterwards he became a great speaker, a great writer too, but God made him all that. Therefore, the thought is to bring out what the priest is, and so Aaron's history is given right up to chapter 28 to show what he was and then he is seen as priest. Jehovah says there,
{99}
"That he may serve me as priest", but he is the brother of Moses all the time.
G.H.P. In @Luke 10 we have the official priest looking on the man, but passing by on the opposite side, showing that the brotherly feeling was lacking. Over against that we have the Samaritan bringing out the idea of what a person is.
J.T. Just so; all that was needed was there. He did not pass on after he had done what was necessary, but he took the man to an inn and he stayed there till the next morning, showing that love was there. It will not do to say that we have done all that was possible. That will not always do. We must go the whole way and so the Samaritan went the whole way in love.
E.H.M. Was Elihu in the book of Job a priest?
J.T. I would say so. His service brought out what Job was. Finally Job is able to say to God, "I know that thou canst do everything" (@@Job 42: 2), and then God constituted him a priest because he was to pray for his friends.
A.B. Job was greatly enriched after his recovery.
J.T. I think in all that is being said we see how God would give us examples of priestly energy in men, for that is what is in His mind. It is what is here in the power of the Spirit. Speaking reverently, the Holy Spirit needs the saints that the service may be carried on. In the creation a divine Person operated, but in Christianity, and indeed in all dispensations, we see men available to be used in the service.
C.H. Whilst it says of Aaron first of all that he can speak well, in chapter 7 he is to speak representatively. Do you think that is important?
J.T. I do indeed. We have a representation of God because Moses was to be God to Pharaoh. He was to bring out the features of God. How far he went in that it is hard to say. We have to be on
{100}
our guard as to how we speak of Deity. There are those who are brought near and I believe Moses was especially distinguished in that way for it says, "the form of Jehovah doth he behold". He was not an ordinary prophet even; he was beyond that.
G.H.P. Referring to what was said about the Samaritan going the whole way, and that it will not do for us to say we have done all possible, because love never fails; sometimes we are not able to gain a person and withdrawal is considered necessary. Is there something wrong if that is the case?
J.T. Well, of course, that is prescribed for in the Scriptures. @Hosea 4: 17 says, "Ephraim is joined to idols: leave him alone". That must be done sometimes. We have the Lord's own words, "She hath done what she could" (@Mark 14: 8), so that is a formula which you can use. Brethren, perhaps, have gone the whole length according to the Scriptures and even according to love; they have done their best, they have visited the person concerned, and yet nothing has resulted, for it is a question of the state of the person. How many are malformed! What can you do? The malformation is there and it requires an act of power on the part of God to change it, and God is not always pleased to do that.
F.B. If love were more in evidence there would be more for God.
J.T. I would think so. The great matter now is to decide how to meet the situation which has arisen on account of lawlessness having come in. We are on the border of the apostasy and the position is a most difficult one, and yet there is a way out. I believe God is dealing in His governmental ways, His sovereign ways, to modify conditions so that our way is not entirely shut up. We can go almost anywhere today and break bread and minister freely, which is a great comfort. God has done that
{101}
for us, and has used men so that the brethren are free to go on in His service.
Ques. In regard of the point raised about persons not being gained, would the thought be that we are constantly to be in the spirit of the bondman and prepared to serve at any time as opportunity offers?
J.T. The priest is there, which is a point of great encouragement. Numbers is not the priestly book, nor is Deuteronomy; Leviticus is the priestly book, and the priest is always there, showing that God has means of carrying on for He has *the priest*. You can always find the priest.
Ques. The man in @Luke 10 is spoken of as being half dead, and is that not the kind of case that tests us most? The official priest passed by in @Luke 10, but if the man had been dead he would perhaps have known what to do.
J.T. I think the true priest, one who could meet a half dead case, is contemplated in @Romans 7, and he himself had to reach that point. It was a matter of coming to it in his own soul and no doubt Paul reached it. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law" (verse 25); it is with the *mind*. If we were to tax our minds more, our pure minds which are contemplated in @Romans 12, we might find solutions to some local difficulties, so that, instead of depending on brethren a long distance away, we could look around in the local meeting or the nearby meetings, to get the nearest man and see what he can do. Hence it says, "Ye who are spiritual" (@Galatians 6: 1), they are really priests. A word of wisdom would perhaps be the solution of the difficulty, and get to the source of the trouble.
J.O.S. The word in the prophecy of Haggai is, "Ask now the priests concerning the law", (@Haggai 2:11).
J.T. Just so; and in Malachi also we have, "for the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his
{102}
mouth they seek the law", @Malachi 2:7. That is seen in Aaron.
C.H. In matters of difficulty we find often that the priestly feelings that do exist are inarticulate. Is that not where a priest like Aaron would come in helpfully?
J.T. Quite. It says he can speak well. We find illustrations of that throughout Scripture, and I believe @1 Corinthians 13 is the solution, for love never fails.
R.McG. What would be the particular point in what it says, "He can speak well"?
J.T. Because it was what was needed then. It would seem as if Aaron had prayed to God. Moses does not allude to him earlier, but Jehovah knew him. How did He know him? Speaking reverently, God had heard him say something to Himself.
Ques. The thirteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians to which you referred makes much of love, and that chapter follows the reference to the gifts set in the assembly. Are the gifts to be exercised in the priestly way of which you spoke?
J.T. Yes, we have *helps* and *governments* referred to in chapter 12. "Governments" are more defined, but "helps" are indefinite, but still the word is noticeable. Love would go all the way in the exercise of these gifts.
Ques. Would the much detail in connection with the priestly service associated with the restoration of the leper show how essential love is?
J.T. What a lesson there is in all that! It speaks of the leper standing outside his tent door and the number of days he had to do it and all the other details there are. It is, I believe, to show the skill of love. It is important not to bulk things together, but to do them one by one, and we see that in all the detail connected with the case of the leper.
{103}
C.H. It is encouraging to see that in the case of the leper the thing goes on to completion, for the man as cleansed is eventually anointed and thus able to take up things himself.
G.H.P. The word in the prophet Malachi is striking, "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge". We might have thought it should say, "speak knowledge". Are difficulties sometimes prolonged by wrong speaking and the inability on the part of some to keep things?
J.T. And then "at his mouth they seek the law"; the thought of the mouth is beautiful. One has often thought that it is God's masterpiece in human creation. Mark makes much of the power of speech. The Lord groaned when He beheld the man who was defective in his speech; in @Mark 7 we read, "And looking up to heaven he groaned, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right". The man there could henceforth act like the daughters of Zelophehad, of the tribe of the sons of Joseph, who spoke right. It is not simply that we can enunciate our words, but that we can speak right morally.
R.McG. Do the friends of Job represent the official side which is often found lacking?
J.T. I think they had themselves in mind, and how great their fathers were, and so forth, whereas Elihu had none of that. He was a man full of matter received from God, but he waited for his elders to speak. I believe the book of Job brings out the system which we are now in, and the priestly service is in mind in the way he deals with those who had been unbrotherly to him. Then God blesses him. I am sure that is how things would go. God is blessing those who are abiding by the truth.
S.M. We are told that the daughters of Zelophehad "speak right" and here it says that Aaron
{104}
"can speak well". Have you anything further to remark about that?
J.T. "Who hath made man's mouth?" Jehovah said. He knew all about Aaron and says, "I know that he can speak well", and that was not simply because He had made his mouth, but He had heard him speak.
J.M. Have we special help now in speaking, the Holy Spirit having come? I was thinking of @1 Corinthians 2: 13, "Words ... taught by the Spirit".
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. Christianity depends on the Spirit, but it depends also on the saints, and the Lord made a point of that, when He said, "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever", @John 14: 16. The word *Comforter* is to be noted. It is a Comforter down here because Christ is up there. That is how the system is set up and that is how it continues and will continue. The Spirit is to stay until the divine will is fulfilled and then the saints will go up, for the Lord is coming for them. The Spirit does not take us up, the Lord is coming Himself, which is a beautiful touch. He comes for us and we join Him up there and so we shall be for ever with the Lord. The system is complete as to its present effectiveness and another system will be taken on presently, but the system of Christianity is the most perfect of all, the longest and the most resultful. Every member of the assembly is to come into it.
S.B. So that whilst we have the help of the Spirit, we have to fit ourselves into these things. It says of the Spirit, "*He* shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you".
J.T. It shows how the system is perfected here. Colossians tells about the perfecting of *every* man.
{105}
That is what the apostle had in mind and it is what is in mind now; the thought is great and we should be industrious in order to fill our part in it.
S.G. Is what you are calling attention to seen in Peter and John in @Acts 3? Peter said to the lame man, "Look on us", and further, "What I have, this give I to thee".
J.T. Quite so. So @Exodus 28 is the great priestly chapter and we have not finished it until we have the sons. The sons are touched on from the very beginning, but Aaron is in view almost throughout. The sons are seen as having caps, which means intelligence, and then the breeches or trousers both for Aaron himself and for the sons. So that there is the power of truth working out in holiness. I believe that is the idea in the clothing. The first part of the clothing is wonderful. It is the unfolding of wonderful things of which we should never tire. The present is a young men's time and a young women's time. Holiness and sobriety are so much needed in order that the priestly service should go on. Youths are used in chapter 24, but in chapter 28 it is Aaron's sons. The dignified thought is the sons of Aaron and they are to serve with their father, but the clothing is remarkable because it tends to produce sobriety and holiness in our service.
{106}
READINESS FOR SERVICE
@Luke 24: 28 - 36; @John 20: 14 - 23; @Acts 1: 15 - 26
J.T. It is in mind to show that the Lord, in joining the disciples, as seen in John and in Luke, affords opportunity for them to do things, to act for Him, and the facts show that they acted with intelligence. John's record has this clearly in mind. Luke's record is less definite as to the Lord coming, in fact it does not say that He came, but that He "stood in their midst". I, says, "as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst". The things they were saying were right. Then further, Luke, in the Acts, shows that the number of the apostles must be complete, the number being twelve. According to Acts the Lord remained with them for forty days after He arose, and then went up to heaven and was there for ten days before He sent the Spirit. There was enough time for them to show that they had right exercises and intelligence, and specially that the Lord's designed number should be completed.
These remarks are made having assembly service in mind. God has recovered this truth to us and has greatly enlarged upon it in the ministry, yet one notices that there is considerable hesitancy in going forward on the principles mentioned, before the Lord joins us at the Supper. There is considerable hesitancy and awkwardness and lack of intelligence too, and hence time is lost. It is hoped that these scriptures, with the Lord's help, may help us as to the great matters that are involved in the service of God, so that we may be ready. One of the things that is mentioned in connection with the Passover, which preceded the institution of the Lord's supper in the gospels, is that the disciples were to make things ready, and the suggestion of containing vessels is mentioned. There is the pitcher of water and then
{107}
the cup, and these bring out the idea of vessels which would be usable in the service of God.
G.H.P. Is your thought that we are lacking in these features of the truth to which you refer and hence the slowness and awkwardness as we come together?
J.T. Just so. And that is seen not only in the Lord's supper but also in what follows on the first day of the week, and in other meetings such as prayer meetings and Bible readings. There is a great waste of time because there is not readiness for service in a priestly way. The epistles to the Corinthians are intended to govern assembly service externally and hence the great stress on order in those epistles, especially the first. So it is a question of the priests being ready.
C.H. The disciples and those with them appear to have had great experiences, but they did not seem to connect them with the Lord coming to His own, for when He came they did not discern the fact, nor were they ready for Him.
J.T. They were not ready in Luke. John, however, in his account shows they were ready. There is no need to wait. It would be perhaps wise to take up Luke first, as he indicates adjustment is needed.
F.B. You stress the idea of intelligence; how is that to be obtained?
J.T. Well, that is a good question, and Luke helps us particularly as to it. He tells us that one of the disciples, seeing the Lord praying, asks, "Lord, teach us to pray", @Luke 11: 1. And then, apostolically, Paul is the great servant whom the Lord uses. Of course, all the apostles were qualified, but Paul is peculiarly qualified to teach. So in view of the Lord's supper, which is the great initial feature in the service of God, Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons"; that means, that he takes them up abstractly, as if they were that, and he had a great
{108}
part in teaching them. It was through him that they were converted. The Lord said to him in Corinth, "I have much people in this city". We also see Paul and Barnabas in the service in Antioch, and it is said that "for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd". The suggestion is that initially they were a crowd, but the teaching for a year brought about an assembly in the place, and they were serving God. Then in @Acts 13 we have names given, and the saints there were honoured in serving the Lord and in laying their hands on the two missionaries Paul and Barnabas. The Lord honoured them as evidently they were ready to join in the great operational service that He had in mind. That service was completed too, and Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. Then it says they stayed no little time with the disciples. All this would help to bring out this great matter that is now before us. The Lord, in Matthew, says, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me". That is what is needed. He is the Model as well as the Teacher, and so John, as having love in mind would have things right, and he tells us that those who left John the baptist, and followed Jesus called Him "Rabbi", which means Teacher. They desired too to know where He dwelt, saying, "Where dwellest thou?" and He says, "Come and see", @John 1: 38, 39. He would have them go to where He dwelt, as if to suggest that they would then know how things were done. In keeping with that Mary .Magdalene later on says to the Lord, "Rabboni". She needed teaching very much. She is much thought of by many of us, and rightly so, because of her love for Christ, but it was an unintelligent love at the first.
{109}
So it was stressed in her own words that the Lord was her Teacher, and I believe that is the idea that we would have before us in John's gospel. It says, "They shall be all taught of God", @John 6: 45. Lack of teaching and the imperfectness of the teaching is one of the great weaknesses, resulting in what is unsuitable happening in the service of God.
F.I. In @Luke 24 the Lord drew nigh to the two who were going away from Jerusalem and in His gracious way so brings things before them that they realise they are moving m disobedience. They return to Jerusalem and find those gathered there saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon", indicating that the Lord had also been moving in grace to Peter, and then they relate their experience.
J.T. Well, that is very good. One was struck this very day with the severity of the Lord's language to those two on the way to Emmaus, "O fools and slow of heart", He says to them (@Luke 24: 25). He points out that they were defective in the truth of the Scriptures. "And beginning at Moses ... he expounded unto them ... the things concerning himself". Luke in that way would show that the Lord stressed the idea of teaching in recovering those two. Then as He went on and spoke to them, their hearts burned; that is the inward effect, and after that He vanished from their sight, because His desire was that they might be set in movement. They then returned to Jerusalem that same night and found the eleven, and as coming in they knew what to say. There was something already being said, but it was not enough. There was something else to be said, and the two who were recovered said it.
H.B. Are we to understand that the defect is absence of teaching, but that we have not profited by the teaching?
{110}
J.T. Quite so. Very soon after the time of the apostles we find that leading persons in the assembly had turned to human methods and to human education, and hence the great religious system of learning which we find all around us. But it was not all departure and God has come in to revive the truth. We see, too, how men have been raised up to teach and qualified not by the colleges or the universities, but by God. Timothy and others like him were raised up to teach. He becomes a qualified teacher and those who come down after him were to teach others. God has provided teachers.
Ques. Is it in mind that insubjection might underlie our lack of intelligence? In @John 13 the Lord says, "Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for I am so", and then He says, "If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher". He reverses the order of the titles as if to stress the importance of subjection. Is that necessary for us in order to get the gain of the teaching?
J.T. Yes, and that we should value the teaching. I believe Enoch being "the seventh from Adam" is a suggestion of one who has learned all that preceded him from Adam. Much had come out in the course of time and through the channels specified and it all had to be gathered up, the fragments. The teaching of the Holy Spirit is precious, and it has to be gathered up, but the idea is for us to gather the things up in our souls. It is said of Samuel, that none of his words fell to the ground. How often it is, that things said at the meetings are immediately forgotten. We speak of good meetings, but the goodness does not extend beyond the meetings. The things are forgotten and not carried through and made use of.
E.C.M. It says of Mary in @Luke 2 that "she kept all these things in her mind, pondering them in her heart".
{111}
J.T. Very good. And that is characteristic of Luke.
W.A. Is that what Luke had in mind in writing to Theophilus, that we might know the certainty of the things in which we have been instructed? There should be no uncertainty.
J.T. Quite. And he writes with method. I suppose that would enter into the book of Revelation which was reserved, and is an additional matter in the order of the revelation of the Scripture. The Lord in chapter 1, after saying to John, "*I* am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and, behold, I am living to the ages of ages", tells him to write and gives him the order in which he should write. These principles ought to enter into all ministry, because gift is a great feature of the present operations of God. In Revelation we have the order, namely, "what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these". These three divisions mark the book of Revelation. It is a remarkable book, and the order in which it is written should be noted, for the Lord told His servant how it was to be written. So in view of gift the power of speech is in mind, and speech capable of conveying right thoughts, because the idea of the word of God is that the thoughts of God are to be rightly presented, that those who hear should profit by the things they hear, as they are set out in an orderly way.
C.H. Would what you are calling attention to be seen in Peter in the Acts where, as he was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word? Were Peter's words accredited in that way, and did the Holy Spirit act in relation to them because they were in keeping with the truth as a whole?
J.T. Quite. God without doubt governmentally ordered it that there should be such a language as
{112}
Greek which is especially intended to enter the human mind and illuminate it. It is important that the brethren should have those that are ministering in mind, and that there should be concern that they speak right. In Mark's gospel the Lord Himself makes much of speaking right. In chapter 7 we read of a deaf man who could not speak right and in loosing his tongue the Lord looked up to heaven and groaned, a most remarkable thing, and He says, "Ephphatha". This shows how much entered into the Lord's service to this man in view of his being made to speak right.
F.I. Have you the same thing in principle in @Luke 24? Before we have the Lord indicating to the disciples the fact that repentance and remission of sins was to be preached in His name to all the nations, we have the fact recorded that He opened their understanding to understand the Scriptures.
J.T. Just so. Some of us have noted that in Luke the Lord (speaking reverently) appeared to hasten to the ascension. If we were to go by the actual wording in @Luke 24 we might conclude that the Lord went up to heaven on the day He arose. I believe the Lord intended that His own should be impressed with the fact that He wanted to reach that point, for there were great operational matters to be entered on, and they have continued now for eighteen hundred years and are still going on. The Lord, as it were, hasted to go to heaven so as to proceed with the great matter of the gospel and of the assembly. In @Luke 24, verse 36, we read that "as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst". The Lord valued what they were saying. He must have been pleased that they could speak right and in an orderly way. They were gathered together, saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". That is a remarkable statement to have on record. Then these two who
{113}
had been recovered had their part in relating what had happened on the way and how He was made known to them in the breaking of bread. That was a great matter also. They had received a touch sufficient to move them and they moved at once. They were able to say these things which were needed to be added to what had already been said by the disciples. Then it goes on, "As they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst". It does not say that he came, although we might think He did, but the thought is rather that He was there. It shows that He is not far away at any time. Then the Lord says to them, "Peace be unto you. But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit". As already remarked they were not ready, which is very often the case with us and we lose time. "And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts? behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having. And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet". It shows how a state of unreadiness might hinder the Lord. Then He said to them, "Have ye anything here to eat?" This I would apprehend would be the conclusion. The Lord would hasten to the conclusion. "And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb; and he took it and ate before them. And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled. Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures, and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning
{114}
at Jerusalem". This is the point that was in mind to bring out and to show that the matter of the gospel was in the divine mind, that it should proceed without delay, and as we shall see later, the assembly too. The Lord then goes on to say, "And *ye* are witnesses of these things. And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high". From this we see that if the matters in mind are to proceed, all these things must happen so that there should be witnesses here and the divine system set up. It seems to me that these are matters of great importance and the instruction is that time should not be wasted, but that we should be ready as such services are opened up, to proceed in them.
J.G. Do we get the thought in @Luke 12 where we see the Lord giving certain instructions to His disciples, having in mind that when He comes and knocks they may open to Him immediately?
J.T. Quite; they may open to Him *immediately*.
S.R. In the case of Joseph and his brethren he says, "Come near to me, I pray you". Was he looking for things to proceed?
J.T. I am sure he was! He had a great matter in his heart and Joseph is a type of the Lord in this very matter. He was a man of affairs. We marvel as we think of the great men of old, such as David and Solomon, how they carried on their household affairs and at the same time were able to carry on with the things of God. In the Psalms too we see how much David was able to do, and then how much Solomon was able to do, and all this indicates how much we may be able to do. It is a question of doing things, as it says of the Lord, "All things which Jesus began both to do and to teach".
J.C.T. When it says, "As they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst", is it in your
{115}
mind that what we say as we are together would enable the Lord to come in?
J.T. That is what I was thinking, and I was saying also, that the two took a good journey that night covering about eight miles. They did not intend to do it, but the Lord so stimulated them that they started out immediately and they came and found the eleven. They did not go to a hotel, but went to the brethren. Then there is what the company were saying, and what the two from Emmaus could say, and then what the Lord did following that and in keeping with it. There is also the inward service of opening their understanding and telling them what should be preached, and then His going up, as if He would say to them, that He could carry on now that they knew what to do and were ready for service. Much more had to be done, and in view of that the Lord enjoins them not to go from the city until they were given power from on high; that must take place, for the Spirit of God must be recognised.
C.H. In view of the Lord going on high He seems to be putting it upon them that they were to be witnesses of Him. Is He appropriating them as they are available, although they were not fully intelligent?
J.T. We might confirm that from the first chapter of the Acts. This second treatise, as Luke calls it, was evidently an afterthought. We cannot say how long a time had elapsed between the writing of the first one and the second one, but it was addressed to the same person. It says, "I composed the first discourse, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up; to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered". Several things are said in the chapter
{116}
that are very important, specially from verse 10 and going on to verse 14. The whole matter is set out in order with a view to the great matter that is in the divine mind being apprehended, and then the next chapter brings out the great thought of the Spirit and His operations.
C.H. Are you thinking that they are holding to the whole idea of the twelve, and that they set about to remedy the broken situation which had arisen?
J.T. That is why I thought we should read that closing paragraph beginning with verse 15, "And in those days Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said, (the crowd of names who were together was about a hundred and twenty,) Brethren, it was necessary that the scripture should have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke ... concerning Judas, ... It is necessary therefore, that ... one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection". Another thing that should always be before us, is to recognise that the Lord has constituted elders fitted to lead and give direction to the brethren generally, so that there is no stoppage or delay. We may proceed to the right point at once and do it.
F.I. In @Acts 1 in connection with the appointment of one to take the place of Judas, Peter is able to give a lead and he acts according to Scripture and that was before the Spirit came down.
J.T. Yes. He had learned much already. The apostles were all supposed to be complete in their education, and so they are constituted as authoritative, and hence when the Spirit begins to operate He directs these converts to Peter. They themselves discerned that Peter and the eleven were men of whom they could ask questions, and get answers. The result was that "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers", @Acts 2: 42. So that the matter is set up and it has not been altered. The apostles
{117}
of course have died, for "one generation passeth away, and another generation cometh", but divine things continue at the present time, and the economy remains.
In the earlier verses of @Acts 1 the Lord is saying, as it were, 'I am doing as much as I can for you'. The Lord was infinite, but at the same time, He was acting as the Mediator for God and hence He speaks of the Father placing certain things in His own authority. So the Lord does all possible for those whom He was going to use, but He is saying, so to speak, 'I want to go up there'. The system must be set up there and the proceedings will go on henceforth from that centre; that is where the centre is, in heaven.
J.W. It says in @2 Chronicles 30, that Hezekiah spoke consolingly to all the Levites that had understanding in the good knowledge of Jehovah. Is that word to encourage us?
J.T. Quite so. The knowledge of Jehovah, and they are all ready for the work.
J.W. At the close of that chapter it says, that "the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, to the heavens".
J.T. That is what we get here. They had continued in prayer and then the Spirit came down, because that is the great climax of all God's operations, and now, as we are saying, simply and humbly and reverentially, He goes up, because the great operational system is up there and it is to continue its operations from there.
Ques. What was the thought of waiting ten days before the Spirit is given?
J.T. The Lord, I think, was giving the apostles an opportunity to show how much they had been affected. I believe He had great pleasure in what there was with the disciples. Mark would make
{118}
very little of them, he says they were unbelieving. These persons had such an opportunity to learn things from the Lord, but they were unbelieving, but in due course the Lord says to them, in spite of the fact that they were unbelieving, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation. He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned", @Mark 16: 15, 16. The work is to go on; we cannot afford to waste time; things must be done for the time is short.
G.B. Would Rebecca and Abigail illustrate the features of preparedness, intelligence and sacrifice, in line with your thought?
J.T. Quite so. They are seen in both. Intelligence such as we see in Rebecca is needed, but especially so as seen in Abigail. She was a woman of good understanding, and ready to discern what was needed, and her young man is typical of a person who belongs to the assembly today. If we should hear anything that is apt to militate against the truth we ought to tell the brethren. This young man was a servant of Nabal, but he was also a servant of Abigail, and he told Abigail what a difficult man Nabal was and warned her to see to it. She took his word and did what was needed, and then David says, "Blessed be thy discernment". David himself thus honours Abigail, as she showed that she knew what to do and what to say, and she acted accordingly. In all that she said and did David was the central thought with her.
S.G. Would what the Lord says in @John 14 be in line with what you have before you, "He that believes on me, the works which I do shall he do, also, and he shall do greater than these, because I go to the Father"?
J.T. That corresponds with what we are saying. The personnel in the upper room are set over against
{119}
clericalism; the outward formal and antiquated religion having lost its power, the upper room was the centre of all that the Lord had. The Lord Himself had centred all that He had there, and so we have the list of those who were there, beginning with "Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude the brother of James. These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren", @Acts 1: 13, 14. These are the personnel, you might say, in view of the great operational dispensation that was now ahead, and we can see what pleasure the Lord had in them and how He would foster them from heaven and furnish them with all that was needed down here and teach them, as we have already remarked. We read in @Luke 11 that one of the disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray". There is no need for a prayer book in the new system. There is need for a hymn book, but prayer should be spontaneous, the outcome of the Spirit operating in our hearts. So the idea would be to overthrow all antiquated religion which God has abandoned, and to maintain that which is of God. These are the persons that the Spirit of God would occupy us with, in view of the services that are now opening up to us.
{120}
THE PROMISES OF GOD
@Hebrews 6: 1 - 20
J.T. This scripture is proposed not only because it instructs us as to the promises of God, but also because the apostasy and the consequences of it are contemplated in it as the alternative to the appropriation of the promises. The non-appropriation of the promises will mean falling away; that is, apostasy. The chapter is intended to strengthen us in the truth so that we should go on to the end, as it says, that "we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil, where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec". The writer is aiming throughout the whole epistle to get the saints steadily going on and entering into the holiest, which is the final thought. We read in @Hebrews 10 of the day drawing near; that is to say, faith discerns the circumstances of the moment, and notes that the day is drawing near. It is not simply the end of this dispensation, but *the day* drawing near, and this chapter is intended to strengthen us to go on. It is intended therefore that we should understand and use the ways and means by which we can pursue the way of God until the end; this is in mind throughout the epistle.
Ques. Were you connecting the day drawing near with the promises?
J.T. Yes. What is in mind is that the young people especially may lay hold of the promises; the allusion in @Hebrews 6 is to Abraham in @Genesis 22. There is a danger of young people
{121}
truth mentally, whereas this passage contemplates the *soul* of the believer, as it says, "we have as an anchor of the soul". The mind, of course, is used by the believer, but the soul is the seat of affections, feelings and consciousness. It is worth while counting on the promises of God, for we are held in our souls by them.
F.B. The promises to Abraham were substantial.
J.T. Quite so. @Genesis 22 stresses the oath and the promises -- the swearing of God and the promises of God. As Abraham is ready to lift up his knife to slay Isaac, it says, "The Angel of Jehovah called to him from the Heavens, and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I. And he said, Stretch not out thy hand against the lad, neither do anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh; as it is said at the present day, On the mount of Jehovah will be provided". Then further it adds, "And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time, and said; By myself I swear, saith Jehovah, that, because thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, I will richly bless thee, and greatly multiply thy seed, as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because thou hast hearkened to my voice".
Great promises are made to Abraham and secured to him by oath. Following that he returns to his young men and they rose up and went together
{122}
to Beer-sheba and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. He is now resting in the oath and promise of God. Beer-sheba is the well of the oath. God is resting all for Abraham in the promise made to him, and Abraham going to and dwelling at Beer-sheba suggests a state to be sought after, one of restfulness in the knowledge of God.
F.B. In that sense Abraham embraced the promises.
J.T. He saw them afar off and embraced them. Young believers are sometimes remiss in this respect; their minds are clear, but their souls are lean, because of not laying hold of the promises of God.
H.B. It also says in @Hebrews 11 that "Abraham ... had received to himself the promises".
J.F.C. Would you link that up with @Acts 2: 39 where it says, "For to you is the promise and to your children"?
J.T. Quite. Peter brought in the thought in connection with the gospel, saying, "For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call". That is another thing that enters into this passage.
S.G. Are these promises calculated to make us restful and stabilise us in the presence of the apostate conditions around?
J.T. So many things are coming in to darken the minds of the young, who are apt to trust the mind, which in a sense is right, but we should not forget the soul, which is the feeling part of man's being. We are composed of spirit, soul and body; the soul is most important, especially in the case of young people, because there is that which holds them feelingly. That which holds us thus includes the fellowship, we are to be held by the doctrine, of course, but by the fellowship too, the fellowship of brethren.
{123}
J.W. Would Isaac be an example in this? In @Genesis 26 his servants come, and tell him concerning the well that they had dug, and he called it Shebah, and it adds, "therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day". Is he following Abraham in this?
J.T. The idea set out in the father continued in the son, the latter continuing in the truth which his father had. The wells had been stopped by the Philistines after the death of Abraham, but they are unstopped by Isaac, and he goes on in this until it becomes a broad position -- Rehoboth; he can stay there, and he does not need to move again. It shows that stabilisation is in the power of the Spirit, and it goes with what we have been saying as to the soul of the believer. The Spirit being in him would operate in relation to his feelings and affections. The danger is referred to in the early part of @Hebrews 6, "Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on to what belongs to full growth ... For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away". It seems to me a most solemn thing, and it should be noted how near we might be to this very thing. The apostasy is developing so rapidly and we may even ourselves have part in it, hence the need of being held by the anchor, that is, what the promises make available to us.
J.G. Did king Saul fall away because he lacked the soul feelings of which you have spoken? He seemed to be void of right feelings at the outset, and was not ready to hearken. You were stressing the importance of hearkening.
{124}
J.T. Quite. The report did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard.
A.M-d. On the other hand God tried Abraham. He could trust His own work. Would that be seen in @Genesis 22?
J.T. A very good point. God, as we see, trusting His own work and we ought to be able to trust the work of God. So that we are capable of going through things such as the brethren in this country have been capable of going through in all the pressure of the last few years.
R.M. God tests Abraham and he comes up to the test. As a result of that God adds something to him.
J.T. Quite so.
A.H. Does the end of the previous chapter in any way support what you are suggesting? It says that "solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil".
J.T. That is exactly what I was thinking. In verse 12 of the previous chapter it says, "For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that one should teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food". What is in mind in reading this chapter is that we might go on to full growth, and that would be in keeping with what is said at the end of the chapter, of "the hope set before us, which we have as an anchor of the soul ... and entering into that within the veil". That means that the soul is steady, and able to take hold of things; able to lay hold on the hope set before us which we have as an anchor "entering into that within the veil, where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec". So that the end is seen to be attainable and near.
{125}
G.E. Is Abraham to be regarded in @Genesis 22 as having reached full growth? Was God able to renew the promise, and the blessing to him because of his obedience? It seemed to provide Jehovah with a new motive to renew the matter with him.
J.T. Is He able to trust His own work? God had discovered that He could do so. He says, "Because thou hast done this". The angel says in verse 12, "For now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me". It must be a great triumph for God when He takes up persons like ourselves, and tests us, to see what there is of Himself with us. It is in keeping with God's ways. It was so at the beginning when He brought the animals to Adam to see what he would call them. God intended to test His great creature in this way. And so here He tests Abraham in this remarkable performance and says, "For now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me". God tests out His work to prove it.
T.G. Would these promises, to which you have been referring, be in line with what Peter says in his epistle: God "has given to us the greatest and precious promises"?
J.T. It is a remarkable reference, that. Through these, it says, "ye may become partakers of the divine nature". Then we have the idea of one thing working out another thing, as you will see if you look into the passage. There is therefore, the need of adding things. God is stressing the idea of the subjective side with us, the Spirit of God having come down. He is concerned that the truth of the incoming of the Spirit might stand out and that we might reach the end, that is, reach on to the coming of the Lord. So here in @Hebrews 6 it is the state of
{126}
the soul that is in mind and is described, so as to lead on to the thought of the anchor of the soul, that we might be held and go on to the end.
A.C.S.P. Would you say a little as to the place faith has in this matter of the soul being anchored and the place the Holy Spirit has?
J.T. As we have remarked, the chapter contemplates faith and the work of God. Abraham was tested and was proved to be genuine and hence he goes on in the testimony of God. He is pursued in his history from one point to another and thus proceeds in the testimony, and in this chapter, whilst faith is in mind, yet the Holy Spirit is in mind too, as it says in the fourth verse, "it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away". It is a terrible thought that, in spite of all this that is said, one may fall away and prove to be unreal. It is a most solemn consideration. It is thought well to bring this all in now especially for the young people. How near the idea of apostasy is to us and how we may slip into it and become lost! That is what is in mind. There is no such thing as recovery in Hebrews, which makes it very solemn if we are not going on.
F.R.S. You spoke about soul history. God says later in the epistle, "If he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him". Young people should have soul history. Is that what is in your mind?
J.T. The saving of the soul is referred to, and the soul is mentioned there in @Hebrews 10, showing that it is a soul matter. These matters are within the range of certainty and consciousness, and are not
{127}
simply viewed from the standpoint of the work of God, but there is the Spirit's work too.
F.B. Is Judas an example of this? He was with the Lord and the disciples all along and yet in the end proved to be unreal.
J.T. Quite so. He had been with the Lord and had partaken of the apostleship with all its attendant grace and privileges and yet the Lord has to say, "Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil" -- an awful thing to contemplate. It says of him, that transgressing he fell to go to his own place.
A.H. The allusion in verse 6 to the ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it producing useful herbs, would remind us that it is not only a question of sitting under the ministry, but what is going to be produced by it.
J.T. Quite so. It is important that we should have a sense in our souls of the perfection of Christ. Abraham experienced this typically as Melchisedec came to meet him, and he was thus enabled to overcome the world. It shows how God is concerned about us, for Melchisedec came just at the right time. We are told here in @Hebrews 7 who he was, and John has this in mind in his gospel, as he brings the Lord before us as a divine Person. So we have in John that which gives us assurance as He says, "No one shall seize them out of my hand". In this way Abraham had the service of Melchisedec, and it is most important and urgent that young people should be on their guard as to the apostasy which is all around us, and we are in danger of slipping into it. There is on this account great need that we should judge ourselves. So it says here in verse 6, "And have fallen away, crucifying for themselves as they do the Son of God, and making a show of him. For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those
{128}
for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God; but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end is to be burned". So that we have to look into ourselves, not to belittle the word that we have believed, but to see whether there is evidence of the work of God in each of our souls; the feelings proper to the work of God.
C.H. We do well to note and imitate the faith of those in whom faith is substantial. In @Genesis 22 Isaac raises questions with Abraham. Do you think we might view them in that sense as an old and a young brother journeying together?
J.T. Isaac is called a lad and Abraham is quite an old man. One has often noticed that the Lord encourages us to help the young people to keep with the older brethren and not to company by themselves. They thus see tile idea of faith illustrated before their eyes.
F.B. Is the same idea set out in Elijah and Elisha, the old and young journeying together?
J.T. Quite so. How Elisha learned from his master, as he calls Elijah.
Jno.G. Would Lot, while not representing one permanently lost, show how we might be somewhat on the line of apostasy?
J.T. Indeed. There is a peculiar expression in @1 Peter 4: 18, "And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the impious and the sinner appear?" The righteous difficultly saved would be Lot. He was saved because he had a righteous soul. It is good that this much is recorded of him. It says of him, "For the righteous man through seeing and hearing, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul day after day with their lawless works". It is noteworthy that the word soul is used.
Ques. In the second book of Psalms the writer has a good deal to say about the soul. There are
{129}
several references to it such as, "Our soul is bowed down to the dust", @Psalm 44: 25. Is the answer to all the soul desires summed up in the King in @Psalm 45?
J.T. Just so. Those psalms are in the second book, and in that book the people are seen as in hard circumstances, as Lot was. The people had been driven out of Jerusalem, but the countenance of Jehovah is referred to as well as their own countenance. All the desires culminate in the King in @Psalm 45, as you say, and indeed, in the queen too, for both must be taken account of if we are to deal with these matters. Young people particularly should take account of the queen as well, for it opens up much as to the feminine side and this must be taken account of if the souls of the young are to be held.
A.M-d. Would salvation as mentioned in verse 9 come in there? "But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation".
J.T. Very good. And that is what we ought to go on to now. "For ground ... bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end is to be burned. But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus". The Spirit of Christ is thus seen appealing to them. So the writer of the epistle, as imbued with the Spirit of Christ, was a witness in earlier days of their faithfulness and suffering, and he goes on to say, "For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shown to His name, having ministered to the saints, and still ministering. But we desire earnestly that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience
{130}
have been inheritors of the promises", @Hebrews 6: 10 - 12. All that confirms what we have been saying as to the importance of the younger people being with the elder ones, for that is the point which he makes here when he refers to their being imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises.
F.B. How far does the thought of salvation in verse 9 go?
J.T. Well, I would refer back to the beginning of the epistle where you have in chapter 2 verse 3, the great salvation referred to and that is what the Hebrews had presented to them. Although the word great is not used here in chapter 6, yet I think that the writer would mean that. In chapter 2 it says, "How shall we escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation". The danger of apostasy is in mind and the fact that young people may slip into it. We need therefore to guard ourselves and to look into ourselves to discern evidences of the work of God. We are not, of course, to be unduly introspective, but it is nevertheless quite right that we should look in and be able to call upon all that is within us to praise His name.
G.E. Is it a question of normal growth, the normal development of the work of God; and would the blind man in @John 9 be an example of it?
J.T. Quite so. That is a good point to bring up. The disciples ask, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents ... ? Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him". It is a question of the work of God; really the works of God, the plural being used would stress the importance of the matter.
G.E. The blind man at the outset says, "A man called Jesus" but ends with the knowledge of the Son of God.
{131}
J.T. He says to the neighbours who enquired as to what happened when he got his eyes opened, "Having gone and washed, I saw", but when they bring him to the Pharisees he says, "I washed and I see". The first is a question of what is historical; the man states simply the effect of certain things happening and he saw, but when dealing with the Pharisees that is, persons who would challenge things and criticise, it is a question of some present evidence of the work of God and the man says, "I see".
C.H. The blind man says, "One thing I know".
J.T. He is a very good witness of the truth of the development of the work of God in John's gospel, where it is a question of life. The Lord says to him, after these things had happened, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" The man says, "And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" as much as to say, If I only knew Him I would believe on Him at once. Then Jesus said to him, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage". That is what we get in John, and it is the point in Hebrews also; namely, evidence of the work of God.
T.G. It says of the saints in @Hebrews 6, "For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shown to his name, having ministered to the saints, and still ministering". They were going on in that way.
J.T. Yes. It was still an existing thing, as they were going on with God. It would mark those who are genuine.
H.B. Does that link up with the seventh verse, the product of the ground that drinks the rain being for those for whom it is tilled? Does that refer to the saints or to divine Persons?
{132}
J.T. It is for those to whom the ground belongs; it partakes of blessing from God. There is someone caring for the ground and he gets his reward, but in truth it is God. He gets His part.
J.M. Would the book of remembrance referred to in the prophet Malachi be like this?
J.T. Quite so. They were genuine persons and Jehovah elevates them to the dignity of sons: "And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him".
Ques. Peter speaks of the proving of your faith which is much more precious than gold which perishes, and then he goes on to say, "Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls". Is that in line with what is here in Hebrews?
J.T. It would be. It is the *end* of your faith, meaning the end morally; that in which it culminates. We have a somewhat similar thought in @Romans 6, "and the end, eternal life".
S.R. Would the promises in @2 Corinthians 6 be encouraging to the young? The Lord says, "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".
J.T. Quite so. It is one of God's exceeding great and precious promises, hence the need for cleansing ourselves, as it says, "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear".
S.B. All this of which you have been speaking as to the soul is seen in those who are going on with God. In @Psalm 86 there is the word, "Incline thine ear, Jehovah, answer me; for I am afflicted and needy. Keep my soul, for I am godly; O thou my God, save thy servant who confideth in thee". Then
{133}
further down, "Rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee, Lord, do I lift up my soul".
J.T. We get many such illustrations in the Psalms of the truth of what we have been saying; it is the book of experience.
J.C.T. Is there an encouraging word as to all this in @Hebrews 11 where Abraham is referred to as having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise? Isaac would have been quite a young man.
J.T. Quite so. Heirs *with* him. They were with Abraham, the man of faith; that is the point.
C.D. If we keep near to those who are going on in the way Abraham was, we shall increase in enjoying heavenly things. Lot got astray because he left Abraham.
J.T. He detached himself from his uncle, but he would have been safe if he had kept with him.
A.B. Was he deceived by material prosperity?
J.T. Quite so; the well-watered plains of Jordan appealed to him.
J.W. The children of Israel said in the song in @Exodus 15, "This is my God, and I will glorify him, My Father's God, and I will extol him". They began with this thought of old and young.
J.T. Abraham himself is set before us as an example and we have to look at his history. God says of him, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing ... ? For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him". God honours him in the fact that he proves his genuineness, not only for himself, but for his children as well. The children need to be cared for.
A.H. God is looking for persons that He can bring forward as inheritors of the promises, so that the generation coming may be affected.
J.T. One generation goes and another comes, but generation after generation is preserved, having in
{134}
view the maintenance of the testimony. The service of the Holy Spirit proceeds in bringing the fruit out of the ground so that in result the testimony continues until the end.
F.B. In verse 11 it says, "But we desire earnestly that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end".
R.M. The soul here seems to be set in contrast to what is external and shallow.
J.T. That is what is meant. The closing verses of the chapter show the substantial and practical side of the matter. It says, "For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure. Wherein God, willing to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath, that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil, where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec", @Hebrews 6: 16 - 20. The reference is to the Jewish position, the city of refuge being opened to them. It would seem that the passage is intended to establish each one of us in the certainty of Christianity.
Rem. In verse 17 the promise and the purposes are both referred to.
J.T. It is to show what God has in the promise; and then there is the oath, God intervening by an oath, in order that the heirs of the promise might be assured as to it, and of the unchangeableness of His purpose.
G.E. It is important that there should be balance in the matter.
{135}
J.T. Quite so. And this passage is intended to give that. Abraham is a type of the believer, and we have here how God assured him of things in the oath and in the promise, so that the soul of the believer is to have an anchor. It is a remarkable type that is employed, but the idea is that we are to be made sure and certain; which hope "we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil".
A.H. Would you say a word as to what is involved in the expression, "within the veil"?
J.T. It involves our going inside into the presence of God. In @Psalm 73 Asaph is set right and confirmed in his faith as he went into the sanctuaries of God. He had been discouraged because of the ungodly, but then he enters into the sanctuaries of God (it is the plural) then he says, that he understood their end. He is assured there. Then we have other psalms of Asaph so beautifully setting out what is there in regard to David and others. Asaph in that sense is a prophet as well as a singer and a psalmist. So, as within the veil, as in chapter 10, we are in the presence of God, where everything is assured to us. God Himself is there.
C.H. In the sanctuary things are better understood.
J.T. Quite so, as Asaph says, "Then understood I their end".
Rem. In @Psalm 77 God's way is said to be "in the sanctuary".
J.T. That shows that you get illuminated there. In the case of ordinary exercises you may perhaps be doubtful, but in the sanctuary you are in the presence of God and all is clear there.
J.C.T. Does the Lord's supper greatly strengthen us in regard to being assured? I was thinking particularly of the cup.
J.T. Quite so.
{136}
A.H. Is there development here in the line of priesthood and does that help us in the service of God which would be within the veil?
J.T. We need to be assured. We get persons asking questions, which in a certain sense is right, but faith would go into the sanctuary and would get the answers there.
F.B. Is it a question of looking from the inside to the outside and of our getting God's view of any matter?
J.T. That is the thought. We read in @Numbers 7, that Moses went in to speak to Jehovah, but we are told that God spoke to him.
F.B. Asaph saw things from the inside, that is from the sanctuary.
J.T. There were great communications came out through Moses, but in @Numbers 7, where we get the offerings of the princes recorded, we are told at the end of the chapter that Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak to God. As going in he had the assurance that all would be well, and although he went in to speak with God, yet God spoke to him. It says, "He heard the voice speaking to him from off the mercy-seat which was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim; and he spoke to Him". The way of God in that sense is in relation to the divine communications which are made in the sanctuary.
F.B. That should result in enlargement and expansion with us.
J.T. Quite so.
{137}
THE HOLY SPIRIT'S WARNINGS AGAINST DEPARTURE
@Hebrews 2: 4; @Hebrews 3: 7 - 9; @Hebrews 6: 4 - 6; @Hebrews 10: 15 - 18
J.T. The subject of the Holy Spirit, it need not be said, is of immense importance. This epistle was written, as many of us know, to the Hebrew Christians. Their interest in the truth was waning, and they needed to have the Scriptures brought to bear upon them, especially the warnings, the warnings given by the Scriptures to us. In @Hebrews 2 the writer calls attention to the distributions of the Holy Spirit. It says, "God bearing, besides, witness with them to it, both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will". The allusion is to the coming of the Spirit as bringing what was needed in the service of God according to His will. The Holy Spirit is Himself a divine Person, exercising His own will, even as the Father does, and as the Son does, only He is here in holy subjection, as it is said of Him, "sent forth from heaven". The point in this passage is the distributions of the Holy Spirit. The next passage is to call attention to what He says in the use of the Old Testament, how He uses the Old Testament in the ministry to enforce the truth, and then chapter 6 is to call attention to the fact that He may be partaken of and yet the person doing so may be lost. It is said, "It is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves as they do the Son of God, and making a show of him". Christianity is characterised by the Holy Spirit, and in such a meeting as this for
{138}
instance, He is present and many partake of Him in an outward way, and yet may fall away. Chapter 10 refers to Him as witnessing. It is said, "The Holy Spirit also bears us witness". It alludes to the testimony He renders from the Old Testament as to the forgiveness of sins. So that we have in chapter 2 a reference to the Holy Spirit and His distributions; in chapter 3, what He says in the Old Testament scriptures; in chapter 6, that He is partaken of as come from heaven, and yet persons who may have part in an outward or external way in what He ministers may fall away and be lost; and then in chapter 10, He witnesses to the great fact of the forgiveness of sins. He witnesses to it through the Scriptures, using the Scriptures in a typical sense, and that involves the typical teaching of the Holy Spirit in this chapter.
A.R. Would you say something as to the distributions of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. Well, as come down here, firstly, what the Holy Spirit did, even in the gifts, was to confirm the salvation spoken of by the Lord. He has in His distributions also furnished the assembly, the saints, with what is necessary in the ministry. Reference is made to what the Lord gives in @Ephesians 4, but in @1 Corinthians 12 we have the word, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit. But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit". The service of the Holy Spirit is alluded to there as making "distinctions of gifts".
A.R. It says in @Luke 24 that they were to wait in Jerusalem until they were "endued with power from on high", alluding, I suppose, to the gift of the Holy Spirit so that they should be able for service. Would that be part of the distribution?
J.T. Just so. They were to remain in the city until they were endued with power from on high, and then the Spirit came fifty days after the Lord
{139}
rose. They waited while He was here for forty days, and then ten more after He had ascended, as if the Lord was very deliberate in what He was doing in heaven, because He had gone up to exercise administrative power down here, and He sent down the Spirit.
Rem. So that the Spirit having come, we are told, He "sat upon each one of them". They were all assembled in one place, and there was the sound of breathing from God, powerful breathing.
J.T. The allusion is to the parted tongues: cloven tongues, as of fire, sat on each of them, pointing to the fact that each would be instrumental in the service, and then the Spirit gives them utterance, so that the saints were furnished by His presence and the service of God was carried on.
Ques. It is described as "parted tongues, as of fire". Does that involve the distribution of the Spirit?
J.T. "Parted", I suppose, implies that they would be able to carry on according to what language it might be necessary to use.
W.H. Would all this emphasise the greatness of the system that had now been established in Christ in glory?
J.T. I think that is what is in mind. The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews, who is probably Paul, calls attention first to the Person of Christ, and then to the Spirit as we have it here in the beginning of chapter 2, the Spirit acting here as a divine Person distributing what is needed in the testimony and service of the assembly.
Ques. How would that bear upon us in our local gatherings?
J.T. You mean our Bible readings, and the like. Well, I think the Spirit of God helps us in that and furnishes us. Throughout the Acts we have, I believe, practically every manner of service that the
{140}
Lord is helping us to proceed with at the present time; and so it is said, in @Acts 2, "And there were added in that day about three thousand souls. And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". The apostles gradually, by the Lord's help, came forward with all that was needed in the service, and I believe the Lord helps the brethren to carry on accordingly. The idea of the week is contemplated in the Acts and in the Gospels as well. The first day of the week is noted and the prayer meeting too, and the reading.
H.B. It speaks in @Hebrews 8 of "the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man". Would the help of the Holy Spirit here come in to sustain us in the way of service?
J.T. The Lord is said to be Minister of the sanctuary there, and that would all be in the power of the Spirit, because the Lord in heaven operates in the power of the Spirit. The Spirit too, operates of His own will, but He is sent here.
F.B.W. Would you say a word as to the great salvation which is spoken of, and the distribution of the Holy Spirit in relation to that?
J.T. The word "salvation" is used often. The idea of great salvation which is spoken of, would just be to stress what has already been said, and that the writer of the epistle intended to impress upon the Hebrew Christians what had been committed to them. How complete the salvation was, which at the first began to be spoken of by the Lord, but confirmed to us by those who heard Him. The word *great* is used, because the writer would impress on the Hebrew Christians what they had come into; what salvation the Lord had acquired at such cost for them. I suppose the opening up of things as Paul came into them would be the great salvation; it would be expounded in the epistle to the Romans, and even in other epistles.
{141}
T.T. It speaks about God bearing witness with them by distribution.
Ques. Is this one of the means by which God attests the word and confirms it, "God bearing, besides, witness with them to it, both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will"?
J.T. Yes; as we have especially in Paul's ministry and Peter's ministry, and, of course, all the apostles¬. I suppose each of the apostles had his own line of ministry. They would all be furnished with signs. Mark, in his closing word in his gospel, says, "The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God. And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it". That would be a brief allusion to the feature of Pentecost, and the wonderful work of God by the Spirit sent forth from heaven, and all that accompanied His coming, calling attention to the greatness of the salvation that God had brought in. And then, of course, the other thing is the ministry by the gifts, especially the prophetic ministry.
G.E. Would there be an indication of this in @Acts 13, where the Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". Is that according to His will?
J.T. Quite so. It was His own action, "Separate me", He says. The allusion is to what was going on at Antioch, and much is said in chapter 11 as to what led up to it. The service of God was inaugurated at Antioch, and we are told that Paul and Barnabas had been there for a whole year teaching in the assembly, and then there were men there at Antioch whose names are given, who were said to be ministering to the Lord and fasting. And then the Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul
{142}
for the work to which I have called them". Following that, the saints "having laid their hands on them ... let them go. They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit". The apostles did not send them forth. Modern missionary work is hardly according to what we have there. The Spirit sent them forth; the saints laid their hands on them. The assembly did not send them forth. It is never said to have sent them forth. The Spirit sent them forth, and they went out to the work. @Acts 13 and 14 report what happened in the first great missionary enterprise of Barnabas and Saul. Having *fulfilled* the work "they sailed away to Antioch, whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled".
A.R. It was the direct action of the Holy Spirit in that chapter, indicating that the Spirit acts according as He will.
J.T. Well, that is what I was thinking. The Spirit Himself did it, and sent them forth. The saints were with Him in it and He recognised them in it. In all the journeying of the two apostles there would be much prayer for them, and of course, divine support in it would also be furnished, but all that is in keeping with what is presented in the Scriptures.
F.M. Do you think we still carry that on today?
J.T. The question is whether modern missionary work is according to the principles of Scripture, and whether the East, so much in mind in this kind of work, has not been reserved by the Lord for a further great work through the preaching of the everlasting gospel, the pre-millennial service shortly to commence. There has been little real result in the East, as compared with the West, from the work carried on there over the past three hundred years. There is nothing at all to be compared with what we get in the Acts.
{143}
Ques. Do you mean that in the Acts the trend of the work of God was westward?
J.T. Quite so, and it has remained so. The persons who are really in true Christian fellowship in the light of the assembly in the whole of Asia are few in number.
Rem. It is very striking that they sought to go to Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered them not.
J.T. Well, that is a good scripture to bring up now, showing how the Spirit of God is controlling things.
Rem. The situation of Bithynia in Asia Minor was northward from the apostles¬ position at the time.
J.T. Whereas the Spirit's mind was that they should go to the West, because the man in Macedonia was towards the West.
Rem. It was Europe that was in mind.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Why does it speak of the "Spirit of Jesus" there? It says, "they attempted to go to Bithynia and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them".
J.T. The Lord's personality as a Man, is in mind. He says to Paul, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest". We are told, "we see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour", which is hardly a Jewish reference. It is more in keeping with what we have in the gospel. The next scripture we read in Hebrews is to call attention to what use the Spirit makes of the Old Testament scriptures. It is said, "wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts". The allusion is to @Psalm 95, showing how the Holy Spirit uses the Old Testament in the ministry of the New Testament, the ministry of the present time. We understand that the Old Testament has its place, but the New Testament, in fact the apostles themselves, have the first place in the whole matter we are dealing with, and, to be more specific, Paul has
{144}
first place, because to him was committed the ministry of the assembly and the completion of the word of God. So it is clear that we ought to consult him in all matters that he deals with, and not make any Old Testament scripture of prior importance over Paul. The Lord said he is "an elect vessel to me".
H.B. It says, "Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice". Does that bring in Paul?
J.T. Well, he is doubtless the writer here, but it is the Spirit's voice we are considering. The Spirit uses @Psalm 95 in the ministry. The word *says* means that.
W.H. So that the first scripture you refer to would suggest the endowment of the Holy Spirit in the way of gift and ability, do you think? And alongside of that you have the Holy Scriptures at the Spirit's command to further the service of God.
J.T. Yes. The Lord cites Moses Himself, and puts the writings of Moses on a level with His own words, you might say, in @John 5. At the same time, when the Spirit of God came and conversions began, the converts were not directed to read Moses, nor David, nor the Psalms, but it is said that "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles", so that the apostles have priority in all matters.
A.R. In regard to the Spirit speaking through the Scriptures, would you suggest that He only speaks through the Scriptures, or might He use another channel?
J.T. Well, of course, He speaks directly. He said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul". He spoke there.
A.R. But I was wondering whether we might experience such a thing today, the Spirit speaking directly as He did then.
{145}
J.T. Well, He is here still, as much as He was then. He is here, and we hope, at least we would expect, something like that even now, some word from the Spirit.
H.B. "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".
J.T. Quite so.
A.R. But would speaking through one and another in the assembly correspond? In Acts He spoke directly.
J.T. But even then He would speak through someone, because the Spirit did not become incarnate like the Lord Jesus, who became incarnate and spoke directly personally. The Spirit did not become incarnate; therefore, He would speak through vessels.
Rem. He would speak through those who were ministering to the Lord and fasting. They apparently were the vessels the Lord was using.
J.T. The Spirit did not become incarnate. There is a great distinction to be noted in that sense, between the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus alone became incarnate, and through Him all the communications are made, so that He is called "the Word". He is called "the Word" because through Him the speaking is done.
H.K.R. Would His voice be heard through ministry?
J.T. Quite so. Hence the great importance of being ready, and in a state of soul suitable for His use. Those who read the Scriptures, of course, would perhaps be ready in a peculiar way, and their minds would be free from worldly influences. John speaks of being "in the Spirit on the Lord's day". It is a question of how much of that there may be now.
F.I. In speaking of those who persevered in the apostles¬ doctrine, you did not mean to separate
{146}
that from what the Lord said to them in Luke's gospel, when He opened their understanding in relation to Moses and the prophets and Psalms.
J.T. Of course, they were all subject to the Lord's service in opening their understanding. That included them all.
F.I. The doctrine you spoke of as the apostles¬ doctrine would be based upon that.
J.T. It would. The Lord would be the Author of it, but the allusion is to the economy that had been set up in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit had come down from heaven, to dwell with the saints and be in them. The Lord had gone up. The Spirit remains with us, and that is one of the features of the dispensation, that He still remains with us, but there was constant unfolding until the completion of the word of God. There is no addition now to the word of God. Paul said he completed it but at the same time the Spirit is still here, and would minister through those whom He would use, but they would be limited to the word of God.
Ques. Would the teaching of the apostle Paul be included in the apostles¬ doctrine in @Acts 2?
J.T. Speaking broadly, it would include all the apostles, but I think that the twelve are primarily in mind.
Rem. The light of Christ as Head in heaven and the assembly on earth, would be additional to what is seen in @Acts 2.
J.T. Well, it took years to develop the whole system of doctrine. It was years after that Paul himself was introduced, and that has to be noted. He unfolded the truth, but it is said that the Holy Spirit would guide them into all the truth. That was in mind, and all implies the completion of the word of God -- all the truth.
{147}
G.B. Even when the Old Testament is referred to would what the apostle Paul gives us be final?
J.T. That is what I was saying. *Final* is the word, because it was given to him to complete the word of God. And then he had the doctrine, the ministry of the assembly and the ministry of reconciliation. It is very important for brethren to bear in mind that the apostles had their place.
H.K.R. In chapter 2 we get the great salvation spoken of by our Lord. Here it says that the *Spirit* says, and the quotation you refer to is from @Psalm 95.
J.T. The Spirit of God is here to witness and to unfold the truth; but at first it was spoken of by the Lord, and then in turn by those who heard Him: that would be the apostles. Now chapter 3, as we have already remarked, contemplates the use the Spirit makes of the Old Testament, and then chapter 6 contemplates that the Spirit may be in the company of persons who are regarded as participating in Him. The verses read speak of them as partakers of the Holy Spirit, and yet falling away. This is one of the most solemn things, and it is well that it should be pointed out. How solemn it is that we should have part in the things we are now speaking of, and yet be lost! The apostle says that it is impossible to renew them again to repentance.
W.R. Does it mean a person coming into the sphere where the Spirit is operating and getting light?
J.T. Yes, many have also taken on things. Judas undoubtedly carried on with the other apostles, the eleven, and did work similar to them, perhaps was used, and yet we know he was lost.
A.R. Would there be a difference between partaking of the Holy Spirit here, and being indwelt by the Holy Spirit?
J.T. A very great difference, and one that ought to be observed. One who is actually indwelt or
{148}
sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise shall *never* be lost, cannot be lost. The Lord says, "They shall never perish".
A.R. I suppose Paul is showing the danger of their being in the profession, and not in the reality of things.
J.T. Well, it says, "Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the Jews who have believed" (@Acts 21: 20); and again, "a great crowd of the priests obeyed the faith", @Acts 6: 7. We cannot be sure that they were all saved.
W.H. Does John allude to that, when he says, "They went out from among us, but they were not of us", and he calls them 'antichrists'. They are not simply quiescent, but they are definitely apostate; "they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame".
J.T. These are most solemn things to be spoken of. The persons referred to come under the influence of the truth and fall away, as it says here.
Ques. Your remark refers particularly to the Jewish nation. Would you say, that there is any application of this to some of the European nations?
J.T. Well, I would think Mohammedanism would suggest it; the whole of Asia Minor and North Africa were carried away into apostasy. Presently, we are told in Thessalonians, that God will send a strong delusion and men shall believe a lie, that they all might be condemned. We are coming to this terrible thing, that they all might be condemned, because they received not the love of the truth.
A.R. You suggest then that these become apostate that are spoken of here?
J.T. I think that is what is meant. John names them. Even now there are many antichrists.
Rem. The work of God in the soul would be a necessity, to have the love of the truth.
{149}
J.T. Well, it would be a real work of God to receive the truth; in fact, one would have to be born again. The Lord says, "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God ... Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"; first he cannot *see*, and then secondly he cannot *enter* the kingdom of God. These are all most solemn matters, and, of course that is what is in mind to call attention to, that we should be real, and sure of our salvation; "to make your calling and election sure", as Peter says; sure to ourselves.
R.McA. Does the Spirit bring in a similar warning in 1 Timothy, in saying, "But the Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith" (@1 Timothy 4:1). Later on Paul says, "Laying these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast fully followed up" (@1 Timothy 4:6).
J.T. Yes. Paul uses the word *expressly* there; "in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith"; that is an allusion to Romish doctrines.
W.R. Jude speaks of "The Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, in the second place destroyed those who had not believed".
J.T. Paul, writing the second epistle to Timothy, speaks of this matter of apostasy. It is now at our doors.
H.B. It is a good thing to be amongst the saints, but we want to challenge our hearts as to our reality in divine things.
J.T. Yes, as has been remarked, making our calling and election sure. It is not only the light, but the work of God in the soul.
G.L. Would verses 11 and 12 of chapter 6 give us the contrast?
{150}
J.T. That is what I mean. It is well to have that before us, what the real thing is. "But we desire earnestly that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises". This is the positive side.
W.B. What is the force of the expression, "crucifying ... the Son of God"?
J.T. Well, I suppose it is to show that apostasy involves the entire renunciation of Christianity from its foundation, and those guilty of this took on the guilt attaching to Israel in regard of the death of the Son of God. Apostasy in effect made this their own act. The thing would be to nullify the testimony of the Lord Jesus. That is, of course, the great trend now in the anti-Christian teaching.
G.E. Would the reference to Simon Magus in @Acts 8 help in this matter?
J.T. "A certain man, by name Simon, had been before in the city, using magic arts, and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying that himself was some great one ... But Simon, having seen that by the laying on of the hands of the apostles the Holy Spirit was given, offered them money, saying, Give to me also this power ... . And Peter said to him, Thy money go with thee to destruction, ... Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter". Whether he was converted or not, it does not state, but anyway there seems a link in the terrible situation that arose. He was already among those who believed professedly.
H.K.R. We are told, that "Simon also himself believed; and having been baptised, continued constantly with Philip; and beholding the signs and great works of power which took place, was astonished". Would that suggest that he had outwardly professed, but his heart was not affected?
{151}
J.T. He is not classified with the apostate as in @Hebrews 6, and the Spirit would distinguish him. Although we cannot say very much, because it is left at that, yet he asked them to "Supplicate ye for me to the Lord". It is left at that.
W.H. Does it suggest in @Hebrews 6, that if we are not moving on we are in danger of going back into apostasy? It says, "let us go on to what belongs to full growth".
J.T. Just so, but as to those receiving this epistle then, they did have the real thing of which we read in that chapter. Verse 9 reads, "But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus. For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having ministered to the saints, and still ministering. But we desire earnestly that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises". No doubt we are in what the apostle stresses as to the real thing.
I think we should go on to chapter 10, to see how witness is attached, or comes in, in the teaching; the idea of the witness of the Holy Spirit. The passage reads, "and the Holy Spirit also bears us witness of it". That is not what He is *saying*, it is *witnessing*. The witness of things is a further thought. "The Holy Spirit also bears us witness of it". "This is the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith the Lord, giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings; and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more. But where there is remission of these, there is no longer a sacrifice for sin". The point is, that the Spirit is witnessing, not simply saying things which are in the Old Testament,
{152}
but witnessing about the new covenant, which involves forgiveness of sins. The new covenant provides that God will never remember their sins any more.
W.H. Is this witness a subjective feature in the soul?
J.T. I think it would be over against what Peter says of one who has "forgotten the purging of his former sins". Such a one is in great danger, but one who has this witness of the Holy Spirit is certain that God will never remember his sins any more. It says, "Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings ... their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more". That is the witness, as if the Spirit of God clothed Himself with the power of testimony, testifying to our souls that God will never remember our sins any more.
F.B.W. Is the witness to give us assurance in view of the ministry that is following on this, so that we may be able to go on to further ministry?
J.T. Quite so. It is a foundational thought and what a relief it is if any one is doubting if he is forgiven. Who can be a greater witness than the Holy Spirit, going to the length of quoting the Old Testament, to afford all the authority of it! That is involved in what we get in @John 5: 45, about Moses; "Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one who accuses you, Moses, on whom ye trust; for if ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me". That is remarkable. The authority of Moses is spoken of by the Lord.
A.R. It says, later, "we are not of them who draw back". So that the Spirit's witness would preserve one in assurance.
J.T. Well, that is what is meant, "we are not of them who draw back ... but of them that believe to
{153}
the saving of the soul". The use of the word soul in this epistle is to be noted, because it alludes to the feeling part, that you are not simply trusting in your mind, but you are affected feelingly.
J.H.P. In @Romans 8, it says, "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit". Is that what you have in mind as to feeling?
J.T. Not quite. The Spirit is there too as in us eternally, I would say. Here He is speaking of the types, the prophets in the Old Testament, using the prophets, especially Jeremiah, as to the new covenant. How we are assured in that remarkable way by the Spirit bringing in the Old Testament.
Rem. The witness of the Spirit in the present dispensation would be a final word.
J.T. Yes, in the sense that the Lord's word was final when He was here. The Spirit of God is in Christianity, not only in speaking things, but in making us feel things; He operates in our souls.
Rem. I was thinking of your references to the warning. In the first it is slipping away; in the second it is turning away, in the third it is falling away.
{154}
THE BASIC WORK OF GOD IN BELIEVERS
@Acts 1: 1 - 26
J.T. It came to my mind today that what the Lord left as He went up to heaven is *basically* presented in this chapter. I use the word 'basically' thinking that this chapter has to be compared with the endings of all the gospels, where the disciples are seen just as they were as the Lord was apprehended and put to death. We can easily trace the difference between @Acts 1 and the endings of the gospels; and notice that much darkness and ignorance marked those whom He left on earth. This is seen in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but this chapter records much improvement, although the Holy Spirit had not come. The Lord had gone into heaven, but the Holy Spirit had not yet come, and yet there is evidence of great improvement in the intelligence of the disciples; at the same time the thoughts presented in it are simply basic. The whole book is intended to open up the results of the Lord's death and resurrection, and the incoming of the Spirit. Acts is a gradual, but steady unfolding of the truth.
H.B. Would you explain a little what you mean by the improvement as compared with the gospels?
J.T. Well, take Luke himself. Evidently the second treatise was an afterthought, I mean from his point of view. It was no doubt designed of God that there should be the book of Acts, and if we did not have it, we would have the facts in the endings of the gospels, but we should have to build up on less complete information than the book of Acts furnishes in chapter 1. There was much darkness, as has been remarked, and confusion and uncertainty, to all of which we have to confess in our own souls, and judge. We have all to begin with new birth, and new birth in itself does not mean the
{155}
indwelling of the Spirit. Every believer has some experience such as is disclosed in the endings of the gospels; whereas the first chapter of Acts indicates a great improvement, and yet the Spirit has not yet come, showing that the work of God basically may progress of itself without the reception of the Holy Spirit.
H.B. It says, "being assembled with them". Would that show that they had developed ability to eliminate what was unsuitable to His presence?
J.T. Yes, the whole chapter indicates certain elements that the endings of the gospels do not give to us. We all do well to judge ourselves in the light of the endings of the gospels, for they contemplate those who are believers to a point, but who are very ignorant and dark and confused. What is presented in the second chapter of Acts would be in agreement with the incoming of the Spirit in the believer. There must be some work prior to this according to the way things are presented in Scripture, as Paul says to the Ephesians, "Having believed, ye have been sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise".
R.B. How do you understand the Lord charging the apostles "by the Holy Spirit", in verse 2?
J.T. Luke says that he wrote before about "all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up". It is to be understood that the Holy Spirit was there, but there in Christ and in Christ only.
F.I. In @John 20, He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit"; they received the Holy Spirit as from Himself.
J.T. Well, that is a pattern of what should happen after the Holy Spirit came from heaven because while the Lord was here He had not yet been sent down from heaven. It can only be a pattern in
{156}
@John 20. It says that He breathed into the disciples, but we can hardly say that subjectively the Spirit was there, giving any character to them, because it is said afterwards, that the leading ones turned away and went fishing. What is said in @John 20 is just a pattern as to what would happen when the Holy Spirit was given from heaven.
F.B.W. Are you calling attention to certain features in this chapter which are at the foundation of things in view of the Spirit's coming?
J.T. That is exactly the point in mind, that we have fundamental facts, fundamental in view of the fulness or completeness. The succeeding chapters would refer to the work of the Spirit in the saints, as in them; the Spirit Himself in them. All the instruction that flowed out to them, and the spiritual ornamentation, involved the formation of the assembly as such, and the formation of each believer. All that is in mind in the succeeding chapters, beginning with chapter 2, but chapter 1 is just basic; that is to say, without speaking of the Spirit Himself as coming in from heaven, and the formation that He would bring about in them.
W.H. This would seem to be a certain service on the Lord's part, do you mean, prior to the coming of the Spirit? It says "he presented himself living" and then "being seen by them during forty days", and then He was "speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God", and then His ascension. Would all these elements enter into what is basic?
J.T. Quite so, to make them suitable for the great thought God had in mind. And so chapter 2 begins with the fact that the Spirit came as the saints were assembled in the house, "and there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other
{157}
tongues as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth". And so the passage runs on to verse 14, which says, "But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them, Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words; for these are not full of wine, as ye suppose, for it is the third hour of the day; but this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel". That is to say, the Spirit is definitely here and acting already now as the Preacher in a gifted man, and the gospel is unfolded. And then we are told from verse 37 of chapter 2 about those who were converted; "they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles, What shall we do, brethren? And Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call. And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation. Those then who had accepted his word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls. And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". From this verse to the end, we have the description of those who were there in Jerusalem, including the converts, and there were three thousand of them. So that we have in this chapter 2 what involves Christianity, whereas chapter 1 is bare material for building up the great structure of Christianity; the bare material, but largely built on what is in the endings of the gospels.
A.R. Would you say that chapter 1 might be an example of the way the Lord was teaching them Himself, and shows the improvement with them as
{158}
the result of the Lord's own teaching, before the Spirit came?
J.T. Just so; during the fifty days. These days would imply what has been already intimated, that the work of God in itself, that is, new birth in itself, effects something, though not full Christianity, but it effects something that is remarkable and is basic.
Ques. Would this section of the book of Acts show that one feature that has basically been built into the souls of persons is obedience, and is that primarily one of the things that is necessary for the reception of the Holy Spirit? It says that God gives the Holy Spirit to those that obey Him. They were charged by the Holy Spirit to remain in the city until they were endued with power, and the chapter shows that they were obedient to that charge.
J.T. Well, that is true. There were many other things, of course, but we have to treat them all as a whole, so that we might see what the work of God really is by itself, before the Holy Spirit comes in to effect all, for it is the Spirit of God that guides us into all the truth.
A.M. Is this a kind of completion of the great vessel that is about to be filled, considering the vessel by itself; not just the persons that constitute it, but the vessel itself, as the Lord's own handiwork?
J.T. Yes, if you mean by the vessel, that the assembly was there, what you say is quite correct and important. It was only there in prospect, because it could not be formed, except by the Spirit.
A.M. I was thinking of the words, for instance, "with one accord" and then the "crowd of names". Does it not suggest the thought of the vessel prepared to receive the Spirit?
J.T. Well, the material is there, but the actual setting up of the vessel, the formation of the vessel
{159}
was by the Holy Spirit. The saints are not to be viewed in the assembly, save as by the Holy Spirit. We are baptised into one body, "for also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body", @1 Corinthians 12: 13.
-.P. Would Peter himself be an example of this, the product of the gospel and the work of God?
J.T. Quite so. Some of us were noticing this morning that Peter is called Simon in Luke, it is said that the Lord appeared to him. "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon", but when Paul mentions him, as appeared to by the Lord, he is called Cephas, which is his assembly name, the name by which he is to be known as assembly material, as of the assembly, and that is something that bears on all of us. As we sit down together, we come in responsively, in view of the assembly, in view of our partaking of the Lord's supper and all that follows upon it. We are in the light of the assembly. We already have the Spirit, and we are able to act assembly-wise. We are, therefore, enabled to act as if we were *Cephas*, and that is how Paul relates the matter. The Lord appeared to Cephas, meaning that He appeared to him in his assembly relation. This chapter hardly opens that up for us, although of course, he is Cephas, and he is moving in the light of his name too.
A.S. Would this chapter have any correspondence with the "unformed substance" spoken of in @Psalm 139?
J.T. Yes. That is a psalm that should be looked into in relation to the assembly as it prophetically alludes to it, though it would be purely abstract. If we regard ourselves in relation to the assembly in that sense, it would be purely abstract, and so this chapter is abstract. It deals with the basic substance
{160}
or facts as to the material out of which the assembly was formed.
F.B.W. Would you open up what you have in mind in calling attention to what is basic in this chapter?
J.T. Just that we might note the material from which we have sprung as in the assembly.
A.R. It says, the number of names together was about one hundred and twenty. Would each of the names suggest what is basic?
J.T. And more than that. There would be the administrative thought -- ten times twelve. Undoubtedly the number helps us in this respect, and it enters into this chapter with the idea of responsibility attached to each of them. But the fact that they had names, and the word *crowd* is used, meaning that they were not specially ordered, indicates that there was something there by which they are to be designated. As the Spirit came, each one of them would have a name.
H.B. I was thinking of Cornelius, he had not the Spirit, and there was something particular with him.
J.T. Yes. He was able to build up a memorial in heaven, and that would establish what has been said that the work of God is something in itself, and effects something before the Holy Spirit comes.
G.D. Is it seen in the beginning of @Acts 19, where Paul arrives at Ephesus and finds certain disciples, then he raises the question, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?"
J.T. Yes, that would be something like this; Apollos too, although Apollos evidently had improved on them. He had more than those twelve men. They did not even know that the Holy Spirit was come, they said, which shows a state very like the ignorance and the darkness that is seen in the endings of the gospels. Here in @Acts 1 there is more
{161}
life, but the endings of the gospels correspond very much to these twelve men that were found at Ephesus. But then Paul soon adjusted them; their ignorance was not allowed to continue. They were to be used, and he said, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed? And they said to him, We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come". Then the apostle instructs them, and when they heard what Paul had to say, they were baptised, showing they were obedient to the word; but it seems that their ignorance was culpable, for they did not even know about the Spirit, and yet John the baptist himself spoke about the Holy Spirit. This is often seen in our own time, people do not know things that they should know. Paul laid his hands on them. We have in this the idea of linking on with the brethren. The thought in the laying on of the hands is that in getting the Spirit we are linked up unitedly in one body.
W.H. Would the two references to the Spirit in chapter 1 of the Acts bear on what you are saying? In verse 5 the writer speaks about being "baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days". Would that be preparation in view of the organism and unity; and then in verse 8, the Holy Spirit having come upon them, that the service would be taken up in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so. That is obviously anticipative, and the Lord was preparing them for it, but it had to await His ascension. He was forty days on earth before He ascended; that is another thing. Why did He not go to heaven at once? There must have been something more in His mind to effect preparatory to the reception of the Spirit. Then there were ten days more also.
-.P. Would something of this preparatory work be seen in verse 14, "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several
{162}
women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren"?
J.T. Yes; the work is progressing; the work of God has power to progress in itself. I mean the work of God, before the Spirit is given. Even in the Old Testament times, we have something like this, not just so full as this, but there is enough to show that the work of God is the work of God, and it must proceed until the coming in of the Spirit.
A.R. Have you something in your mind as to the additional ten days after the forty days?
J.T. Well; there must be some meaning in the mind of heaven why the Lord did not go up to heaven the day He arose. He could have gone. In fact, @Luke 24 would indicate that that was the thought, as if He hasted to go up, in order to begin the great administration He had in mind, but He did not; and Luke the same writer tells us expressly in Acts that He remained forty days with them, and what He did while He was here. It is said, "concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up; to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and being assembled with them". All this must have been in the Lord's mind as necessary preparatory work and the fact now is that such preparatory work is necessary in order to prepare us for the Spirit at the present time.
R.McK. When the Lord says in @John 14, "if ye love me keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter", is the Lord there taking account of something existing before the Spirit is come?
{163}
J.T. Quite so. These things are necessary, and the Lord was working in order to affect them individually, but they were very slow in learning and, of course, we all are.
H.K.R. Would the last two verses in Luke's gospel refer to the effects of the forty days that He remained with them? "And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God". Does this suggest that the ignorance and darkness had in some measure been removed?
J.T. The end of Luke happily corresponds with the beginning of Acts. The Lord Jesus went up from Bethany, we are told in the end of Luke, and as we have remarked, it appears as if the Lord intended to go up that very day, but He did not. Luke is led of the Spirit to write the Acts, so that the whole matter should be clarified, and that the assembly's structural formation should be rightly understood; the gospels in themselves did not give the full thought. It reminds us of much that may be thought over and meditated upon as to what is written, and how men were to write, by the Spirit of God, what they were intended to write, and afterwards how they may have thought over it. The Lord helped Luke to write another treatise so that we have the full thought that enters into the formation of the structure of the assembly.
J.B. Does the necessity for another apostle, in view of completeness, indicate in a way that they had apprehended the reason for the extension of the ten days?
J.T. There must be the twelve, although the Lord did not tell them to provide another. That only indicates what we were saying, that they were steadily improving even before the Spirit came. The sense that the twelve should be complete arose from themselves, and so we find in verse 15, that
{164}
"Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said, (the crowd of names who were together was about a hundred and twenty,) Brethren, it was necessary that the scripture should have been fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke before, by the mouth of David, concerning Judas". Clearly there was progress in the disciples and apostles, before the Spirit came, showing that in themselves, the work of God is capable of this even before the Spirit is received. I have thought of it several times, and I hope the brethren will not think that I am merely repeating, but I am speaking of it because I know that there is much abroad about new birth, and the idea that things take place at once, simultaneously or automatically, but they do not; the work of God must take place of itself. Of course, the Spirit's work is the work of God too, but I am speaking now of God's work sovereignly by the Spirit as over against the work of the Spirit as indwelling the believer. There is something there that progresses of itself, so that a certain state is brought about to prepare us for the Holy Spirit.
Rem. You are stressing that the Lord did not stay with them the whole fifty days.
J.T. He stayed forty days, and we can see from the facts that we have here, that He did certain things during those days.
J.L. Is your thought that God sovereignly begins anew in a soul, and if there is to be any progress or development, the Holy Spirit is necessary?
J.T. Yes, there may be development before, because this chapter indicates improvements on what marked the disciples at the endings of the gospels, and it is to emphasise what the work of God is in itself. On the other hand, those who have not the Spirit should become exercised so as to be sure to have Him, because if they do not, they will never
{165}
make any definite headway according to the mind of God.
Ques. By what means is this work of God accomplished?
J.T. Well, the work that we are speaking of, of course, begins with new birth, but we are to distinguish that from the Spirit as come, and how He operates in the soul of a believer after He is received.
D.F. Does Nicodemus afford us an example of what is before you? The Lord speaking to him at first says, "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God", and the footnote there (in the Darby Translation) says, 'It is a new source and beginning of life'.
J.T. Well, that is important, and what the Lord adds to that is in agreement with what we have been saying, and it ought to be clear. In verse 5 we read, "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God". The idea of entering is an increase on seeing.
Ques. Does entering involve enjoyment of the position, whereas seeing would be apprehension; new birth giving one the ability for this?
J.T. Quite so. What He is dealing with is new birth, not the gospel, in the third chapter of John's gospel.
H.McL. What is meant by being "sealed with the Holy Spirit", in @Ephesians 1: 13, and when does that take place?
J.T. That takes place when the Holy Spirit comes into the believer, when He is received. So that we read in @2 Corinthians 1, "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts". There are three things, the *anointing*, the *sealing*, and the *earnest* in the heart.
{166}
G.D. The movement is very quick with Cornelius and his company. Would you suggest that Cornelius sets forth one who was good material?
J.T. Yes, he was already born anew. He was already recognised in heaven as having built up a memorial before he had the Spirit, and so while Peter is speaking to the company in his house, the Holy Spirit fell upon them before Peter stopped speaking; this shows how ready the Spirit was to come into persons to seal them who were ready for Him.
F.I. You were speaking last evening as to being born of God. What relation has that to new birth and the reception of the Spirit?
J.T. I would think that the reception of the Spirit implies that the receivers were born of God, but the new birth does not go so far as being born of God. I am going by the words of the Lord. Jesus; He said that unless anyone be born again, or born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
Ques. How far does the Lord's statement to Nicodemus go, "born of water and of Spirit"? Would you say that the one involves the kingdom and the other the assembly?
J.T. It is just enlargement of what He had said. I do not think either involves the assembly.
R.B. Does the reception of the Holy Spirit involve the assembly?
J.T. The reception of the Holy Spirit does involve the assembly, but then we have spoken of two things, "born anew" and "born of water and of Spirit". This latter is an increase on "born anew", and it shows that the work of God itself progresses.
Ques. Is new birth entirely sovereign in the way of the work of God, or do you allow the idea of responsibility in it?
J.T. I would say it is entirely the sovereignty of God by the Spirit; if the word *sovereign* means anything,
{167}
it means that. You do not preach to people to be born anew. What you do say to them is, "Ye must be born again". That is to say, the thing must happen, and it is a sovereign act of God when it does happen.
A.R. Would you present it to people's responsibility that they must be born again?
J.T. I certainly should, especially if they are religious. If you were speaking to a number of religious persons, who depend on their own good works, would you not say to them, "Ye must be born again"? I would say that the Lord implies in the way He speaks to Nicodemus, that Nicodemus himself was born again. "But there was a man from among the Pharisees, his name Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi".
Rem. John says that the Lord did not commit Himself to men, for He knew what was in man. "But there was a man"; the 'but' implies that Nicodemus was the subject of new birth.
J.T. Quite so.
H.K.R. Does the sovereign action come in in @John 3: 8, "the wind bloweth where it listeth"?
J.T. I would say that shows the sovereign action. You cannot explain it; no natural man can explain it, "so is everyone that is born of the Spirit".
Ques. Of one of the scribes in @Mark 12, who conversed with the Lord as to the commandments, we are told that "Jesus, seeing that he had answered intelligently, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God". Would that show the work of God?
J.T. That is a good illustration of the work of God, and there are such. Very little can be said about them, but there is something by which you can discern that the work of God is taking place in them, and I believe that is what the Lord meant.
{168}
The Lord saw that he answered intelligently. That is the word Paul applies to those of us who partake of the Lord's supper; "I speak as to intelligent persons".
G.L. They said, "Thou Lord, knower of the hearts of all", @Acts 1: 24. Would that have in mind what would develop as the work of God progressed?
J.T. Just so. God knows what is going on in our hearts.
I think we should now go on to verse 21; "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection". Now this shows remarkable intelligence in Peter. He knows that an apostle is to be selected, and he is to be one who is conversant with the Lord's life, His ways and ministry from the baptism of John until He was taken up. It is remarkable that Peter had that intelligence at this point, and so it is said, "And they appointed two, Joseph, who was called Barsabas, who had been surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, knower of the hearts of all, shew which one of these two thou hast chosen, to receive the lot of this service and apostleship, from which Judas transgressing fell to go to his own place. And they Gave lots on them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles". That shows that heaven intervened and supported what they were doing, but *they* were doing it, showing that the work of God in them was progressing.
-.P. Peter skilfully brings in the quotation from @Psalm 69.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord Himself had instructed him. He opened their understandings in view of
{169}
telling them how the gospel should be proclaimed, that repentance and remission of sins should be proclaimed to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
W.S. They chose two, who were suitable as far as they could discern, but *the Lord's* choice is final.
J.T. They gave lots on them, and the lot fell on Matthias. It was the Old Testament way, but it was honoured for *the Lord* Himself indicated by it His choice of Matthias for the position; so it is said later that He appeared to the *twelve*, meaning that Matthias was among them.
H.K.R. One is impressed in regard to the basic thought you have been bringing before us, and the importance of the names. Does the work of God in the soul call for a name being put upon it, especially in the light of things at the present day?
J.T. Well, what you say is right. What we have said already about Peter refers to that. John says, "thou shalt be called *Cephas*". Matthew says, "thou art Peter", meaning that he was the thing, not *called* Peter. That is important, that we are what we say we are.
{170}
THE FOUNDATION OF GOD
@1 Corinthians 1: 1 - 9; @1 Corinthians 3: 14 - 17; @1 Corinthians 5: 6 - 8; @2 Timothy 2: 19, 21
J.T. The object in mind in the first set of scriptures read, is to call attention to what was at the beginning, the Holy Spirit having come. The saints at Corinth are addressed according to what we have read as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours". The saints at Corinth arc thus regarded as having the status of the assembly of God, which is at Corinth. The passages read treat of the truth in an abstract way, as I hope to show. The brethren will understand that I use the word abstract in no sense to baffle our minds, but simply that we may see that divine conditions are seen as intact, notwithstanding the serious evil that had arisen in the assembly at Corinth. The evil, in itself, did not disturb the status of the assembly, for it is regarded as "the assembly of God" in Corinth in spite of what had transpired. The same is true of what was read in the third chapter which refers to the temple of God and then in the fifth chapter, where, although there was serious wickedness, they are enjoined to purge out the old leaven, "according as ye are unleavened". That is the abstract idea. It is said that they were *unleavened* notwithstanding the serious evil which had arisen, but the Spirit of God through Paul urged the saints to purge it out. The passage in the second epistle to Timothy shows that evil had come in to such a degree in the profession that it had to be called a great house; the local companies being no longer acknowledged publicly as the assembly of God. It is viewed as a leavened system, not as it was in 1 Corinthians, but because of the seriousness
{171}
of the evil that had come in. That evil is indicated in what is said in verse 16 of the chapter read, "But profane, vain babblings shun, for they will advance to greater impiety, and their word will spread as a gangrene; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; men who as to the truth have gone astray, saying that the resurrection has taken place already, and overthrow the faith of some". That is to say, the faith of some that were there was overthrown by the evil doctrine, but even so the Spirit of God says, "Yet the firm foundation of God stands". That is to say, the foundation that Paul said he had placed in Corinth stood in spite of the evil that had come in; that foundation was of God. Paul goes on to say, "The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". That is to say, the withdrawal from iniquity would enable those who thus acted to pursue what is indicated in the first chapter of 1 Corinthians. They would not assume to be *the* assembly of God, but would act in the light of it, recognising that they were but a remnant of persons who had withdrawn from the public profession of Christianity. The apostle then goes on to say, "But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour". This is followed by another statement of special importance, "if therefore one shall have purified himself from these", that is, vessels to dishonour, "in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work". These preliminary remarks have been made deliberately, so that the brethren will understand what is in mind. The last scripture read in the second epistle to Timothy contemplates where the brethren are now. God is mercifully coming in and
{172}
separating His people from the evil that has grown up in Christendom, so that His service should continue. It is said here, "Yet the firm foundation of God stands". It is not said, that it *should* stand; it *does* stand, so that, as having withdrawn from iniquity, we can go on with the service and testimony of God.
T.M. We must keep the abstract idea in mind; and, acknowledging and judging the ruin that has come in, separate from iniquity. Is that in your mind?
J.T. That is right. The abstract idea refers to what God has affected, and we are entitled thus to regard those who are separated from the evil, as being separated ourselves. Any who think that they can continue in the public associations of Christendom, without being separated from the evil, will find that God will not be with them. The Christian profession is now regarded as a great house, in which there are vessels to honour and vessels to dishonour, but in order to be serviceable, it is necessary to withdraw from iniquity, and be separated from the dishonourable vessels.
A.I. The great difficulty has been, in persons trying to rectify the bad conditions of things, whereas we are told to withdraw from iniquity and separate ourselves.
J.T. That is the word. It is plainly stated, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity". The iniquity is not stated, but whatever iniquity it may be the believer ought to be able to discern and name it. And then it goes on in verse 20, "But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour". These are specified. The iniquity of verse 19 is not specified. It is for us to discern iniquity and to withdraw from it, but verse 21 says,
{173}
"If therefore, one shall have purified himself from these in separating himself from them"; that is to say, from "vessels to dishonour"; such are unconverted or unjudged persons operating in the things of God.
J.M. Is this an individual matter?
J.T. The separating is. Paul says, "Let every one". We do not separate *en masse*. Each separates for himself. Multitudes might go on with the evil, as is evident in the profession; but those who have withdrawn and separated, as coming together are purified, and can in humility take on the position of the assembly of God, carrying on the service of God.
R.P. Is that the way in which the fellowship can be recognised?
J.T. Quite so; where there is separation from evil. Following that there is the positive side, stated in verse 22, "But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". That is where, I might say, the conditions are seen.
A.I. We are balanced with those two words "with those". Some might have had an independent view of the pathway, but it says, "with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". There are those with whom we can walk.
J.T. We can. Thank God there are some in many places throughout the world with whom we can walk and follow what is of God. We would like to be sure that the brethren have the abstract idea, that we might understand what is meant in the scriptures read in 1 Corinthians. The scripture in chapter 3, for instance (verse 16), "Do ye not know that ye" (that is the saints in Corinth) "are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" And then, another thing as to the abstract idea is in verse 14, "if the work of any one which he has built upon the foundation shall abide, he
{174}
shall receive a reward. If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, but so as through the fire" (verses 14, 15). The man is saved in spite of the fact that his works are burned up, meaning that abstractly he is a subject of the work of God, and that in itself remains, but he never judged the principle of the evil; he was saved so as through fire.
T.M. Do you see the principle of it in Lot? He never judged the principle of the world, yet he was saved, but as through the fire.
J.T. He was difficultly saved. Peter says, "if the righteous is difficultly saved", referring to the conditions through which he is saved.
A.M-r. Is the foundation here the same as in @2 Timothy 2?
J.T. No; save in the sense that what Paul laid at Corinth was of God, hence the Corinthian saints are said to be the temple of God without any modification or qualification, although the apostle goes on to say that there was evil amongst them. That is to say, they were viewed abstractly as the temple of God, because the Spirit of God was dwelling there. It is God's foundation, although Paul had laid it.
W.C. What might we understand by these terms, "the assembly of God", and "the temple of God"?
J.T. Well, the assembly of God is the way the saints are addressed in the first chapter; they are also said to be the temple, but this has a different meaning. The idea of *assembly* is that the persons are called out of the world and constituted, by reason of the presence of the Holy Spirit and the work of God in each individual, equal to act for God as His assembly; but the temple is where divine communications are made, where God speaks to His people. The word *assembly* does not mean the same as the word *temple*, although it refers to
{175}
the same persons. The divine communications are made because the Spirit of God is in the place.
D.S.M. Does the first epistle to the Corinthians bring out the furnishings that are available for the saints of God who accept the ruin spoken of in second Timothy?
J.T. Quite so. In verse 4 of chapter 1, Paul says, "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge, (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,) so that ye come short in no gift". The apostle does not speak of their requirements, but rather of God's enrichments or furnishings, that they are well furnished. "in everything ye have been enriched in him in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you), so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you to the end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ", and then he adds another great furnishing, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord". The whole thing thus stated is abstract, and there is no discrepancy. The work of God is contemplated; what He had effected in the Corinthians.
J.L. Does the status of the assembly stand connected with the fellowship of His Son?
J.T. It does clearly. The abstract passage, I would say, ends in the ninth verse, although the abstract idea runs through the whole epistle, but these verses in themselves contemplate the intactness of the assembly in Corinth, in spite of the fact that there was actual evil there, but it was stated by the apostle in view of the evil being dealt with. However, it was not all dealt with or put away,
{176}
because it is said later in the second letter that there were certain things to be dealt with (@2 Corinthians 12: 21); but in that there was that which had been dealt with -- there was a good moral reason for regarding them as clear.
Rem. So that the abstract position enables us not only to find our way intelligently in relation to the profession, but also to go on together as working out divine thoughts.
J.T. That is the idea; *to go on together*. As already remarked, there is that which we are to flee and what we are to pursue. "But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". Thus it is that we go on together. We might be a hundred, or two only, but we can go on, and the Lord Jesus has promised to be with us. As it says at the end of Matthew, "lo, *I* am with you alway, even unto the end". Then in @Matthew 18: 20, He says, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".
A.I. You mentioned the remnant idea of things, and I suppose that always has to be taken account of. The word to Philadelphia says, "Thou hast a little strength ... and hast not denied my name". Weakness is there, yet there is a little strength.
J.T. Quite so, but that epistle contemplates the intactness of what there is. It is the day of small things. What is of God is there, and in a remnant, and He says "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, *I* also will keep thee"; 'thee' here means the whole assembly. The assembly is indwelt by the Spirit of God. We are to be kept "out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth", @Revelation 3: 10.
{177}
A.B. Why does he bring in the brother, Sosthenes, in the first verse of 1 Corinthians?
J.T. I would say, to show the brotherly spirit that Paul maintained, for he was not writing simply for himself. He says, "Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother". You will find the same thing in other epistles. It is to bring in the brotherly element in order to add to the apostolic authority of Paul. In Exodus, Moses was to be the apostle to unfold the truth, but Aaron was given to him as a brother; "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?", God says, @Exodus 4: 14. Aaron as a brother would link up with Moses, and so here the brother is linked up with Paul. The extension of that would mean in this day, or wherever the brethren are gathered, that the brotherly element would be present as well as the authority that the Lord has placed among us.
E.R. We get "in Christ Jesus" seven times in the second epistle to Timothy.
J.T. That is proof that they were maintaining the intactness of the position. We are in Christ Jesus. We are not in the system of men.
T.M. Would you say that we have an analogy to that in @Exodus 32, where Moses pitched the tent outside the camp? He acted on the principle of separation from the iniquity, owning the ruin.
J.T. Quite so. He went outside the camp because of the wickedness in the camp; the camp was corrupt. It is a very good scripture to bring in, in relation to 2 Timothy and 1 Corinthians.
A.M-d. What is involved in the expressions, "call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" in 1 Corinthians; and then in 2 Timothy, "call upon the Lord"?
J.T. Well, I would say that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is basic according to the Acts. The gospels and all the ministry are in that Name, and
{178}
so John says, "that ye might have life in his name". Things are held in that Name. It means that the Lord is not here. He is absent, but His Name is here, and the Spirit of God supports that Name, and those that call upon it. But then when we come to *the Lord* in the second epistle to Timothy, "But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord", I would say that refers to the authority of the Lord; it is to remind us of His authority. His name carries with it all that He is, but His authority is in the term "Lord". He is made "both Lord and Christ", we are told, which is important to keep before us. There are those who separate from the brethren, and do things that are contrary to the truth, and to the principles governing the assembly. Well, they are lawless, and the Lord will deal with them. The incestuous man who is spoken of in Corinthians is dealt with on that principle.
W.S. You mean on the principle of what is due to the Lord?
J.T. Just so. The apostle wrote to them saying, "For *I*, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present, to deliver, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this; to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus", @1 Corinthians 5: 3 - 5. It is clear there that the authority of the Lord is carried into the act of discipline against the man who is put away from amongst the saints; he is delivered unto Satan for destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
R.P. What is involved in "all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours", @1 Corinthians 1: 2?
{179}
J.T. Well, I think it is to bring out the universality of the assembly. That brings up another matter; namely, that at the beginning, in the book of Acts, there was a metropolitan situation at Jerusalem. The word *assembly* is used in the singular in @Acts 2: 47. The word assembly may not be strictly there, but it is in the principle of it. The assembly was there at Jerusalem in a metropolitan position in Judaea, and the Lord added to it, but in due course, as the testimony went on, through the labours of others and the apostle Paul, there were assemblies formed in gentile cities, not only the assembly in Jerusalem. There may have been several gatherings in Jerusalem, but no matter how many they would be called 'the assembly of God in Jerusalem'. In due time, we have assemblies in other cities, and it is said in @Acts 14, that Paul and Barnabas chose there elders in each assembly; that would mean that these assemblies were constituted as self-supporting wherever they were throughout the earth. They would not be regulated by Jerusalem as a metropolitan centre. Wherever assemblies were formed, there were elders and these elders would rule, so that the order of God would be maintained, and with it the unity of the assemblies; as it is said by Paul, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies". They would be in the same fellowship; the same teaching that marked one assembly would mark all the others, and that, I think, is what is meant here by the words, "all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours".
D.S.M. So that no local exercise would be taken up except in the light of what is universal.
J.T. That is the idea. Whatever is done should be such as could be endorsed by the brethren everywhere. Local independency is against the principles of the assembly in that sense.
{180}
F.I. Paul says in Corinthians we are "called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord". Is 'our Lord' the bond of fellowship?
J.T. That is just what we get here, and "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called". There is "the fellowship of his Son", our Lord, and then there is "the communion of the blood of Christ", that is, His death (chapter 10: 16); and then there is "the communion of the Holy Spirit", @2 Corinthians 13: 14. So that the fellowship is the great feature in those matters.
W.C. Does the reference to "his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord", dignify the fellowship?
J.T. I would say so. It is not simply the Lord, but He is the Son of God; that is the great feature in it, that Christ is the Son of God. It is a great thing to keep in our minds the dignity of the fellowship. Imagine a person saying he was going out of fellowship in the light of that. How ridiculous, and yet how wrong!
Ques. Does that dignity enter into the working out of things in @Matthew 18, "if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer"?
J.T. Quite so; "let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer". He shows that he is unfit for the fellowship, and that the assembly has power to deal with evil. If the assembly is not recognised, the person is disqualified for the fellowship.
T.M. What is your thought in regard to localities where things have dwindled down to one brother? Does it bear out what we have here in principle?
J.T. Well, it would make it necessary for him to walk alone. He would have to do it. God would not leave him alone long.
A.I. Would you think that in the normal setting there are two or three gathered together?
{181}
J.T. Well, of course, he may have to learn to walk with God like Enoch; one brother could not maintain the service of God in the assembly, he could not break bread alone, and, of course, he may have to suffer and sacrifice and go to the next meeting. He would have to sacrifice so as to be with the brethren.
T.M. Even if there were two or three sisters in the locality walking in the same path.
J.T. Quite so, but they could go on and break bread together if they were in a normal setting. They could continue to break bread because there are two or three. The scripture does not say two or three brothers, but "two of you".
T.M. One would like help in regard to dealing with evil where two or three witnesses are needed. In regard to dealing with evil can sisters be with us?
J.T. Quite so. They should be listened to. The Lord rebuked the apostles in @Mark 16, because they did not believe what the women said.
A.I. Is there a normal assembly function with one brother?
J.T. Why not? It may be small conditions, but it is a situation that the Lord can own, because you have three or four persons who love the Lord, who have the Spirit, who are of the assembly. Why not continue?
J.B. The keeping of the concrete idea before us would be a great matter?
J.T. Quite so. That is what I was saying. I hope we all take it in, because it is an immense thing in heaven to have one or two who love the Lord Jesus, and who care for His interests. Sisters, or even a sister, are regarded as capable of exercising discipline. If there is a brother there, and he is not going on in the truth, the sister may have to separate from him, which would be exercising discipline.
{182}
H.P. Does the whole of this epistle govern the situation?
J.T. 1 Corinthians does. It is all one thing, really. It is in the singular. It is all one commandment, really. Paul says, "let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14: 37. You see what scope we have in the term "Lord".
W.S. I was wondering if the elect lady would come in here?
J.T. The second epistle of John speaks of this: "The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom *I* love in truth, and not *I* only but also all who have known the truth, for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity. Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father. And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another. And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments". So that this elect lady was being instructed, and exhorted in regard to all that we are speaking of. That as regards the truth, John says, "That ye might walk in it. For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh -- this is the deceiver and the antichrist. See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive full wages. Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, *he* has both the Father and the Son. If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into the house, and greet him not; for he who greets him partakes in his wicked
{183}
works". I think we can see that discipline is involved in all that.
F.I. Is it not one of the greatest encouragements we have in walking in the pathway in which we are, that we are able to exercise discipline. There are other companies of Christians who are not able to exercise discipline, but we are able to exercise discipline as moving in relation to divine principles.
J.T. I am sure we all agree with that. At least we all should.
A.B. God does not go on with evil either small or great.
J.T. Quite so. We do not need to, because we can separate from it. "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".
T.M. So that there is no excuse if there is only one brother, if you have godly sisters. They can act in the Lord's name.
J.T. Quite so. We have experienced that many times.
A.I. All this is to enhance the ground of our gathering.
J.T. Quite so. The abstract idea too, and how it applies to persons who have the Holy Spirit, as the Lord said of Him, "He dwelleth with you and shall be in you", @John 14: 17. He is the power by which we do all these things and exercise all matters of discipline.
T.M. Would you help us with regard to the difference between 1 Corinthians and 2 Timothy, in regard to the statements, "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves", and that in 2 Timothy as to "withdraw from iniquity", and purging ourselves from vessels to dishonour?
J.T. Well, putting away involves public power, whereas withdrawing is an acknowledgment that you cannot act in the same sense in power. We are
{184}
in a day of small things, and we have owned that we are, and that we are not possessed of the power that they had in apostolic times. The apostle says in @1 Corinthians 5, "with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ". "For *I* as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present, to deliver in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ". Notice this, he is doing it himself, "to deliver in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ)". He is not doing it by himself, individually, he is doing it with them, but it is in this way that he speaks: "Ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, him that has so wrought this: to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". That is the ground or basis on which things were carried out at the beginning, but the word in 2 Timothy indicates the ground or basis on which we have to act now, in the absence of public power; we are to withdraw from iniquity, but at the same time the foundation of God stands today.
J.B. Would you say it is the same in principle?
J.T. I would. It is the same *in principle*, only the weakness is acknowledged.
T.M. You mean that in withdrawing we are not claiming assembly status, as it was at Corinth. The designation "the assembly of God which is at Corinth" means they had that status and were thus owned of God, which meant public power to deal with evil.
J.T. We choose our language, and speak according to facts, and hence we are consistent in saying, *we withdraw*. There is no power to force people out if they do not walk in the truth, and therefore, we withdraw from them.
{185}
A.M-r. Have you the thought in @Jeremiah 15, "if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth"?
J.T. That is a very good scripture. "If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth". That is a service that the brethren render, of course.
W.S. Is loyalty to Christ especially called for in remnant days?
J.T. Just so, as expressed in the word in @1 Chronicles 12, "Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse". In Moses¬ time, to which we have already alluded, it says, "Who is on the Lord's side? Let him come unto me"; @Exodus 32.
J.M. What is the thought of withdrawing in 2 Thessalonians? "Now we enjoin you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the instruction which he received from us" (@2 Thessalonians 3:6).
J.T. That is plain enough so far, only it does not go so far as the instructions in 1 Corinthians or 2 Timothy. If you look at the margin you will see that the word withdraw means to shrink from. The word in the original only occurs there and in @2 Corinthians 8: 20. It is not the same as withdrawing in @2 Timothy 2. These are important distinctions, because the man in question there in Thessalonica is not as you might say wicked as the man in @1 Corinthians 5. Paul goes on to say, "For ye know yourselves how ye ought to imitate us, because we have not walked disorderly among you; nor have we eaten bread from any one without cost; but in toil and hardship working night and day not to be chargeable to any one of you; not that we have not the right, but that we might give ourselves as an example to you, in order to your imitating us. For also when we were with you we enjoined you this,
{186}
that if any man does not like to work, neither let him eat. For we hear that there are some walking among you disorderly, not working at all, but busybodies. Now such we enjoin and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that working quietly they eat their own bread". That is evidently not as serious as the wickedness at Corinth. It is a matter of a brother failing to work.
J.M. He would still be breaking bread.
J.T. Yes, quite so.
J.M-r. Is the withdrawal in 2 Timothy individual, and in 2 Thessalonians collective?
J.T. I would say that 2 Timothy means that we withdraw severally, although we are walking together in it; yet the withdrawal is for each one to come to. The passage read in 2 Thessalonians could refer to what is collective. "We enjoin you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye withdraw"; 'ye' implies what is collective; that is, the body of the brethren would withdraw from the brother like this until he judged himself; he would then work and eat his own bread, and not live on others. He is not to be regarded as an enemy. That indicates that it is a gradation of sin.
Rem. The action would have an admonishing effect according to verse 15.
J.T. Quite so.
T.M. You might help us with regard to the grading of sin in Scripture.
J.T. Well, you have it here. This man is not of the same grade as the man in Corinth, and therefore they were not to put him away, but to shrink from him, avoid him, give him to understand his conduct is not just.
J.B. Would you say that this walking disorderly might mean more than not working?
J.T. Well, it might. The brethren are to use their judgment about things. There is the order of
{187}
the assembly, and according to it discipline and rule are to be maintained.
R.P. Is there a further difference in the turning away from one in @Romans 16: 17?
J.T. Yes, I think that is more serious. The apostle says, "But I beseech you, brethren, to consider those who create divisions and occasions of falling, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learnt, and turn away from them. For such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting". That shows that it is more serious than what is spoken of in 2 Thessalonians, and almost as serious as what is at Corinth, because they are causing discord among the brethren.
T.H. Do we need an assembly meeting for dealing with evil?
J.T. I would say that in obeying the injunction to turn away from such men as those mentioned in @Romans 16: 17, and @2 Timothy 3: 5, the assembly should be brought into the matter and united action taken.
{188}
DAVID AND ABIGAIL
@1 Samuel 25: 1 - 9, 14 - 19, 32, 33, 39 - 42
J.T. There are several types which have served us well from time to time, to instruct us as to the assembly. David and Abigail will serve today, and the Lord might have a word for us in this type. It represents Christ militarily, and the assembly in accord with Him. Indeed the leading thought in the chapter is the assembly as typified in Abigail, who is said to have been marked by understanding. It is said, "the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife, Abigail, and the woman was of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance". The type makes much of the beauty of Abigail and her understanding, two features of great importance spiritually. The masculine side is not so pronounced; but it is seen in David, who in this chapter would in measure represent the brethren, although he does represent Christ in it. Sometimes those in responsibility in the testimony fail and the subjective side then comes into evidence, steadying the position; hence the wisdom of keeping sisters in mind as well as the brothers, in all matters of administration, because the administrative side requires the sisters as well as the brothers. Abigail specially represents skill and feeling according to God, at least in an administrative sense.
T.M. Do you see that in principle in the wise woman of Abel? She went to all the people in her wisdom (@2 Samuel 20: 20 - 22).
J.T. Quite so; she is a very good example, Abigail herself comparing with her in the wise approach she made to David.
A.I. Would you explain the administrative side in relation to the sisters¬ service?
J.T. Well, the woman of worth in the last chapter of the book of Proverbs is intended to represent
{189}
that. She is like Abigail though a hypothetical person, but presented to us in that light as a woman of great skill and great understanding, knowing what to do in all circumstances.
J.B. Is that service going on behind the scenes? I was thinking of "her husband is known in the gates", @Proverbs 31: 23.
J.T. Just so. I was thinking of what might come into that, also the woman in @2 Samuel 20; then in the case of Abigail, and in the instance of Sarah herself, who, although not presented as a type of the assembly, yet presents much that suggests it characteristically. Her words, which show determination as to Hagar and Ishmael, are quoted as scripture. She said that they should be cast out. In the epistle to the Galatians we read, "What saith the scripture?". Instances of that kind, and others referred to, illustrate the skill and wisdom of sisters in meeting emergencies. For instance, the elect lady in John's epistle may be so regarded.
T.M. Would you not regard that more on the line of what is individual? We referred yesterday to the position where there is only one brother in a locality; how would things be carried out assembly-wise with sisters as to administration?
J.T. Well, I think we see it in the scriptures alluded to. There was the question of Ishmael. His father was very concerned about him, but would have him remain in the house. God said to him as to Hagar and Ishmael, "In all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice". He did hearken to her, and the word of Sarah at that time is formally quoted by the apostle saying, "What saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son". So that, whatever emergency might be in mind, and they are coming up constantly, we understand that the assembly is qualified to meet them, because she is here in the absence of Christ. That
{190}
is the position of the woman of worth in @Proverbs 31; her husband is not in view, nor are his activities spoken of, but hers; yet he is known in the gates where administration is carried on. His heart confides in her.
A.I. Then is the woman in Proverbs a direct type of the assembly in that setting?
J.T. Yes, but she is spoken of in an abstract way. Undoubtedly the assembly is in mind. The book of Proverbs is the book of the wise man, and thus refers to Christ, but then He is absent; the Lord's supper supposes that He is absent. He comes to us, but we are to carry on in the interval, as furnished with what God gives us, "the all-various wisdom of God", which is in the assembly, not simply in Christ, but in the assembly (@Ephesians 3).
Ques. Does Deborah in the book of Judges show how the feminine side is taken up in an emergency?
J.T. She really is the guiding spirit in the whole matter there, although she is out of view in a certain sense, and she is not mentioned in @Hebrews 11. Barak is mentioned, but Deborah is distinguished in the way that she acted behind the scenes as in the secret of the matter.
G.M. It is said of the woman in Proverbs, "The heart of her husband confideth in her, and he shall have no lack of spoil". She would be going in for the spoil.
J.T. Deborah would represent that, also another woman in the same section; that is, Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite. She was militant.
A.I. On the side of administration, do you mean that the sisters would be behind the scenes?
J.T. Well, generally, because they cannot speak in the assembly, but they can speak to their husbands at home.
W.C. How would you take account of Abigail here being linked with Nabal, and yet she had good
{191}
understanding, having the features of Christ as seen in David?
J.T. Well, I suppose the type in this chapter contemplates the history of Abigail and the history of David too. They were contemporary of course, and I should think pretty much of the same age. They were contemporary and hence represent the wisdom to be acquired in the book of Samuel. The first book of Samuel has its own voice, and brings out the wisdom that was in such a man as Samuel himself, prophetic wisdom, which is a great matter now. God is reviving the thought of prophecy in our meetings for ministry, and it is intended to form the saints collectively; it is intended to form us all. So I believe that what we may be initially often changes as we develop through prophetic ministry that comes to us. Undoubtedly Abigail's whole outlook would be changed as she formed a judgment about Nabal; the young man had a right judgment of him too. The judgment expressed by the young man is like that of anyone in the assembly with light and faithfulness. It says of him, in verse 14, "And one of Nabal's young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife". He is spoken of as one of Nabal's young men, because he was ostensibly one of his servants; he told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master; and he has insulted them. And the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything as long as we companied with them, when we were in the fields. They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them feeding the sheep. And now know and consider what thou wilt do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his household; and he is such a son of Belial, that one cannot speak to him". And this represents the judgment of Abigail herself. So that the brethren
{192}
who are active in the assembly often have changes in their lives, and this is undoubtedly so in her case. She formed the judgment about her husband.
D.S.M. Samuel's death is referred to at the beginning of this chapter. Would Abigail represent the product of his ministry?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. He personally is stressed. Samuel died. It was a time of great sorrow really, and all Israel were gathered together and lamented him, and they buried him in his house at Ramah. So that we have history behind all this, including Samuel's ministry; the man who was recognised as the prophet from Dan to Beersheba, whose words did not fall to the ground. Evidently they had not fallen to the ground from Abigail, nor from David.
T.M. Why do you think that there is stress laid on the greatness of this man Nabal, and what he had here in contrast to David's position?
J.T. I think he would represent the Jewish nation at the time of the introduction of the assembly. His character is seen even in Saul of Tarsus, an insolent, overbearing man, we are told.
A.M-d. Paul speaks of grievous wolves not sparing the flock. It speaks of Nabal here as insulting David's messengers. That spirit follows on in the course of the testimony.
J.T. Quite so. You would not be sure of the sheep if you had someone like that about.
A.M-d. I was thinking of what place king Saul, who did not change, has over against David. He would be of Nabal's spirit.
J.T. He had the same character right through.
A.M-d. Nabal speaks well of Saul. He says, "There are many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master". He thought much more of Saul than of David.
{193}
J.T. It was a sharp thrust at David, when he said, "Many servants ... break away". He meant that David was headstrong, unreliable; at least the enemy would say so.
A.M-d. Nabal suggests that Saul was the man to follow?
J.T. Quite so. Well, we have now to consider the qualities of Abigail, because the qualities of David are not in mind so much. It is not David so much as the assembly. Although Christ is in mind too, it is rather the assembly, and how reliable it is in an emergency.
G.M. Would the young man in that way be intelligent as regards what the assembly should do? "Know and consider what thou wilt do".
J.T. He is not a mere messenger. He is an intelligent person, an intelligent brother, as we all ought to be. If anything arises, each of us should feel obligated to speak of it. One hears of things being said among the brethren that are not scriptural, but nothing being said by persons who ought to deal with them. That is the thing that enters into the chapter.
T.M. Are you suggesting that the young man puts information in the right place? He tells the assembly. Along with Abigail he had a right judgment in regard to things.
J.T. Quite so. If you hear anything, if such a one as myself, for instance, says something not true, the brethren ought to be on the alert, and not be afraid to speak about it.
A.I. Are you thinking of this matter of weighing things? "Know and consider". David was inclined to be rash.
J.T. He was rash. Therefore, it is not exactly the Lord, although He is here too, but I think that David is intended to be seen as a type of the brethren more, those who are responsible. We are apt to be
{194}
rash in these cases, whereas what the young man does is what any true brother or sister ought to do; if anything that he observes is wrong, he should lay the information where it belongs. Abigail represents the assembly in that sense. "Tell it to the assembly", is the word in @Matthew 18.
W.C. Do you mean that the church militant has power and wisdom to deal with any evil that might arise?
J.T. Just so, but especially when it is a question of meeting David. I mean of dealing with brethren themselves who are in the position of administration and may fail in it. She knew what to do. She learned from her young man, or rather Nabal's young man. He said to her, "And now know and consider what thou wilt do". He is doing his part, but he is speaking to those who are responsible. He is not speaking to David, but to Abigail, and she is responsible. He says, "For evil is determined against our master and against all his household". And then it says that Abigail made haste, taking with her abundant testimony to her regard for David. "She came down by the covert of the hill and behold David and his men came down against her, and she met them". Her wisdom shines in the way she turns David from his purpose, so that David comes to what is right. She has dissuaded him against an act of vengeance that he thought of. God has to do with the matter, and *He* deals with Nabal, and David is preserved by wisdom. There are things that happen amongst us that God alone can settle, and we have to give Him time to do it. After about ten days "the Lord smote Nabal that he died".
J.B. David says to Abigail, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me".
J.T. Quite so. David is recognizing the wisdom of Abigail, and he said, "Blessed be Jehovah, the
{195}
God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me. And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging myself with mine own hand". So that we can see how the responsible element may be dissuaded from what is not right by the calm, patient advice from sisters. Hence, the sisters need to be wise, to clothe with wisdom what they should say to their husbands. It is said, "Let them ask their husbands at home".
P.M. The king's business requires haste, and it says of Abigail that she made haste.
Ques. Do you think that her discernment is particularly emphasised in what she selected, as meeting the situation in the food she brought?
J.T. Yes. The food is a beautiful thought. Food has a great place in the economy of the assembly. "Let a man examine himself and so let him eat". The eating must be continued in order to build up the constitution, the power that our constitutions need. I am not saying it is solely dependent on the Lord's supper, but it is the idea of eating. And so you are struck with the variety. "Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skin-bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred raisin-cakes, and two hundred fig-cakes, and laid them on asses. And she said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you". She is wonderfully furnished to meet David. She had to appease him, because the whole matter was in her hands for the moment. Her husband was yet alive, and vengeance was against him, and it was for her to set aside the vengeance by grace, because that is the idea in the food, the excess of grace.
J.M. The first words that Abigail said to David were, "Upon me, my lord, upon me let the iniquity be". Why did she take that place?
{196}
J.T. She is taking the responsible place. It is really like Christ; like Rebecca in relation to Jacob. She took on the responsibility.
W.S. Would you say that David sets forth the brothers who might sometimes be found acting rashly?
J.T. Well, that is what I have in mind. Very often we do act rashly and very often feelings arise from behind the rashness.
W.B. In @Acts 5, when evil came up, Peter dealt with it apostolically, but in @1 Corinthians 5, Paul brings the whole assembly in, not merely brothers in care, dealing with evil; it is a question of the value of the assembly as balancing what brothers in care might think to do rashly.
J.T. Quite so. The sisters ought to have the balance. There is a beautiful word in Nehemiah. Nehemiah sought something from the king, which he succeeded in obtaining, but it says, "the queen also sitting by". She was not saying anything, but she was there; it is the feminine spirit.
G.M. Is that seen in what Abigail says, that the food is to be "given to the young men that follow my lord"? The young men that are following David are now getting this food.
J.T. I think the idea of food in this respect is grace, the overwhelming power of grace, and Abigail was the giver, but then she was in keeping with what she had with her according to David's own report. "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me. And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging myself with mine own hand". He does not refer to the food, but to her discernment and then says, "Blessed be thou", meaning that she had acquired a place now in his mind.
{197}
A.M-d. Would the sisters be tested as to their substance? I was just thinking of the women in @Luke 8, and at the cross, and of Lydia, and of the elect lady. It is important to have substance.
J.T. Very good, and there is the other at the end of Romans, Phoebe. You remember the beautiful tribute of the apostle in regard of her. All these and many more are in mind in the feminine side, what they can do in the way of influence and wisdom. According to @2 Samuel 20, as has been remarked already, the wise woman of Abel went to all the people in her wisdom. She went to Joab too. She saved the city.
D.S.M. The households are brought in at Corinth. Does that imply what you are saying? The house of Chloe told Paul.
J.T. That is remarkable. Paul had learned certain things from her. He had learned other things by common report, such as the incestuous man, but he learned from Chloe the division amongst the brethren at Corinth. Then we have the women in Philippians, who laboured with him in the gospel.
Ques. Does what Abigail says of David, in verse 28, "Evil has not been found in thee all thy days", correspond to the idea of the abstract you were speaking about? She holds on to that.
J.T. Quite so. She rose in her thoughts above the level of the chapter, I would say, as shown in the beautiful remarks she makes about David. She says further, "If a man is risen up to pursue thee". She alludes, not to Nabal but to Saul, for she has a judgment about him also. "If a man is risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out from the hollow of the sling. And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall do to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken
{198}
concerning thee, and shall appoint thee ruler over Israel, that this shall be no stumbling block to thee, nor offence of heart for my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall deal well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid". She is prophetic in what she says. All this is a most important matter as regards the composition of the assembly. The assembly is not composed of men. It is men and women. The public assembly is now constituted of men and women. Together they have responsibility. Presently the merging power of God will bring all together, on the one side the feminine and on the other side the masculine in Christ. That is, I think, what we have to understand in regard to Christ and the assembly.
T.M. Do you not think that we often suffer on account of knowing things and not taking them up? Things are left undealt with. Abigail made haste.
J.T. Quite so.
A.I. This would not be Nabal's house now. "Go up to *thy* house".
J.T. I suppose it would be in a way her house; the abstract idea being continued. Following this we see the result: "And it came to pass in about ten days that Jehovah smote Nabal, and he died". That is to say, God takes up an issue like this if we give Him time. We are all tested, and we need patience, but God deals with matters. And so when David heard that Nabal was dead (he did not kill him, for Abigail prevented that), he says, "Blessed be Jehovah, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has kept back his servant from evil; but Jehovah has returned Nabal's evil upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her as his wife". That is the next thing. It is a question of moral grounds now. It is not simply on the ground of her
{199}
beauty and intelligence, but on account of her skill and the means she had of dealing with the situation; the food she selected and brought would indicate her skill, too.
D.S.M. In connection with the thought of food, what is introduced in the prophetic ministry in @1 Corinthians 14 is in order that the assembly may be edified and all may learn and be encouraged. Is that the bringing in of the food?
J.T. Just so, the prophetic word is mentioned; "rather that ye may prophesy". Let that be the kind of ministry.
G.S. It says of Abigail that in the morning she told Nabal of these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. Ten days later he died. Does that in any way correspond with what is bound on earth being bound in heaven, @Matthew 18: 18?
J.T. It does. It says his heart died within him. He did not die as yet; the end is prolonged, I suppose. Probably the death of the Jewish system in the early days of the assembly's history is in mind; from the time of Stephen's testimony and that wonderful death, his martyrdom, you may see Nabal, as it were, becoming defunct, gradually approaching his death; that is like the death of Judaism, because it had become the positive enemy of Christianity. Paul's ministry and testimony became the means of that; it dogged his steps throughout, but he said, "Lo, we turn to the Gentiles", @Acts 13: 46 and the Jews were left arguing with one another, and they are doing that yet to this very day.
G.W. You spoke at the outset of changed persons. I was wondering if this matter was prolonged so that we might come to a right judgment with regard to Nabal?
J.T. You mean as to the state described in Nabal.
{200}
Ques. Is your thought in the latter part of the chapter that, as these features come to light in the assembly, Christ delights to bring her into conscious nearness to Himself as united to Him? David communed with Abigail.
J.T. You see David's judgment of Abigail; it is not exactly Christ, although He is seen there, but it is the exercise of the masculine side; that is, the responsible element, so to speak, in the assembly. Abigail came to the right thought of Nabal, but David came to the right thought of her, and so the pronouncement, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me. And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou". That is his judgment, and so what follows; that is, the death of Nabal brings about circumstances suitable for the union of Christ and the assembly; that is to say, it brings out the truth of it.
W.C. Would the smiting of Nabal be expressed in the word, "God has judged your judgment"? (@Revelation 18: 20).
J.T. Just so, but more particularly such judgment as is expressed in the epistle to the Thessalonians. In the second chapter of the first epistle, verse 14, the apostle says, "For *ye* brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus; for ye also have suffered the same things of your own countrymen as also *they* of the Jews, who have both slain the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have driven us out by persecution, and do not please God, and are against all men, forbidding us to speak to the nations that they may be saved, that they may fill up their sins always; but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost". That had to come about to make the way clear for the full thought of the assembly in Paul's ministry.
W.S. Has the Lord special pleasure in seeing the assembly answering to its responsibility?
{201}
J.T. I am sure He has. I am sure He is watching over all our care meetings, and efforts to maintain what is right in the spirit of grace. Abigail overcomes the spirit of Nabal, and so the Lord is pleased. I suppose David rises now to a type of Christ. It says, "David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her as his wife. And the servants of David came to Abigail to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee as his wife. And she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said, Behold, let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. And Abigail hasted". She is hastening again; this time it is to be united to David. "And Abigail hasted and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife". These five damsels, I think, would be to emphasise the feminine thought. She was marked by it. There is the masculine thought, but there is also the feminine thought. The expression of femininity in Abigail here would not be to stress administration, but suitability to Christ, in view of our service at the Lord's supper, implying our suitability for this service.
T.M. Did David fail on the line of administration, but get adjustment through Abigail? The assembly is responsible for right doctrine; as information is brought to the assembly, things can be adjusted publicly.
J.T. So that we can have assembly service. Service begins with the Lord's supper, that is to say, Christ and the assembly, and then going on to the Father, but that does not appear here.
Ques. Is the same feature seen in @Genesis 24, "Rebecca arose, and her maids, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man"?
{202}
J.T. Just so; it is the feminine side. The femininity of the whole position is in mind, and that it is suitable, and hence the importance of the sisters maintaining feminine qualities according to God, and yet maintaining the wisdom that belongs to them; that is, the wisdom that belongs to women (@Proverbs 14: 1). At the same time, there is what goes with wisdom, that is, affection; both are to be maintained.
Ques. Are you thinking, too, that the brothers partake of that feminine spirit?
J.T. Well, we do. The position in the assembly is to be characterised by the feminine spirit, the whole assembly. From one aspect it is feminine and it is to exhibit the feminine idea. Frequently the assembly is viewed impersonally; as for instance, "the assembly of God which is at Corinth", but when we come to the matter of union with Christ, it is the feminine idea, and all are to be merged in it. The members of the assembly merge into one, in the feminine idea, and the masculine is seen in Christ.
J.W. Is that why the apostle labours for the saints in the first epistle to Corinthians, in order that, as in the second epistle, he might present them as a chaste virgin to Christ?
J.T. Quite so. There is more spirituality in the second epistle than in the first; principles are more stressed in the first, but, when we come to the second epistle, we come to the personal thought more; and so he says, in chapter 11, bringing in Adam and Eve, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ".
J.M. Do we see feminine wisdom in Abigail in @1 Samuel 25: 36?
J.T. Yes, she knew how to be silent. We are told, let the women learn in silence (@1 Corinthians 14: 34, 35). That is another element.
{203}
A.M-r. Is the right attitude seen in Abigail which would work out in the washing of the assembly? "Behold, let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord".
J.T. That is beautiful. It says, "she ... bowed herself on her face to the earth", and then we have already noticed that Abigail hasted. That is the third time she hasted.
A.I. There is another thing to be taken note of; "she came down".
J.T. She and David came down together. They met on the same level.
A.M-r. Would washing the feet of "the servants of my lord" be like @John 13?
J.T. Quite so.
J.M. This was an opportunity for Abigail to have great thoughts of herself, as you were saying about John the baptist yesterday, but she had no ambitions.
J.T. I am sure the brethren would agree with that.
Ques. I would like to ask about what you were saying about the merging of the masculine and the feminine. Does what is feminine go into eternity in the assembly, while what is masculine is seen in Christ?
J.T. That is what I understand, Christ and the assembly. The assembly in another sense is seen in the aggregate of all believers having the Spirit, in the sense of persons. David speaks of Jonathan's personal affection as greater than that of women.
{204}
"THAT NO ONE TAKE THY CROWN"
@Revelation 1: 12 - 20; @Revelation 3: 7 - 13
I have read this section in @Revelation 3 because of verse 11, "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown". All that I have to say will centre around that verse, as bearing on this great moment; I mean the present moment, and all that enters into it, so as to impress us here at this time with the great responsibility resting upon us; that no one may regard themselves as irresponsible, but each one knowing what rests upon him, accepting it and doing what it involves. Luke begins his second treatise, as you will all remember, by mentioning what the Lord began both to do and to teach, doing first and then teaching. It is our hope that the teaching may proceed, the teaching that began, as John records, with the Lord Jesus who, as here in the flesh, is called Teacher in the early pages of that gospel. Mary Magdalene takes up the thought and furnishes a word that is peculiar, saying, "Rabboni"; He was her Teacher; not simply that He was a Teacher, but He was hers. In the case of Mary of Bethany, we have the anointing of the Lord's head; this is mentioned by more than one evangelist, and of her it is said that "she hath done what she could", @Mark 14: 8. That is a word, dear brethren, that I would seek to impress upon us all, "She hath done what she could". She anointed the Lord's head, which would mean that she recognised the divine intelligence that was there and available for her. Elsewhere she is seen sitting at the feet of Jesus and hearing what He said. That came in after the wonderful scene on the mount, called the mount of transfiguration, where the voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, hear him"; that word should impress us; "Hear him".
{205}
Following this the Lord said of Mary as she sat listening to His word, "Mary has chosen the good part, the which shall not be taken from her"; @Luke 10. Such expressions by the Lord would refer to His power, and what He will do, as we see it here in the passage I have read, when He speaks of Himself as the One "who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open". As with Mary, the good part could not be taken from her, so we can see, dear brethren, how the Lord would impress us with the impregnability of the protection He affords us, and the defence and support too that He affords us, so that we need not fear. Another word that is to be noted specially, occurring in the holy pages from the Old Testament and down to the Lord's last writings to the assembly, is "Fear not". The present situation politically, industrially, socially and financially is full of fear, but the Lord's word to us, I am assured, is "Fear not". I spoke of it before I crossed the Atlantic this time, I felt it was a word to the brethren in America, and I say it to you, dear brethren, now; the atmosphere all round us is charged with fear, nations fearing each other industrially, and otherwise; but the word to us is "Fear not". That word carries with it almighty power, almighty protection, whatever scientific men, so-called, may say, whatever dangers exist, and the hidden dangers, they are not intended to cause *us* to fear.
I have taken up these scriptures, as I said, with the thought before me of the word of the Lord to His assembly, saying to her, "Behold, I come quickly; hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown". That word comes like the blast of a trumpet in war, like the silver trumpets in the book of Numbers which were to be employed in the case of war. I intend to compass all the verses read in some sense and particularly
{206}
because of John. You may say, It should be because of the Lord, and of course it is; but the Lord is pleased to distinguish His own bondmen, and they are to be in mind, not always, but prominent at certain times. At times when love is in question John is in evidence; he is the disciple whom Jesus loved, which clearly would mean that he was a lover, he understood love, one of the most important things to understand. John quotes the Lord as saying, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35. This is what marks off Christianity from all other associations or societies; it has love in it, and John the evangelist, the writer of the gospel and the three epistles bearing his name, was the actual writer of this book.
The Lord is Himself the designer of the book and the author of it too, but He tells John how to write it. It is remarkable that John should be taken up in this peculiar way as a writer; in fact it is John who says, that if all the things which Jesus did were written, he supposed that "even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written". But he said, "These are written", that is to say, he calls attention to his own composition, and, of course, a servant whom the Lord employs in this sense ought not to be ashamed to call attention to his own words; if the Lord is not ashamed of them he need not be himself. So John says, "These are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life in his name". Many things are to be held in His name; salvation is in His name, life is in His name. The great question of life which the Lord Himself has brought up within the memory of some of us, the great question of eternal life, is still a burning question and will be till the end. So John says, "These are written that ye may believe
{207}
... and that believing ye might have life in his name"; a precious suggestion that you hold, that victory is in the name of the Lord Jesus, and is a matter of life.
It is in order that I should thus speak, because of what the Lord says to John here. It really is a conversation, as you might say, between the Lord and John, who in sitting down to carry out his holy task of writing this book, places certain verses at the outset; a foreword for us so as to introduce us into the great subject of the Apocalypse, a subject which came in late in the history of revelation. Things had begun to wane and flag; disloyalty had come in. It is recorded in @Mark 13 that He said that neither the angels nor Himself knew certain things; that is, the day and the hour of His coming; only the Father knew. This is one of the most interesting matters, and undoubtedly His words link on with this wonderful book called the Apocalypse which is said to have been given to Him by God. John, in writing this book, embellishes it at the outset, calling attention to the Deity and other matters in relation to God, and to the assembly too; so that we are introduced into the book with most blessed suggestions. In verse 4 we read, "John to the seven churches which are in Asia", and then he speaks of the blessing which is ours, saying that God has "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages, Amen. Behold he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him. Yea. Amen. I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty". These are assertions of Deity, of Him "who is, and who was, and who is to come".
{208}
We can see how nobly John served his Lord and Master in writing this book, and in doing what was needed in order to present it to be read. He adds a premium to the reading of it, which we ought to take notice of. It is hardly found anywhere else, but in this book. This book is to be read; not to be thought by anyone as too hard to be understood, but to be read and read and read again. It will be understood as we read it; as Habakkuk says of his prophecy "that he may run that readeth it" (chapter 2: 2). This book is written for that purpose, because these are most urgent times and they are short too. The Lord says in the verse 1 had particularly in mind that the crown might be snatched from us, so that we are to be continually on the alert, so that we may not be robbed of our greatest distinction. We are not told what the crown is, and that makes it all the more precious. We are to see to it that it is not snatched from us, stolen from us. We are to be always on the alert, to be doing; that is the principle.
So, as I said, John is taken up by the Lord, and he says, "I turned to see the voice", showing that he was an alert attendant to what was being done. Earlier he says that he heard a voice behind him, but here he turned to see the voice, a remarkable thing, and then he tells us what he did see. I mention things in this order for the sake especially of the young ones, because they are the coming generation; one generation passes away and another comes; that is going on constantly, yet the Lord at the very beginning of the dispensation said, "Surely I come quickly". We have to understand that. It was said to the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" we have to understand the statements of Scripture. So the Lord said, "Surely I come quickly". If He had said that 1800 years ago, He meant that certain things must happen. He is under
{209}
the Father's orders in a sense, but nevertheless personally equal with the Father; that is ever to be stressed, that divine Persons are equal. This eleventh verse is in mind, and it is intended to affect us as if it was said today. It is to cause us to be on the alert, to be doing things that should be done, doing them at once and doing them well.
As John undertakes his task, he says, "I turned to see the voice". There may have been many things on the horizon that might have diverted him, but he was not diverted; he turned to see the voice, and what he saw was similar to what Isaac saw when Rebecca was coming; instead of noting that Rebecca was coming, Isaac, we are told, saw the camels coming. So here, what John sees first are the candlesticks. Isaac saw what carried Rebecca, and John saw that in the midst of which the Lord Jesus Himself was; namely, in the midst of the golden candlesticks; in other words, in the midst of the assemblies; that is where He is. The Lord Jesus speaks about it as regards the service of God saying, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises". You may say, 'I can praise God anywhere'; but He says, "In the midst of the assembly". Let us understand that, and let us be ready to join in the song. "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", shows that in the Lord's mind, the assembly is essential. It was not essential to the creation primarily, nor even to the creation described in @Genesis 1; not even angels are seen in the work in @Genesis 1. God Himself said, "Let there be light, and there was light". God did it; in truth it was the Lord Jesus. I say with joy and glory, that the Lord Jesus is said to have created all things and "without him not one thing received being that has received being"; and so John does not record any assistance, as it were, in the creation. But when we come to the assembly, then persons are
{210}
brought into the divine economy in which the Father and the Son are operating, as the Lord says Himself, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work". Then presently the apostles were brought in, they too were workers, and we are all brought in, every one who has the Holy Spirit is brought in.
John was brought in in a peculiar way, as I said, so he says, "I turned to see the voice", and what he saw was seven golden lamps or candlesticks and "in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man". As there the Lord is now intent on an operation which is described throughout the book and He is taking the saints with Him, the assembly is with Him. There may be things He does alone, I quite admit that, but in general the position is that the saints have part in the divine operations, and that is what John saw, "seven golden lamps and in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet". How marvellous these verses are! and John says, "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not". I have already touched upon it, and I am sure the Lord would dispel from our hearts every kind of fear; instead of that the word is, "Fear God". "Fear not those who kill the body and after this have no more that they can do". Although the cities may be wiped out, as men speak, yet after that they have no more that they can do. "Yea, I say to you, fear him", that is, God.
Now John says, "When I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". In approaching this wonderful book in this way through the servant whom the Lord is pleased to signalise by causing him to write
{211}
it, our minds are disabused of fear: we are to rest in the knowledge of God. "Who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?" We are to train ourselves, and so face the situation as it is, full of anxieties to the natural man, but none for us, we are to be without fear. And so the Lord says to John here, "Fear not", and then He tells him why he should not fear, saying, "I am he that liveth and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death". Sometimes we hear men say they have visited the dead. They are just lying; for it is not true. The Lord Himself has the keys of hades, which is the place of the dead at the present time provisionally; and of death, which is the final place. Will He give the keys to these wicked men? These so-called scientific men think that they can find the dead, the wicked dead, and it may be, assume they can speak to them! These things are diabolical, they are just lies, and we are to disabuse our minds of such things so as to be without fear. The Lord lays His right hand on John and says to him, "I am he that liveth and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore". Then he says, "Write ..." He says to John, I am about to employ you, and I wish you to write according to My direction.
Now I pass on to chapter 3, just to show how this matter spoken of in verse 11 is reached, and I want to leave the brethren with this verse at the close of this remarkable time we have had. We are to hold fast what we have; "hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown". The Lord is, as I was saying, implying that we are not to be robbed; not indeed that we are to put things under lock and key, so to speak; that is not the idea. We are not told what the crown is that is alluded to. We were saying today that the saints themselves at times are called crowns, and there is no suggestion
{212}
of their being hidden or concealed; they are to remain in the activity of love, and that is why they are called crowns. Any one of us could be a crown to the Lord Jesus or even to the saints; Paul says to the Philippians, "My brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown". In addressing the assembly in Philadelphia the Lord Jesus calls Himself the holy and the true; the Lord Jesus is naming Himself thus. What thoughts to be in our hearts, holiness and truth! He says, 'I have the key of David', as much as to say, I am ready to attribute to you refinement spiritually, not worldly refinement, but refinement spiritually, that is what we get in Philadelphia. And so the Lord here refers to David, saying, "These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man shutteth; and shutteth and no man openeth". The whole book has to be read in order to get at the thought of the Spirit of God as to David, and to see what characterises him.
The very best suggestions as to refinement are found in the Lord Jesus, they are found in the saints too in principle, because of the Spirit of God being in us. So He says, "I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star". Our hearts should be thrilled with these thoughts, they are sobering and glorious, and they are also applicable to us, for we belong to the Lord Jesus, we belong to the assembly. So He says, "*I* Jesus ... testify these things to you in the assemblies". He is dealing with the greatest things, and that is what I wish to impress all with. He says to Philadelphia, "I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an opened door". He has done it already, and it is for us to enter in, for it is a door "which no one can shut". None can interfere with the Lord, He has almighty power. So He goes on to assure us that we are able to have to do with these matters,
{213}
and He says, "because thou hast a little power;" it is but a little of the real thing, but again, "and hast kept my word"; not My commandment, but My word; that which opens things up for us and illuminates us; "and hast not denied my name". Life is in that Name, but many other things; salvation and all the matters relative to the service of God are in it. So that while we repudiate all mere officialism and clericalism as not of God, we revere the name of Jesus.
In @Hebrews 8 Jesus is said to be "a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man", meaning that He has charge of all that. The Lord Jesus is Minister of the sanctuary; He is a priest according to @John 6. Peter says to Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God"; that is to say, He is the Priest of God, He is in charge of all the services and perfectly, infinitely capable, so He is the Minister. "We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens"; He has power and right to do it, to set Himself down as "a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man". And so here He would address the assembly at Philadelphia, which is the assembly viewed as marked by love, for Philadelphia means love, and it stands for the whole assembly in the Lord's mind, and He is saying to them in a confidential way, "Thou hast kept the word of my patience", and again, "Thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name". These are the things He attributes to us to encourage us, that we might not be afraid to go on. That is the principle governing all this and the Lord is with us to support us so that no one should take our crown. I am not telling you what
{214}
it is; I cannot, though I may have my impressions, but it is "thy crown". We are all of the assembly, let us hold to the thing, hold fast what we have. To further encourage us, He says, "Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee". The Lord is saying this to the assembly in regard to these wicked persons who are agents of the devil, who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie. He is urging us by all that, so that we may be sure that we do not lose our crown. We are to go on in the energy of faith according to what the Lord apportions us, and to work with our might, and thus we shall go straight into glory like a ship going into harbour in full sail. Then He says, "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth". We are not to come into the great tribulation, that which will come upon all the earth; we will not be in it, the Lord will save us out of it. All this is in keeping with the previous verses; so that we may be sure that our crown is not taken away; we are to hold fast what we have. "Behold, I come quickly; hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown".
I cannot say any more, but I just leave these matters, for I think they are most important. We are to go forward according to what we have. We are to add to it, of course; the Spirit of God is doing it, raising up men to do it, and let us hold fast what comes to us through them, and the Spirit of God will guide us into all truth, we can rely on that. He will take up this and that one, properly qualified, but *He* will guide us into all the truth.
May God bless the word to us all.
{215}
OVERCOMING
@1 John 5: 4, 5; @Revelation 12: 11
I have in mind to speak about overcoming. John, of course, tells us more about it than any other New Testament writer; he presents it as in Christ, and as in Christ it is magnified indeed. He said to His disciples, "*I* have overcome the world", and the thought is that He leads in all these matters. In the gospels the Spirit presents to us what goes beyond the present dispensation, for they present Christ Himself as here. What He was, indeed, cannot be confined to any dispensation, and so in reading the gospels, we have to bear in mind that much in them alludes to a coming dispensation, whereas the epistles are generally restricted to the present dispensation, and to what is current at the present time, in ways and thoughts and words suitable to Christianity; suitable to heaven, of course, but suitable to Christianity. This is true especially of the epistles of Paul, who employs terms and gives suggestions that no other apostle or scripture writer does. Thus in him the idea is set out of a special vessel, not only a special worker or apostle or evangelist; not only a *special* brother, he is that, of course, but a vessel; "an elect vessel", as the Lord said of him. In him we find the ways, the words, the thoughts and ideas of a Christian. The name *Christian* was an irregular one when first used. It has to be understood in connection with the work of Paul and Barnabas when they toiled for a whole year together, as you might say, in heaven's best employ. We have set out in them the idea of a Christian, and that idea runs down to our day, no doubt greatly magnified and ornamented in human thought, as the Spirit of God has used and portrayed it so much; thus it should be understood as designating a heavenly product, that can be called
{216}
*Christian*. Peter employs it, although writing to Jewish exiles, and he says to them, "if any man suffer as a Christian", not as a Jew, but as a Christian, and it meant suffering to be a Christian. When Agrippa said to Paul, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian", Paul's reply was that he himself was that, but he wished that all that were there including Agrippa were that, were Christians; that they should be as Paul, "except these bonds". He did not wish anyone to have them, and clearly the idea of overcoming was there in Paul.
I have read from John's epistle to bring out this thought of overcoming in relation to Christianity. Christianity is not comparable at all with any human sect or system on the earth. It is a heavenly product and the Spirit of God glorifies it in those who are Christians and who as such are overcomers. Hence John in the verses read, says, "Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?" These verses speak of overcoming, and also give the way of it, the facts that lead to it. The thought that all that has been begotten of God overcometh the world, alludes to the generative power of God; not simply that one is born anew, or born again, for that is not quite so advanced in the work of God; new birth is basic, and without it nobody can be a Christian, nor an overcomer, but more is needed and that is included in the term, "born of God". There are many who regard the thought of "born again" as if it meant "born of God", but it is not that, it is not quite so far on as that. Persons in the millennium will be "born again". Indeed, without new birth we can have no part or lot properly in divine matters, but John in his epistle is dealing with more than that.
{217}
He is the evangelist who especially deals with new birth, but here he is speaking of "born of God". Peter also speaks of it, but John alludes much to it, and therefore those who would seek help and guidance as to the fulness of the truth should refer to John. Many are content with what is short of the fulness of the truth. John, in speaking of the Lord, tells us of His fulness, that is, of Christ's fulness, and no-one should be content with less. So here John says, "whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world". The idea is what is new as to birth, but what is implied is *persons*, not merely material. In the gospel (chapter 3), the Lord says that no-one can see the kingdom of God unless he be "born anew", but we have more than that here, and the better translation says, "For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world". Much has to be said by way of expansion, for John is abstract, as has often been remarked, which means that he is saying some things and leaving out other things which could be said. *Whatsoever* here implies much that could be said, but the abstract idea is very brief, as intended, so that many may be included; indeed all that are born of God are included. It is a very wide and comprehensive thought and a very blessed thought, for Christians are outside of the things in the world and superior to it.
Now the next statement is that "this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith". I am speaking of what John makes much of, for he speaks much as to overcoming, particularly in the book of Revelation, of which I shall speak in a moment. The word is used there many times, firstly in every epistle to the seven assemblies. They had seven letters written to them, and in each letter there was a special word to the overcomer and much promised by way of reward. The Lord speaks of Himself in the seventh letter, saying, "I also have
{218}
overcome and have sat down with my Father in its throne". The Lord is tonight on His Father's throne as an Overcomer, and He is saying that this is open to us. The honour of sitting down with Him, not on His Father's throne, but on His own throne, and that throne is future. He is not sitting on it yet, but He will sit on it, and we shall join Him on it, and hence the greatness of the suggestion. The word in John's epistle is, that "this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith", and then he says, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"; so that the passage goes on to a very concrete matter. It is addressed to all persons who believe that Jesus is the Son of God. But the idea of faith is the first thing. It seems to be set down for us as the first great thought in overcoming. I say the first great thought, because it is so here, and believers are to understand that, in overcoming, there is this idea of being "*born of God*" -- not simply "born again", but "born of God". Then so as to amplify that and clarify it, we have, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"; that is a great presentation of the truth.
Although "our faith" is mentioned before, I refer to it, so that the brethren will all be revived in their interest in what belongs to us; it is *our* faith. It is not what is called a creed or religion of which there are many, but it is faith, not faith in the sense of what a person may have, but faith in the sense of the truth held in faith, and that, of course, applies to Christianity. It singles out Christianity in the way in which I have spoken about it, that there is nothing comparable with it at all as a system. I say system, for it is a system; and the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are operating in it systematically; the saints are taking part in it too. God
{219}
has worked on the principle of system from the outset, from the creation, and so in Christianity, and in Judaism too, as He will in the millennium, and among the nations. All will be on the principle of system originating with God. Faith belongs to Christianity, not simply to Christians, but to Christianity, and it is characterised by faith, "our faith", and it has overcome the world. You may say that there is little evidence of it, but the little that there may be is included, and even though it were only one person the thing would be established, but there are many more. Not that I am assuming to know all the brethren here, but thank God they are here, and I am here with them, as among them. It is another matter to assume to know them, although we shall know each other in heaven, dear brethren; that is the thing to look forward to. "I shall know according as I also have been known"; that is a very precious thought.
Now I go back to what I was saying about faith. It is a thing that applies to Christians, and makes Christianity what it is. It refers to the faith period as coming into the world. It did not come into the world properly until Christ came into manhood, and coming here He was "the leader and completer of faith" (@Hebrews 12: 2); not indeed that it was not there before. It was here, hence we get it depicted down the line from Abel, but at the same time the Spirit of God says, "Jesus, the leader and completer of faith"; so that we have to look to Him, and learn from Him. He says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls", @Matthew 11: 29. So faith is to be learned from Christ. It is a universal thought in Christianity, and this is the dispensation of faith, as Paul in writing to the Galatians says, "faith having come"; that is, when Christ became Man and inaugurated the great idea
{220}
of faith; it is now an established matter, the Spirit of God maintaining it here on earth. If there were no faith, there would be no Christianity.
When the next dispensation comes, it will be a sight dispensation, and everything will be seen then, but now everything that is of God is to be understood by faith. That which is seen is not faith, but that which is not seen is eternal, and so faith links us on with what is eternal. Although we shall not need faith in heaven, yet it links us on with eternity, because it is the element of faith that makes everything real, but what will be by sight in the future is now by faith. We are designated a heavenly people as discerning things by faith, and hence the word is, "this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith". *Our* faith, not what a person might have himself, of which we are told in @1 Corinthians 13, "faith, so as to remove mountains". There is not time to explain that, but that is to be understood, that one might remove mountains by faith, yet, if one has not love, he is nothing. He could not be less than nothing. He is nothing at all spiritually, even although he have faith to remove mountains. I say that as calling attention to what Paul says, and that we might not be aiming at doing great things or exploits, but rather being governed by faith *and by love*. Faith working by love is the practical idea of Christianity. But the faith mentioned in this verse, "our faith", is not simply that some of us are believers, but that there is such a thing as *the* faith, which is Christianity, known as a system of truth, but known by the Spirit and understood by the Spirit; it is a system of truth, because the truth is to be held as a whole. The Lord Jesus is said to be the truth; the Spirit is the truth, too, but objectively the idea is applicable to Christ. He speaks of Himself thus in connection with other things, saying, "I am the way, and the truth, and
{221}
the life". These three things are applicable to Christ, who is the truth. Thus the faith is the complete thing, the whole, not simply that I have part in it, for, of course, we know in part, but the Lord tells us that the Spirit will guide us into all truth.
The dear brethren would do well to take it to heart, not to settle down even in any known or well established doctrine, but to see that we hold things in a vital way, as maintained by the Holy Spirit, for the Spirit is the truth subjectively, even as Christ is it objectively. What I would seek now to make clear is that this passage, in @1 John 5: 4, this "victory that overcometh the world, even our faith"; that is, the faith which we enjoy, which we come together constantly to look into, to speak of as the truth, is superior to anything in the world. The world is in mind here, and the victory is while we are here in the presence of it, and it is superior in the sense of power, the power of God, power in Christ, and in the saints. That we have the mind of Christ is a wonderful fact, and assures the intelligence, the power of thought that enters into this victory. What I am saying can only be seen when the faith is held as a whole, and held in a spiritual way, as a complete system of truth. Paul says that it was given to him to complete the word of God. I do not say that what Paul says is all, because the Old Testament is also involved as well as the gospels and other writings of the New Testament, in the truth, and matters of the faith include all these. These are things in which one would seek to be practical, not to be speaking over the heads of the brethren, but that all might follow, that our consciences and hearts might be affected by these things; that we might understand the greatness of the system with which we are connected, not only the system as formed of persons, but the system as formed by truth, and that truth is eternal. Christ
{222}
is it, but the Spirit makes it real to us; we are living in it, it is a complete thing, and it is greater than the world. That is what I want to urge on the brethren. It is greater than the world, greater than all that is seen, greater than all that men assert as to science. Our faith is greater than all that. All else will disappear, whereas the truth will stand, and now it is held on the principle of faith. It will be held presently in the millennium on the principle of sight, the Spirit will be there too, but not on the same level as in the assembly. Those on earth will be on the lower level, but Israel, of course, will be on the highest level in that system; this is seen in the 144,000 with the Lamb on mount Zion; they have the power in themselves to learn the new song which the harp-singers sing before the throne (@Revelation 14).
Well, that is what I understand by the verse in John's epistle, "the victory that overcometh the world"; but then the next verse is the concrete expression of it in persons, in any one of us. The question asked by the apostle, by the Spirit of God, is "Who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?" I want to ask that question of myself, and I want all the brethren here to ask it of themselves, to see whether we really believe that "Jesus is the Son of God". No doubt most of us would subscribe to it, because Scripture is so plain about it, but we want to have it in our souls on the principle of faith. "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?" That is what marked Paul almost at the outset of his career as a Christian he preached that Jesus was the Son of God, and he tells us that God revealed His Son in him. He revealed His Son *to* Peter, but to Paul it was to the end that he might "announce him as glad tidings among the nations", so that our souls
{223}
might be nourished and brought up in the gospel that Paul preached. That is all I have to say about these verses, and I pray that it will be simple and intelligible to all of us.
I proceed to the book of Revelation to show how these elements are used to overcome, not the world only, but the devil himself. One of the most remarkable things in chapter 12 is that the woman "brought forth a male son, who shall shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne". He is called a *male son*, which, of course, may be regarded as a redundant term, but the Spirit of God by it emphasises the idea of Christ's manhood as important and foundational as to His Person. So the chapter runs on to the overthrow of the devil, as it is said, "There was war in the heaven; Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon. And the dragon fought, and his angels; and he prevailed not, nor was their place found any more in the heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, he who is called Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole habitable world, he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a great voice in the heaven saying, Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren has been cast out, who accused them before our God day and night: and *they* have overcome him by reason of the blood of the Lamb, and by reason of the word of their testimony, and have not loved their life even unto death".
These are wonderful verses, and I am not reading them because of their prophetic use, but rather to make clear to everyone how the blood of the Lamb, the blood of Christ, is used in our everyday life, our business life, and household life, in travelling, and so on. The blood of Christ is victorious
{224}
as it is presented here; "*they* have overcome him by reason of the blood of the Lamb, and by reason of the word of their testimony". It is the efficacy of it in redemption, so as to maintain our consciences clear before God and men and shelter them in the presence of the accuser. Our consciences are apt to fail us, save as we are kept in the full light and shining of the gospel. Paul says, "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", @2 Corinthians 4: 6. It is in that light we are victorious, because we use and understand the blood of the Lamb, the redemptive power of it is a real and known thing, and Satan cannot overthrow it; even if we fail that does not overthrow it. The point is, that failure should not overthrow our faith. God has set us up in Christianity and in the Spirit and I may add, in the assembly. God has set us up in Christ in that wonderful system, with light as to all that Satan can employ to discredit us, to cause us to fear as to our eternal salvation. The devil is bent on that sort of thing. The blood of the Lamb, and its efficacy understood will shelter us from the attacks of the devil. John says they overcame "because of the blood of the Lamb".
Then it says further, "and by reason of the word of their testimony". That is to say, the efficacy of Christ's blood has sheltered my conscience in the face of the devil's attacks, and has caused me to be restful in the presence of God, because I am connected with the righteousness of God in Christ; faith will tell me that, and I have overcome the devil by that light, by that truth that I carry about with me, not what I believe only, but what I have in my soul, in my conscience. I am invulnerable to his attacks. Peter says, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you". That is remarkable, and we have
{225}
to do it with the truth as it is presented to us according to the efficacy of the blood of the Lamb. I not only say that I am a Christian, but I have a word of testimony. That also is an answer to defeat the devil; what I can say in the way of testimony, as it says here, "by reason of the word of their testimony". One might add much to that because it is so great, the testimony of the truth by the power of the Spirit, rendered in the gospel, and so forth, going on all the time. I thank God for all that has been done in this way, in the meeting-rooms, hidden away from the public, and yet the Spirit of God actually having to do with the preaching there, and souls being converted and brought to God. This is going on day and night in the different parts of tile earth where real Christianity is, and where the gospel is presented. Paul said, "Woe is me if I preach not the gospel". Of course, Paul was a gifted man, but one often challenges one's own heart, and one hopes the brethren are challenging their hearts now as to what preaching is carried on, how much the light of the gospel is being proclaimed even in the little meeting-rooms and in the small companies. So it says here they overcame by "the word of their testimony". It describes what is presented now in hundreds of rooms all over the world continually, and that accompanies the idea of the efficacy of the blood of the Lamb, as it is proclaimed in the gospel.
A great deal more could be said as to the book of Revelation, especially as to the letters to the different assemblies; in each one of them we have the idea of overcoming and a reward is promised to every overcomer. I trust that the brethren will look into this book, and see how full it is, and how it is intended to help us in this terrible time in which we are living, for we are living in a terrible time politically and that is not all, for worse things are to come. The book of Revelation is full of the
{226}
things that are to come, and it is not a sealed book. It is a book written at the direction of the Lord Himself by John the apostle. It is written in sections under three heads, and if we look into these carefully we will understand. One is speaking much about the book of Revelation, so that we might see how the overcomer is referred to there specifically. It is as if the Lord has in mind, that all that enters into Christianity is available to the saints in each assembly. The furnishings are all there, and the Lord is telling us that He knows they are all there. We also know they are all there, and almost every real Christian knows that they are all there; that the provisions are there, that the power for overcoming alluded to is there, not only the blood of the Lamb, but other things are recorded so that each one in the assemblies should have the idea of overcoming and should overcome. And then the Lord alludes to rewards. "As I also have overcome, and have sat down with my Father in his throne". We are to sit down with Him in His throne, the Lord's own throne, that is our outlook; the Lord would encourage us by it, and help us to be overcomers in view of it.
I commit the matter to the brethren, to our souls and consciences, for overcoming in view of sitting down with the Lord Jesus in His own throne, when He shall rule, for God "hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained".
May God bless the word.

JOHN THE BAPTIST AS MODEL
@John 1: 19 - 27; @John 3: 22 - 36
I have read these scriptures from John's gospel in the light of the fact that he is said to be the disciple whom Jesus loved, and also in the light of the further fact that John the baptist is a special one in the mind of John the evangelist. I am sure that John the evangelist, whom Jesus loved, in his turn regarded John the baptist particularly as one to be respected, one upon whom he could bestow peculiar distinction.
We learn from these facts that in the divine circle there are favourites, and so John the baptist affords John the evangelist the opportunity to speak of one, as I might say, of these favourites. The Lord Himself bestows peculiar honour on John the baptist, and I speak of him now in this way in view of what is current in the world, and how important it is to have the truth set out, not simply in words, but exemplified in Christians. The Lord, as I said, bestows much honour on John the baptist, saying that there was not one born of women greater than he, and saying further that, if they would receive it, he was Elias. So there is the idea in Scripture of personification of one saint by another. John the baptist is seen as representing Elias, and I am calling him now to the front especially in view of current conditions, and the need of meeting them; and if they have to be met, they can only be met properly by those who have the Holy Spirit. It is not simply a question of brethren talking or conversing at tea-tables, or the like, or even of what they may think, or what has been said, but what we say! If we undertake to say anything, it should be in an orderly and responsible fashion. And so the Lord makes inquiry as to what men said about Him, the Son of man; not what they thought, but what they
{228}
said. After asking what men said, He makes inquiry from the apostles, His disciples, as to what they said on the point, Who is the Son of man? And one was able to speak immediately, and with authority, and with feeling, and with effectiveness, and thus we have on record the great facts of the foundation of the assembly, against which the gates of hades shall not prevail. These are great and wonderful facts.
Now we have before us John the baptist, this remarkable vessel who is introduced almost immediately by John the evangelist, the gospel-writer. He says, "There was a man sent from God, his name John". Much had entered into that name. His parents¬ friends and neighbours would have had him named Zacharias, but his father, who had been disciplined for nine months by being caused to be dumb, made his first pronouncement as he asked for a writing tablet, saying "John is his name". Whatever the meaning of the name John it was prophetically announced that it was the name of this man. John the evangelist speaking about John, says, "There was a man sent from God, his name John". Words are not wasted in the Scriptures; they are just sufficient, suggesting that we have what is needed. The Spirit of God employs words according to what is needed, and so here it is stated that John was "a man sent from God". That is a very great fact, and I do not hesitate at all to say that there are such men today, men who are sent from God. I do not point to anyone, for there are many. I speak of a great fact, that there are men "sent from God;" not angels, but men. Although angels have power of speech and are employed by God on the most important errands, yet John the evangelist says, "There was a man sent from God, his name John". In the book of Acts, which has a great place in the divine records, we read that
{229}
"the crowd of names who were together was about a hundred and twenty". Those names were real, and each had a meaning, and on that account the names are mentioned. They had *names* and there was a *crowd* of them, as if they were all great enough to be distinguished as saints by themselves as they will be in heaven. I have no doubt that each inhabitant of that celestial scene will be designated by his appearance, by what he is, not simply by the name acquired, but by what the person is.
In @Acts 1 all were there because of what they were, and that idea was seen in Peter. It was he that answered the Lord, by saying, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God", and the Lord designated him by saying, "*Thou* art Peter". "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. And *I* also, I say unto thee that *thou* art Peter". The Father had spoken, and now another divine Person is speaking to Peter. "*I* also, I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and on this rock" (that is, on the Lord Jesus, for the rock refers to Him) "I will build my assembly". The Son of the living God is the One designated as the foundation of the assembly. And so it is in that connection that Peter's name came out, and the Lord said, "*Thou* art Peter", meaning that he was that; 'a stone'. In @John 1 the Lord said, "Thou shalt be called Cephas". But in Matthew the word is, "*Thou* art Peter". That is very current among us, and perhaps well known, but it is well to have it before us as to names.
Having said all that, I come back to those scriptures that were written in regard of John the baptist. He was a most distinguished man, as I have said, and particularly because of the distinction the Lord Himself put upon him. How humble John was! He was equal to the moment, and it was a great
{230}
moment, a wonderful moment. The Messiah had just come. The Son of God had appeared, and John the baptist was there, and was able to give an account of the Son of God, saying, "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God". That is a great matter, dear brethren, to have in our souls and to be able to say, "this is the Son of God". That is, the One amongst us, it is not said *that*, but *this* is the Son of God. As believers, He is ever with us. "Lo, I am with you alway", is His word to us. So that we may say, 'He is constantly with us'. Someone may say, Well, He went to heaven, but Matthew does not say that. Mark, Luke and John say that, but Matthew does not. Matthew would assure us comfortingly that the Lord is with us today. He is with us at this very moment. "This is the Son of God".
There is another noted man in this gospel (chapter 9). The Lord met him after He had opened his eyes, and said to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?". That is a question one would ask every Christian here, every person present, tonight, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" That is the great testimony of John the evangelist, and the testimony of John the baptist too, and so I put that question, and I leave it with you, with each one of us to answer. "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?". I have said *on* the Son of God; but if I say *in* the Son of God, that would raise the question of finding out who He is and what great possibilities there are; but believing on Him means that He is the great Object of faith. We are living in the faith period, and so the thing is to have faith, to be in faith, the faith of the Son of God, believing on Him. This is the urgent burning question of the moment, for the truth is denied all around, and if not denied then it is not confessed! There is very little difference between people denying and not confessing.
{231}
It is not so bad, of course, to refrain from confessing as it is to deny, but still the difference is not very great. If we do not confess the Lord we are in a critical position! The Lord says, "Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, I also will confess him before my Father who is in the heavens", @Matthew 10: 32. We are to be victors, confessors; that is the idea. The man in @John 9 was a confessor; he was a confessor of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God. The Lord says, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" and the man says, "Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?". He was ready. The Lord answered, "Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him". Notice that, he worshipped Him!
As I said, as regards names, John the baptist's name is full of renown, and John the evangelist makes much of him. No other evangelist makes so much as John, of John the baptist, and he does it in order to bring out thoughts as to the Son of God. The current conditions abroad permit of things being said that evidence that the truth has been given up. In the world generally, great reverses have taken place as to the profession of Christianity; great nations have fallen, and great cities have fallen, great societies, too, have fallen, and what is going to replace these? How much there is being said in the world that is antichristian, and we are here today as Christians, as believers on the Son of God, and our business is to seek to counter those things; to counter them with the truth. That is the point we should have in mind; and not simply the truth as it is put in the creeds, but the truth as we are taught it by the Spirit of truth. The Lord Jesus is referred to at the beginning of this gospel as *Teacher* and He is alluded to as *Teacher* at the end of it, and in this connection it
{232}
is on my mind now to say a word as to current conditions, and how they are to be countered by those who love the Lord, by those who have the Holy Spirit, and really they are the only ones worth reckoning on in this matter. I would not despise anyone professing Christianity, but in the matter I am dealing with now, the only ones worth mentioning are those who have the Holy Spirit of God, those who love the Lord Jesus, and I might add, who love the truth, as John again says, to the elect lady, "I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth", @2 John 4. It is a question of the walking in things as well as the saying of them.
In the passage read in chapter I of John's gospel we learn that the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask John. "Thou, who art thou?". The Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him. You will see that this gives weight to my point. Those Jews, whoever they were, in Jerusalem, sent to John the baptist; *they* sent to John. I am stopping now to explain that what I had primarily in mind in reading these verses is the statement of John in chapter 3. We are told there in verse 26, "And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan to whom thou barest witness, behold he baptises, and all come to him. John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven". That is the word I had in mind particularly, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven". If I refer to current conversations, talks, speeches, magazines and newspaper articles, all of them, I might say, and all that is expressed in them, can be received naturally; whether one be a politician, industrialist, an educationalist, or a medical man, what is current in the world in the way of teaching and of prime importance is to be received and compassed by the ordinary
{233}
man's mind. In saying this I am endeavouring to call attention by contrast to what should be in the minds of Christians, what is to be in our minds, not to say our affections, but our minds. God has given us minds, He has given us the Holy Spirit! A greater fact! Now the word of John the baptist is, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven"; that is, a man can receive *nothing* except from God! That puts the whole matter where it should be. Heaven has precedence over the earth. Indeed, John says, "He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth, and speaks as of the earth. He who comes out of heaven is above all". Heaven has its own rank and importance in this sense.
In chapter 1 the Jews sent to John, to ask, "Who art thou?". What were they sent for? What was in their minds? The whole matter raises the question with us, and what would *we* do? What would any one of us answer if put in such a position? What would the worldling do, if he had such opportunity? What would we do if we were just simply ordinary men, with natural ability, ability such as could make us shine in this world, what would we do? If governed by earth, we would say to ourselves, What an opportunity! The leading men of the day have sent messengers to ask me, "Who art thou?". Well, I must let them know about my ancestors and my education, and my means. I must bring forth everything that is to my credit humanly, and put it in the answer, hoping that this will bring me some distinction. You see, dear brethren, in speaking thus, I desire to show how we are tested in this way every day, and we are tested as Christians, and the test brings out whether we are governed by heaven or earth. If we are governed by heaven, we answer even as John did in chapter 3, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven". Now, where are we as to those matters? If all
{234}
earthly distinctions are ruled out, where am I? I shall have to explore heaven, because "A man can receive nothing except it be given him out of heaven", and so heaven is the place of origin of each matter that is of value to ourselves as Christians. Heaven has its distinctions to give, its honours to proffer. I hope that the dear brethren will be moved inwardly as to this matter of what heaven has to offer! John is nobly victorious in this test, and that is why I have touched on it so freely.
From the beginning, John acted nobly, as it says, "And he confessed and denied not". He was the first to confess it to another. As walking in truth one has joy in another's confession. Not denying is additional, as confirming that he is the victor from the start. He is confessing the truth as to himself, and not denying it in any way. So it says of him, "he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ". Distinction is one of the things the natural man would grasp at. How many have grasped at being something in this world religiously, but John confessed, "I am not", and denied not! He gave no opportunity to anyone who sought to draw him into the thought of honouring himself, or making himself something, in this world religiously. When I say religiously I include the dear brethren that are now here along with myself, because we are apt to aspire to be something; but John confessed and denied not. He gives no occasion for anyone to say that he aspired to anything. And so the narrative goes on, "Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness". One is reminded of Balaam, when the king of Moab sent messengers to him, with the proposal to glorify him, to add to him
{235}
in every way. The prophet seemed proof against it for the moment, but really at the bottom of his heart he was hoping that he would obtain what the king of Moab offered. Not so John, "he confessed and denied not". And so, dear brethren, if we have any aspirations to acquire distinction in a human way among the brethren to whom I am speaking, John's answers are a model for us. If we aspire to anything in the way of distinction according to man, John's way of escape is simple. His answers are remarkable. These priests and Levites continue, and they say, "What sayest thou of thyself?". They did not enquire about his forefathers; not a word about them; nor about his father, nor about his mother, and he is not going to say a word about any of them, whoever they may be. We are all easily led into making much of these things, ancestry, education, or anything that makes much of us. That is the intention of the devil, and we are to be proof against it. John was proof against it.
So it says, dear brethren, that the inquiry made of John is, "Who art thou, that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?". He answered, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of the Lord, as said Esaias the prophet". They that were sent were from among the Pharisees, and they asked him further, assuming, we may suppose, that they were a distinguished people, as belonging to a distinguished sect. They asked him, "Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet? John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". Now, dear brethren, I am just leaving John the baptist at this point for your consideration. How nobly he met the temptations of the enemy in the attempt to
{236}
make much of him, and again I say, we are all exposed to this temptation, even amongst those with whom we are walking, exposed to the desire to be distinguished in the service of God, but John is a noble testimony to us against it. He is not led away, but is superior to the temptations of the devil.
Now I go on to the third chapter of John, so as to bring out how John is again tested, not now by the Pharisees, but by his own disciples. "There was, therefore, a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification. And they came to John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold he baptises, and all come to him. John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven". John did not say this in the first chapter. He is saying it now, when his own people, those who were interested in him are around him, and they are saying to him that the Lord Jesus to whom he testified is now baptising even as he. Although we are told in the next chapter that the Lord did not Himself baptise, but that His disciples did the service, here it is said that *He* is baptising. They are saying this to John, but he is proof against any suggestion of rivalry.
I have spoken of ambition in relation to oneself, but now I speak of rivalry, even amongst our brethren. The things said to John were intended to promote rivalry between him and the Lord Jesus, that is, in the heart of John. How proof against all that is John the baptist, and so he says, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven". John has heavenly thoughts, and he goes on to say, "Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am no, the Christ, but, that I am sent before him". I want you to notice, dear brethren, what John was occupied with in the midst of this atmosphere of rivalry. He says, "He that has the
{237}
bride is the bridegroom". There is only One who has the bride. We do not want to rival Him, nor do we want to rival each other, but John brings in this rich and holy thought of the Lord's possession of the bride; the richness of what belonged to Him; that is "the bride". The Lord is drawing our attention peculiarly to the idea of the assembly as the bride; and John brings this in in what he says. In bringing this in at this particular juncture, John the baptist shows that he is outside the range of rivalry. His language plainly tells us that, as he says, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom". I would rather be joyous thus than in possession of the greatest gift, for gift in itself will not make me joyous. The Lord makes us joyous. The Holy Spirit sheds the love of God abroad in our hearts to make us joyous; the greatest gift will not do that.
I speak with warning now, not that I am aiming at anyone, and would bring before you John as an outstanding example of one superior to temptation, and specially the temptation arising from rivalry. John is enjoying the voice of Christ, and is completely delivered from rivalry if there was any need for it in him. He says, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom". John the baptist does not tell us who the bride is. Paul does. John the baptist speaks of the voice of Christ the Bridegroom. What a theme, dear brethren! What deliverance from rivalry and pride and every other thing that goes with the natural man! What a deliverance! The joy of Christ's voice brings deliverance. John the baptist goes on to say, "but the friend of the bridegroom ..." That is a great matter. We do not speak of ourselves as friends of the Bridegroom, but as friends of Christ. The Lord Himself tells us,
{238}
"Ye are my friends". We are His friends; that is a delivering element in these matters.
But then I am speaking of what John says: "the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices in heart". John has enough power inwardly to stand as he does. We already know from the first chapter how firmly John stood, and now these are his own words, "the friend of the bridegroom who *stands* and hears him, rejoices in heart, because of the voice of the bridegroom; this my joy then is fulfilled". What can anyone do to decoy John into rivalry, to draw him into it. He is too satisfied. He is settled. His mind is fixed. His joy is full. I am speaking freely of this great subject, because John is not here, and John the evangelist is not here, but their testimony remains. We are here today, and I am speaking in order that we may be moved in regard to this matter, in regard to the Bridegroom and the bride. The Bridegroom's voice, the voice of Jesus, what it should be to us, how it should cause us joy, satisfying joy, for that is really the effect here, the satisfying joy of which John speaks. He says, "This my joy therefore is fulfilled".
Well, I might say much more, but I felt I must not fail in this line of thought that came before me, and I must not fail in presenting to the brethren the example which the Spirit of God has left us as John the evangelist presents it; not as Matthew, or Mark, or Luke present the Baptist, but as John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, speaks of Him. How beautifully he speaks of John and presents him to us as a model of satisfaction, satisfied desire. He is the friend of the Bridegroom, and his work is not done; he is not yet cast into prison; John the evangelist does not speak of John the baptist after he is cast into prison. When he was in prison, he sent words of a very different tone to the Lord Himself, asking Him, "Art *thou* the coming one?
{239}
or are we to wait for another?" @Matthew 11: 3. How different are these words from those we have been considering.
Now, dear brethren, let us be encouraged and embrace this matter; John being a model for us, lest we might be discouraged. I have spoken of rivalry, and pride, and ambition, but now I say a word about discouragement. John the baptist was discouraged in the prison, when he sent to the Lord. I hope none of us is discouraged; though there is much to discourage, there is also yet a satisfying portion in the voice of Christ to the bride! He is the Bridegroom, and His voice is to be heard, and it causes joy, it causes satisfied joy. John the baptist is presented in great detail by John the evangelist, as if the Lord would say to us, I am going to choose John, the one whom I love, to tell My brethren, to tell the assembly, about John the baptist. As viewing the matter thus, I am speaking of this in order that we may have him before us as a model, that we may have satisfied desire in hearing the voice of the Bridegroom. The Lord has brought the assembly to the attention of the saints in a peculiar way recently, and it involves the assembly in her relation as the bride of Christ. John does not say who the bride is; Paul does. Paul says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11: 2. There is no question there who the Bridegroom is, or the bride, because they are brought together. The voice of the Bridegroom is heard and it causes joy, and, as with John the Baptist, satisfied desire. May the Lord use the word to this end.
{240}
THE DISPENSATION OF GOD WHICH IS IN FAITH
@1 Timothy 1: 4; @Acts 4: 23 - 37
The verse in 1 Timothy furnishes the subject of our theme this evening. It presents to us "God's dispensation", which is the proper rendering of the words given in the Authorised Version as "godly edifying". It is the dispensation, or it may be called, the administration of God, which is in faith. (See the note in the Darby Translation for @Colossians 1: 25). So the subject opened up to us, in the few words, is really the greatest of all the dispensations. We may speak of the other dispensations, such as the ante-diluvian period, then the post-diluvian down to Abraham, then down to Moses, then the Judges, then David and Solomon, then the prophets. These are periods marked out plainly in the Scriptures, and we are told in the New Testament that they all converge on ourselves, "upon whom the ends of the ages are come", @1 Corinthians 10: 11. Our position therefore is extremely solemn, yet glorious, for as the end comes it will be manifestly glorious. There will be gloom, for the Lord Jesus tells the assembly in Philadelphia that He will keep the assembly "out of the hour of trial which is about to come upon the whole habitable world to try them that dwell upon the earth". We may say these words briefly, but they involve what is most sorrowful, and terrible as the time arrives, and they are intended to affect us.
The Lord intended to affect Philadelphia, which represents a period of love for the assembly towards the end of this dispensation. He intended that she should be feelingly affected, although assured of His word and its fulfilment, "I also will keep *thee* out of the hour of trial". Intelligence in the saints would lead us to say that He is speaking of the
{241}
assembly, and that He will keep her out of the great tribulation. We may reckon on these words, and that the Lord intends to keep us out of it, by taking us out of it, although the idea of keeping has to be borne in mind. There is undoubtedly a process in the keeping until it is complete, for the Lord does things in that way. Certain things have been in progress in an evil sense for almost the whole period of the dispensation; that is to say, the mystery of iniquity, a terrible thing. It is a mystery. Those who have fostered it, and built it up, and now make much of themselves as in it, are not aware of the evil they are dealing with and building up, but God is aware of it, and those who have light from God, as we ought all to have, are aware too. We find in the Apocalypse, which is the part of Scripture that instructs us most as to this, that God will judge our judgment upon the system that embodies this mystery. So we have some light in this sense, and have become aware of what is incumbent upon us; that is, to keep ourselves, for it is God that worketh in us for the willing and doing of His good pleasure.
So I now proceed to speak of the dispensation of God which is in faith, not in history, although I have alluded to things that are historical, for we are entitled to pay attention to history in these matters, so that we know the facts, but the dispensation of God is in *faith*, it is not simple history; in no way can it be explained by history. Faith can never be explained by history. "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report". So that we are dealing with faith. Politics, society, industry, and all else that makes up the world are seen; they can be known, searched out, spoken of, written about, by man in his natural mind. God, of course, has given him that mind, and he is entitled to use it and give thanks for it, but at the same time, the
{242}
natural man does not understand the things of God, for they are spiritually discerned. Therefore those who are possessed of faith are morally outside of the world as it is, whilst having to do with it under God. The natural mind is God-given, we give thanks for it; indeed we need it now in the service we render, but at the same time, "we have the mind of Christ". The we is very touching, it means Christians. If there are those here who do not embrace the great opportunity of belonging to that we, then the intent of this word is to encourage you to do so, to come into the realm of faith, which in time will lead you into the realm of *love*, which is what is in mind to call attention to.
This dispensation, this administration, in the divine phraseology is bound up with the idea of *twelve*, which numeral is largely found in relation to Jacob's family, and that is in mind, too, in the book of the Revelation. My hope is that a few remarks on administration may help us to see how the idea is introductory to the millennium. It is carried forward in the dispensation of faith, for it is by faith that we understand, "by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God". In referring to administration, for the word in 1 Timothy bears that interpretation as well as dispensation, one is minded to call attention to @Revelation 21. It is the chapter that has most references that I know of to the idea of twelve. Certain numbers have a great place in the Scriptures, particularly the number twelve, which is almost entirely bound up with Jacob's family. Whatever men may think of Israel today, of the Jews, that which denotes love is bound up with them, in the import of this number.
This number twelve comes into the assembly too, for as the apostle Paul says, in writing to the Corinthians, "all things are yours and ye are Christ's
{243}
and Christ is God's". The things that belong to other dispensations, and particularly to the Jewish, belong to us in this present period. This dispensation is so flexible, as built up by the Spirit and supported by the Spirit, that those who are in it can touch things, and enjoy them, which in themselves do not belong to it. Take the new covenant, for instance; it was never made in view of this dispensation. The Spirit of God is in this dispensation, He builds it up and supports it, and is with us, as the Lord said, "he dwelleth with you and shall be in you". It is the Spirit who searches all things, even the depths of God, and these depths belong to us. Christianity cannot be bounded by physical limits. The heavens are not bounded so far as we can see. Earth can be measured, the sea, all that is terrestrial can be measured, but not the heavens, and certainly not the uncreated condition to which Deity belongs. I speak reverently, dear brethren, of Deity, because it means Godhead. The realm of Deity is outside of us. We read of the third heaven, but we are not told how many more there are. Paul said he was caught *up* to the third heaven, but *into* Paradise. The elevation was as far as, but no higher than, the third heaven. Paradise is equivalent or synonymous with the third heaven, and Paul heard unspeakable things there, unutterable things, things not permitted to man to utter.
So we are reminded constantly in these matters of our limitations. We are to be *filled* to all the fulness of God, but we cannot compass the fulness of God, we are limited. Length and breadth and depth and height, however great, is limitation. The assembly is the nearest of all the families that are named, for every family in the heavens and on earth is named of the Father; not named of the Son, for it is the Father who is the Head of the families, and He names them.

Now the references to twelve in @Revelation 21 are remarkable, the more remarkable because it is at the introduction of the millennium. The introduction of the millennium shows what is carried forward from our dispensation. The prophets are full of the introduction of the millennium, and of the body of it, but say very little of the end of it. As it finishes, it is followed by the terrible destruction of Gog and Magog. As the Spirit tells us in @Revelation 20, they come up on the breadth of the earth, and surround the saints, the earthly people, and the beloved city. This hostile element, this enemy of God, at the close of the millennium comes up on the breadth of the earth, which would mean that its historical bounds are set aside, as always is the case, and as often happened to Israel, but fire will come down from God out of heaven and consume them every one. How quickly it will finish, making way for the eventual merging of things in the millennial day with the eternal situation! God says very little about it, but flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
Now I would stress the thought as to the number twelve in @Revelation 21, because it is most important in regard to the point before me, that we should understand how it is related to this wonderful dispensation that is about to break upon us, and our heavenly part in it, which nothing can exceed. Indeed, the assembly's part and place is not to be exceeded by the blessing granted to men in any other dispensation, yet God in His wonderful skill places the names of the twelve sons of Israel on the gates of the heavenly city; twelve angels are there too, so that all the features of administration and government are linked up with the heavenly side of the position, and the heavenly side is our side, beloved; we belong to that place.
{245}
How full the chapter is of the idea of twelve, which, as one could easily show, is worked out in the development of love; and, dear brethren, if we have not love, we are nothing. God has written down with great pains His mind as to this matter of love, and He is endeavouring to put it upon our hearts now. I will not say our consciences, but our hearts. It is a heart time, when God would speak to us as to love. The number twelve is most divisible, and it is multiplied by thousands, and finishes in the cube (@Revelation 21: 16). "Two of you", for instance, refers to the numeral in which love is shining. "If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven", @Matthew 18: 19.
I would urge this on the dear brethren, the sisters especially, because they are often neglected and belittled. The feminine idea is first in the chapter; as the city is seen "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". There is nothing said in the first part of the chapter about the number twelve, because those verses refer to eternity, and the further we get into eternity the less there is need to call attention to love, love will prevail everywhere. There is no need to call attention to what is prevalent everywhere! It is prevailing in heaven now, but on earth it is not prevailing, hence attention is called to it. We speak of it when we celebrate the Lord's supper, it is a time of love; it is the time of Christ's love to us, and it is the time of our love to Christ.
Now I would just remind you that in the gospels the *apostles* are seen as representative of love. The Lord took them up for that purpose. I refer to that now, because of the place which the Lord's supper has acquired amongst the brethren. Historically it has had a great place, especially from the time of the Reformation, but not since pentecostal times has the Lord's supper had such a place as during the
{246}
past fifty years. I am not speaking of mere intelligence as to facts, but I am endeavouring to interest the saints in it, that all may see that the Lord's supper is for them, for the younger as well as for the older ones, and that it would result in our being accustomed to love, and to open our hearts to it.
If a believer wants to break bread, the love matter is bound to come up; have we love, love for Christ, love for the brethren? It is a time of searching, and this matter of the Lord's supper at the end of this dispensation is testing us. At the beginning, when it was inaugurated, the twelve apostles were there; they are not here now, but their writings are here, and Paul's writings are here; it was he to whom the Lord, after His ascension, gave authoritative instruction as to the Supper. This was to be communicated to the assembly, and Paul did that, so that whatever may be said, Paul has the last word, and there is no mistaking what he writes. When Matthew and Mark speak of the Lord's supper, they speak of it in a way that Paul does not, and they do not refer to it as to be continued as a memorial of Christ. Luke comes nearer to Paul than any of them.
If any one wanted to break bread and the apostles spoke to them, the apostles would interrogate such and be very careful. Matthew says, "When the evening was come, he lay down at table with the twelve" (@Matthew 26: 20). Why did He come with the twelve? Surely He had in mind that through all the ages down to the present, the twelve had much to say about this matter, for this matter of love was in it. Mark says the same thing in effect. If the Lord were here He would come with the twelve. He is away and they are away. If He were here they would not be needed. Luke is the only one who says, "the twelve apostles with him". "The twelve"; there could be no other twelve like
{247}
them anywhere. Others were added afterwards, perhaps in some sense superior, especially Paul, but there was none like the twelve.
Hence in @Revelation 21 the "twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb" are in the foundations of the holy city. What an honour to be conferred on these men! The allusion is to the Lord's sufferings; He suffered as the Lamb, and they were the apostles of the Lamb. According to Luke, when the hour was come He placed Himself at table and the twelve apostles with Him. We are not told what they said, for *they* do not instruct us at that time. The Lord said all that was to be said as to the Supper, and He would, as I may say, make a gesture which Peter and John and James would understand, and indeed the twelve, for they were all there. Even Judas was there. The Lord said, "The hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table".
I hope the dear brethren will have followed what I have endeavoured to say as to this matter of twelve, and the place it has at the end of this dispensation and at the beginning of the millennium. Great stress is laid on the idea embodied in the word twelve, now that we are at the end of the dispensation. In the ministry the Lord has been giving in our time, He has been telling us about the Supper, and telling us about administrative matters. Eldership in a formal sense has not been made prominent, but instead we have care-meetings; we never have had so many care-meetings. The word *care* covers the whole matter. It is a matter of love. If we care for the saints and put our word *care* on our meetings, they are love-meetings. If we love the brethren we want them cared for; many will continue late at night in these care-meetings as needed, that the assembly may be cared for. These are the lessons in the administrative idea being so prominent in these verses in @Revelation 20 and 21.
{248}
I urge that upon the brethren, in view of all there is to attend to. The world is pressing upon us its ideas, and brethren will have to stand against much. Why should it be that unionism and many other 'isms' are talked about interminably? The Spirit of God is with us to instruct us, and we ought to be able to arrive at something of the meaning of the mark of the beast. We ought to be able to finish our discussions and to make up our mind as to the mind of God. In these matters of administration which God has placed in our hands, He gives to His servants (not apostles, but bondmen, @Mark 13: 34) the authority, and decisions can be reached humbly and simply under the Lord, so that we can arrive at finality in any matter. We are not driven to the wall, we never shall be; the Spirit of God is too great for that. Adjustments should be made, and things not left undecided and unfinished.
Now I want to say a few words about @Acts 4. This is a love chapter. It was in the Lord's mind that Peter and John should be in at the beginning of the dispensation, fit in every way to be looked upon. "Look on us", Peter said; not hear us, but "Look on us", as though they were adorning the whole position of the dispensation. It was following this presentation of what was in themselves, that they were taken before the council of the Jews, but after being threatened they were let go, and it says, "being let go, they went to their own". They were not occupied with themselves but with the saints, with "their own". There is what is *our own*, what belongs to us, and this would preclude our attachment to unions and all other worldly institutions and associations. We look on each other as *our own*, and say, We have many brethren, many saints of God, all included in this blessed term, *our own*. Then, in @Acts 4, love being there, and joy
{249}
being there, it is said, that they "reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them".
"And they, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them; who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have the nations raged haughtily and the peoples meditated vain things? The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass".
Now you see what a care-meeting they had, what a love-meeting, what a praise-meeting, what a victory-meeting! You will observe there is no suggestion of vengeance, and not the slightest thought of it. "Vengeance is mine ... saith the Lord". There will be vengeance, terrible vengeance, but not now; and that is the great point, to maintain the dispensation at all costs. According as it was at the beginning, so shall it be at the end. So there is no suggestion of vengeance. On the contrary, it says, "And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word, in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus". This is what the Lord is calling upon us for, I am sure, that there might not be a thought of vengeance. If there be, then we spoil the dispensation. It should be unspoiled by us, at least, who love the Lord Jesus and love one another. "Look on us". If we have to look at people who are discrediting each other, quarrelling with each other, it is quite evident that
{250}
there is some spoiling going on; the ornamentation is being damaged, whereas the ornamentation is to remain.
Luke proceeds to tell us in @Acts 4, "And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness. And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one, and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them; and with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. For neither was there any one in want among them; for as many as were owners of land or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to each according as any one might have need". This is a beautiful picture of unity at the beginning, which I believe God is aiming at now, not in the same measure or strength, but nevertheless in the same character. "Thou hast a little strength", the Lord says, and I believe we should go in in full sail, into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Why not? We have the Holy Spirit, we have the doctrines, the principles, and all that is necessary in a small way, to bring about and maintain what is according to this wonderful passage, that what was at the beginning of the dispensation should be at the end of it. I believe every one of us should strive for that, and what a victory it will be!
I was going to say a word about Barnabas. You generally find in Scripture that there is some person of distinction in the place, in the vicinity, to ornament the matter, and Barnabas is the man. He is surnamed Barnabas, because of what he was, and Luke tells us, "And Joses, who by the apostles was
{251}
surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles¬ feet". He is just magnifying the position, finishing it off, as it were, as we often get it in the Scripture. What a finish there will be, dear brethren, as we assemble when the Lord comes! He will see to it that no one will go up unfit, disorderly, or having anything against him. All will be according to the principles here. The thing is finished; Barnabas is the finishing touch, the son of consolation, the Levite. The apostles surnamed him, showing how authority that is of God will never fail to serve in love. Authority must go with love, and love with authority. He gives authority to those whom He has left behind, and the authority is to be wielded in love.
In the first part of @Revelation 21 John sees the *new Jerusalem* "coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men". God is jealously caring for this final thought, and in view of it is instructing us as to love, and love's sphere, where love is. The tabernacle of God is where God is, and, where God is, there love is. There is no allusion to administration here: no reference to the number twelve. Love itself is *there*; it is prevailing there. There is no need to call attention to what is prevailing, but when we come down to our own dispensation, and the beginning of the next, then love is needed, the principle of twelve is needed, and especially now, so that love may be amongst ourselves. The Lord would lay that upon us as we separate. May the Lord bless these thoughts to all of us!
{252}
PRIESTHOOD
@Luke 11: 1 - 4, 11, 13; @Luke 1: 39 - 64
What is in mind at this time is to speak about priesthood. Yesterday, we had the dispensation of God as the subject for our service, and it may be stated now that this dispensation is maintained by priesthood. The system as we spoke of it, for it is a system, is maintained by Christ in heaven. He is High Priest above, High Priest after the order of Melchisedec, which denotes that He is a divine Person. On the other hand, the system is maintained by the Holy Spirit here on earth. That is to say, all is upheld and maintained in function by Christ in heaven on the one hand, and the Holy Spirit here on earth on the other. Hence the invulnerability of the system. It cannot be overthrown, for it rests on the foundation of God, which stands. Whatever happens on man's side, the foundation of God stands, and that is because of two divine Persons active in relation to it, one in heaven, and another on earth, of whom the Lord said, calling Him the Comforter, "another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever". So that we may count on the maintenance of the system until the end of the dispensation. The Spirit is here until then, and He has never been withdrawn. He remains here, and Christ remains above.
In the types, we have allusions to Christ ceasing to be *High Priest*. "The death of the high priest which was anointed with the holy oil" is referred to in @Numbers 35. That is, a certain thing happens; it is the termination of something. That would be so in the type, which refers to the ordinary high priest in Israel, but now we are speaking of Christ; not that He dies. He has died for sin once, but now He lives for ever. The figure just means that He
{253}
ceases to be Priest. That is to say, as to Christ, that He will give up the position of priesthood, through which we are maintained here while He is on the Father's throne, but He will soon take His own throne, and rule the nations from that throne. So that there will be then a change of dispensation, but as was said last night, the present dispensation remains and will remain while Christ is on high as Priest and the Spirit is here. So the position is unaltered up to the present moment.
Now what is in mind is not so much to call attention to the priesthood of Christ and the service of the Holy Spirit here below, although keeping these two great facts always before us, but to call attention to priesthood among the brethren, priesthood in the saints. Peter says we are "a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ". What one has observed is that there is a great shortage of priests, and that among those who may be regarded as priests, a great shortage of power to carry out priestly service; hence the weakness of the meetings. We have to take account of the feelings of sisters too; they are not permitted to speak in the assembly, but have to wait for the brothers to speak, because their function is to speak. If there is to be prayer, they are to pray. If there is to be praise, they are to praise. If there is to be ministry, they are to minister. Sisters are debarred the service, but they are not debarred from the service of priesthood in another sense; that is to say, they are to pray as the brothers are, but in their own setting; they are to pray without ceasing, as the brothers are.
I have read this scripture in @Luke 11 to call attention to the idea of teaching on these points. It is clear that we are not simply to know certain things through reading the Scriptures or ministry, but we are to be taught them; and so here we have
{254}
the Lord, as it says, "in a certain place, praying". We are not told what place it was, but it is simply said that the Lord was in a certain place; and He was praying, and "when he had ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples". I have read this in view of what has been said, that whether brothers or sisters, we are to be taught to pray. In fact, we have to be taught everything that belongs to Christianity, not that one may not learn from the Scriptures, of course, for we can, but the principle with God is teaching, and one great matter that God is teaching is prayer. We are to be taught how to pray, and in saying this, I mean that we are to be taught how to develop priesthood. We learn everything from Christ; in Christianity, everything; He employs others subordinate to Himself, yet He is the Teacher, as He Himself said,, "One is your instructor and all ye are brethren", @Matthew 23. Christ is the Teacher, and therefore none of us should be wanting in ability to serve in a priestly way, wanting in the ability to pray. That is an immense thing, and we would encourage you in it, for there is a grave shortage of those who really pray, even amongst ourselves.
The disciple in @Luke 11, whoever he was, asked the Lord to teach them to pray, and obviously it was because the Lord Himself had been praying. One does not hesitate to suggest that there was something particular about the Lord in the attitude of prayer, and as to this or aught else in the service of God, we have to learn everything from the Lord; and so here the disciple said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray". He did not ask the Lord to teach him, showing that he was not selfish, nor did he count himself to be over the heads of others, nor desire to be at an advantage among them; he wanted all to be taught.
{255}
In @John 20, Mary Magdalene had the message, and she showed no indication of any feeling that she had something distinguishing her above others. The Lord sent her with the message, and He told her what to say to His disciples, "Go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", and she went and told these things to the disciples. She made no parade of the fact that she was the only one who had such a message. It is very comely in any of us, especially in sisters, not to make any show of things, even if you are the first to know something. Mary simply went and told them that "she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her". I am mentioning this to show the comeliness that belongs to sisters.
Now, in this case in @Luke 11, it was a brother, and he was just a disciple, but he did not ask the Lord to teach *him* to pray, as if to make a parade of something that he had. No, he says, "teach us to pray"; and so it is that the chapter teaches us about priesthood, for praying is a priestly function. The Lord responds to the wish of this disciple, and no doubt they greatly valued it, for the instruction in all probability supplied what the disciple would say at some time as he prayed. The Lord would perchance say to the disciples, 'I would like you to know how to pray, to see how I pray, and to know what words to use'. How appropriate then is the desire of this disciple, in saying, "Lord, teach us to pray". In answering, I suppose, the Lord would have the full meaning of the word *pray* in His mind, so that the disciple should be a true priest; and indeed all the disciples.
Now Zacharias, who is the main subject in the beginning of this gospel, was a priest, and he was fulfilling his priestly service at the altar of incense at the hour of prayer. This shows that he was accustomed
{256}
to pray, but apparently, as the chapter shows, he did not know how to pray, and hence he had to be taught, and he was taught, so that he became a true priest. He had never really been one before, as far as we can see, although he is called one, and served as one, but he was simply a legal priest, a Jewish priest, whereas Luke has in mind Christian priests, priests after the order of Christ. Zacharias was within the temple at the hour of prayer when incense should arise, but he was stricken dumb. I leave that there, so that we can have it in our minds. He was stricken dumb, and he remained dumb for nine months. There is a sequel to it, a very great one, and a very precious one too.
The Lord proceeds patiently to instruct the disciples, no doubt far beyond what the disciple expected. "He said to them, When ye pray, say, Father, thy name be hallowed, thy kingdom come: give us our needed bread for each day; and remit us our sins; for we also remit to every one indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation". They were evidently attentive and He then proceeded to say more; even as we learn in @Luke 19: 11, that "as they were listening to these things he added and spake a parable". They had been hearing something from Christ and because they were attentive, "he added and spake a parable". So here we read in the fifth verse, "And he said to them, Who among you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, let me have three loaves". So the Lord goes on with His teaching in this chapter, giving in an extended way the instruction that the disciples asked for. He enlarged on the matter for them, beginning with the prayer that was suitable to the Father, as He said, "When ye pray, say, Father". That was suitable, but He goes on to the eleventh verse and says, "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will
{257}
he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? or if he ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him". This is one of the most important scriptures I can bring before you as to the point in question. The Lord in His instruction rises above the disciple's question, who asked Him to teach them to pray. He teaches them to pray, but He goes further, and He leads them to the Father.
Now, I think I may take the opportunity of just stopping there, dear brethren, and asking you to consider this matter, how the Lord in this instruction begins with *ourselves* and ends with His Father and the greatness of what His Father would give if anyone asked of Him, namely, the Holy Spirit. Now, let us stop to think, as we are praying. Some of us here may not have the Holy Spirit. There are many who have not, who are nevertheless the subjects of the work of God, yet do not know enough, they do not know redemption. Through bad teaching or through negligence, they do not know enough, as Jehovah says, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge". That is a solemn word, but how true it is. "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge". The Lord is giving us knowledge here as to the Father, and as to prayer, and as to the possibilities of prayer, and what the Father might give as we pray. "How much rather shall the Father, who is of heaven, give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" That great and glorious gift is available to those who pray, and therefore, I would urge anyone here, who is not sure as to the Holy Spirit, to get to God about it, and ask, as the Lord says, in the plainest possible language. "If therefore, *ye* being evil, know how to give good gifts to your
{258}
children, how much more shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" Do not tell me that it is dispensational truth. It is the truth; direct truth from God, and it applies to every person who believes, and I am urging the necessity of *believing*.
We perhaps know the beautiful word of Elizabeth as to Mary, "Blessed is she that has believed". She could hardly have said anything more blessed and greater at that time. "Blessed is she that has believed". What I am saying is for faith; it is for the believer, and the very greatest gift that God can give to us is the Holy Spirit. He gave His Son to die *for* us, and He gives the Holy Spirit *to* us. The Son and the Spirit are both blessed divine Persons; one of Them as having become Man, has died for us, and the other is given to us and works in us so as to fit us for God, and for the assembly, but also to fit us for our place in heaven. We cannot afford to go into heaven without suitable education for the place, and God is educating us so that we should know. "And we shall know", says Hosea. "We shall follow on to know Jehovah". Divine things are to be known. Why not avail ourselves of them? We need them if we are to be priests unto God, and that is my point. So the Lord says, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them who ask him?"
Now having said so much, and I hope that what I have said is clear, I want to show that the passage read from chapter 1 affords three notable examples of persons who became priests in the true sense, priests in the Christian sense, as I might say. I can cite others too, because Luke affords many examples of priesthood, but he gives these three, and there is not time to speak of more. The first one in mind is Elizabeth; the second is Mary, the Lord's mother, and the third is Zacharias, Elizabeth's husband.
{259}
Those three are recorded or presented in this chapter as typical of what I am saying, not simply typical of Jewish priests, but of Christian priests. Luke would transfer our thoughts to Christianity, and above all he would instruct us in the truth of priesthood according to Christianity, to deliver us from the error of the many who have returned to the Jewish system of priesthood. I do not hesitate to say that many of the Protestant denominations have returned to the Jewish system, and this is true of Christendom in general; they have returned to Judaism or paganism.
It is a fact that in the early days of Christianity the apostle Paul, who is the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews, had to write to the Jewish Christians, and Peter also wrote to them, to set aside in their souls the legal system, for they had returned to it. The assemblies of Galatia had also returned to it, and the apostle Paul had to labour with them in order that they might renounce what they had returned to. The whole teaching of these epistles is to set out the error of returning to Judaism or paganism, of returning to what we have left in becoming nominal Christians, because leaving nominal Christianity means apostasy, and one great point in the epistle to the Hebrews is to warn and deliver from apostasy. It says in chapter 6, for instance, "For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted of the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away". Read the chapter for yourself, when you have opportunity. There is no hope for ever for such persons. You will understand, beloved friends, that I am seeking to testify the truth as the opportunity is open to me, and what I say *is* the
{260}
truth. If we renounce the truth, and go back from Christianity, it is apostasy, and that is what the epistle to the Hebrews teaches, saying, "It is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted of the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away".
Well now, I want to show, as I said, that these three persons, Elizabeth, Mary, and Zacharias, are illustrations of the Christian priesthood. The Lord's teaching, as I have been speaking of it in chapter 11, is to show how it could be effected, for it is a question of being taught how to pray. Let us remember, dear brethren, and let us be touched by it, that the Lord Himself as here upon earth had His ears opened morning by morning as a learner, that He might know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. Isaiah prophetically records that. Is it not marvellous, that the Lord should say that, and yet He is "over all, God blessed for ever"? He became so low, to teach us to pray, and to teach us all other things, and show us how to learn, by Himself taking the place of a learner before God. He is not learning in @Luke 11, He is teaching, and indeed, He is no longer in the *place* of learning, but He was in it. The disciple asked Him to teach them to pray, and He teaches them, and I am seeking to show you now that these three persons in @Luke 1 are intended to instruct us by example, because that is the divine way. Hence the Lord says Himself in @Matthew 11, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest". He would give us rest, knowing how many of us are in the throes of anxiety as to our soul's state. We do not know the way out, but the way out is often by example, and that way is Christ. He says, "I am
{261}
the way". Everything is to be learned from Him, and so He says, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me". That is by example, and "ye shall find rest for your souls".
As I said, Elizabeth, Mary and Zacharias here, are three illustrations of transfer through instruction out of Judaism into Christian priesthood. I know full well how much the word priest is attached to certain religious leaders, but I am not referring to that kind of priesthood. Elizabeth and Mary and Zacharias did not develop into that kind of priesthood, for they really left the Jewish system, and they are examples of the true Christian priesthood. The remarks of Elizabeth are very beautiful; many of us have been charmed by what is presented in the chapter as to these two women in the hill country of Judea. Priesthood belongs to heaven, for it is a heavenly priesthood, and Christ is our model. Elizabeth's remarks are most touching, but she does not say as much as Mary, for she did not know as much. She did not advance so much; she had not had such intercourse with divine Persons as Mary had. I have no need to remind you of what I am saying. What intercourse Mary, the mother of our Lord, had with divine Persons. "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee", the scripture says, "and power of the Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God". He was the Son of God as born in time, as becoming incarnate. Mary had that experience, through the power of the Highest overshadowing her, and the Holy Spirit coming upon her. To be priests we have to understand that, and what I am saying will help us to do so.
The prophet Malachi instructs us, saying that "the priest's lips should keep knowledge", meaning that he is not to be silent. If he has anything to
{262}
say, he says it. He has power to do so, for God has given him power, the power of expression. "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law". Elizabeth is seen thus here, and her remarks are charming. I have often said that, and I do not hesitate to say it now. The verses from 39 onwards are before me now in speaking. "And Mary, rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste". The hill country is not simply a physical idea; it refers to what is elevated; that is to say, the priesthood of God is elevated; it is not on the level of men. Mary went "to a city of Judah, and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit". Now that is what I am speaking of. *She was filled with the Holy Spirit*. That is in keeping with what I have been speaking of, that the Holy Spirit is available to those who pray. Elizabeth at this particular time was filled with the Holy Spirit, and as such she is a priest. And so it is, that in the power of the Holy Spirit she says to Mary who had come to her, "Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?". Elizabeth is speaking as a priest, and I appeal to the sisters as to this matter. How beautiful are her words! She is speaking to her sister, her cousin, of course, but her sister spiritually, and in speaking to her, she calls her the mother of her Lord. Mary speaks next, but Elizabeth finishes in saying, "And blessed is she that has believed". I have already touched on that, because what I am speaking of depends on faith. It is a question of laying hold of the truth by faith. Mary believed, and Elizabeth is celebrating the fact that she believed. She believed what Gabriel
{263}
told her, and Elizabeth says, "there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from the Lord". There is assurance as we have faith.
Now Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord" She is a worshipper. She has become that. She is one of the three of whom I am speaking, and she is a worshipper. She is intelligent in what she says, and our worship should be intelligent. Our words at the Lord's supper should be intelligent, and intelligible, as it is said, "I speak as to intelligent persons", and that is the point here. Mary says, "For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid, for behold, from henceforth, all generations shall call me blessed. For the Mighty One has done to me great things, and holy is his name; and his mercy is to generations and generations to them that fear him. He has wrought strength with his arm; he has scattered haughty ones in the thought of their heart. He has put down rulers from thrones, and exalted the lowly. He has filled the hungry with good things, and sent away the rich empty. He has helped Israel his servant, in order to remember mercy, (as he spoke to our fathers), to Abraham and to his seed for ever". That is Mary's tribute at this wonderful time, and it is worship. It is a tribute of worship to God in the light of the wonderful things that had taken place. She becomes a priest, but more than a priest, she becomes a worshipper. She is a sister, and she is a worshipper, and she is intelligent and what she says is intelligible.
Well now, she is the second. I am speaking briefly, and the third is Zacharias and he has a good deal to say. Zacharias is well known to us, but as I said before, I cannot say of him as Elizabeth said of Mary, 'Blessed is he that hath believed'. It is not said that he believed, but it was a fact nevertheless that he came into a state of faith. In principle, he came into the knowledge of Christian priesthood.
{264}
And so as John the baptist was born, the neighbours and her cousins spoke to Elizabeth. We have to notice these neighbours and cousins, because they are apt to be very natural, for natural feelings are very likely to lay hold of persons in these cases. Natural sentiments tend to deprive us of the quality of priesthood. And so it says of Elizabeth, that "her neighbours and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy with her and they rejoiced with her. And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called it after the name of his father, Zacharias". That is what the kinsfolk would do; they would say, 'His name must be the same as his father's name, and his grandfather's name'. Well, that is not heaven's thought. Heaven has other thoughts. And so it says, "his mother [that is Elizabeth] answering said, No;" she is a spiritual woman now. She is not any longer simply of the daughters of Aaron, as she is called in verse 5. That is another thing to notice. Her husband was a son of Aaron; the sons of Aaron were called priests in relation to their father, but not so the daughters. Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron, and no doubt would cherish the fact that she was a priestess, so to speak. But now when they say of the son that was born, Call him Zacharias, she says, "*No*". She had become spiritual. I am not saying that she would say that, but that is the fact in her soul, that she becomes spiritual, and I am humbly insisting on the brethren becoming spiritual, and going in for priesthood, to know how to pray, and know how to worship, and whatever else requires to be done. There is what sisters can do, and what brothers can do. And so here, Elizabeth says 'No'. The cousins say, He must be called after his father. He is his firstborn. That is just how cousins and grandmothers are apt to speak; whereas what we are engaged with now is not what we do naturally,
{265}
but what we should do spiritually. What was imperative spiritually, and imperative at the moment, was that his babe should be called *John*. Thank God, Elizabeth and Zacharias are of one mind.
How important it is that husbands and wives should be of one mind, and in matters of this kind especially, that is, as they bear on the service of God, on the testimony, and on the priesthood. And so it says, "There is no one among thy kinsfolk who is called by this name. And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called". He had been dumb for nine months or so, had no power to serve even in the temple. And, of course, it is right that the father should name the child, although Eve named her first child, but Seth named his, and gave him a name that was suitable; Enosh. He was a poor dying man, that is what Seth said.
And so finally, "they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called. And having asked for a writing table, he wrote, saying, John is his name". It is firm and it is settled. Let no one ever raise a question about this name. He is John the baptist, his name has come down the ages to us as a witness to Christ. As the Lord said, There is none greater born of women than John the baptist. The cousins would have him called Zacharias, and spoil the whole matter if they could, but Zacharias is proof against that. He has now become spiritual, and therefore become priestly. He asked for a writing table and wrote, "His name is John". And they all marvelled. His mouth was opened immediately, showing that he was on spiritual lines now, and what does it say? "His mouth was opened immediately and his tongue, and he spake blessing God". He is the priest and speaks to God.
I would just finish now, leaving the brethren having these facts in their minds, and the importance of priesthood, and the scarcity of true priesthood.
{266}
One hopes that there may be more of it, and that it may be understood, as we build on the truth I have just set out, and what I have illustrated in those three persons.
{267}
FAITH AND SPIRITUALITY AS SEEN IN ABRAHAM (1)
@Genesis 14: 18 - 24; @Genesis 15: 1 - 21
J.T. I was thinking of Abraham, particularly in view of the intervention of Melchisedec and his ministry, and at the same time of the word of God coming in in chapter 15. In making this proposal one believes that it is most opportune at the present time; that is, what is involved in @Genesis 14 and 15: first the extraordinary reference to Melchisedec, typifying to us as he does clearly, One who is a divine Person and yet viewed as Man here historically. Hence it becomes a question of our having the understanding that is needed to live in the realm that is suggested, the realm of faith, but also of spirituality. Both faith and spirituality are needed, in order to penetrate what is implied in these scriptures, especially in Melchisedec. He is referred to in the New Testament in a peculiar way, for the Spirit through him would bring before us no less a Person than the Lord Jesus Himself, in whatsoever way we may look at him. He is spoken of very little in Scripture, only here, and in @Psalm 110, and in the epistle to the Hebrews; and it seems to me, that it will tax our faith and our spirituality to speak of him, to take on this subject with profit, because if it is not for profit, it will not serve us much. It is not a question of what we may know of the chapters in the ordinary sense, but of what spirituality we have in dealing with them.
A.M.H. You have said that this was particularly applicable to the present time. Do you mean this Melchisedec setting is particularly applicable to us?
J.T. Well, the spiritual side attached to it. It is not simply a question of what is in the subject, but what we are, what is in us spiritually; and I
{268}
believe that has a significance in view of the end, because the Lord intends to make the end of the dispensation what it should be. He intends to make it spiritual; He intends that we should go out spiritually, and know where we are going. We are told that the Lord Himself is coming for us; but then the question is, Have we a spiritual understanding of these chapters and the connection of them in the New Testament, especially with the epistles to the Thessalonians?
J.C-S. So that heaven has provided spiritual facilities for us in order that the divine end of spirituality in us might be reached.
J.T. Quite. Spiritual facilities is a good expression. I believe it begins with the beginning; it begins with the first chapter of Genesis. It is a question of the days, and how they are to be regulated, how we fit into them, especially the sun and the moon and the stars.
P.H.H. Have you had in mind the Lord Jesus in speaking of the sun, and the assembly in speaking of the moon, and spiritual men in mentioning the stars? Would they be amongst the spiritual facilities in mind?
J.T. I think what you say is very appropriate, because we need not only Christ and the assembly, but men, individuals fitted especially to shine in God's realm, the realm of His operations, especially since the time of the breakdown of the assembly. There has been a great need for this, for individuals to come out and take their part each in what there is to be done. We have it in spiritual history and in hymns, that since the breakdown there have been men who are more or less in accord with the mind of heaven. The Reformation, under God, brought out the possibilities that have been, but all is greatly accentuated now in the light that has been furnished, extending down to our times.
{269}
C.C.C. The thought of glory attaching to it would stimulate our hearts. I was thinking of @1 Corinthians 15, the different glories; the sun's glory, the moon's glory, and star differing from star in glory.
J.T. That is good.
Ques. Had you in mind that the bread and wine might sustain Abraham in view of the word of the Lord reaching him? I was thinking of the reference to spiritual facilities. Would the bread and wine come under that heading, and in the next chapter, the word of Jehovah coming to him? I wondered whether you had in mind our being built up constitutionally so that the word of Jehovah could come to us.
J.T. Just so. And the word coming in here in the sense of opening up things, opening up the mind of God as to any given time, and the connection of this with the epistle to the Hebrews, in the priesthood of Christ, and the word of God. The priesthood of Christ is to fit us according to any spirituality that we may have, and strengthen us, and the Spirit adds its help to our weakness; and then the word itself strengthens us as to the light of God that is available to us, and then the bread and the wine. In the Lord's supper it is the bread and the cup, but bread and wine have a distinctive meaning as to what strengthens the heart, and the joy that goes with what there is in the word, as it is said of Christ, "the joy that was set before him". The Lord would bring us into that joy.
J.C-S. We are oftentimes deficient in the thought of joy.
J.T. Yes, I think so. One feels one's own shallowness and meagreness as to it, and no doubt we all feel the same way. At the same time it is remarkable what God has brought about amongst His people at the present time, and whilst not
{270}
eulogising ourselves, it is well to accept facts, and be thankful for them.
Ques. Would you say there is in that provision strength and buoyancy to go through exceedingly testing circumstances?
J.T. Strength and buoyancy; that is good. That is exactly what comes out in chapter 14, in the bread and wine brought forth. It comes after a term of conflict, in which God made Abraham victorious, and not only was he victorious, but he secured lost ground, lost property. So it says, "Melchisedec king of Salem brought out bread and wine. And he was priest of the Most High God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth. And blessed be the Most High God". So that we have here in effect and in substance, not only the blessing of the saints, the blessing of the assembly, but the thought of blessing God too. These two things have been brought together in a peculiar way in our own times.
C.H.H. Is it important that Abraham comes under the personal service of Melchisedec?
J.T. Very good, the personal service.
C.H.H. I wondered whether coming under the personal service of Christ is the great means of developing spirituality.
J.T. Yes; developing it in intelligence, as it is said, "The Lord will give thee understanding", not only making us spiritual, but giving us understanding.
J.C-S. And he was "priest of the Most High God". Would that put a spiritual impress upon the matter?
J.T. Well, the whole position is in view, we might say, it is a question of the universal position into which God has come. We call it rightly the economy into which God has come, but then, that
{271}
may be simply spoken of as a dispensation, but there is more than that. The economy is more than a dispensation. It is a question of divine operations, and the One who is the great Operator; that is, Christ.
A.J.G. Would you say that the end in view in His operations is that God Himself in His supremacy, Possessor of heavens and earth, should be before us, and served?
J.T. Just so; and so if we are to deal with special ministrations or personalities in the ministry, then it is a great matter to have before us the ministry that each may have, beginning with Paul, for what he set out was special, it was outstanding. The idea of the economy can hardly be restricted to a dispensation, for it is more, because it is a question of what God is doing, and the personnel by which He is operating.
J.C-S. You have in mind that the word economy refers not merely to a dispensation. In the economy there are certain divine operations, involving the Spirit's work, and in relation to what has come out in Christ, the revelation of the Father; all that enters into that.
J.T. And then, what I have referred to in speaking of the expanse; that is, the opening out in a fresh way of what God had primarily introduced in the thought of the word *heaven*. The word *heaven* is greatly amplified in what is said of the expanse in the second day; the allusion is to what God has as a sphere of operations; and we must therefore make allowance for these operations. The great Operator is Christ, but then there are those whom He has taken on, and what may develop out of each, and then how we are to view ourselves, as we have already said as to the economy. Each is to view himself, and see what part he is to have, because Satan has come into what is called heaven;
{272}
that is, the expanse, and he would oppose these operations. God called the expanse "heaven"; He called it that Himself, yet He does not say it was good. There is something to be deduced from that, and from the general thought of heaven; and we have to consider what we may be, what each may be, in it, and how each may contribute to it, and whether he is in the expanse according to the primary thought of God as to heaven.
Ques. Is it suggested in the passage in Daniel? "And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse; and they that turn the many to righteousness as the stars, for ever and ever", @Daniel 12: 3.
J.T. Very good. That fits in well.
P.H.H. I was wondering whether it is possible to be in the expanse, even in an active way, and yet not thoroughly fitting in with God's primary thought. I suppose a good many in Christendom, many for instance as indicated in 2 Timothy would be professedly in the sphere of God's operations, but not with Him. Is that what you mean by speaking of how each one may be in it?
J.T. Quite so; and how God may segregate us and keep us in accord with His primary thought, that is to say, with heaven; with what God began with. God made the heavens and the earth, and they continue, only there has been an addition on the second day, and it is a question therefore of how we treat that day, and how we are in it, and whether we belong, as it were, to the segregation, understanding that we have a heavenly part.
P.L. Would the allusion in Deborah's song to the stars in their courses serving in the conflict, bear upon this?
J.T. It would, when it is a question of conflict, and, of course, we are dealing with conflict now in the chapter that is before us. Satan has come into
{273}
the expanse, and there must be conflict until he is driven out; and therefore the questions come up, How did he get there, and how is he to be driven out? Scripture leaves no doubt about that. But now we are occupied with the spiritual side, and we want to make the most of the hour that we have, in speaking of the *spiritual* side, and of what Melchisedec may mean to us, according to what we get here; and then the word of God following on that, as instructing us and settling mind and adjusting us, as to the actual territory in mind in @Genesis 15.
C.H.H. Abraham's dealings with Melchisedec brought about a right state with him, so that he said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah, the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth".
J.T. You mean that he was affected in that way.
C.H.H. I thought that he was affected by the ministry, giving him a link with the Most High, and then m the beginning of the next chapter God Himself says to him, "I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward".
J.T. Quite so, and we shall get great advance as we proceed in the chapters from the fifteenth, because we have to reach heaven itself, not only the instruction of chapter 15, but heaven, the specialities of the later chapters.
E.T. Is it in mind that the economy includes more than one dispensation?
J.T. I think it would. There are more than one.
E.T. You alluded interestingly in Sydney to the scriptures as bearing particularly upon the past dispensation and upon Christianity, upon Israel and upon the assembly. Does that link on?
J.T. Well, I am not sure that we have time to enlarge on the subject now in that way, but we might at any rate, at this juncture, refer to
{274}
@1 Corinthians 10: 11, where we have the allusion to dispensations. "All these things happened to them as types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come". "The ends of the ages" is plural, and the idea apparently is dispensations, so that we have to distinguish, and segregate, as I would say, using that word, and see where certain persons belong, and certain families belong. "Every family in the heavens and on earth" is named of the Father, and we have to place each family, and of course it will open up much to us, especially because of the assembly, which will be in our minds.
P.H.H. Is it interesting here that Melchisedec blesses the man before he blesses God? Is that to bring into our minds the greatness of the persons in relation to whom God is operating?
J.T. Abraham is a typical believer; he is Abraham *the* believer. He has his circumstances, and his ups and downs, so that God will take account of the ups and the downs, and so God would think of Abraham. Melchisedec thinks of him. It is said, "Melchisedec king of Salem brought out bread and wine. And he was priest of the Most High God. And he blessed him", that is Abram -- "and said, Blessed be Abram". That is, he begins with Abram; but then if we are blessed, we are ready to have part in blessing God.
J.C-S. That would be the end in view of faith, in that way, in his soul.
J.T. It would indeed.
Ques. Is it noticeable, that it does not say of Melchisedec that he went out to meet Abram, but it does say of the king of Sodom, that he went out to meet Abram? Of Melchisedec, it is said that he brought out bread and wine. Would that bear on the ever-availability of the Lord?
J.T. Quite so, bringing out what we need.
{275}
Rem. And being near to us, so to speak, all the time.
J.T. Quite so. The word, "The Lord is near", is always happily in mind in these cases.
Ques. Would @John 13 show the way in which the Lord would leave a personal touch of His love and service upon each one of His disciples, before He left them, providing all that is necessary for them in the feet-washing?
J.T. Very good. We are now engaged with the great *believer*, and how heaven treats him and meets him, and so the next chapter says, "After these things the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward". That is to say, God Himself takes the matter up as to the believer, because we are here in the presence of Abram the believer. It is a question of where we are, whether we are believers or simply nominally brethren.
A.M. Does it all call attention to the living and operative character of the word of God?
J.T. It does indeed. Those chapters in Hebrews which came to one just now touch on Melchisedec, but we should perhaps stress a little the thought of believing. So that we get the word here applied to Abraham. He "believed Jehovah" it says, "and he reckoned it to him as righteousness".
J.C-S. He was really a righteous man on that account.
J.T. Therefore, you might say representative of the material which God has on hand in the expanse.
P.H.H. And reliable in view of all that God would unfold?
J.T. Clearly, being himself the heir of the world. You could hardly get a more important person than Abram in that sense, because he is the heir of the world.
{276}
C.H.H. Does "he believed God" mean that Abram became characteristically a believer?
J.T. He did indeed. The point in Romans is *that we should be believers*.
Ques. Does it not say "believing Abraham", (@Galatians 3: 9); he had that kind of character?
J.T. That is what I thought. He is Abraham the *believer*, you might say, according to Galatians. He is characteristically the *believer*.
C.H.H. Would you distinguish between believers and brethren? Are some brethren not believers?
J.T. Well, it is a question of the use of terms. There are many known as brethren who can hardly be regarded as characteristic believers.
Ques. It is said in Romans that he "found strength in faith". Is that faith in activity?
J.T. Just so. It is "for obedience of faith among all the nations", and we are here among the nations, down in the very extremities, you might say, of the nations. It is a question of having the features of the believer.
A.M.H. Believing would link us up with the work of God that is going on in the expanse. Faith is spoken of as the substance of things hoped for, in @Hebrews 11.
J.T. So that the great army of believers in that chapter is to bring that out. Abraham went out, not knowing whither he went. That is, he acted in faith, trusting in God. It is a question of God, Abraham and God. Later God says to Abraham, "It is I" (chapter 17: 4). God takes this ground with him.
J.C-S. Then faith does not ask for a way with sign-posts to direct you.
J.T. Quite so. We do not get sign-posts or external ways and means. It is a question of faith, nevertheless we do see, but it is a question of faith,
{277}
as the Lord says, "Blessed they who have not seen and have believed", @John 20: 29.
A.M. Is it important in that connection that Abraham's vision is directed at once to the heavens and the stars rather than to the earth? Verse 5 says, "And he led him out, and said, Look now toward the heavens, and number the stars".
J.T. Yes; you have an allusion in chapter 13 (verses 14 - 17) that might help in that. I call attention to that because of the reference to seed as the dust of the earth, as over against the stars. Our chapter has the stars in mind, but we will have more about that later. The territory in mind here is not the heavenly side. It is the general position that is granted to Abraham. It says in verse 18, "On the same day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates". That shows it is the general territory to which the word of God would apply, and what disposition God may make of it, and where the families on the earth may be found, and where the material for the assembly may be found. But we shall later find the things more distinguished as to the heavenly side and Christ Himself being the Heir of everything.
A.J.G. Do you mean that we are to be intelligent in the whole range of divine interests including other families besides ourselves?
J.T. I thought that. And therefore the word of God is mentioned here for the first time. It is the word of God, as if God would call attention to His mind, not only as to heaven, but as to the whole earth, the whole territory in which He is operating.
Ques. Is there any distinction in it being the word of Jehovah in the Darby Translation?
J.T. It is the word of God. It is a question of God, really, for the word is *His* word, and therefore,
{278}
that is brought in to answer Abraham's enquiry. God says to him in verse 7, "I am Jehovah who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to possess it. And he said, Lord Jehovah" (note that it is 'Lord Jehovah'), "how shall I know that I shall possess it?" It is a question of how he is to know. The area in God's mind is very wide, and the instruction as to it runs on to the end of the chapter. It is the application of the word of God, and shows how things are made clear by the word of God.
A.J.G. So that in the presence of all that is being done by man in the world, -- for we have the conflict of the five kings against four -- believers are to be entirely lifted out of that, and fully governed by the light that God is giving as to the immensity of what He is effecting?
J.T. That is what I was thinking in using the word segregation because the idea in the second day is general, and what is done is not called good. That is, Satan is supposed to be there, and we have to face that, and know how to behave in view of it, and to conserve what is of God.
P.H.H. And in that there is the knowledge which is based on belief.
J.T. That is right. And what the word of God affords too. Not simply the ordinary knowledge of things, but the word of God.
P.H.H. The scope of His mind.
J.T. Exactly. Not only what He says, but what He is apt to say, and the word has that meaning; not only what He has actually said, but what He is likely to say. It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, and so we have to be prepared for things to be concealed, and for finding them out. The glory of kings is to find them out, and that is our business this morning.
{279}
Ques. Do you mean that God would have every believer on this personal basis as available for what He may be pleased to convey?
J.T. I would say that. We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, before the judgment seat of God. Each has to give an account for himself of the things done in the body. So that we are before God on an individual basis as you were saying.
J.C-S. So that the word of God would regulate us in regard of the whole position.
J.T. It surely does. We can tell where we are, but then we can tell where God is, what He is doing, what His purposes are.
Ques. Would it be a peculiar joy to God to have a believer to whom He could entrust His thoughts which would involve suffering and testing for all his posterity?
J.T. That is exactly what Abraham is. Abraham is a believer. God has taken him up, selected him out of a whole race and called him alone. He says, "I called him when he was alone, and blessed him", @Isaiah 51: 2. So that God has His man, that is the point that is before us for this particular reading, and there are the word of God and the priesthood of Christ. We are supported by the priesthood of Christ, by that Person, and we are furnished in the sense of food, even as everything is provided for Abraham.
P.H.H. You have drawn attention sometimes to the way the word of God in Hebrews (chapter 4), runs on to God Himself. First of all it says, "The word of God is living and operative" and finishes with "And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do". Would you mind saying a little more as to how God Himself is in His word?
{280}
J.T. That brings out what we have been dwelling on in @Genesis 15. It is a question of God's mind, for the whole world, for the whole earth. Not simply what lie would give to Abraham of course, that is mentioned too, but as we look at it we shall see that it is a question of God's mind, where He is, what God is doing, what section of the world He is operating in.
J.C-S. So that we are to come into line with what He is doing.
J.T. We are. It is the extent of the territory here, it is given in verses 18 - 21. It is for us to determine as it were where God is in all this, because it is His territory, There is China, and the rest of Asia, also Africa, Australia, Europe and America; where is God in all this? Is He doing something special? It is a question of our learning specialities, to name them and be in them, if we are properly belonging to them. @Genesis 15 does not go so far; it is on lower ground really, as we shall see in later chapters, where God distinguishes His heavenly people, but here we are dealing with the whole idea. It is the divine mind at the outset and where God is in the area belonging to Him, at any given time. So that if we take Japheth, where is God? Is He working in that territory? Or is He working in Ham, or is He working in Shem? I am only endeavouring to bring out the general thought as to where God is at any given time.
P.L. Would that fit in with having an understanding of the times?
J.T. Exactly. An understanding of the times and the map too, not only the time, but the actual territory that we are dealing with.
J.C-S. Does that involve what you said at the beginning, faith and spirituality?
J.T. Just so. Because we need these two things if we are to make any headway at all in the truth.
{281}
C.C.C. Would the reference to the number of the stars in verse 5 have in mind to give us an impression of the greatness of the position rather than the thought of what is the heavenly side?
J.T. Yes; you see what God is in it, and what He has. We have assertions on the part of the nations as to what they each have, but God is asserting His rights in the present time in testimony. It is what He has, and that is the point I thought we might confine ourselves to in chapter 15, because it is a question of the covenant God had made at this time with Abraham, and the extent of the territory.
{282}
FAITH AND SPIRITUALITY AS SEEN IN ABRAHAM (2)
@Genesis 17: 1 - 27
J.T. Attention was called this morning to the use of the title Lord, as applied to Jehovah; in @Genesis 15: 2 it is said, "Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me? seeing I go childless". The title Lord applied to Jehovah clearly would have authority in mind. Here it is Adonai, a plural word, and is connected with the word "Father" in the epistle of James, chapter 3, verse 9. "Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men made after the likeness of God". The title Lord used here is connected with the Father, and it is undoubtedly of significance, especially as we are accustomed to connect grace purely with the Father. At the same time there is the idea of authority attached to the Father; the Lord Himself refers to the Father in this very sense, addressing Him as "Lord of the heaven and of the earth", @Matthew 11: 25. We have to apprehend the Father in that extended way in order to understand how the terms applied to the Godhead are flexible; and that in treating of the Father we are not to limit the idea simply to grace, for there is authority also with Him.
A.J.G. Would that agree with what we have in the first epistle to Timothy where God is spoken of as the blessed and only Ruler, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship?
J.T. That thought is stressed there in the sixth chapter; Paul says "... which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall show, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship". He will show who is to have authority whatever it may be. A very important matter just now, because of the need of the idea of authority being stressed among the brethren.
{283}
P.L. Would the expression, "which the Father has placed in his own authority" (@Acts 1) bear on that?
J.T. I would say that.
J.C-S. Whilst He has taken the name of Father in grace, it has not cancelled other features attaching to Him.
J.T. Quite so. It shows the flexibility of the truth made known to us relative to divine Persons. They are all One, although they are three Persons, yet there is one God and Father; "one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all".
P.H.H. Might I ask in this connection what is the force of the word *judge* in @Hebrews 12 as a part of the system to which we have come? We have come to "God, the Judge of all".
J.T. It is part of the system to which we have come, and it fits in with what we are saying.
P.H.H. So that the matter of the *Judge*, and the *throne*, and this title *Lord*, all stand together to emphasise authority?
J.T. I thought that, and I think the brethren will acknowledge that it is something we have not thought much of.
A.E.D. The title Lord, as applied to God, is employed in Acts when the authorities came in to prevent the testimony going forward. "They, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God", @Acts 4: 24.
Ques. Does Asaph reach it experimentally when he says, "For God is the judge; he putteth down one and exalteth another", @Psalm 75: 7?
J.T. Just so. This passage we have alluded to in @Acts 4 should be treated extensively I think, because it is a critical time, and there is a reference to the idea of Master in the chapter. It says, when Peter and John had returned, after being severely
{284}
threatened, to their own company, "they, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord". The word is literally *despot*, the master of a slave; one having sovereign power, as in @Jude 4; @2 Peter 2: 1; @Luke 2: 29, and other scriptures. So that we have a considerable amount of truth here, as bearing on the present time, to show that there is the idea of authority in God. God is viewed as a despot, meaning that He has full power as to all matters relative to His government here.
Ques. Is Abraham himself in full accord with that when he says, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
J.T. I am glad you mentioned that, because Abraham is in full accord with it; it is a question of "the Judge of all the earth". We have someone who does right; we have come to "God the Judge of all".
A.M. Had Abraham faced the matter of judgment in relation to himself and his family in this chapter? It says "a horror, a great darkness, fell upon him".
J.T. Yes. It enters into the chapter in a very conspicuous way, I mean the idea of accepting judgment. It is a question of God entering into covenant with Abraham, and these pieces of sacrifices are brought forth pointing to maturity in the subject we are engaged with, because the animals are of mature age, three years of age; not the birds, but each animal. They were to be three years of age, the females, and then the ram. So that we have maturity before us in these matters, and the truth brought in in connection with Isaac in chapter 22 helps as to it, because there the *ram* is found caught in the thicket; that is to say, it is the idea of continuance in the sense of begetting, of fruitfulness, on the line of a certain family, and what we have had
{285}
comes into all this, both the animals and the division of them. And then the power of God passing through them, as though God is giving Abraham, and us now, testimony to His power. The Lord said to those who came to Him with the thought of what there is to be, male and female, "Ye ... err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God", @Mark 12: 24. The idea of error in regard of the Scriptures, and the idea of male and female, all comes up now as we are here together, where the male and female come in, and then how the distinction is made between the male and female in the sacrifices; and so the covenant runs on those lines. Then the power of God went between those pieces; they represented Abraham's exercises and representation before God.
J.C-S. Was that why you spoke of the thought of maturity?
J.T. Just so, because we have come to the time when we should understand the matter of male and female, and what is to be the representation of it in the coming world, as we say, in the eternal side of things.
P.H.H. What is the main distinction?
J.T. The first is as to whether there is such a thing as male and female in the eternal state of things, and then what it means, because the Lord meets that question in the Sadducean objection to Him; and it -is to be understood between us now, especially as to where it comes in in our exercises in the service of God, in our relations in that sense. The Lord, as I said, met the matter in very plain terms, but then we have to think of it as it is treated in the epistles as well as the gospels; and the epistle to the Galatians treats of it directly. There is no male and female, it says, in Christ Jesus (@Galatians 3: 28).
P.H.H. While there is no male and female as applying to us in our persons, that is, men and
{286}
women, in the eternal condition of things, do you understand that male and female may apply as in Christ and the assembly?
J.T. That is just what I do understand.
J.C-S. Do you think that the only way in which the feminine thought will be carried over will be in the assembly?
J.T. That is how I understand it. Of course, you have the masculine thought carried over by itself in the sons of God and the brethren of Christ, but we have to treat of the assembly as composed of all brethren, brothers and sisters, as we are down here now. We have to consider the assembly as including all, and Paul says in @2 Corinthians 11: 2, "For I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ". He speaks there to all the saints in Corinth.
P.H.H. Would it be right to say that God reverts to His original thought as outlined in @Genesis 1 and 2?
J.T. I would say that. And then the question arises as to nations, and what there will be in what we call the millennial condition of things. Undoubtedly the idea of finale and female will remain then as regards men and women; but certainly it does not seem as if it continues on in what we rightly call the eternal condition of things.
Ques. Is that what is implied when Paul says, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God"?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Referring to the passage quoted, how would that tit in? "Do not ye therefore err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God? For when they rise from among the dead they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels who are in the heavens", @Mark 12: 24, 25.
{287}
J.T. Male and female are not found there. It is found only among men; it is not found among angels. They were to be *as* angels.
Ques. Have you in mind that in eternity the three things you mentioned run on collaterally, what is feminine being seen in the assembly, and what is masculine being seen in those who compose it, the brethren of Christ and the sons of God?
J.T. Well, if we just fit in the matter in that formal way, but I would prefer to keep to the facts as mentioned in Scripture, as to Christ and the assembly. "*I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly", as Paul says.
J.C-S. That is, you are thinking of the masculine thought in relation to Christ, and the feminine thought in relation to the assembly?
J.T. That is where it is. And if we think of a sister or a brother now, and anticipate coming conditions, well, a sister is just the same as a brother, and a brother is the same as a sister in that sense.
J.C-S. So that involves spiritual power in ourselves to absorb the truth of it.
J.T. It does. That is just the thing that enters into what we are saying. "Ye ... err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God". We err on those matters.
P.L. We read in @Genesis 5: 2, "Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created". Does that suggest the merging of the assembly in that sense in relation to Christ?
J.T. Well; yes, if you extend the thought in that way, but you actually get male and female there; Eve was a female. I think it is better to keep to these wonderful things, because they are wonderful, but they are mysterious. That is the most difficult side in the mystery. Paul speaks of mystery,
{288}
and whether we are accustomed really in our minds to mystery is the question.
H.H. In @Psalm 22 "the hind of the morning" is mentioned, and then in Habakkuk, "he maketh my feet like hinds¬ feet".
J.T. You mean the feminine thought is there.
H.H. I thought it fitted in with what you are saying.
J.T. It does, and @John 20 does too. In the allusion in @Psalm 22 to the hind of the morning it is a question of the agility in the female; it is not a male thought, it is a female thought. It really alludes to the assembly as the spouse of Christ.
Ques. Your reference to believing Abraham this morning, is that set over against the character of the Sadducees?
J.T. Quite so. There is hardly anything more denied than the truth attaching to women in the Scriptures.
G.A. "This mystery is great". You have referred to that. Does that indicate that the apostle was impressed with the greatness of what had come into the expanse?
J.T. I think so. Ephesians is in mind, the highest feature of the Scriptures that we have. The work of God at Ephesus comprises the highest feature of the truth; and the idea of mystery must be attached to that epistle, but Paul in the epistle to the Romans, as we may remember in the last chapter, alludes to the same thought. "Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, as to which silence has been kept in the times of the ages, but which has now been made manifest, and by prophetic scriptures, according to commandment of the eternal God, made known for obedience of faith to all the nations -- the only wise God, through Jesus Christ,
{289}
to whom be glory for ever". We can see therefore the place of mystery in the truth, and how we are to be accustomed to it in our minds.
C.H.H. Do you think the attack here was peculiarly against that idea of male and female in @Genesis 15? The birds of the air came down, and I wondered whether the idea was to destroy the manifestation before God of the male and female, and that which was pleasurable to Him in them?
J.T. We might as well look at it, "The birds of prey came down on the carcases; and Abram scared them away. And as the sun was just going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, a horror, a great darkness, fell upon him". Abraham took the matter in hand, and in this he is a type of what we all should be, resisting the devil so that he will flee from us. He *scared* them away.
C.H.H. I wondered whether in Abraham scaring them away there would be the manifestation in him of the power of God, transferred, as it were, to Abraham as a characteristic believer, so that he had power to scare away the evil.
J.T. That is good.
P.H.H. This matter of mystery would prevent us from becoming too formal in certain parts of assembly service.
A.J.G. You have spoken often of Paul's intelligence in the mystery, and would his desire be that we should know his intelligence in the mystery?
J.T. That is just the point. There was someone who knew. God was pleased to set someone down here who knew, and Paul could speak of himself in that way. "My intelligence", he says, "in the mystery", not as something entirely unknown but "the mystery".
J.C-S. Paul was going about in his service disseminating the truth, as he says, "to enlighten all
{290}
with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God, who has created all things, in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God, according to the purpose of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord".
J.T. So that the assembly has the thing. The inference is that the assembly has that knowledge. Even although it were not in every one of them, it was in Paul, and Paul was of the assembly. It was there, so that the angels would desire to look into it. It does not say they understood it. I do not think they did, or ever will, but they desire to understand, and of course that is a good example for us, the desire to understand.
A.J.G. Is it right to think that the feminine side of things in eternity is seen in the assembly in her relations with Christ, but in the assembly's relations Godward is it the full thought of sonship entered upon by the saints with Christ?
J.T. Well, yes, only we would not exclude the Father from His part in the mystery, and the joy He has in it. Matthew tells us about a certain king who made a marriage for his son. There is something there for us.
P.L. He brought the woman to the man. Would that give a hint as to joy on the Father's part?
J.T. Well, it might. Whether Adam really had any knowledge of it is another matter, but certainly there it is. Adam did have knowledge and God is displaying it. He is calling attention to it, and He is ever ready to call attention to what He has placed here amongst the brethren; it is something worth calling attention to, because it is a known thing. We have the Spirit of God, and we are told "ye have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things", @1 John 2: 20.
{291}
A.J.G. The assembly according to @Revelation 21 coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride adorned for her husband, would very definitely bring God into this matter of what is feminine.
J.T. Very good. I want to come back to what has just been introduced, as to the Father.
A.J.G. I was enquiring for help whether the feminine thought of the assembly in eternity is connected with the assembly in her relations with Christ, but whether the assembly in its service Godward under the hand of Christ unto all generations of the age of ages is the full thought of sonship in Christ and the assembly. Is that right?
J.T. Quite, we should not shut out the Father from the mystery. I think that the Father would have a part in all this. What pleasure He must have in the Son, and in the Son with His bride. What pleasure He has in her, and all that comes into the service of God now.
J.C-S. That would be supported, would it not, by that verse in the end of @Ephesians 3, "But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think, according to the power which works in us, to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".
J.T. It is what is in the assembly, and what part the feminine has in that sense. What joy the Father must have in what He has, and what the Son has in the assembly.
Ques. Would you distinguish between the affection of the assembly viewed as a woman for the man, and her part with Christ under the eye of God for His pleasure?
J.T. Well, I think so, "I will skew thee the bride". It is mentioned by itself. The Spirit of God says to John, "Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife". She is to be shown to him,
{292}
and she is seen by herself coming down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God. What a marvellous thing that is. What a future thought it is too for us.
P.R.P. Do you mean that the expression "the mystery" has specially in mind the feminine idea?
J.T. Not specially. The mystery is one great thought, inclusive of Christ and the assembly, though of course there are other thoughts of mystery besides, but it is one thought that the Spirit of God would stress, I believe, amongst the brethren, because the time has come for the greatest thoughts, and the Lord is saying to us, that they are now available. There may be only a few who enter into them, but these great thoughts are available, and it is a question of each desiring to have them. Whatever there is, it is for all.
J.C-S. You were referring to the greatness of what Paul had in comparison with John. The mystery is the distinctive feature of Paul. John never refers to it, does he?
J.T. I think it would be a mistake to make John have a ministry by himself, *such as Paul had*.
J.C-S. John got what he had from an entirely different level from Paul. It was from the Lord here on earth, whereas Paul got his direct from Christ in heaven.
J.T. Paul is the only one that is singled out as receiving a ministry in that sense. Of course, Peter is too, but not in the sense of Paul. Peter had a certain speciality, but the twelve generally are much on the same level. Peter is said to be first in @Matthew 10: 2, but Paul is by himself, and speaks of himself as having certain ministries, not only one ministry, but certain ministries, and we are therefore to cleave to him. We can be sure that Paul had a distinct ministry that John did not have. John did not have a distinct ministry in that sense as Paul.
{293}
Ques. Have you in mind the passages in Colossians that refer to his being made a minister and completing the word of God (@Colossians 1: 23, 25)?
J.T. Quite so.
P.H.H. You would say that John has a line of things which runs into Paul's ministry.
J.T. It belongs to the twelve. It belongs to the whole matter that we have in the second chapter of the Acts. The twelve are there alluded to, and they were appealed to. The apostles¬ teaching is referred to, and it, of course, included them all, but there is no speciality there. We have to wait for Paul in that respect.
J.C-S. I think it is important what you say, that nothing should be allowed to becloud Paul's distinctive place in his ministry. It stands out.
J.T. Quite so. That is just what it is. No other apostle or minister has the place that Paul has; there is no comparison really, and to place others on the same level in ministry is not right.
P.L. Peter's word, "What of this man?" the Lord rebuked, and did not state what was John's commission in chapter 21.
J.T. "If I will that he abide until I come", the Lord says, "what is that to thee?". We must not pretend to know, because we do not know.
R.R.T. That is the serious matter in 1 Corinthians, is it not? Levelling out matters, saying, "*I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ". Levelling matters in that way.
J.T. Quite so, but I do not want to divert from the chapter before us, the seventeenth chapter of Genesis is a most important one. It is a continuation of the fifteenth, and more than that, it increases or enlarges on that. We have here in chapter 17 a change of name in Abraham, and in Sarah too, so that clearly it is a new line of thought for us, but
{294}
then there is this matter of his age, and so on. Chapter 16, of course, cannot be ignored, because of its negative character, that is to say the readiness with which the flesh in us, whether we are believers or otherwise, for the flesh is in believers, is apt to have recourse to some method of reaching an end that is not according to God and that works ruin, which is what Abraham and Sarah did. It is to Abraham's credit, it should be said, that the suggestion came from Sarah, not from him.
H.H. What is the thought in the trouble in regard to Hagar? It brought in a lot of trouble, as we see from the references to Hagar in the New Testament.
J.T. It does. Wherever a sister makes a proposal of that kind you may be sure it does bring in trouble, and then it brings up the whole question of headship. Sarah failed in it clearly here.
P.H.H. @1 Corinthians 11 would make the matter of headship more extensive than just between husband and wife. Is it not introduced there in the creational order?
J.T. Very good. It is more extensive than what exists between husband and wife, because the head of the woman is the man. Clearly the apostle had in mind that a sister, even although she did not have a husband, had a head if a man were there, so the sisters never need to be regarded as headless in that sense. "The Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God". That is the order of the truth in creation.
A.M.H. I suppose Chloe had no head, but she knew where to refer, did she not? She writes to Paul.
J.T. She certainly did. She knew where to write to. How often it is that we hear of people writing here and there, especially sisters, and brothers too, to long distances whereas they could get their answers
{295}
nearby, especially when you have a brother like Paul, or anyone at all labouring with him who is available, a local man.
Rem. And her house, too, under right control, because her household was of one mind about what was going on, showing the feminine authority in the absence of a head.
J.T. Quite so, running very well with Aquila and Priscilla. Aquila did not have any great place in the service, but he was one who had a wife, and she could be recognised as having part in the service in relation to him, so they both worked together, and also in having Paul in their house.
H.H. Also "I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is minister of the assembly which is in Cenchrea", @Romans 16: 1.
J.T. Quite so.
C.C.C. Would the change of name in chapter 17 bear upon the developments in view?
J.T. It does, but we are reserving that for the next reading, which I hope will be a full one tomorrow, God willing. The thought is to run on to the end of the history of Abraham, that is to say to the end of chapter 24, bringing in Christ and the assembly. You feel it is a fitting thing if we are dealing with Abraham, to extend the thought to Rebecca, for she has her place in the testimony, and then Abraham disappears; he is not mentioned after that. In chapter 24 the servant's master is Isaac, which is a great matter for us to see in what we are dealing with now; the thought of what Christ and the assembly is, and how divine Persons can, as it were, merge Themselves in the truth They will unfold, and bring us into it. They are ready in a sense to take up attitudes or positions so as to enlarge on the truth, in order to bring it out. They are standing for it.
{296}
FAITH AND SPIRITUALITY AS SEEN IN ABRAHAM (3)
@Genesis 17: 1 - 27; @Genesis 18: 1 - 33
J.T. We were unable to complete the 17th chapter yesterday, so it is thought that we should take it up again today, and in connection with it chapter 18. Chapter 17 is very rich with thoughts which should engage us. We have first, God taking on the name of Almighty with Abraham, and then His changing his name from Abram which meant "high father" to Abraham, meaning "father of a multitude". God then made a covenant, and then the truth of circumcision was introduced, far reaching in its effect. Sarah also is brought into these changes; so that it is a question of learning to change, learning to take on change. We get it on God's side, and we get it on man's side; clearly the resurrection will mean an immense change taken on by each of us, but then there is also added to that the thought of, not only what was seen in the Lord during the forty days after He rose, but what He is now. That is to say, His body of glory, one of the most wonderful things to think of; not simply His body of resurrection, but His body of glory; that is to say, His glory as alluding to ascension, and, we may add as to chapter 18, some allusion to Deity in the three men that came to Abraham. Although two of them were angels, yet there is a suggestion of the Godhead in the three; much is added as to Abraham himself, and certain moral qualities that came out in him, in chapter 18. There is too, the great place that God takes as to judgment, the Judge of all the earth, which is another element that has been peculiarly before us of recent weeks; that is, the idea of God being Judge of all, and all that is opened up to us in the book of Revelation as to it,
{297}
so that added to the great positive thoughts of God we have in that book the thought of judgment in all its phases, including the great white throne, as it is called. So that it is a question of our being able to take on these thoughts and speak of them, each in its place, for we learn in part.
Ques. Would the term Almighty God be a fitting prelude to these great matters?
J.T. I think it would. We begin in @Genesis 1 with God, although there is that which in a sense is greater in @Genesis 2 where the name Jehovah is added to the thought of God. As we follow up the name Jehovah through the Scriptures, we see that it works out in what Jesus is, according to Matthew, which is something that enters into the assembly, and the truth related to it.
J.C-S. Is the title, Almighty God, drawn as it were from that feature that marks God?
J.T. Well, just so; it is a question of power. The thought of power is introduced at the outset, but now God is taking on a name. We have the very title God, which implies power, in a certain sense, in the early chapters, but God is taking on a name which conveys all that.
A.J.G. Peter in his second epistle says, "As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue". Does that enter into this?
J.T. Very good. I am glad we are able to bring Peter in, because his part in the dispensation is not to be overlooked, especially as he is able to contribute his estimate of Paul, saying, "Our beloved brother Paul", and thus showing that he regarded Paul's writings as Scripture. This shows that Peter was advancing in the truth, writing without personal feelings, which is a very important matter that we should always keep before us.
{298}
P.H.H. Paul brings in the term Almighty in @2 Corinthians 6, when it is a question of coming out and being separated from what is unsuitable. "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".
J.T. It is connected with the idea of promises, so that we should purify ourselves in the light of them.
Ques. "Perfecting holiness in God's fear", is that what was being accomplished in Abraham?
J.T. I think *accomplished* is the thought, because it is a question of development. We are proceeding here on the line of development, and it is a question of *higher and higher yet* in the truth. The service of God must be in keeping with what we get in the early chapters of Genesis, for it is introduced in that book, and is to proceed "higher and higher yet".
C.H.H. Does God's revelation of His name here as the Almighty link on with the change of Abraham's name, in relation to the great things that God has in the economy?
J.T. We shall see that. Abraham is the great father, the father of us all, indeed, as Paul is willing to say (@Romans 4: 16), showing how the Spirit of God deals with terms and names and dignities, how they can be used with discrimination and liberty; so that we are taught to be in liberty in dealing with divine things, to know how to speak of them with liberty and dignity, not losing anything, not using one thing to interfere with or damage another; and I believe that is what Peter has in mind in his epistle, in saying "But for this very reason also, using therewith all diligence, in your faith have also virtue, in virtue knowledge, in knowledge temperance, in temperance endurance, in endurance godliness, in godliness brotherly love, in brotherly love love". I think it will be agreed that the allusion made to Peter added to this will help us as to the
{299}
dispensation, and to see that he has part in the formation of the dispensation too, with all the other apostles.
P.L. So that in referring to the mount of transfiguration Peter uses feeling and worshipful expressions, which would perhaps fit in with your thought of suited selection of expressions that fit into any moment. He alludes to "*such* a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory", and then "the *holy* mountain".
J.T. "Such a voice". So that we are reminded of what enters into that particular section of Peter. It refers to the sonship of Christ. We might have expected it before, but we do not get it. It is important to keep that in mind, because the sonship of Christ has had a peculiar place in our own times, bearing on the whole of the truth, and Peter does not mention it really until he comes to that particular section, that is the first chapter of his second epistle.
A.J.G. Would that show that what there was in Peter's soul is brought forward at the right time to support and amplify Paul's teaching?
J.T. I was thinking of that. How beautifully it merges. It was Paul who preached the Son of God at the commencement of his ministry. Peter too has the light of Christ's sonship at the outset, but in his ministry it is not alluded to until you come to the second epistle.
J.C-S. Peter speaks of the "untaught and ill-established" as wresting the Scriptures. Would that be where perhaps one idea is exaggerated to the detriment of another thought in Scripture?
J.T. Just so.
P.L. "Holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit". Would that lit in?
J.T. Quite so. You can say more about that. Brethren who are accustomed to minister generally
{300}
ought to have something to bring out at such a time as this, something, we might say, constructive, bearing on the whole matter. We are in a time when the whole matter of the truth is being opened up. It is a question of each contributing to it.
Rem. Peter says, "If *any one* speak -- as oracles of God". I was thinking it came home to everyone who ministers; as undertaking it that should be their standard.
J.T. Yes, speaking as oracles of God. The psalmist says, to "inquire of him in his temple". We are now together in a place of inquiry; there is room for it; and for answers too, there are those who are able to answer, but there is to be inquiry; and if we can add an answer we do better than the question.
P.H.H. So what goes along with the pronouncement of the sonship of Christ is the prophetic word. "And we have the prophetic word made surer". Would that be another feature of the present time?
J.T. Very good. It is a word that has come into our vocabulary peculiarly during the past few years; that is, the prophetic ministry. God has helped us in it, too.
Rem. You are thinking of the development of the truth. The Lord has brought these things out in ministry, and the saints were able to respond to it.
J.T. I think so. I think that could be shown from the outset of the revival. Not the least and not the greatest is the truth of eternal life. The term was misused, in 1890, and it was said, 'Eternal life is the Person of the Son', which was a distortion of the truth. God has saved us from it, and the truth of eternal life is brought to its proper level, its proper relation in the whole scope of truth, and I hope we shall not overlook what a great place it has in the truth, and how things are mentioned, and it is for us to follow them up and be constructive in the use of
{301}
them, so that we may become profitable to each other. We may all speak one by one, as the word says, and the Spirit of God is with us, and if one has anything, there is the spirit of liberty. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".
Rem. So that you would expect at any given time there would be some emphasis laid on the truth, and it is well to be in the field that is being reaped.
J.T. I think it is; to keep the thing in line, so to say. It is said of the Spirit, "He shall guide you into *all* the truth", and the truth of eternal life is certainly a great and important part of it.
Ques. Is there spiritual alacrity with Abraham to take on the change that God indicated to him? I was thinking of what you said in regard to circumcision; in verses 23 and 26 of chapter 17 it refers to "the self-same day", showing that although it was a very serious matter he embraced it immediately.
J.T. That is, he acted in obedience, at once. An important matter had been introduced; that is, circumcision; and it had been introduced dispensationally, you might say. Abraham immediately uses it and applies it himself, which is very important; if you get the truth into your mind, apply it and you will become enlarged.
J.C-S. Is that taking on what we spoke of as change?
J.T. Well, that is the idea. Abraham is able to change over, to take on the truth, to become part of it, as it were, because the Bible is one whole. Although human instruments were used, the Spirit of God has formed it, and it is a constructive matter; it is the development of the truth.
A.E.D. Does the passage in Philippians bear on it, "that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more
{302}
excellent"? The overseers and ministers are addressed in that epistle.
J.T. Very good. I would say that. It is the peculiar place that the overseers and the ministers have, and the fact that Philippi had such a peculiar place in the unfolding of the dispensation. I am speaking now of "God's dispensation, which is in faith". Philippians has a peculiar place in it, and they were proceeding, proving the things that are more excellent.
P.H.H. Do we have to wait for Paul to get the full light and meaning of circumcision?
J.T. I think it is not given elsewhere so we had better get the good of it in his writings, and it is in the epistle to the Colossians; that is where we get the truth of circumcision.
P.H.H. I was thinking about the preliminary remark too, in the end of @Romans 2. "He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh; but he is a Jew who is so inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter".
J.T. You would notice that the word circumcision there refers just to the Jews; it is brought down to a concrete thought there, but it is not really a part of the truth of Romans.
C.F.I. You stated yesterday that the Lord intended to make the end of the dispensation spiritual. Is this matter of circumcision essential to it?
J.T. It is. It is a great Colossian thought; it is properly Colossian in its full bearing. It is not a Roman thought properly; Paul has written about circumcision and it is properly set out in his epistle to the Colossians; we do well to pay special attention to it, because we will only get the full thought of it from Paul.
Rem. So that whilst we get the doctrine in Colossians, we have the formal statement in Philippians.
{303}
"*We* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God".
J.T. Well, there we have the concrete thought; it is an example, certain ones are said to worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. He is giving an example of what the thing really means.
Ques. That is the result, do you think, of the Colossian doctrine being taken on?
J.T. Quite so.
J.C-S. So that this would involve a great change, and the saints took on the change, really filling out the idea of the pillar and base of the truth, and confirming it.
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of whether the idea is at all in our minds, this thought of circumcision. We are not to go so far as saying we are it, but have we got the thought of it at all? We have baptism in Romans and it would be in that book that I would look for the truth relating to baptism, but circumcision belongs to Colossians properly and it gives character to the epistle and in effect gives character to the whole of Christianity.
P.H.H. Would it be right to say, therefore, that we take all these thoughts back to Genesis in our minds now, when we read of circumcision?
J.T. That is the idea, exactly; that is the only way, as I understand it, whereby we can utilise Scripture properly for public readings, I mean the Old Testament. Generally people do not understand, therefore we have to stop and refer to the New Testament, because the New Testament is the answer to everything, only the Old Testament is typical and has its own meaning and own usefulness. Hence the word, "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable", and it is a profitable thing to look into the Old Testament, because of the use God makes of it Himself in a typical sense.
{304}
P.L. Circumcision in its bearing has in view the service of God, that God may have man pleasurable. Is that so?
J.T. I have heard you were giving quite a little about it lately, and I should like to hear more from you now, please. You will pardon me for asking for it; what was your thought about it?
P.L. Well, I was thinking of @Genesis 18, God having man pleasurably before Him, and the power Abraham had to detain divine Persons complacently. Would not circumcision involve that God must have man without all that he is in the flesh, must have him according to another order of man for His pleasure in view of His service?
J.T. Yes, quite so. That is how it is, in the putting off of the body of the flesh *in* the circumcision of the Christ, that is the idea of it.
C.F.I. Have we, in circumcision, first the putting off in Colossians, and then the positive feature in Philippians of moving in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Very good; the positive feature, but it requires the negative side of Colossians or you would not have it at all. It refers to the death of Christ, that is the truth, and we must look into the matter of the death of Christ, what it really means. It is not a mere thought to be used at a Bible reading like this, but rather something by which our spirits are to be affected; by the terribleness of the death of Christ in putting off the body of the flesh.
E.B. Would that be implied in the use of the word *covenant*, circumcision being the covenant, the death of Christ being such a basic matter?
J.T. Quite so. The covenant has a great place with Abraham. We have had one already, but now we are having others.
W.S.S. I was wondering whether the reference to circumcision in Joshua as a necessary basis for
{305}
eating the old corn of the land and moving into what was spiritual, would be helpful.
J.T. It would indeed. I have often used that myself in referring to the idea of circumcision, going to Joshua about it, not simply dealing with Colossians, but going to Joshua, because it was enforced, and the instrumentality of it was sharp knives made out of stone. It was a really difficult matter to make sharp knives out of stone, but they were made showing what difficulties there are, that when we are dealing with the truth at such a time as this how much is involved in it, how much has to be gone into about it, so as to get at the roots of it.
W.S.S. The impossibility of moving forward apart from it?
J.T. Just so.
D.J.M. "Put to death therefore", is that the working out of it practically?
J.T. Well, there it is, "Put to death therefore".
Ques. Would there be a certain dividing up of things in the Old Testament for us? Circumcision in relation to Abraham being in view of further divine communications; in the case of Moses to fit him for service, and in the case of Joshua to take the people into the enjoyment of the inheritance. Does that amplify the truth of Colossians in its bearing practically? Between the time Moses was commissioned and his meeting Aaron, God reminded him of circumcision.
J.T. Quite so, the matter had to be gone into. We are now dealing with realities, and if we look at circumcision we are looking at death in some sense as to the *reality* of it. Would you mind referring to the scripture?
Rem. @Exodus 4 verse 24 says, "And it came to pass on the way, in the inn, that Jehovah came upon him, and sought to slay him".
{306}
J.T. Now, think of that, the great servant Moses, and God sought to slay him! Why should that be, why should it even be written down? What have we to learn from it as in the service? Nearly all of us here are more or less in God's service and what do we learn by such a thing as that? The severity of God. We must not only think of the goodness of God but His severity, and that thought must come home to ourselves sometimes. It is not all grace. It is a question of God in His severity.
Rem. "Thou, thou art to be feared", said the psalmist, "and who can stand before thee when once thou art angry?" @@Psalm 76: 7.
J.T. Very good.
J.C-S. Speaking of the severity of God in relation to circumcision, have we ourselves to take up that idea and to deal with ourselves in severity?
J.T. That is the whole point in Colossians, "Put to death therefore" was a word to themselves. It is a question of ourselves.
P.H.H.. Is there some encouragement in the fact that Jehovah said to Joshua, "This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you"?
J.T. Just so. It is what God does. It is a great relief when God does something that you cannot do.
P.H.H. Does that set them free and set God free to go forward with them in all His thoughts?
J.T. Exactly, Then the man with the drawn sword, what about him? Would you be kind enough to refer to that? Where does he come in?
P.H.H. The end of @Joshua 5 reads: "And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him: Art thou for us, or for our enemies? And he said, No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come".
{307}
J.T. That is to say, Joshua was the partisan there. That is the point that one thought it would be well to bring up here. He was just a partisan in the light of all that precious truth. "Art thou for us, or for our enemies?". But the man with the drawn sword says, "As captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come". It is a question of God.
P.H.H. Does that mean, referring to Colossians, that not only is circumcision an established matter, but there has to be the putting to death and the putting *off*, definitely on our part?
J.T. That is just what I was thinking, and why that man with the drawn sword is there. That is in Colossians really for us, indeed in this room now for us, as to whether we are partisans in any way, locally or generally, as regards the truth. There is no such thing admissible in the service of God as partisanship.
A.J.G. Is the whole assembly what is really referred to as the army of Jehovah?
J.T. That is what I would say, perhaps you will enlarge on that.
A.J.G. I was thinking of what you said as to the danger of partisan outlook. True service has the whole assembly in view, has it not?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. And if you are setting out in the service, whether it be in America or Africa, what is in your mind is universality, the universality of the work of God. So that we are not in any whit taken up with any side or any nation or any set of circumstances, that would be partisan.
W.S.S. You would say that circumcision is absolutely necessary to that end. If there is partisanship, there is a lack of apprehension of the truth.
J.T. You see that in regard of the truth of the Lord's supper. We have the very thought of schism, introduced in Corinthians, for they were partaking
{308}
of the Lord's supper professedly and there were divisions and sects among them.
J.C-S. Is it important to note that the ministry of reconciliation is one of Paul's ministries? Without it the opening out of the truth which he has relative to the assembly would not really be reached in power.
J.T. That is the truth.
Ques. May I ask whether there is a further amplification of what we have already had when the man says, "No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I *now* come"?
J.T. Well, it is just that; he would say, I am now come, and I am ready for whatever it be. It is a matter of war, war with the flesh.
Ques. Does it mean that the man waited until certain things had happened before coming into that position?
J.T. Well, but *now* is stressed there. "Am I *now* come". He is not on partisan lines. He is in connection with the army of Jehovah and that is a very great army. You get it in Ezekiel, an army risen from the dead, really that is what God has in His mind.
D.J.M. Would holiness exclude partisanship? "Loose thy sandal from off thy foot: for the place whereon thou standest is holy".
J.T. Just so.
S.H.B. Why does the apostle in Philippians introduce the idea of seeing to things just before he brings in this matter of circumcision? "See to dogs, see to evil workmen, see to the concision. For *we* are the circumcision".
J.T. The concision is a thing particularly to notice, that is to say, the not going all the way with the truth, it is a half way measure. That is the idea of the concision, whereas circumcision is a whole
{309}
way measure. To go the whole length of the truth is what is required.
S.H.B. Is that in line with what you were drawing our attention to last night, that we take up the feature of putting all out?
J.T. Quite so. Putting all out.
R.H.C. Was David in the full gain of it as he approaches Goliath? "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?".
J.T. Just so. He is applying it to the Philistine, and later he will have to apply it to himself, and every one of us will have to apply it to himself, if he is to be anything permanently for God. @Psalm 51 shows how David applied it to himself.
J.C-S. Do you think it would apply particularly to those ministering, where they may have developed peculiarities in their ministry which may even militate against the presentation of the truth?
J.T. So that we are in the whole truth or we are nowhere. God has greatly blessed these meetings such as we are having but He has blessed them because those attending them have the whole truth in their minds, and that is what the Lord says as to the Comforter, "He shall guide you into *all* the truth". These meetings ought to have that in mind always.
W.S.S. I was thinking that the connection between circumcision (chapter 17), and the changes of the names seems very instructive, for if we are to take on this change to which you have drawn attention, circumcision must be accepted.
J.T. That is exactly what the chapter teaches and so Abraham goes fully into the thing. He has a new title, but he is not thinking of that, he is thinking of the application of the truth, that is the point, the application of the immediate truth, and he acts at once. "Abraham *took* Ishmael his son,
{310}
and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money -- every male among the people of Abraham's house -- and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that same day, as God had said to him". That is to say, he is obedient in the application of the truth, at once. It was a question of the present truth.
P.L. So in Philippians we read, "So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, ... work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you".
J.T. Very good.
G.A. Why is the numeral 13 introduced? You referred last night to the numeral 12. It says, "And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised". I was wondering why the Spirit of God sees fit to specify his age on this occasion. Are we to look for the teaching of the matter in such wise that the thing is applied to the mind of the youth growing up amongst us?
J.T. He is thirteen, it is a question of his age and what kind of a boy he was, as the truth developed later, which required that Sarah should use the word of Scripture and say, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son".
E.T. Is the severity of God in this matter indicated in verse 14?
J.T. Quite so, "And the uncircumcised male who hath not been circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his peoples". Think of that, that a boy should be cut off from his peoples, showing how severe God is in enforcing His truth. We are not to be slow about it, but to enforce it at once.
C.H.H. It says Abraham was ninety-nine years old, and Ishmael thirteen. I wondered whether these names being mentioned and their ages, conveyed
{311}
that, as the word of God came to them, the thing was done whatever the age.
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of the truth and the enforcement of it and we are speaking now of circumcision, and that it is to be enforced, and if I need to enforce it, begin at once, even if I have to make a stone knife, a difficult thing to use as the instrumentality, but it is to be done; I cannot afford to wait.
A.E.D. As to the suggestion in the second verse of a covenant "between me and thee", God and Abraham, is all this side of things a necessity in view of the development of that?
J.T. God comes down to His servant, to His child as we might say, because he is believing. It is believing Abraham we are dealing with, and it is a question in God's mind of "me and thee". It is very beautiful, I think, and how God would encourage us in unfolding things to us, even dignifying us, because it is that here, a matter of dignity conferred upon him, how God would have us take it on cheerfully and how He would show that He is with us in the thing. It is a matter to be cheerful about.
Ques. Do you get that, too, in verse 7, "to be a God to thee" and in verse 8, "I will be a God to them"? Is there abundant encouragement in the goodness of God over against His severity?
J.T. Just so. He will be a God to them.
P.H.H. I would like to ask about God going up from Abraham. "He left off talking with him; and God went up from Abraham" (verse 22).
J.T. It is something to be taken account of in the chapter. We have it later that God went away (chapter 18: 33), but now it is a question of going up; that is to say we arc touching heavenly ground in the idea of going up. We shall soon all have to do with that, joyfully, when the Lord comes. It will be a question of going up.
{312}
W.S.S. In the meantime, does what is suggested in the beginning and pretty well all through chapter 18, indicate that we may move intelligently in relation to divine Persons consequent upon this exercise?
J.T. Quite so, intelligently; that is a good word. Paul says, "I speak as to intelligent persons". The service of God requires intelligence, and the Lord's supper begins it, and we are addressed on the ground that we are intelligent; that is to say, we know what we are doing, and why we are doing it.
A.J.G. Do you mean that God's going up from Abraham was intended to give him the idea of spiritual elevation that he himself was to take on?
J.T. Yes; he went and dwelt at Beer-sheba (@Genesis 22: 19), but then it does not say that Isaac went to Beer-sheba. The suggestion is that he has gone up, too. That is really the suggestion in the truth of the scriptures as unfolded, because the idea of going up must enter into it. After Christ has died, He must go to heaven; that is what @John 20 means. He says, "I ascend to my Father".
P.H.H. In a foundational way does circumcision prepare us for the going up?
J.T. I would say that. Hence the great place Colossians has in the truth, because you have in @Colossians 2: 5, "joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ". All that must be founded on circumcision.
J.C-S. The apostle, after opening out the glories of Christ in Colossians speaks of his own distinctive place in completing the word of God, and brings in reconciliation between the two points.
J.T. Will you enlarge on that?
J.C-S. I was only thinking of the glories of Christ as presented in the chapter, and then how he brings in reconciliation as if to indicate that it must really be known in the soul before we can appreciate what he brings in under the term of completing the word
{313}
of God. Reconciliation involves the truth of circumcision; see @Colossians 1: 22 and 2: 11.
J.T. Well, let us examine what you say. What are the glories of Christ referred to?
J.C-S. He says in verse 14, "In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins; who is image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation; because by him were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities: all things have been created by him and for him. And he is before all, and all things subsist together by him. And he is the head of the body, the assembly".
J.T. I think that opens up much for us, especially as to the deity of Christ, which you do not get even in Ephesians, it is a Colossian thought. That is the first point, now the second is what?
J.C-S. It says in verse 24, "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly; of which I became minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given me towards you to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations". Reconciliation comes between the two.
J.T. Quite so, very good. I am sure we all agree with that. The epistle to the Colossians brings in the deity of Christ, and then that He is "head of the body, the assembly; who is the beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that he might have the first place in all things: for in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell". Marvellous thought. Then again we have it in verse 9 of chapter 2, "for in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". The earlier verse reads. "for in him all the fulness was pleased to dwell". The words "of the Godhead" are an interpolation, and not in the original. What
{314}
is stated is a question of the word *fulness*, the peculiar glory of Christ, the word *fulness* there. Whereas the idea of "bodily" in chapter 2 is bringing it within our reach.
J.C-S. I think you have said elsewhere that He is brought within our range in the second chapter.
J.T. Just so.
P.L. Would this circumcision involve the development of spiritual taste, the calf tender and good, and the sweet milk, and then delicacy of feeling?
J.T. Yes, you are referring to @Genesis 18. There is not time to go into that now, but it is something to think of, what Abraham did and how God was pleased to place Himself so that He could be within Abraham's reach. Because that is what has to be read into the passage in chapter 18. The three who visited Abraham took up a certain position so that they should be, you might say, available to him. It is said he "lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men standing near him". The word *standing* is said to mean *stationed themselves*; that is, they are not simply standing, but are taking up the position definitely and clearly to be available to Abraham.
{315}
FAITH AND SPIRITUALITY AS SEEN IN ABRAHAM (4)
@Genesis 21:1 - 34.
J.T. There was something in mind, as to reconciliation.
W.H.W. I was wondering if God speaking to Abraham was somewhat similar to our sitting under the ministry of reconciliation, bringing about the same results in us where it is accepted.
J.T. Well, that is a matter to be considered, because the section we are engaged with, that is, beginning with chapter 14, leads on methodically but surely, to the truth of reconciliation, in principle. I say in principle, because we have to await the New Testament for doctrine, only that all Scripture is inspired of God and is profitable for doctrine, Paul says to Timothy. My thought is that Abraham, in all that we read of him up till now in these chapters, speaks or acts in the light of grace, allusion being found to certain persons that are not exactly of the dispensation or in the spirit of it, such as Ishmael and others, but yet they are treated graciously, especially Ishmael. It is thought, therefore, that what we are engaged with should remind us of the spirit of reconciliation, which is brought out, not in the first letter to Corinth, but the second. The letters to Corinth have to do with the service of God, beginning with the Lord's supper, and chapter 5 in the second epistle contemplates the spirit or principle of reconciliation. The chapter now read will engage us with Abraham, and the spirit in which he is seen in this section expressed in the seven ewe-lambs which he gave to Abimelech, and as to which Abimelech enquired. It is said that "Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven
{316}
ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves? And he said, That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well. Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there they had sworn, both of them. And they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the captain of his host, and returned into the land of the Philistines. And Abraham planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God". I thought that this section would help the brethren as to what is before us, and what one trusts will engage us, please God; that is, the spirit that is proper to Christianity, the spirit of grace instead of the spirit of exaction and quarrel.
A.J.G. Would that spirit show itself in Abraham in his intercession for Sodom?
J.T. Well, I think that is good and opens up much, because we cannot ignore the section we have had to pass over for want of time and the place that Lot has in it. Lot being related to Abraham represents our brethren who stand in relation to us m some sense, though not exactly in fellowship, but in some relation to us, and so Lot has a remarkable place and he is treated of in the New Testament, especially by Peter, as a righteous man. We have already alluded to Peter as having part in the formation of the dispensation, as one of the apostles, of whom he is said to be first, and to the spirit and terms in which he refers to Paul himself, as "our beloved brother Paul". In saying this he also treats Paul's letters or writings as Scripture, and he alludes to what Paul had written to the Jewish brethren, Peter would co-ordinate the position in encouraging the Hebrew brethren at that time. It is thought that what is before us now will help in that spirit, in which we are to proceed with our meeting, and what we find with Abraham here, as to Hagar and
{317}
Ishmael and others that we have already alluded to, will help us as to the spirit of grace proper to Christianity.
Ques. Would you see the same spirit of grace in Elisha when the bands of the Syrians came against Israel, and were brought into Samaria? The king of Israel wanted to smite them, but Elisha said, "Set bread and water before them", and it says, "he prepared a great repast for them ... And the bands of Syria came no more", @2 Kings 6: 23.
J.T. Very good. "The bands", pointing to party feelings. They came no more. Now the beginning of our chapter speaks of Ishmael who is said to be a wild ass of a man, yet he is treated according to his relation to Abraham. This raises another point; that is, that although Ishmael's generations and Isaac's generations are given, Abraham's generations are not given in the book of Genesis; that is to say, he is above the point of generations or history or territory. He is a heavenly man, and that is what we are coming to.
P.H.H. Do you see this spirit of reconciliation in @John 8 where the Lord speaks to the woman, and at the end of the chapter says, "Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced"?
J.T. Very good; showing how Abraham is taken account of. "He looked for a city ... whose builder and maker is God", which is a phase that enters into our consideration at the present time, and so he rejoiced to see the Messiah's day; that is, Christ's day. The whole of that wonderful chapter has Christ in mind. It begins with grace, because to the woman who was taken in sin the Lord says, "Neither do I condemn thee". They wanted to condemn her. They brought her there to have her condemned, and probably slain, but the Lord refused to be the judge. He says, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin
{318}
no more". He does not entirely release her, He impliedly sets before her the thought of judgment if she would continue in sin. So we are in the presence of grace, dear brethren, I would say, in a peculiar way at this time, hoping that the Lord will be with us and enable us to reach a definite conclusion as to this particular matter of Abraham's spirit.
J.C-S. Is it the intention of God that this spirit should permeate every one of us?
J.T. That is exactly what I was thinking. The Lord in speaking of Abraham said that he rejoiced to see His day, but then He pointed out certain things that Abraham did not do, and it would be a word for us as to what we should not do, the negative side of things. The positive is to be specially stressed, but the negative is not to be overlooked: that is to say, we cannot say we are free from the law, because although we are not under it, yet the law has authority.
E.T. Does this spirit of grace link with the insistence upon the truth? I was thinking of @Genesis 21: 10, "Cast out this handmaid and her son". It comes into the setting out of the truth in Galatians.
J.T. Well, we have already alluded to the grace shown to Ishmael in that Jehovah said to Abraham, recognising his relation to him, that He would bless him and so on, and that he should beget twelve princes. All that is in favour of Abraham, but at the same time the word comes to him through Sarah, "Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son -- with Isaac". So there is the casting out; it is enjoined by Sarah, however.
Ques. Did Abraham have to do violence to nature?
J.T. Quite so.
{319}
A.M. Would that be on the line of the directions the Lord gives in the gospels as to cutting off the hand and the foot, and the eye being plucked out?
J.T. Well, it would be if it is applied to each individual of us, but then if it is applied to one's attitude towards another, that is another thing.
Rem. In the first hearkening to Sarah there was no divine intervention to prevent it, but the Lord takes the initiative here, and tells Abraham that he *must* hearken to Sarah. The truth is at stake, and the Lord takes the initiative to see that it goes through.
J.T. Quite so. Hearkening to the voice of his wife. His wife had a voice; that is to say, she has a place, but then Abraham has too, and therefore the question of the place of the wife in relation to the husband comes up, and in this case it requires the divine intervention because it is not that Jehovah told him directly he must do it, but "In all that Sarah hath said to thee hearken to her voice". We know the New Testament quotes this very passage as Scripture, just as Peter refers to Paul's writing as Scripture.
F.J.B. Did Sarah rise to a type of the assembly in reference to the casting out of Ishmael and the bringing in of Isaac?
J.T. She rises to a type of a speaker of Scripture, an inspired person, which is more than the assembly in that sense. Her voice is inspired. If we look at the epistle to the Galatians we shall see that. What she says is recognised as Scripture, and, of course, the voice of the assembly is not exactly Scripture. It may be, but Sarah's voice in this matter is definitely referred to as Scripture.
A.J.G. Is it like the Spirit maintaining the truth authoritatively?
J.T. Just so. You are enjoined in grace to do it, but you *must* do it. We must hearken to the voice
{320}
of Scripture; that is more than any care meeting or any brothers¬ meeting-the voice of Scripture.
Ques. Is that more than oracular speaking, as referred to in Peter -- speaking as the oracles of God?
J.T. Well, yes. The oracles of God are in themselves authoritative but they are not said to be Scripture, although in @Romans 3 it is said that much belonged to Israel, because they had the oracles of God, and the allusion there is to the Scriptures, of course.
C.F.I. Would this spirit of grace that marked Abraham be the result of his own knowledge of God, the way God had come in on the line of supply, bringing in Isaac?
J.T. I would say that. All that enters into it, but the place that Sarah has is remarkable.
H.H. Would what the Lord said in relation to praying to His Father for twelve legions of angels bear on what is being considered? "How then should the scriptures be fulfilled?" (@Matthew 26: 54) the Lord said, recognising the necessity for the fulfilling of Scripture.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord even put things on that basis.
J.P. Is Abraham's spirituality tested here? I was thinking of what the apostle Paul says in Corinthians, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment". @1 Corinthians 14: 37.
J.T. That is good. That is an important point, bringing out the value of the epistles to Corinth, because they are in mind in what is said; they are not simply the commandments but the commandment of the Lord, one idea, and, of course, that gives more point than merely the plural. It is one idea in those two epistles.
{321}
E.B. Would it be profitable to ask about the laughter of Sarah in this chapter, as over against her previous lack of faith, when she denied having treated the matter as an impossibility?
J.T. Well, it was lack of faith as you say, but then that is to be taken by itself. If she is treated in the passage we are dealing with as a scriptural authority so far, well, this has to be regarded by itself in all its force, because it is quoted as such in the New Testament, as Scripture; and therefore we are to pay attention to every Scripture.
P.H.H. Are you implying in all you are saying that the way that God acted in supplying the well for Hagar is to give us an incentive in this great matter of grace?
J.T. Quite so, and the place that Beer-lahai-roi has in Scripture, in this very section. It was firstly the well that Hagar drank out of (@Genesis 16: 14), showing that God's grace towards Israel had to be recognised at first as it was. The apostles came back to Jerusalem, we are told, from Bethany, and were in the temple praising and blessing God; that is to say, they were still in that spirit, the spirit of what we are dealing with.
P.H.H. Are we then to distinguish between what Hagar and her son mean spiritually, and what our brethren may be to us, whom we are to treat graciously?
J.T. I think that is good. All these references that are before us now are intended to soften our spirits towards our brethren wherever or whoever they may be if they have a righteous claim to be regarded as ours.
P.H.H. The spirit of divine commandment would still come in, would it, because God tells her, or at least the Angel does, "Arise, take the lad, and hold him in thy hand"? There must be the spirit of subjection.
{322}
J.T. Just so, and as to our brethren with whom we would walk if we could, they must come to this, that "the things that I write to you"; that is to ay, Paul's writings, as Peter testifies to, are "the Lord's commandment". I mean the particular ones that treat of the government of the assembly and the services entering into it, but beginning with the Lord's supper. We must insist on the truth that governs the Lord's supper, and that truth comes from Paul. "The things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment".
J.C-S. Actually in Christendom Paul's writings are belittled perhaps more than any of the writers of Scripture.
J.T. It is very noticeable, especially as to women. They are allowed to speak, whereas they are commanded not to speak in the assembly. Women are put up here and there as witnesses and ministers of God, whereas it is contrary to the commandment of the Lord through Paul.
Ques. May I ask what the difference in aspect is between what we are considering in regard to Ishmael and what Abraham had previously said, "Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!" chapter 17: 18. Has the intervention of circumcision anything to do with the difference?
J.T. Well, let us look at the passage, what ground does God put it on? "God said, Sarah thy wife shall indeed bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him, for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. And for Ishmael I have heard thee: behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will very greatly multiply him; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year. And he left off talking with him;
{323}
and God went up from Abraham", @Genesis 17: 18 - 22. Now the connection is that Abraham's desire for his son is based on Abraham himself, not exactly as circumcised, or that even Ishmael was circumcised, but that he was Abraham's son, as he says. "Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!" Then there is an allusion to Abraham being his father.
A.J.G. That is in chapter 21: 13. "But also the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed".
J.T. I had in my mind to add to what has been said, that the basis in God's mind of anything being done for Ishmael is because of his relationship to Abraham, his sonship to Abraham, and as I was saying, he has a place in administration in a certain sense, because he begets twelve princes and his generations are mentioned among the other generations, of which there are about ten in the book of Genesis, but Abraham's generations are *not* mentioned, and that is just to show the place he has relatively in regard to all else in the book of Genesis, that is to say, he is the heavenly man, therefore he is our father, the father of *us* all.
A.J.G. Have you in mind, then, that Ishmael would stand for certain ones who are of faith, but are not pursuing, you might say, God's heavenly thoughts? They have a certain place, but the mind of God is that we should be set for the full thought of sonship and what is heavenly.
J.T. I think so. In all our dealings with them we have nothing less than that in mind. There is a remarkable passage in the epistle to the Romans, and amongst the things mentioned that belong to Israel is sonship, it pertains to Israel; "the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants". The adoption pertains to Israel, that is to say sonship, so that we have nothing less in view for our brethren if we are certain that they are our brethren. They may,
{324}
indeed, have that knowledge, that the highest thought, that is, sonship is for them.
W.S.S. "Sarah said, God has made me laugh: all that hear will laugh with me". Is there a suggestion in that of the subjective side of the truth in Sarah, sonship being entered into joyfully?
J.T. She calls Isaac "my son" saying of Ishmael, he "shall not inherit with my son". I think that is good. There would be the voice of the assembly in that, I would think.
W.S.S. That is what I was wondering, whether we are, so to speak, coming into the light of that, and whether it is a joyful position.
J.T. It *is* a joyful position, because his name means laughter.
C.F.I. Does the reference to "all that hear will laugh with me" indicate the coming in of Isaac, and the word of it going round would induce that laughter in others? Would that be in a way the spirit of grace in our approach to our brethren?
J.T. Quite so. It is holy. The question is to maintain holiness in all such emotions.
S.H.B. Does the allusion to grace in @Colossians 4 help in this matter? "Let your word be always with grace, seasoned with salt, so as to know how ye ought to answer each one".
J.T. Very good. "Seasoned with salt", and so elsewhere, "Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another", @Mark 9: 50.
S.H.B. Would the salt answer to what you have been suggesting in stressing the need of obedience to the commandment?
J.T. Quite so.
W.H.W. Does it help to see, that if in seeking to carry out God's commandments, we have sometimes to act severely, God comes in then, bringing in the spirit of grace, as Hagar is so cared for from heaven?
{325}
J.T. Quite so. Cared for from heaven.
A.J.G. Does verse 12 help us? "Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad".
J.T. Well, God is graciously helping Abraham, and of course, what we were saying about Bethany and Jerusalem, that is to say the disciples coming back to Jerusalem, and then in the temple blessing and praising God, would be to make way for Ishmael or for like persons who are in relation with us, because the greatest things belong to them, we have nothing less in mind for them. We have the greatest things, and we want to share them with all our brethren.
J.C-S. So that it is stated, "Because he is thy seed" -- would that link up with John's epistle somewhat? There are those who like Ishmael may be regarded as true believers and we would identify ourselves with them as having a point of affinity with them as the seed in that way.
J.T. Quite so.
A.J.G. I was wondering whether there was a suggestion in the scripture that the lack with Ishmael was in failing to appreciate the well, because God opens Hagar's eyes and shows her a well, but she seems content just to fill a flask of water from it; whereas Abraham goes and dwells by the well, and in fact digs it.
J.T. Showing that whilst the Spirit of God was necessarily connected with the Jews, that is to say with Israel, from the very outset, although He is not very formally stressed in the Angel that was to lead Israel into the land, yet the Spirit was there, "My Spirit", we are told, remains "among you", @Haggai 2: 5. So it was connected with Israel, but then when we come to the truth of the Spirit, it is taken up in a more definite way in chapter 24 in connection with Beer-lahai-roi, where Isaac is seen as
{326}
Rebecca comes to him. All that is most precious as to the truth, because the Lord has the Spirit in mind in view of Rebecca, that is to say, in view of ourselves; in view of the assembly. He would say to us, What can be done without the Spirit? That is a question that each one of us ought to ask.
Rem. We see a certain tenderness in Abraham, that whilst he was going all the way and doing what Sarah said, casting out the handmaid and her son, yet he took bread and a flask of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. There is a suggestion of tenderness, not ruthlessness, in dealing with the situation.
J.T. Quite so. He took bread and a flask of water. We have already had bread and wine, but here it is bread and water. He gave it to Hagar, putting it upon her shoulder. I think what you say is important.
Rem. I thought it would amplify what you are drawing our attention to, the need of the maintenance of a right spirit towards those with whom we cannot walk.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Is that seen too in the Lord when the Samaritans would not receive Him and James and John wanted to call down fire from heaven, but the Lord rebuked them and said, "Ye know not of what spirit ye are".
J.T. Very good.
D.J.M. Is it the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ?
J.T. A good quotation.
A.M. Would the flask represent limitations placed on the Spirit; something like the pool of Bethesda in @John 5 -- a kind of static idea as distinct from what is living?
J.T. Quite so.
{327}
C.H.H. Would God's calling attention to the well indicate the grace that is there, and the possibilities that are available?
J.T. I think so, especially after the Lord had gone up into heaven from Bethany. He had gone up to heaven having blessed the brethren, and then they came back to Jerusalem and were in the temple praising and blessing God; it was a testimony in grace to Jerusalem that the Spirit would be in the mind of God for them.
C.H.H. Abraham was really in the spirit of that in bringing the seven ewe lambs. Seven is the complete idea, and he was thoroughly in the spirit of grace.
J.T. And then the ultimate result in what comes out in the end of the chapter, that is to say, Beer-sheba. He "called there on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God". It is one of the most beautiful passages that you can think of.
Ques. May I get more clearly what Abimelech represents today?
J.T. He is also seen earlier, but now he comes back to Abraham. "And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech, and Phichol the captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest. And now swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal deceitfully with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson. According to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou sojournest. And Abraham said, I will swear". That is to say, Abraham is on firm ground with the Philistine king, but then he would go beyond the mere position of righteousness with the king; he would go further. And so it says here that "Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech", and so forth. And then it says, "And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. And Abimelech
{328}
said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves? And he said, That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well". That is to say, Abraham is presenting himself to the king of the Philistines in this way, that he is in a gracious attitude, and would have Abimelech to be in that attitude too, in a right spirit in so far as he could be. But then Phichol is there, the captain, which is another thought added to the relations of Abraham with the Philistine king; as a captain he has a military spirit. Abraham is to take notice of that, and we are to take notice of it too, and yet in spite of that military threat we are to maintain the right spirit as suggested in the seven ewe-lambs.
C.H.H. Is the idea to meet the opposition in the spirit of grace?
J.T. That *is* the idea.
Ques. Does that bear on the threat by trade unionism which we have had before us?
J.T. That might be included because in these countries where God is working in such a remarkable way, the spirit of trade unionism seems to have greater place than anywhere, and the question is why should it be so? Have the brethren maintained a prayerful attitude before God as to this remarkable condition that has arisen in this part of the world? There is more tolerance of trade unionism here, as far as I can see, than anywhere, even in America. I am not saying it is amongst the brethren, but the brethren are apt to be affected by it.
A.J.G. Is there any connection between the spirit of Christ shown by Abraham in the seven ewe-lambs, and the moral power he had to reprove Abimelech?
J.T. That is a very good point, that there is moral power instead of actual military power; and,
{329}
of course, *that* moral power belongs to those who have the Spirit of God. It is not in any ecclesiastical relation or assumption; it is a question of the Spirit of God. If you look for moral power it must be by the Spirit of God.
J.C-S. So the spirit of it would be the meekness and gentleness of Christ.
J.T. That is the full thought of it.
P.L. "In meekness setting right those who oppose". Would Abraham planting the tamarisk link on with the thought of the meek inheriting the earth? Does he take possession of the earth in testimony?
J.T. I would rather connect all that with Matthew. Matthew is the gospel book, and the Lord there says, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart". That is where we see the full thought. The assembly ought to be equal to that, because the point in Matthew is to bring the assembly to the full thought.
R.G.C. Does Paul emphasise this matter of grace in the conclusion of most of his epistles, both to assemblies and individuals? His last word generally at the end of his epistles is, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit", and so on.
J.T. Quite so. I think Matthew must have prime place in what we are saying; not simply in the reflection of Christ in the brethren, in their spirits and that, but as to what the Lord Himself is. We have come back to that or we have not come back to anything. We have come back in principle, I believe, in the revival, to Christ, but not simply to Christ but to Christ and the assembly. It began in the Reformation. I believe the Spirit of God had in mind to bring in Christ, and He *did* bring in Christ; but the Spirit had more in mind in the revival;
{330}
that is, to bring in Christ *and* the assembly, and that is Matthew.
C.C.C. Is there some connection with the thought of the seven ewe-lambs in the answer in Isaiah to the Assyrian assumption: "The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn", @Isaiah 37: 22?
J.T. Just so. The question is whether the Assyrian was to be met that way, whether it is a military or international matter, because the international idea cannot be ignored. We have to deal with it. The question I am raising is where the virgin daughter stands, what she is, how she copes with the Assyrian. We have to face all that, but we can hardly take it up now. It is only a question of touching things in a meeting like this, and seeing the bearing of them.
C.F.I. Abraham refers to having dug this well. Is that important?
J.T. If we wish to assert that we have the truth of the Spirit, good and well, but we want to show that we have the Spirit. It is no question of saying, that I have been sealed, that I am a believer. We have to show that we are spiritual. If we make any claim as here, to having dug the well, we want to show that we are spiritual.
E.B. Would it be right to ask in that connection whether Abraham has shone in his intercessory way in regard to Sodom, and then has shone in his consideration for Hagar, and now he is shining in relation to the authorities?
J.T. I would think that, and would add what is said of him in chapter 18: 33, "And Jehovah went away when he had ended speaking to Abraham". That is what I was alluding to a moment ago; God is dealing with the nations, and we cannot ignore the international position, but we count on God in relation to it. He has to do with it, and we have
{331}
to do with it, and how are we to do it? It is not God going up here, but God going away, as having to do with Sodom, and that entered into Lot's position. I wonder if the brethren are all following what I am endeavouring to say. It is not God going up, but God going away as having ended speaking to Abraham. And then it says that Abraham "returned to his place". What is that? It is not a question of heaven, but what is on the level of the earth here. And God is acting on that level too.
P.H.H. Does that mean that God is going on to judgment, but meanwhile we are left here?
J.T. Good. We have to wait and see. It really corresponds with the book of Revelation.
A.E.D. Is it exemplified too in the teaching of grace in Titus? "We should live soberly, and justly, and piously in the present course of things, awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ".
J.T. Quite so, there is the level on which God is acting and on which Abraham is acting. There is no idea of going up. It is the international position, because that has already come in in Abraham's intercession for Sodom.
C.C.C. You suggest that the book of Revelation will help us as to God dealing with all the nations of the earth, the whole position.
J.T. That is the idea.
P.H.H. Meanwhile, are we to be here with a good testimony?
J.T. Our position is clear, and God's position is clear. God goes away. Well, what may not be in that? May it not be some military intervention, because the Lord is seen in Revelation as the King of kings and Lord of lords; He is the One who will deal with everything in that sense.
A.C.S.P. Would it be the thought at the end of Matthew in the reference to the Lord having all
{332}
power, and then the reference to all the nations, and the Lord with us all the days?
J.T. That is good. Matthew was in my mind, for in that gospel the Lord is never said to go up to heaven.
P.H.H. Do you mean that we may be left here, and God arranging things so that we can be left here safely for a while?
J.T. Quite so. It is what God is mercifully doing. He is merciful, not willing that anyone should perish. He went away, but then He is not withdrawing His hand; His hand is over everything. The Father is over all, and through all, and in us all. He has the supreme place everywhere.
P.L. And does this book of Revelation link on with "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing"?
J.T. Very good. The book of Revelation really links on with @Mark 13. The Lord speaks of things and says, "But of that day or of that hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father". And then He says, "But what I say to you, I say to all, Watch". That, I think, is what will come out in the book of Revelation; it is a revelation that God gave to Christ, something God conferred as it were, on Christ. It is the word Apocalypse. It is a revelation, and He signified it to His servants by His bondman John. The Lord took it on and took up John. We were already speaking about John. He has a certain work to do, but it is always left open. He has no ministry in a formal way like Paul, but he has a place in the book of Revelation, which largely relates to judgment, you might say.
P.H.H. Do the closing verses of chapter 21 suggest a little what may occupy us while we are waiting? Abraham planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba "and called there on the name of Jehovah, the
{333}
Eternal God". Is there a suggestion there of our going on with the service while we are sojourning?
J.T. Just so. It shows the liberty Abraham has, and how easy his circumstances are now. Our circumstances in a way are easy; that is, God has made them so for us. So that we can carry on as we are today, for instance. And so Abraham's circumstances are easy, if you will pardon my using the word. It is a question now of going down to Beer-sheba and calling on the Eternal God, and he can say to Abimelech, 'I am ready to make a covenant with you. I am rich enough to do it, I have means enough to do it, I am in easy circumstances'. I trust the brethren will understand the use of the word easy. The Spirit of God makes it easy for us, so that we can take up this attitude of grace towards men.
C.H.H. Does the last verse imply the effect of the operations of grace, Abraham sojourned in the Philistines¬ land many days? He would be there in the moral superiority of grace in an adverse scene.
J.T. But look at the God he has, the "Eternal God"! That is what I am looking at, the Eternal God.
Ques. Whilst we have to take full account of the serious position in the world at the present time, it is never to become overwhelming to our spirits?
J.T. Quite so. We are in easy circumstances generally, but then we are to use them for the gospel. The gospel is not to be allowed to go, to be left, and so I think the brethren ought to take to heart the need for public testimony to the gospel in these countries. The preaching of the gospel *publicly* is not practised as far as I know.
J.C-S. I am afraid it has been discounted somewhat, and then the plea is made that there is no interest, that men do not listen.
J.T. It is a poor plea, and it will not hold in heaven. What are we going to do with these easy
{334}
circumstances? What are we going to do with the time we have? We are well occupied today, but then what about the preaching of the gospel? What about the sufferings attached to it, as Paul says in the epistle to the Colossians, "I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly"?
P.L. "Woe is unto me, if I preach not".
J.T. That is what Paul says of himself.
P.L. Jeremiah said the fire was in his bones, (@Jeremiah 20: 9).
J.C-S. You are suggesting that the easy circumstances should really provide what you might call contributory circumstances for the preaching of the gospel, and going on to the service of "the Eternal God"?
J.T. Just so, because what can be more assuring and more certain than that we are in the presence of the Eternal God, and we are related to Him intelligently and according to His mind.
{335}
FAITH AND SPIRITUALITY AS SEEN IN ABRAHAM (5)
@Genesis 22: 1 - 24
J.T. We have before us a section of Scripture almost unequalled, for the affections involved and the circumstances generally are all intended to bring out divine love in its family relations, because love is of God, and everyone that loves has been begotten of God and knows God. The section before us deals not only with God peculiarly, but with God in relation to a family, Abraham being selected, foreknown indeed of God, to fill out this wonderful section, which I believe the Spirit of God intends to use to impress us at this time. This chapter, of course, is the very heart of our subject, that is to say the offering up of Isaac and the conversation between Abraham and his son, and then God's comment on it all.
Ques. Would the beautiful spirit of grace in Abraham seen in the previous chapter, provide God with a moral basis for taking Abraham on?
J.T. I would say that. He is, as it were, equal to the occasion, because the idea of personality must come into view, and in no section of typical Scripture do we find an equal, as far as I know, in the facts presented to us here, an equal as to family affections involving personal relations with God and with men. So that Abraham qualifies, I would say, and if God were regarded as making a selection, Abraham is fully qualified, and the events immediately preceding only augment the qualification; that is to say, what we have in chapter 21, the spirit brought out in the presence of the Philistine king. It is here that the Psalms refer to the people of God in their weakness and how they were taken account of by God, and how they were viewed at this early date even as prophets, and they were not to be
{336}
harmed, they were being watched over, a word that would certainly appeal to us at the present time, "Do my prophets no harm".
P.H.H. Are you referring to @Psalm 105?
J.T. Yes, I am referring also to the whole section really, which is illumined by the wonderful appearance, I may say, of Melchisedec, the light of whom shines throughout Scripture, speaking especially of the priestly grace of Christ, for He is said to be a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
H.H. That is the first time that priesthood is mentioned, is it not? It is the first time a word is used that governs the situation. The priesthood of Melchisedec is not an Aaronic priesthood, but a permanent idea?
J.T. Quite so, another priest arising not after the order of Aaron.
Ques. The reference to the burnt offering here, would that be a continuation of the idea?
J.T. Just so, it is fitting. Isaac says, "Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the sheep for a burnt offering?" That is, Isaac had the right thought, and Abraham's reply is, "My son, God will provide himself with the sheep for a burnt offering. And they went both of them together". The word is *sheep* as the brethren will notice. It is not a youthful thought, it is a mature thought that is in mind. But they went both of them together.
Ques. May I ask you to amplify a little what you had in mind in emphasising, Melchisedec as being necessary, his service enabling all this matter to continue? Have you in mind the heavenly side of the priesthood?
J.T. He is introduced abruptly, but his very greatness swallows up the abruptness. The mind is at once seized by the greatness of the occasion and the personalities involved in it, for God would draw us at such a time as the present into His own
{337}
thoughts, although they may be abrupt at times, yet their very greatness absorbs the abruptness. It is a question of the greatness of things. It is a question of God, divine Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and that is what we are baptised to, so that Christianity involves all this.
Ques. When Paul in Hebrews was entering on the section in which he was to speak of Melchisedec, he says, "Let us go on to what belongs to full growth". Would that link on with what you have lust said as to maturity in the sheep?
J.T. Quite so, and let us go on to it. Evidently the Hebrew Christians were drawing back, and he is urging them forward.
P.H.H. What is the meaning of "assimilated to the Son of God" in @Hebrews 7? Melchisedec "having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually".
J.T. It is a fact I would say; the facts stated involve the assimilation. The thought of the Son of God is brought in to the mind at once.
P.H.H. Does that mean that the Son of God is the Person who is in mind, and Melchisedec is to suggest Him as he comes forward early in the Scriptures?
J.T. Quite so, but to suggest Him as already existent. The Son of God according to John's gospel is existent. "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". He is in the bosom of the Father; that is whence the declaration comes. It is a question of the Son of God, but the only-begotten Son of God.
Ques. Do you mean that whilst sonship involves Christ's manhood, what is said about Melchisedec involves also His deity?
{338}
J.T. It does indeed. Both sonship and Deity are asserted and verified in John's gospel. It is said, "In the beginning was the Word". Infinitude can be put into that, "In the beginning was the Word", not is but was. "And the Word was with God, and the Word was God". He was with God, but then He was God, so that we are left in no doubt as to what is in mind. The expression, the Word, refers to Christ as known here in sonship.
J.C-S. John tracing Him back as he sees Him here would identify Him in this way as God. That is, the Word was as he saw Him here in time.
J.T. That is what is in mind in the gospel of John. "In the beginning was the Word", but then "the Word was with God, and the Word was God".
P.H.H. I suppose that lays a great foundation in our minds for all that follows upon the introduction of Melchisedec, leading up to these great relationships involving the Father and the Son. Is that so?
J.T. I think so, and it is what is before us now. The intent is to affect us, to enlarge us inwardly; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, that is the place that Christ *has*. Not who was in the bosom of the Father, but who is in the bosom of the Father, and *He* hath declared Him.
C.A.I. "Take now thy son, thine only son", that touches on the great matter of the affections involved.
J.T. Quite so, because what precedes is that God tried or tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham!" It is the supreme test of love but love in this particular setting.
A.J.G. Does the fact that this is the first mention of love in Scripture, "thine only son, whom thou lovest" indicate that it is the prime thought of love that God would present to us, the love of the Father for the only-begotten Son?
{339}
J.T. I am glad you mention that. It is good to get the first mention of a thing like this. We have all read in @Genesis 15, the first mention of the *word*, and now as you say, this is the first mention of love, and that is very important to have before us. According to the scripture in Exodus the Hebrew servant plainly says "I love". Here is a statement of fact that Abraham loved Isaac, "thine only son, whom thou lovest". God says this to Abraham. It is a question of love in activity, not love in an abstract or static way, but in activity. And so in Exodus it is again love in activity, "I love my master, my wife, and my children".
A.J.G. Do we get a double thought of love in this chapter, the love of complacent affection in the father for the son, and then the love seen in supreme sacrifice?
J.T. Just so, the love seen in supreme sacrifice, that is what it is.
Ques. Would the verse in @Romans 8 refer to this? "He that spared not his own Son"?
J.T. "His own Son", just so; He that spared not. That is a sacrifice, a supreme sacrifice.
J.C-S. Would the two thoughts be included here, "The Father loves the Son" in @John 3 and then in @John 10, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again"?
J.T. Yes.
P.H.H. Would you be free to say a word about the verse in @John 17 where the Lord says, "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them"? Would that be typically brought before us in this chapter?
J.T. Quite so, and then "I in them", that is to say, He has a place, and He would be loved in a certain place, that is in them, which opens up the
{340}
idea of His service to God in the midst of the assembly. That is where He would be.
J.W.H. Is it intended that as we view this love in complacency as seen in the Father and the Son we might be affected by it in the service?
J.T. Just so, to be in love, but love in activity.
Ques. Is there any connection between the thought of the Eternal God in the end of the previous chapter and the love that is now coming into expression? I was thinking of the passage in @John 17 -- "my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". Did what is spoken of as complacent love have its existence in eternity, but it has now come into expression in a tangible form in relation to Christ in manhood?
J.T. We are dealing with a most profound typical section, and @John 17 is the most profound apostolic section. It is the very heart of things, and of course it opens up something for us to think of, and the Lord would give us grace to think aright and to speak aright, so as to help one another, because in what we are saying it is a question of our being able to say it in love, and thus there is a situation created in which love is active. I believe that is what John's gospel implies -- the activity of love.
J.C-S. So that love becomes our measure in the matter?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. It says that Abraham rose early in the morning to give effect to this. Do you think that that would be delightful to God? He was ready to give immediate effect to this great thought of sacrifice in love.
J.T. "The morning" affords much in an operational sense that you do not find later in the day. Hence it is the time for doing things and reaching ends, especially in these readings that we have. The morning meetings usually are the best as far as
{341}
I remember, because it is the freshness of the day, and the freshness of ourselves too, the vigour that God may give us, the spiritual vigour of course, to deal with His things.
Rem. So that God says to Moses, "Be ready for the morning", @Exodus 34: 2.
J.T. Quite so. Now tell us more of what you had in mind as to @John 17.
Rem. I was only enquiring as to @John 17: 24, "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". My inquiry was whether the love before the foundation of the world touched what was otherwise inscrutable, the relations of love in eternity, and yet evidently centring now in Christ as Man, for the glory is given to Him, involving His manhood. I was wondering whether the Eternal God in that sense has become known to us in the love of the Father for the Son.
J.T. Just so. In considering the subject we might look at verse 5, "And now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". He is speaking as Man here, but He is speaking to His Father on personal grounds and desires to be reinstated, as it is said, "And now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". He is speaking to His Father as Man here, but He is referring to the past and asking to be glorified now in manhood along with His Father with the glory which He had along with Him before the world was.
C.C.C. Are we entitled in that way to carry over into this chapter the impression of @Genesis 18 as to Deity in the three Persons who stood near Abraham?
{342}
J.T. We alluded to that yesterday, and one would not speak of it except in a fluid way, that is to say, not to make it a prime thought exactly, but there are the three seen together thus, that is God Himself and the two angels, for we see later that they were angels, though they are not viewed thus in @Genesis 18. The word is, "Jehovah appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre. And he sat at the tent-door in the heat of the day. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men standing near him". We just touched on that yesterday, seeing too that the word "standing" means that they had stationed themselves there, they took up the position deliberately so as to be available, to be near. They were standing near. It is clearly that there might be opportunity for Abraham to move in such light and in such company and in such distinction as were afforded to him by the presence of the three persons alluded to.
Ques. Would it be wrong to use the word *assimilation*, and say that these three men, might, in our minds, be regarded as assimilated to the thought of divine Persons?
J.T. I doubt if we should go so far as that; it is a question of Godhead. The word *assimilated* is a New Testament word, used in saying that Melchisedec was assimilated to the Son of God. I speak of @Genesis 18, as I said, in a fluid way, not to stress it unduly, but to have the thought in our minds, because God does teach us in this way, sometimes in a shallow or light sense, and then at other times in a deep sense -- the depths of God. I mean to say we have to choose our words if we are to be careful, and to say that these three are assimilated to the Deity is going too far.
Ques. Do you think that what David prays for Solomon might enter into what we are now saying? He speaks of "the imagination of the thoughts of
{343}
the heart of thy people", @1 Chronicles 29: 18. Do you think that would enable us to grasp the divine thought that has been suggested to us without taking it too far? To lay hold of the tangibility of the suggestion without trying to work it out completely?
J.T. Well, quite so. David is a suitable person to bring forward. "Thou art that God", he says, @1 Chronicles 17: 26.
A.E.D. Is the relationship brought into peculiar prominence in the seventh verse of this chapter in the words, "My father", and then he said, "Here am I, my son", before the question is raised by Isaac? Does this link on with what you were saying as to @John 17?
J.T. Think of the infinite depths involved in @John 17: 5! Firstly He had said, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it" and now He adds, "and now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". We are in the very depths of God, you might say, because that is an expression that is used by Paul, "the depths of God".
P.H.H. Are the Persons emphasised so closely together, "Now glorify *me, thou* Father"?
J.T. Yes, it is a question of the intimate relationships, and these relationships being asserted, and then time brought into it. It is a question of before the world was, but there is an anticipation, too, that the Lord is looking for, of Himself being reinstated, if I may use that word, in the glory which He had along with the Father.
A.M.H. Do you take that glory to be some peculiar relationship of divine love, before the relationship of Father and Son was introduced? And now He asks to be received back into that in manhood.
{344}
J.T. That is right, so that we cannot say that love was introduced. I mean that we have to see that love was there.
A.J.G. The expression "along with" involves equality, does it?
J.T. I think so.
Ques. Does not the verse taken by itself leave us with the impression of what is inscrutable? Verse 24 would enable us to say something in relation to love, because that is where we come into the matter, is it not?
J.T. Well, verse 22 I think should precede what you are saying, "The, glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one". I would say that that is the glory of sonship, but the glory of verse 5, "Now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was"; I would not say that that was sonship. I am certain it Was not, but verse 22 is sonship. It is the glory of sonship, that is to say, the Lord has taken the disciples up in a fit relationship involving glory.
P.H.H. That is the glory which He had, but it was a glory which He was given. Is that the distinction in your mind?
J.T. Just so. He gave the disciples the glory that was conferred upon Him. They are brought into that glory.
A.J.G. And then would you mind saying a word as to verse 24, "that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me" as distinct from "the glory which thou hast given me I have given them" in verse 22?
J.T. You are centring on the thought of love. Is that what I understand?
A.J.G. Yes, I was enquiring whether in verse 22 it is a glory which, as you have said is given to us, the glory of sonship, but in verse 24 there seems to
{345}
be something distinctive in the expression, "my glory", which He desires that we should behold as with Him.
J.T. One has to think more about this matter. Verse 24 reads, "I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me", that is to say, there is a glory that the Father has given Him, and He wishes that the disciples should know it, should behold it.
A.J.G. Yes. Is that the distinctive glory given to Christ to bring in, in Himself, all the thoughts of love which the Father had formed before the foundation of the world, and would it link at all with what Peter records in the first chapter of his second epistle, that when they were with Him on the holy mount, the Father said to them, "This is my beloved Son, in whom *I* have found my delight"?
J.T. Then this prayer in verse 24 is, "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". If I may make a comparison, in verse 5 the Lord says, "And now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". Here it is "the glory which I had along with thee", but in verse 24 it is something that is given to Him. This is clearly a distinct thing from verse 5. The disciples are to see the glory of verse 24, and I would think what you say is quite correct. It is a question of the unfolding of love, divine thoughts between the Father and the Son, and the disciples are to come into these, and see the glory that He has as unfolding these thoughts, and bring them into evidence.
A.J.G. Would that be confirmed by the difference in the expressions used in verse 5 and verse 24?
{346}
In verse 5 He says "before the world was" which seems to be a more absolute expression, but verse 24 is "before the foundation of the world", which seems to link on with the thought of divine purpose.
J.T. Just so, it is divine purpose. That is the idea, "the foundation of the world". It is a foundational thought, that is to say, God is going to build up things, and the Son is to be the agent of it, but the disciples have this special place. As He says, "Father ... I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me". The glory which the Son has received, which has been given to Him by the Father, is now to be seen by the disciples. "For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"; the Father's love for the Son is brought into it all, therefore I would think what you say is quite in order, and encouraging, too, and instructive as to what we are to be brought into, in the sense of what is given to Christ, in view of the service that He is rendering now, or has been rendering to the Father.
J.C-S. The glory of sonship in verse 22 conferred upon Him or given to Him is conferred upon us, but the glory in verse 24, whilst conferred upon Him is not conferred upon us. We are to behold it.
J.T. That is right. We are to see Him.
W.S.S. Would the anointing of Aaron help to the understanding of it, Aaron anointed alone in the first place, and then Aaron and his sons with him anointed together (see @Leviticus 8: 12 and 30), one being a distinctive glory and the other a glory which is shared?
J.T. There is a good deal in that, I am sure, because @Exodus 28 is primarily concerned with Aaron by himself, although the sons are in view, but the whole chapter almost, we might say, is occupied
{347}
with Aaron by himself. The sons are brought into it at the end of the chapter.
J.P. Could we have a word as to the love in verse 24 and the love in verse 26 of @John 17? "For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world", and then "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them"?
J.T. Well, it is not now that we see it, but that it is in us. That is a greater thing, a fuller thought really, and brings out just what has been remarked earlier, that the Lord says, "I in them". He has a place in us, and is operating in that position, and so in Hebrews He sings to the Father in that connection, in the midst of the assembly.
Ques. Is it not brought out by the whole tenor of Scripture, that whilst we are brought into such intimate relations with the Lord, and share the love that He knows, and share His relationship, He ever retains and will ever retain, a distinctive personal place?
J.T. Quite so. In all things He must have the pre-eminence, but at the same time it is very touching that He wishes to be in a certain position in order to serve God. The Father's love is in them, but Christ is in the disciples -- "I in them", He said.
P.H.H. Is this preposition *in*, therefore, to be looked at in the light of operation and activity? "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be *in* them and I *in* them".
J.T. I think it just supports what we are saying as to operation. The Lord desires to have a certain position in view of the operations in mind.
P.L. Does it link up with headship in Colossians? "I in them". It would give Him scope for the service of God.
S.H.B. Is there a reason why the feature of contemplation is introduced in regard to this great
{348}
subject? I was thinking of @John 1. "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". Does contemplation come in on our side, so that we get the joy of it?
J.T. Quite so. It comes in following on the Word having become flesh. "The Word became flesh" (He had taken another form) "and dwelt among us and we have contemplated his glory". That is what John says, the Lord had come within their range, that they might contemplate His glory.
F.D.A. Referring again to love, the love that ever existed, is that carried forward into the sphere of sonship, or is there something distinctive about the love that has ever existed?
J.T. Well, you are quite right in saying it is carried into the sphere of sonship. The Lord has come into that sphere, that is the point in @John 1. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". He *became* flesh. It was His own action. He has taken another form, but with a view to being within our range, dwelling among us.
J.W.H. Does this link on with Paul, as seen in Galatians, where he says, "When God, who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son *in* me"?
J.T. Well, Paul had the revelation *in* him, Peter had it *to* him. Peter had the revelation, too, but it was *to* Peter, but Paul seems to have a fuller and more animated and intimate thought about the revelation, in that the Father had revealed His Son *in* Paul, that he might announce Him as glad tidings among the nations, as if to glorify the service of the gospel, whereas what *Peter* represents is to work out in the structure of the assembly, the building of the assembly, and the appearing is to him.
A.M.H. Might I refer again to @John 17:26. "The love with which thou hast loved me may be in them"? Is that the Father's love *in* us, in some
{349}
sense giving us to stand beside Him in His delight in the Son?
J.T. Very good. In some sense, that is, in a respectful deferential sense. Just as we often had it, that at the crossing of the Jordan, a certain distance is maintained, but the position is there.
E.N.J. Would Abraham's two young men be in that position, the great privilege of contemplating in type the movements of the Father and the Son, but only able to go so far?
J.T. Well, there is not much said of what they saw. Have you anything in mind as to that?
E.N.J. I was just thinking of Abraham having chosen these two young men to go so far on the journey, and he said to them, "I and the lad will go yonder and worship".
J.T. They are seen again at the end of the chapter going down to Beer-sheba. In verse 19 it says, "Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba". But Isaac is not seen, therefore they did not see much. The matter of seeing was between Abraham and his son, and then that is true as regards ourselves. The thing is happening between the father and the son themselves, so, I think, we are left with the thought that Isaac does not come down to Beer-sheba. After he is risen figuratively from the dead the position is left open, and therefore we have the thought now that we often enjoy, of the Lord's place with us in coming to us, that He is free, but He does not belong to the level of the earth or Beer-sheba. Isaac is not said to have come down; the young men came down, and Abraham came down, but not Isaac; that I think opens up much as to assembly service and privilege.
P.L. So that "they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba". Is that the state of love and unity in which God is pleased sovereignly to give us light
{350}
as to the assembly? "Bethuel begot Rebecca", is now introduced.
J.T. That is what we have to come to and not forget it. The picture must be filled out, and Isaac is seen above; he does not come down to the level of Beer-sheba. The picture must be filled out, and it is filled out in the facts of the verses from verse 21. They bring in the position of Rebecca. Her name is just mentioned in verse 23, but it is enough. It is enough to fill out the wonderful sphere in which we are.
P.H.H. It is mentioned in the setting of begetting. Does that in some sense bring in the thought of the Father?
J.T. Just so, and it also fits in with the thought of the ram.
P.H.H. I was going to ask whether the ram brought in the progenitive idea, so that all these thoughts of love that you have been speaking about, are to be carried forward and continued.
J.T. That is just it. It is not a female thought, although we have the female in the earlier chapters, that is chapter 15, and we have the ram too, there, but here it is progenitive just as you said, because it is a question of Abraham's line being carried forward. There must be the progenitive idea, and that will be the basis for our next considerations on chapter 24, where Rebecca fills out the truth.
P.L. Is that like the males appearing before God in relation to His service?
J.T. Bringing out the masculine side in the ways:, of God, beginning with @Genesis 2.
P.L. Is not the language very selective in this spiritual environment, the "sons" in verse 20, and then the "firstborn", and "his brother" in verse 21, and then "these eight" in verse 23. Does this all bear on the upward trend?
{351}
J.T. I think we shall see as we proceed further today that the upward trend is in mind all the way through.
F.W. Is there any reason why Isaac is twice spoken of here as the lad, and then in the second reference what immediately follows is his being the son? "Stretch not out thy hand against the lad, neither do anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me". Is there a progressive thought in that?
J.T. Very good. You are stressing the word "*lad*".
F.W. Yes. Earlier in the chapter it says "I and the lad" and in chapter 48 Jacob says, "Bless the lads". Is it a progressive idea from what is an historical position to what is in mind in sonship?
J.T. That is the point. The point in the passage is that the son dies. Christ has died, but is risen again, and He is not only risen, He is ascended, and that is the point in @John 20, "I ascend to my Father and your Father", so that we must go on to that to get the full thought of Christianity. It is a question of ascension, and I think the thing is confirmed in Paul's ministry, especially in @Acts 20, where we have love at the beginning and love at the end, and at the middle, and the middle brings in the boy, that is the youth at the window. He is called a boy, meaning that it is an initial thought, a youthful thought, but he is not going to stay there. He is going to progress, because they brought the boy away. They brought *away* the boy alive and were comforted. Whether our young people are a comfort to the brethren is a question. They are not always, very often the opposite, but they were comforted by the boy.
{352}
FAITH AND SPIRITUALITY AS SEEN IN ABRAHAM (6)
@Genesis 24: 1 - 21, 50 - 67
J.T. We cannot indeed but be impressed with the richness of the passage; I mean the whole section beginning with chapter 14. It begins with Melchisedec and ends with Isaac and Rebecca.
Ques. I was impressed with the word as to the love with which the Lord Jesus was loved being in us. You remarked, I think, that we love Him in some sense as the Father has loved Him, and it raises an enquiry as to verse 21, "That they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us". Have you something for us in relation to the oneness of affection evidently involved?
J.T. It would seem as if the Lord had in mind that there would be some correspondence between the Father and ourselves in this matter. There is much relativeness in distinctions and dignity, and when we come to having to say to divine Persons as in @John 17, and our having part with Them, and in what They are going on with, then clearly there must be some special action of God in order to fit us for that place of nearness because we who form the assembly have the greatest place and the nearest place in relation to divine Persons. And so in the last chapter of the Bible it is said that when the Lord announces Himself as the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star, the Spirit and the bride say, "Come". That is to say, a divine Person is heard speaking in the same voice, in the same word, with creatures; that is to say, with ourselves, the assembly; the Spirit *and* the bride say, Come. There is thus to be understood by us a peculiar nearness which belongs to us as of the
{353}
assembly that ought to affect us profoundly, specially what comes in in the last chapter of the Bible.
Rem. I thought perhaps it would lay a foundation in our souls for the consideration of this matter that is now before us, for love is really required to enter into it.
J.T. Yes. Another thing that comes in immediately into this chapter, @Genesis 24, is the service of angels. I mention it just in a preliminary way especially in view of circumstances in these southern parts, industrial circumstances affecting the Lord's people, calling for suffering. And whether we have in our minds, especially in our prayers, the place that angels have in this sense. They are, in a general sense, said to be ministering spirits sent out for ministry for those who are heirs of salvation, and clearly it would be a relative service, not comparable to the service of the Holy Spirit or the service of the gifts that the Spirit has brought in and gives. But still it is a service that we are dependent on day and night, week in and week out, and the enemy is attacking on those lines, and it is a question therefore whether in our prayers we include the service of angels. Their service can be counted upon, we know. The Lord said He could call on His Father to send angels to Him, and we see throughout the Scriptures from the very outset that they are engaged in service right down to the end.
Ques. Is that confirmed by the apostle Paul in @Acts 27, when he says, "For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night, saying, Fear not, Paul"?
J.T. And he said to his listeners that it would be so, as the angel of God had spoken to him.
Rem. "Thou must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee", the blessing connected with those who are following the teaching of Paul -- and then "I
{354}
believe God that thus it shall be, as it has been said to me".
J.T. It would, I believe, be a matter of great importance if we all laid to heart the peculiar kind of attack to which we are exposed, extending back now for many years, in the industrial world in which many of our brethren are engaged. We heard of it yesterday, and it is just a question now of whether we might not include it in our thoughts, that is the importance of prayer. Not indeed to single out the angels, because we cannot do that, with one or two exceptions. They are not named except as I said in one or two cases, but we know that they are there and in large numbers, and that God has employed them from the very outset, even extending back to the very foundation of the earth when "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy".
P.L. Hezekiah's prayer in remnant days in relation to Jerusalem was answered by God with the angel of Jehovah smiting 185,000.
J.T. Quite so. Showing how much can be done in that sense.
D.J.M. We have come to myriads of angels in @Hebrews 12. Does that bear on it?
J.T. Quite so. We have come to that, as if they belong to that to which we have come in the sense of privilege and protection.
J.C-S. Should we habituate our minds to think along those lines, not merely on special occasions?
J.T. Quite so. We should habituate our minds so and especially on Monday nights, Monday evenings being devoted to prayer.
P.H.H. Would you specialise a little more as to this matter, just for our help?
J.T. Well, we have, I suppose, the angels alluded to in the cherubim with the flaming sword keeping the way of the tree of life, in an early chapter of the
{355}
Bible and then running right down to the very end of the Bible, and especially in Paul's ministry, and Peter's ministry too.
G.A. It would appear that the Lord Himself in some way accepted this service, "an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him. And being in conflict he prayed more intently", @Luke 22: 43, 44.
J.T. Very striking. We associate ourselves with the Lord in that sense as calling for help from God. Although it is not said He called for that help, but He could, He said, have done so. As I was remarking, from the very outset we see the ministration of angels. Are they not all ministering spirits? We do not know how many there are, evidently a great many, they are called myriads. "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service ... ?" Sent out, therefore, they are available for us. Mention has been made already of an immense number of persons slain by one angel, and the word in Zechariah is striking, "Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan! Yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem". Therefore Jerusalem is the object of protection, and of course we shall now come presently to Jerusalem as it is presented in the book of Revelation, the holy city -- new Jerusalem.
C.F.I. Does the special service of the angel in verse 7 have to do with the securing of the bride in this chapter? "He will send his angel before thee, that thou mayest take a wife for my son thence".
J.T. Quite so. That is the first mention we have in the chapter.
P.H.H. Does it mean in the main that critical positions are covered or may be covered with special angelic care, so that God's thoughts are not interfered with finally?
J.T. Well, it is seen in what was said yesterday as to Lot and the attack on Sodom, and all that
{356}
followed as to Lot, and how it is said that Jehovah left off speaking with Abraham, and went up from him, but later it is said that He went away. I believe that what is in mind in all this, is what God would do in relation to the wickedness of the world, because it was interfering with God's interests and people. Should we not have that more in mind than hitherto, and count on God's intervention in wars and such disturbances as are likely to interfere with the testimony, and whether we may not be freer to call on God for His help? Not indeed that we would specify persons, because, as I said, we cannot name many. We have Gabriel and Michael, but we know that there are a great many, and that they are sent out actually in service and are available for our help, and to be called for.
P.L. "From heaven was the fight; the stars from their courses fought with Sisera", @Judges 5: 20. Is that the way God may throw in unseen forces in crises that arise in the testimony?
J.T. We can count on God having men, not exactly christians, but men that He can use; many of us here have experienced it in the wars that we have been through. How God has come in from time to time, and how the prayers of the brethren at times became centred in the matter, and God answered our prayers with great results.
Ques. He has operated in circles to which we have no access, political and governmental circles. Is that what you have in mind?
J.T. Yes. We have no access to them, no part in politics; we trust in God, but we know that God has these persons that He can use and they are already in service, they are sent out. *All* ministering spirits, it says, sent out for service, service to those who are heirs of salvation.
E.B.McC. He used an angel to liberate Peter and to smite Herod, did He not?
{357}
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Are you free to say a word on the scripture in Exodus, "Behold, I send an Angel before thee", and "my name is in him"?
J.T. That is a good scripture. It is found in @Exodus 23 and alluded to later in the same sense in chapter 33. The angel was entrusted with the bringing of Israel into the land, and he was to be feared, for God's name was in him. In Timothy they are seen as connected with God's service and activities.
D.J.M. In the crisis in @Exodus 14:19 the angel of God moved from before the camp to behind the camp in view of protection from the Egyptians pursuing them.
J.T. Quite so.
G.A. What would be in mind in the angels of God ascending and descending in @Genesis 28? Would it bring into view their activities and movements in relation to what you have been bringing before us, as though there is constancy in the matter? It is not an isolated movement but a concentrated movement, ascending and descending for the service.
J.T. There is a similar allusion in @John 1: 51. "And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man". It is, I think, an allusion to the passage in Genesis, but it is very touching that the Son of man is in mind, and it is undoubtedly looking on to a later date when such protection will be needed among the saints. The same protection is needed now amongst the saints in view of the peculiar industrial situation that has arisen on the earth, especially in Europe with its outgoings, and what a weapon we have in prayer, appealing to God especially to come in and deliver us, so that the
{358}
testimony may not be bound up or hampered by this attack that is so manifest, especially in these southern regions.
J.C-S. Do you suggest that the devil is acting through the industrial position in this way, in getting at the testimony?
J.T. That is what I noticed, and I refer to what came before us yesterday as to a certain part, and whether in that part and elsewhere we are taking into account what God has with which to meet such conditions, and whether we are availing ourselves of it.
Ques. Have you in mind perhaps a little more specific prayer? I noticed in Ezra it speaks of seeking from God "a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance ... And we fasted, and besought our God for this; and he was entreated of us". Would that encourage us more?
J.T. Quite so.
P.L. In Elisha's day we get the thought of beholding the mountain, "Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw; and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha". Is it the vessel of light so exposed that is specially protected?
J.T. A very good illustration of it. Our brethren are bound to suffer, and the question is, whether we are equal to the suffering, because if we are and take it on there will be greater blessing and greater light too furnished for us.
S.H.B. Would it help us also to take up the exhortation as to thanksgiving for all men as well as prayer for all men?
J.T. Very good. It is a question of men, all men.
W.S.S. When it says, "that thou mayest take a wife for my son thence", would it suggest that apart from this angelic service the work of the Spirit would not be successful in securing a wife?
{359}
J.T. Although it is not an angel that is commissioned at all, it is a servant of Abraham that is commissioned, undoubtedly typical of the Spirit of God Himself. So that the service is of the very highest order.
W.S.S. I was thinking of the servant as typical of the Spirit, but that the sending of the angel before him would, in that way, make way for him.
J.T. The angel would lend his service happily, as he would lend it too later in taking Israel out of Egypt into the land.
P.H.H. Is it a kind of heavenly accessory service?
J.T. It is just accessory, but it is a real service, a service that none others are fitted for. I mean to say the brethren cannot interfere politically, but the angels can. They have means of doing it.
C.K. Is that why it is mentioned here in connection with the fact that Jehovah the God of the heavens had taken Abraham out of his father's house?
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. In @Matthew 28 it speaks of one angel and says, "For fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men. And the angel answering said to the women, Fear not ye". The same angel causes dead men amongst the enemies but brings the support of heaven to those who are in the testimony.
J.T. Quite so. Then another thing that might be added in this connection is the peculiar circumstances in Abraham's house and among his servants, how all is fitted for this great matter, for there is nothing that need be forced. Everything is there that is suitable in Abraham even externally, and so we have "and Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said to his servant, the eldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had", and so forth. That is, Abraham's circumstances are such as to
{360}
render him available in an external sense for such an important matter, as is now before us; that is to say the securing of the assembly. We take the brethren generally, there is considerable need, of course, and it is intended that there should be, and the need amongst them only brings out love that exists; at the same time, the brethren generally, in a circumstantial way are cared for by God. It is not His intent to make us rich or distinguished by anything of that kind, but it is His intent to show that He is caring for us, and that circumstances are available for our benefit. So that we have what is needed. Abraham had all that was needed, he was blessed in every way. As I said before, "Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things". Well these things were necessary for this great matter, and now they are put into effect. And so we get in verse 10 "And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed"; that is to say, he had plenty, so that the servant can take them according to what he thinks should be taken, *ten camels*.
C.C.C. Is this to impress us with the thought of the Father's affections moving in this matter? It is the movement of a father in relation to his son.
J.T. Just so. It shows too how the circumstances of a brother and his family may be such as to enable him to afford love's way, afford love's service and activities. So that the brethren here have moved in love, and they are not restrained in any way, they are ready to use hospitality to invite their brethren, and God is pleased with all that.
P.H.H. Do you mean it is all to be used to promote this great assembly matter?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. The whole array of things here that Abraham is the centre of is all put into motion with great intelligence. Everything is done rightly, and therefore we can see the sphere in which love is active, and love's ways
{361}
shown, and we are in that sphere. That is where God has put us.
E.T. John having something like that in mind wrote to Gaius, saying, "that in all things thou shouldest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospers". He speaks about having wrought, "whatever thou mayest have wrought towards the brethren".
J.T. A very good example, and the elect lady too. John's epistles work out all this of which we are speaking. So the elect lady and her children were governed by the truth, and were cared for by God in a circumstantial way.
Ques. Does this all make for definiteness? I notice the servant speaks in verse 14 of one who was appointed for Isaac. If we are over-burdened circumstantially, and not conscious of a little help from God in such matters, distraction is likely to ensue, whereas, as moving on this line I wondered whether confidence was begotten and definiteness comes into view. So the servant speaks not of anybody, but of one who was appointed for Isaac, as though divine arrangement was entering into the matter.
J.T. Yes. Of course that takes us on to a higher level. That leads us on to a more spiritual level when we come to what was appointed for Isaac, which would mean the assembly.
Ques. I wondered whether we are being set free for that.
J.T. Just so. Hence whether our circumstances are eased for us so that we should be free.
A.M. Are we to be acquainted with the Spirit in various ways? There are several suggestions of the Spirit, the well, the water, the camels, as well as the servant.
J.T. I think the whole area of operations here contemplates the Spirit in more phases than one. The Spirit is here in such power, and in such ways
{362}
that you may find Him in different settings at different times, but His presence is always assured, and more particularly when it is a question of securing something for Christ, securing the assembly.
R.R.T. His presence is always assured, you say, Would verse 13 bear on that? "Behold, I stand here by the well of water". The Spirit here takes up a position similar to what we had in relation to the three men standing by in @Genesis 18.
J.T. Just so. He is standing where He can be usable, so that He can secure what He is aiming at.
A.E.D. The servant runs to meet her, according to verse 17. Is that what marks the Spirit's ministry, the energy of the present moment?
J.T. Quite so. And then of course we must come down to Rebecca herself and begin to enquire among us as to what is going on in this way, as to whether there is anything that is comparable, and progressive, in the service of God. We have the word, "always abounding in the work of the Lord", that is, of course, a word that ought to apply to everyone professedly in the service. So that there are those who are ready to do what is needed to be done, and to do it well. I think that is the point that comes out here, that what Rebecca does is done well and liberally and willingly because it was a big undertaking for a young woman to furnish water for these camels.
R.A.H. Is it noticeable in regard to Rebecca that she "came out"?
J.T. Yes. Verse 15 says, "And it came to pass before he had ended speaking, that behold, Rebecca came out". And then we are told about her, who she is. We have her identification. "Who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother", that is to say she is identified as the proper person to be in marital relation typically with Christ. She is of His kindred.
{363}
W.S. Is her name important, meaning captivating?
J.T. Quite so.
P.H.H. Have you in mind that what Rebecca does is a practical service?
J.T. Well, I think it is to bring out what the assembly is in the place of need, not only where it may be, but where it is. She is there ready to be used in a large way.
Rem. There is nothing niggardly about the assembly's provision, once she puts her hand to it.
J.T. Quite so.
J.C-S. She is equal to the occasion.
J.T. I think what you say is good. There is nothing niggardly or small about her. And then if we are entertaining we are to be liberal and free in it. It is a great matter because we are enjoined in the epistle to the Hebrews not to be forgetful of hospitality. The point for us now, therefore, is to see how she qualifies because it is a question of coming up to the spiritual level of her relation with Isaac, and correspondingly what the saints may be in relation to Christ, that they are of His kindred.
E.B. I was going to ask in that connection whether Rebecca at this point suggests the thought of assembly personnel, because we have spoken about not being niggardly in entertaining. We have had considerable concern as to whether the assembly entertains, but that the persons do who comprise it. Are you speaking about Rebecca as typical of assembly personnel at the moment?
J.T. Well, it would be the material. She represents those who form the assembly, I would say. The matter of entertaining is now of great importance in this city, so many are being entertained and need it, and I am sure that those of us who are being entertained can testify to the liberality of the hospitality, which is a great testimony to God too.
{364}
C.H.H. Would it imply that the activities are really in the mind of the Spirit? What she does here is in keeping with the mind of the servant.
J.T. Quite so. She is material for the assembly, but the servant here is typical of the Spirit undoubtedly, and so what would come out is the work of the Spirit in those who, like Rebecca, are intended to form the assembly.
C.H.H. Have you in mind that even material things required in caring for the needs of the saints, are really in the mind of the Spirit, and are furthering the testimony in relation to all that God has in mind?
J.T. Yes. Many a time we prove it. These large meetings have now become prevalent, and God is in them, and I am sure He would continue them. It is a question, therefore, for sisters as well as brothers, how they are to be continued and maintained, but we must not forget that we must deal with the spiritual side in order to reach the thoughts that are before us.
P.H.H. Is it significant that when this has been done and the water drawn the man brings in the ornamentation? "And it came to pass when the camels had drunk enough, that the man took a gold ring ... and two bracelets". Does this ministering in a spiritual way give an opening for spiritual adornment?
J.T. It goes with what we are saying. The spiritual side, of course, must come before us definitely before we finish, the mere externals are only accessory. We have to come now to the thought of Rebecca. She is seen at the end of chapter 22 definitely; she is seen by herself. She is brought out in the chapter, "Bethuel begot Rebecca". She is outstanding here, as if we are to get a view of her in the type, so as to have her in our minds, and when we come to the book of Revelation, it is very remarkable
{365}
that the heavenly city, the bride in the closing chapters, is seen by herself, and the question is whether we are accustomed to take account of her by herself.
P.L. Would the first reference in @Genesis 22 treat of her constitutionally, so to speak, in relation to her lineage, and here we have what you have referred to elsewhere, as substantiality?
J.T. Quite so. And what I am saying especially is a matter of being able to see or take account of the assembly by *herself*. She is seen, for instance, in @Revelation 19 as the bride, the Lamb's wife. She is given to be clothed in fine linen bright and pure, for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints. That is to say, she is seen by herself in those who compose her.
Ques. Do you mean that the assembly is to be regarded as an entity?
J.T. Quite so, as an entity. A creature entity to be taken account of by all of us, because in the book of Revelation the Lord says of Philadelphia, "I make them ... who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee". That is to say she is known to be loved by Christ. She is seen by herself, but she is known to be loved by Christ.
A.J.G. Have you in mind that it is not only a question of having the abstract thought of the assembly before us, but that there is to be sufficient expression of it among the saints, as a result of the work of God, for us to see it concretely?
J.T. That is what I thought exactly. The book of Revelation affords us views of the assembly, and if we go by the word "captivated" of which we arc reminded, what is presented is very touching. Is there that amongst us that is captivating, that is to say, that tends to hold persons for blessing?
{366}
P.H.H. The bride, the Lamb's wife, would be captivating!
J.T. She is captivating. The words mean that she is captivating to Him anyway.
Ques. Does the Song of Songs in the ardent language employed prove that? Christ typically is held by the affections of the assembly.
J.T. Yes.
P.L. "The king is fettered by thy ringlets"?
J.T. Just so. I do not wish to be unduly pressing one side, but it seems to be a matter that is to be before us, that she is to be viewed by herself, what she is in herself.
Rem. She is said to have "made herself ready".
J.T. Very good.
J. C. Is what you say seen in verse 16 which says "And the maiden was very fair in countenance; a virgin, and no man had known her"? Then it goes on to say what she does and what she is.
J.T. Just so. See what she is and what she undertook. How readily she undertook a great service; that is to say, she is not small at all in her thoughts when the service is proposed to her. She *went down* to the well and filled her pitcher *and came up*. "And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, sip a little water out of thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord! And she basted and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink. And when she had given him enough to drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until *they* have drunk enough. And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw water; and she drew for all his camels. And the man was astonished at her, remaining silent, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not". I think that is a remarkable statement. The man was astonished at her.
{367}
H.H. Would not the gift of the servant to her of the ring and the bracelets be on account of her personal worth? I thought her own personal comeliness and attractiveness is something like the pearl in @Matthew 13.
J.T. Quite so. She is not alone in this, in this lavish giving, for it is said in verse 53 "the servant brought forth silver articles, and gold articles, and clothing, and he gave them to Rebecca; and he gave to her brother, and to her mother, precious things". That is to say the whole position is lavish in wealth, but the wealth that love can use. It is a love matter, but it is not restricted to Rebecca, there are others mentioned, as I said. He gave all these articles, so that there is a spirit of liberality in giving; that is to say, giving in the power of love acting, for this is the sphere of love's activities. It is not mere philanthropy, it is love that is acting, and you cannot find it anywhere in the universe, now, except in the assembly.
G.A. Would that be indicated in the fact that she ran on two separate occasions, as having, perhaps, learned that from the Spirit typically as taking on the urgency of affection?
J.T. Just so. No doubt she is, as you might say, absorbing things. She is becoming like the man, really, and thus in time, becoming like herself. She is the real entity that is in mind to be secured.
J.W.H. Would you say a word about the astonishment in connection with that?
J.T. It is a remarkable thing that it should be said of one who represents a divine Person, and it corresponds with the Lord Himself. It says in @Luke 7 that He wondered at certain things that a certain man had said.
J.W.H. Is the astonishment on the part of one who is typical of a divine Person to impress us with
{368}
the thought of mystery relating to Christ and the assembly, this having union in mind?
J.T. Quite so. But let us now think of the idea of mystery, because we must not let it go, now that you have brought it up, because the mystery covers Christ and the assembly.
Ques. Does Paul open the door for very great expectations when he says "above all which we ask or think" in @Ephesians 3: 20? Would that open a wide field of expectation, that this wonderment might really be apprehended by us, that God may do something much greater than we have anticipated?
J.T. Quite so, and who represents it more forcibly than Abraham's servant here, how he wondered at things, and yet he had come out for them, but they go beyond his expectations?
A.E.D. Is that in the light of the excellence of the quality in the vessel?
J.T. Just so; the excellence of the quality, and the efficiency, and skill, and power of the service.
J.C-S. Remaining silent would indicate how greatly he was affected by what he saw.
J.T. Yes. Look at what is here, divine Persons, you might say, in wonderment of what has come about, and having pleasure in Their own work, and its results.
A.M. Does her right speaking on several occasions enter into this too -- there is comeliness of speech with her?
J.T. Quite. Everything is in keeping, that is what strikes you in this whole passage. There is no discrepancy except perhaps in Laban, but in general there is no discrepancy at all. In moving on with the Spirit of God at the present time we shall not be impressed with discrepancies, we shall be impressed with the fulness and blessedness and liberality that God has furnished for us, because we are
{369}
coming near the end of things, and God is going to give us a good finish, I would say.
P.H.H. Do you think we have reached that spirit of things now, when the servant says, "Do not hinder me, seeing Jehovah has prospered my way: send me away, and I will go to my master"?
J.T. And yet he is silent; the servant is awaiting his opportunity to say what he had to say, not doing anything, not saying anything, not eating until he says what his mission is. He has one thing before him, and that is a great matter in the service, to have one thing before us. "One thing I do", Paul said. I think we should proceed from verse 50 now, what we get with Laban and Bethuel and then the thing proceeds, Laban and Bethuel are able to say that "the thing proceeds from Jehovah: we cannot speak to thee bad or good. Behold, Rebecca is before thee". That is to say, Laban and Bethuel have full confidence in Rebecca, that she is fit for the situation. She will fill it out suitably, and so, "we cannot speak to thee bad or good. Behold, Rebecca is before thee: take her, and go away; and let her be wife of thy master's son, as Jehovah has said". That is very fine. These two men are responsible in the matter, and they are looking on, and they have full confidence in what is being done, that Rebecca is equal to what is being sought, ready to meet it, and so there she is. "Rebecca is before thee: take her, and go away". So that she is to be regarded in this light in this passage.
J.T.S. I was thinking of what was remarked earlier as to the importance of viewing the assembly by itself. I wondered if we should have a word as to the import of what it says in verse 64 that "she sprang off the camel".
J.T. That has a beautiful place, as we shall see. It is a question of the power of spring in Rebecca; after the long journey of the wilderness, she is now
{370}
ready to spring, as it says. We might look at the group of things that are mentioned in that connection. First it says, "Rebecca arose, and her maids", verse 61, "and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and went away". He had reached his object and he went away. "And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi; for he was dwelling in the south country. And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields toward the beginning of the evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, camels were coming". I just point out that what occupies Isaac is the camels, not Rebecca. And then it says, "Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, and she sprang off the camel". That is her part. That is to say she has the power of spring, which is a great matter in these spiritual affairs. She has the power to spring off the camel. "And she had said to the servant, Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master". Now that is another thing to be noticed. The change from Abraham to Isaac, that Isaac is the master now, which we have to understand as to how Christ comes in, as a divine Person, into such a place. That Isaac is now spoken of as the master, and then it says "she took the veil, and covered herself". That is another thing, suitable and comely, pointing to the covering of the head according to 1 Corinthians, and then again it says "the servant told Isaac all things that he had done", so that the whole position is set out clearly, and we are given an account of things, and everything, as I said before, is without discrepancy, except perhaps with Laban and the others in the house.
E.N.J. Is it significant that the report is made to Isaac and not to Abraham, "the servant told Isaac all things that he had done"?
{371}
J.T. That is what I was thinking. Abraham is now lost to view. It is a question of Isaac being the master, which would, of course, point to Christ in some sense in which we apprehend Him in relation to the assembly.
J.C-S. Does it point to His supremacy?
J.T. It does; and then he is a man of leisure, he is not occupied with work, that is not the idea. It is a question of leisure.
C.A.I. In this connection is it to be noticed that she refers to the servant as lord, "Drink, my lord!" and then receives the word from him, "That is my master!"? I wondered whether in addressing the servant as "my lord", she would be reverential towards the Holy Spirit typically, and now receives from him an indication of the supremacy of Isaac; that is, of Christ?
J.T. Just so. The Spirit leads the way in that. The Lord says, "He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you". He makes much of Christ.
Ques. So that in the marital setting, would you say that it is Christ personally before us?
J.T. Quite so, but what have you in mind in saying that?
Rem. I was just thinking of the place He has secured as the Man in the heart of the woman. But the divine conception arose with the Father, as you have been pointing out, Abraham was the source of all this.
J.T. Yes, and then the servant is so skilled and wise, he is the eldest of Abraham's house, he knows what to do and everything comes under his guidance.
E.B.McC. Where does the Lord come from on Lord's day morning? Does He come from heaven or is He here as in Matthew, or as we have it here?
J.T. You are distinguishing and, of course, that helps us. Matthew would say He is here all the time. But then we know from other scriptures that
{372}
He is in heaven too, He has gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him and, therefore, He can come out of heaven and does come out of heaven, as it says, "He is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race". That is a picture of Christ Himself, and opens up much to us as to the activities of Christ at the present time towards the assembly and the service of God.
P.H.H. Rebecca addresses the servant here a good many times, but you would not bring the addressing of the Spirit by us, I suppose, into formal assembly service, would you?
J.T. By the addressing of the Spirit do you mean that we speak to Him?
P.H.H. Yes.
J.T. Well, He keeps out of sight, I would say; although in the book of the Acts, He is very active in Himself in authority, which is something to be noted. He says for instance to Peter in @Acts 10, "*I* have sent them". Peter was to go, because the Spirit said to him, "Go with them, nothing doubting, because *I* have sent them", and then again m chapter 13 He is seen as sending Paul and Barnabas, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which *I* have called them"; so that there is a definite action of the Spirit in authority in those cases, and it is well to keep that in mind too. At the same time He keeps Himself out of sight, as in Colossians for instance, where you get very little of the Spirit acting of Himself, but still He does act of Himself.
C.F.I. Some reference has been made to what is said in @Numbers 21 in relation to the well, "Sing ye unto it".
H.H. I wanted to ask if it was thought that we should pray to the Holy Spirit.
J.T. I would not say that.
{373}
D.J.M. You made some reference to singing to the well, and that the Spirit should have some part in our worship.
J.T. Quite so. That is the truth.
C.A.I. The Spirit should be recognised as having His part in the economy.
J.T. Quite so.
J.C-S. You really could not have the service without the Spirit in reality, could you?
J.T. Quite so. He is here, He is sent forth from heaven to witness for Christ, and to be the power of our testimony too, but then He is here as a divine Person having authority to send out ministers. Now to proceed, I think the position of Rebecca is certainly worthy of perhaps a little more attention. In the verses alluded to, "Rebecca arose, and her maids, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man". I would call attention to the fact that the maids are mentioned, that being a feminine thought. That is the increase of femininity, which is important in this connection. The feminine idea is there, whatever we may say about it, and then "the servant took Rebecca, and went away. And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi; for he was dwelling in the south country. And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields toward the beginning of evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, camels were coming". It is important to notice, that he saw the camels first; it does not say he saw Rebecca first, he saw the camels first, and then it says, "Rebecca lifted up *her* eyes", and so forth, but the fact that he saw the camels first is of prime importance to my mind, because it is a question of what the brethren are being carried by, what power we are using in the service of God, whether it is really the Spirit of God. I would like to notice especially what Isaac saw, and why it is mentioned. It says "he lifted up his eyes and saw,
{374}
and behold, camels were coming". Why does it not say Rebecca?
Ques. Do you mean that as the Lord Jesus looks on our assembly activities, He should see that we are employing the power of the camel, spiritual power in all that is done?
J.T. It is what is divinely furnished to carry us through, that is the idea and where are we in regard of these things. How are we going through to Christ, what power are we using?
Ques. Is there a reference to the responsible history of those who compose the assembly m the mention of ten camels? Does it mean that there is ample power furnished for every department of responsible history?
J.T. Good, but I would like a little more stress on what Isaac saw.
Ques. Would it be the Spirit coming into His place after a long history of hidden service for the delight of Christ?
J.T. Very good. What Isaac saw was that camels were coming. It does not mention Rebecca. That is to say, the Lord is thus occupied for the moment with what power we are using, what we have been carried by.
J.C-S. You are thinking of the service of God particularly when you raise the question as to what we are using, we might only be using our minds instead of the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so, a very needed matter to consider.
J.W. Would that verse in Ephesians help, "We have both access by one Spirit to the Father"?
J.T. Just so. That is the power for getting to the Father, but now we are speaking of what the Lord sees, by what power we are being carried. If you will look at a passage in @2 Corinthians 6 I think there are about 37 references to what Paul used, what he is going on with, and I think we will
{375}
get some idea of what Christianity really means in a practical way.
F.W. Is it the suggestion of the importance of the truth known in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of the power of the Spirit, as you say, but then allusion has been made to our minds, and our affections, and the like. Well, we must use our minds, and we must use our affections, but then we may misuse our minds, and the type in Rebecca has been forced and carried by our minds, whereas it is really not the full thought. We need more than our minds, we need affections, but we do need our minds and when we come to the Lord's supper the first thought really is the mind. With the mind we are ready to gather up and take on what is to be used for the moment in the service of God.
Ques. May I ask to what you refer in Paul using these things in 2 Corinthians?
J.T. In chapter 6 verse 3, "Giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed; but in everything commending ourselves as God's ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits, in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, in the word of truth, in the power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left, through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true; as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death; as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things". That is what I consider real power used in the service of God.
{376}
FRUITBEARING AND TESTIMONY
@John 15: 1 - 27
A.M.H. I suppose the Father had waited thousands of years for this fruit, looking for it in vain from elsewhere? It must have been a great moment when One here could say, "I am the true vine", and the thought of the Father as the Husbandman seems to be very attractive. The branch is introduced to produce fruit, fruit for the Father's heart, would you say?
J.T. It seems an abrupt change, as you might call it. At the end of the previous chapter the Lord says, "Rise up, let us go hence"; so that this chapter would have in mind another side of the truth. The vine evidently introduces a subject by itself, but, as I was saying, the previous chapter closes its subject.
A.M.H. In chapter 13 He has shown the kind of world He is leaving them in, and the way He is providing for them against it, would you say? In chapter 14 He seems to be providing them with what is heavenly, that they might dwell in the light of that whilst in this scene where He can visit them. Then He says, "Rise up, let us go hence"; breaking off, as you say, to another subject, and this matter of fruit.
J.C-S. What are we to gather from the thought of the vine?
J.T. I suppose it is an earthly matter, the vine would bear fruit. The kind of fruit has to be considered. Certainly we do not have the heavenly side to start with. So much arises as we proceed in John, because things came into the Lord's mind, or were there, that would attach to Him as He was here on earth, and their position could be viewed according to this, so that the Lord may be regarded as dealing with things having just an immediate
{377}
bearing. Chapter 11 has been dealing with something by itself, and now the Lord is ready to go on to something else; and He applies it to them, saying, "My Father is the husbandman. As to every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes it away; and as to every one bearing fruit, he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit. Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you". So that He is turning the matter over on them, clearly having in mind what is there which would bear such a change, and the fact that they were clean by reason of the word which, as He says, "I have spoken to you"; it brings up the question as to why the idea of cleansing comes in, and why it is "the word".
M.B. Do you think the thought of the vine had its fulfilment in Him, and terminated in His death here; but the thought of fruit-bearing is carried on in the disciples and that it might be written over the chapter, "From me is thy fruit found"?
J.T. From the use of the word "true vine" we must have in mind what existed from the Old Testament down, though it could be immediately applied to them. Then the cleansing is by the word, which would mean that it is very substantive and it affects the mind.
J.C-S. Is that introduced as a necessary adjunct to the idea of bearing fruit?
J.T. It would be a question of the mind, and how what the Lord said would apply to the minds of the disciples. It would clearly mean that we are entering now on the thought of intelligence. Then we have the word, "Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abide in the vine, thus neither can ye unless ye abide in me". Then it goes on, "I am the vine", leaving out the word "true" -- "ye are the branches. He that abides in me and I in him, *he* bears much fruit".
{378}
So that the Lord had in His mind what would work out through the instruction, their minds being acted upon, the word which He had spoken and the purifying effect of it. What had you in mind in your reference to fruit?
J.C-S. "The word which I have spoken to you" would be an absolute necessity to their bearing fruit.
J.T. And He would take the place of being the Source of everything. That would be a matter of intelligence. It is very needful that the thought of intelligence should extend not only to the brothers but to the sisters; that things should be taken up intelligently by all. The assembly must be in mind, indeed it is a matter of the saints and it includes all who have the Spirit. So it is a question whether the sisters take on the idea of intelligence, or whether they leave everything to their husbands.
R.R.T. It says, "Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you". It is not "words", it is "word". Does that refer to the manner of His speaking in John? He is introduced in this gospel as the Word.
J.T. "The Word was God"; in our prayer we noted it, and in our hymn; so that He becomes the Source of everything, and this applies to both brothers and sisters; so that the mind becomes active and is applied now to the idea of the vine, an earthly position; for clearly we have to begin with the earth and the working out of things where we are.
J.C-S. Do you suggest that what is taken up on the earth and is filled out there must precede the higher level that John leads on to?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. There is that which the Lord works out in relation to an earthly position. In @Romans 15: 8, he had such a position to confirm the promises of the fathers. It is clear the earth has to be dealt with first. The Lord went up to heaven as having first come down from
{379}
heaven; He says "And if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before", and again He says, "The Son of man who is in heaven", indicating that He would take a heavenly place. But clearly as having come to earth and become a Man He would take up what referred to man, and so is here seen as the Vine. That would be a thought that God had worked on previously, but now it is applied to the disciples, the Lord's disciples; because according to Isaiah He had disciples, and they were His children, they were regarded as His property, as His family; see @Isaiah 8: 16 - 18.
J.C-S. So that the idea of the vine found in the Old Testament, is not allowed to lapse; it is re-established in Christ and extended to the disciples.
J.T. I was thinking of how we could make a present application, because if we cannot apply it to the present moment it would be unpractical. We have to make a present application of the truth and make it useful, make it food for each other. Thus we would work out this matter of the vine, and the things that accompany and implement it here, especially the idea of the word, the word that Christ had spoken to them. That was to have an immediate effect and constitute them a part of the system He was now working in. He was the Vine, and they were the branches, so that we are to see how the truth is workable and applicable at the present moment as we abide in Him.
E.B. In @Isaiah 5: 7 we read, "The vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah the plant of his delight". In chapter 8: 16 it says, "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples" and in verse 18, "Behold, I and the children that Jehovah hath given me". Did you have in mind that, whereas there had been failure in Israel in regard to God's thoughts, now a divine Person having come in, those thoughts have been
{380}
established and God glorified in regard of them? All were answered to in Christ and His disciples. The principle of this continues for us as we hear the word of Christ and abide in Him; thus we bring forth much fruit. "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you. In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and ye shall become disciples of mine".
J.T. Very good. So that the present application is to us, and in making that application we are free to extend our thoughts, which is sometimes necessary to make the application workable. We see in the scripture referred to that the Lord has a family, "the children that Jehovah hath given me", and that, as He said, they were to be for signs and wonders in Israel. So that the question is now how it applies, and whether it is going to be workable, and affect us at this very minute.
Ques. Does the scripture referring to the children indicate of what origin they are, and to what system they belong?
J.T. Well, I think that is good, but the Lord according to Isaiah would take on many things; for we read, "His name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace". Isaiah reminds us thus of what can be applied, and how easily the Lord can move from one point to another, but always having the saints in mind; He said, "My disciples"; there were eleven of them. They were the nucleus from which things would be worked out, and they are never lost sight of. You go through the gospels and they are never lost sight of, nor are they ever lost sight of in the Acts or in the epistles.
Ques. What is suggested in the thought of abiding in Christ?
{381}
J.T. I suppose it is astronomical in the sense that the word *in* sometimes implies a position dependent on some other body. It is some heavenly body, or whatever it may be, everything being made contingent on its relation to another body; and of course what is in mind in John, is that the Lord is everything. You must begin with Him, you must not work up to Him, for He is the beginning of everything. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God ... . In him was life, and the life was the light of men" and so forth. We must begin with Him, and so we are here now in this chapter beginning with Him as the Vine. Hence abiding in Him would mean the attitude of your mind is that you are fixed in Him. It implies a certain fixity of position in which we keep ourselves.
Ques. Would it correspond to headship in Paul's teaching?
J.T. I was thinking that, and how they work out, Paul and John together.
A.M.H. There would be no philosophy and vain deceit if we were abiding in Him, would there?
R.G.C. Is Mary an illustration of abiding in Him, sitting at His feet, and thus developing into a very intelligent sister?
J.T. Quite so. She saw the position. Martha did not, but Mary saw it and remained in it. If we did not have John's account we would think very little of Martha; but John makes much of Martha, more than Luke does.
R.R.T. Looking at the thought of "abide in me" as an attitude of mind would make way for "My words abide in you", would it?
J.T. It shows that the mind is capable of being used, and that is what the apostle says of the Corinthians, "We have the mind of Christ". It shows how workable the truth is, and how spiritual may
{382}
be compared with spiritual. So that if such a figure as is represented in the idea of the vine is presented, the mind of the believer may be usable under those circumstances. The book of Acts shows how usable those can be with whom the Lord came in contact, and also those whom Peter was used to convert. Hence the word is they persevered in the apostles¬ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and prayers. These things open up what we are usable in.
E.B. Would that answer to the thought of fruit? Is it one thing to understand the position that grace has given us in relation to Christ, but another that there should be the designed fruit of that? Would that result work out from our abiding in Christ?
J.T. Quite so, so the Lord is now dealing with intelligence in us, with persons who are intelligent. "I speak as to intelligent persons" is introduced in relation to the Lord's supper.
J.C-S. So that spiritual facilities have been given that we may not remain unintelligent. Often it has been said, 'If the affections are all right it does not matter much about intelligence'.
J.T. Which, of course, is a very ignorant remark, John says at the very outset that certain ones left John the baptist and followed Jesus. The Lord turns to them and says, "What seek ye?" And they say, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?" meaning that they were thinking of intelligence and One from whom they could learn. That is the start really of the whole position in John and we are all brought into it; hence the great place the Spirit has in John's gospel and in John's epistle, especially the word unction as applied to it, by which we know all things.
V.P. So that we become intelligent as we listen and hear the word of God ministered in the power of the Spirit.
J.T. Yes, we become intelligent.
{383}
R.R.T. In view of what you are saying as to intelligence, the Lord says, "Ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you". Is that an indication that the Lord is addressing intelligent persons? He is looking on them as having some intelligence?
J.T. Quite so, and Matthew takes it up, applying it to "two of you"; two of the assembly. It says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth" and this is an earthly position -- "concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". It is an earthly position but an earthly position as in relation to the assembly, for it is a question of "two of you". So here "if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you. In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and ye shall become disciples of mine". So we get a clue now as to what the fruit means here. There is abiding in Him and "in this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and ye shall become disciples of mine". We become disciples through bearing fruit.
A.M.H. Do you think verse 8 explains to what the asking in verse 7 refers? Does it suggest that they are considering for fruit for the Father?
J.T. Surely. "If ye abide in me, and my words", -- not "word" -- "abide in you"; such persons will know what to ask for. The words would mean the truth in detail, whatever may arise, whatever circumstances may lead to, the Lord's words would apply.
A.M.H. In relation to fruit-bearing too, do you think?
J.T. Clearly. Then, the next thing is love, "As the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you; abide in my love. If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, as I have kept
{384}
my Father's commandments and abide in his love". So that the question of love comes in now. And then it goes on, "I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be in you, and your joy be full. This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you. I call you no longer bondmen, for the bondman does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and have set you that ye should go and that ye should bear fruit, and that your fruit should abide, that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give you. These things I command you, that ye love one another. If the world hate you, know that it has hated me before you. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on account of this the world hates you". So that the question of love comes in now and is put on a very high level in relation to the Father and the Son, but then they are brought into it.
A.T.S. What is the difference of thought between abiding in Christ, and abiding in His love?
J.T. I suppose the position is laid hold of and it is understood that love is in the matter. How much can be said of such a position!
H.W.B. Referring to verse 9, "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you", would that be in relation to the Lord's manhood?
J.T. Quite, it was what He was here, it is what could be seen in Him, they are to learn from Him. "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love", and then the idea of commandments
{385}
is brought into the position. That is to say, the idea of obedience must be there. He says, "If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love". So that we can see how great a place love has, and we are gradually lifted up, the level is becoming higher. So as He said in verse 11, "I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be in you, and your joy be full". One often challenges oneself as to joy and how little we have of it, and how little one has of it. "That your joy be full". There is much in the world to distress us and press us down, but the Lord would keep us afloat, as it were.
J.C-S. So that, as we draw upon the resources here, there would be a buoyancy about us; we would not be overcome by the things we meet here.
J.T. That is just the point that often comes to one, that one is not buoyant, that we are so easily overcome by very little things, trifles sometimes; but the Lord would begin with Himself so as to bring us into His state of things, His own conditions so that our joy might be full.
Ques. Subjection and love and joy all seem to be connected here, do they not?
J.T. They do. I have been struck by that as to how we rise, how the Lord would lead us up from the earth into heavenly things. John's gospel is not so much to bring in the form of things but the spirit of things, and heavenly things. That is what the Lord has clearly in mind here, beginning with verse 9. So in verse 11 He says, "I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be in you, and your joy be full". How marvellous these things are, and yet they are within our very range!
R.G.C. What is the thought of "my joy"?
J.T. What is the thought of Christ's joy? Well, for that we have to get into touch with Him, there
{386}
is such a thing as getting into touch with the Lord and seeing how He lives, what circumstances He is living in. John would help us to get into touch with the Lord, so as to lay hold of the state He is in, so to speak, being reverent. There is a state there that we can reach, that is open to us.
Ques. He has no joy in what is going on in the world, has lie?
J.T. Well, quite so.
J.C-S. So that His realm would afford us the gratification of every divinely produced feeling.
E.B. Is the thought suggested in @Romans 6: 10, "In that he lives, he lives to God"? Does that describe the Lord's present living conditions, might we say?
J.T. Quite so.
M.B. The apostle speaks in Hebrews of the "joy lying before him". Was it all included in His thoughts?
J.T. Things have to be dealt with, each by itself. It is marvellous, but we are dealing with infinitude, so we cannot just say that this is that, and that that is this. We are dealing with infinitude, and all in Christ, so that it is touchable and reachable and we are capable of laying hold of it, because we are born again and brought into spiritual things, made spiritual and then there is the work of the Spirit in us. As we receive Him as the unction, we know all things, so that we come gradually into the greatness of things, into infinitude you might say. In Ephesians we read of "the breadth and length and depth and height". These are creature limitations; but then it says, "and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God". There we touch infinitude.
R.H.C. Is the fruit of the vine peculiarly connected with joy?
{387}
J.T. Yes; I think the Lord would speak to us about joy, and about peace too, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you". Notice the word is "I give unto you". Philippians would help us on these lines from Paul's angle. "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are noble, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure ... whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue and if any praise, think on these things ... and the God of peace shall be with you"; so we are brought into things, they are available to us.
M.B. The Lord would bring us into those things in this particular intimacy with Himself as friends, would He? He brings us into it by sharing it with us.
J.T. Sharing it with us; that is good.
R.R.T. Do you think that those two in the early part of the gospel that followed Him and abode with Him that day, were let into the secret of this joy?
J.T. Quite so. "They abode with him that day". We could hardly say that He invited them, it is rather the outcome of the state, the circumstances, that they abode with Him that day. And then we are told what time of day it was. I suppose it is Roman time; anyway it shows us how things are brought down to practical everyday affairs, and that we are living in them.
Ques. Do you think that part of the joy would be in loving one another? It is placed on a high level, "as I have loved you".
J.T. Higher and higher yet; that is the thing. Still we begin at the bottom, we begin with the earth, but not the earth in a moral sense, for that would lead to what is devilish, as James says, but what God has made, the earth itself, "The earth is Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof". It is within the range of these operations, just as the work in @Genesis 1 is called the expanse, something that God added
{388}
to what He had at the beginning. This is something that would touch the earth and yet touch infinitude above. "God called the expanse Heavens", It is not said to be good in the sense that the others are, and yet it is included in the general thought of what was called good in the present creation, but it extends up to God and then comes down to where we are. The created heavens are in mind and the air and so forth, indicating that God has a sphere of operations, He has added this great idea of a sphere of operations, and we are included in that. The devil comes into that sphere, which is very solemn, so that we keep ourselves from him.
A.M.H. That is why you pointed out that God does not call it good in totality. It depends upon what comes into it. There is His own work, also Satan's work.
J.T. There is a mixture, and we know it is so. The term mixed condition has been used in earlier days; that is, as to what is actually down here, and what can be separated, or segregated so that God has things for Himself as He pleases. Satan has not the upper hand. How he got into heaven we have to leave, but he did get in, and God accepts that, and has an angel to deal with it, called Michael, an archangel.
E.B. It is very solemn that Satan apparently got into heaven on the very opposite principle to that of keeping commandments, and subjection, for he says, "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High", @Isaiah 14: 14.
J.T. Very good. Still, he will be ousted, because the Lord says, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me" (@John 14: 30); and again, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven", @Luke 10: 18.
E.B.McC. Would you say this position of abiding in Christ can be intelligently held?
{389}
J.T. Quite so. It can be held, because it is not simply that the Lord is holding us; from this point of view it is a question of our being in it, abiding in it. We are selected and we are held there.
F.S. What is the thought in verse 13 in relation to the laying down of His life?
J.T. "No one has greater love than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends". The Lord is aiming at impressing us with the fact that we are His friends, and that He is laying down His life for His friends.
J.C-S. It is the love that does it. It could not be exceeded.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Does it give a kind of direction to the commandment in verse 12?
J.T. "This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you"?
Rem. Yes. It shows how love works out, as it has worked out in Himself.
J.T. Yes. It is the directing that you spoke of. The Lord gives direction. He indicates "as I have loved you", that is how things become intelligible to us; that love is in Christ; it is as He has loved us.
J.C-S. Is that to be the standard in our hearts?
J.T. That is what I would think. "As I have loved you".
A.M.H. Is the thought of His death here as laying down His life for His friends, to put it on the highest elevation before us as beyond the thought of meeting responsibilities so that we will be entirely in liberty before Him, especially as He goes on to speak of having chosen us? I was thinking of Joseph in saying to his brethren, "Be not grieved ... for God sent me before you". That was to relieve them from being occupied with the way they had brought about the position. This is putting a different position before us. I was thinking of the
{390}
Supper. We are not occupied there with His dying for our sins and meeting responsibilities. Would this not more apply, that He laid down His life for us as His friends?
J.T. It brings us on to the ground really of mutual feelings. After the introduction of the Lord's supper, they sang a hymn and went to the mount of Olives. That is to say there was mutual feeling. It does not say that He sang the hymn. It does not say who led the singing; it says that they did it. So that we are in the realm of, you might say, satisfied desire, we are set free. We have been set free in freedom. That would include, I suppose, what we shall have eternally. So He goes on to say in verse 16, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and have set you that ye should go and that ye should bear fruit, and that your fruit should abide, that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give you". Then the idea of love comes in again. "These things I command you, that ye love one another". Perhaps the most difficult thing is to love one another.
A.M.H. There is that which often passes as love which is not distinctly divine in its origin. Love must be divine in its origin, must it not? It must be governed by what God is Himself.
J.T. "Hereby we have known love, because he has laid down His life for us". It was not known before.
V.N.P. You were speaking of that character of love marking us. John in his epistle speaks of the importance of laying down our lives for the brethren.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would this involve our considering, in regard to any matter, how it would affect the question of love among ourselves?
J.T. You are indiscriminate -- it is "love amongst yourselves", so that the question often arises as we
{391}
assemble together, of whom do we think first? I would say the brethren first. They are the ones we are immediately in direct touch with.
A.M.H. Mr. Raven used to say to brothers who said they came to meet the Lord, 'You will not meet the Lord, if you do not meet the brethren first'. They were a little independent, I suppose.
Ques. Would you say our relations with one another are basic, and if we are not happily set together we cannot proceed to higher things?
J.T. We cannot move on. The Lord would say that. Matthew would tell you what to do if your brother has aught against you; that is, to go and be reconciled to him first, and then offer your offering. You cannot have any part in the service of God unless you are reconciled to the brethren; if there is anything out of joint the matter must be settled.
J.C-S. So that as we come together in assembly, the Lord would, so to speak, stand by and give us an opportunity to embrace one another before we embrace Him?
J.T. He would. He would say, I would like to see you do this among yourselves. See how you get together, and therefore the Lord is not there really immediately at first. It is we who come together. The disciples come together. "We being assembled", Luke says, "to break bread", @Acts 20: 7. That is the first thing. The Lord is ready to be there with us, but only as conditions are made attractive to Him.
R.R.T. Would it be right to say of verse 12 where it says, "This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you", that this is a statement of the light of the position; that is "my commandment"? In verse 17 it goes further, "These things I command you, that ye love one another". Having the light of the position, it becomes imperative that we should act in that light.
{392}
J.T. The Lord having recourse to the idea of commandment? Why not? He has the right to command and He is just using it to bring in love among ourselves. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", not 'love to Me' there, but "love amongst yourselves".
L.M. Would the Lord's commandment as to loving one another enter into what we ask the Father?
J.T. Yes. The Lord would encourage that, I am sure, and His Father also, that the brethren should love one another.
A.M.H. I would like to know as to fruit. Has it two bearings, one as something for the Father's pleasure, and the other as it works out amongst us and becomes testimony to men? That is to say, that the Father is the Cultivator of the vine, which would mean that He is looking for something for His own heart. Then on the other hand, they become disciples by bearing much fruit. Would that be something more public as men see it?
J.T. Just so.
Ques. The Lord has not commanded us to do something that we cannot do, has He? He tells us to love one another. It is a thing we can do.
J.T. Yes. We are capable of doing it. We are born again, that is the basis of it. This involves a new kind of state for we are born throughout; and then the Spirit coming in on the ground of redemption is the power for everything. So that we have established down here what is equal to what is in heaven.
E.B. And has the expression, "one another", the idea in it of being indiscriminate? I think you used that word; that is, not partial.
J.T. Quite so, one another. Whether it is a question of colour or of status of life or education,
{393}
whatever might be mentioned, it is covered by the idea of one another. Love one another.
Rem. So that natural affinities do not enter into it.
J.T. No. It is a question of what is effected in us; the basis is new birth. That is the point in @John 3. The Lord did not trust the many that were affected by His signs and His works. There must be the new birth. "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God". He *cannot*. But then as entering into it, he is already in the sphere of divine operations, as we have been saying, the expanse, which is suggestive of a very wide area, but still it is not too wide for God. It is where He is operating. The new birth brings us into it.
R.H.C. Would John's reference in the epistle bear upon it, "every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him"?
J.T. Very good. John in the epistle, I suppose, is breaking up the truth of the gospel. He is bringing it down to us in the most immediate way.
G.G. Have we certain obligations to love the brethren? "We also *ought* to love one another", @John 4: 11.
J.T. Obligation is a good word.
E.B. Does it the more exist because we are surrounded by a system of hatred, the product of satanic operations, I suppose?
J.T. Terrible thought. And yet we are enabled to go on in spite of it. That is the great thought you get especially in John's writings; it means going on in spite of the system of hatred. Love has been introduced in Christ, love unto death.
E.T. There will be an increased need for loving one another in view of the hatred increasing.
J.T. Just so. Then the idea of loving one another is augmented greatly by the fact that the brethren generally are lovable. They are lovable people.
{394}
One has been impressed with that, coming from the northern regions and making contact with what God has in Great Britain, what God has in Africa, what God has in Australia, what God has here. How lovable the work of God causes people to be!
Rem. I think you have said elsewhere that as one is increased in the capacity to love, so one becomes lovable.
J.T. Quite so. I think that brings out what heaven will be; it is infinite in the bearing of it, the constant attractiveness in every one present.
W.S. "*We* love him because *he* has first loved us".
J.T. He set the thing going. To say a word as to the Spirit in the passage would perhaps give a sort of finish to what we have before us. Verse 26 says, "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, *he* shall bear witness concerning me; and ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from the beginning". That is to say the Spirit is brought in here as bearing witness. He is called the Comforter, which is a word occurring in chapter 14. It is a very strong word, a very powerful word as entering into the realm of which we are speaking. The Comforter on earth is equal to what is in heaven. "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father". The word "from the Father" there is evidently, according to what we learn elsewhere, "from *with* the Father". It is a question of the condition that is there, the relations between the Father and the Spirit, how Christ is a theme between Them. So that "when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, *he* shall bear witness concerning me". That is to say, the Spirit comes out from the Father, that wonderful sphere in which the Father and the Spirit both operate,
{395}
and the theme of Both is Christ. And then the brethren themselves, the disciples, are also witnesses alongside the blessed Spirit; and all bearing testimony to Christ.
M.B. Is the testimony as to what came out in Him here? Does that answer the question as to the fruit being first for the Father, and then for witness to men?
J.T. Yes. It is what proceeded between the Father and the Spirit that is in mind in what is said here in the verses read regarding the Comforter; and that also enters into the position of the disciples, the eleven, they bore witness too, because they had been with Him from the beginning; that is to say, they were witnesses of everything that came out in Him. As the Spirit was witness to what is in heaven, they were witnesses here on earth, because Christ had come to earth, He was in their very midst. So he said, "Ye too (the"Ye"is emphatic) bear witness, because ye are with me from the beginning", so that they are constituted witnesses alongside of the Spirit, showing the nearness of what is of the assembly to the divine Persons.
F.S. So is the truth a living thing, then?
J.T. Quite so, it is in living persons. "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father". The Spirit is here called "the Spirit of truth" -- a very strong expression.
{396}
ANGELIC SERVICE
@Acts 10: 1 - 48
J.T. This chapter introduces the gentiles. It is a testimony of God, and what impressed one is the spirituality of the facts presented. Beings outside of divine Persons are employed in the service, such as the angel, then Peter himself, and others, all contributing to this, as if it was divinely intended that the gentiles should be brought into a spiritual condition and state of things, not what had obtained in Israel, a legal condition, but a spiritual condition. The man in question, that is Cornelius, is introduced as having certain characteristics which were intended to accredit the whole position. He is said to be "pious, and fearing God with all his house, both giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually". Then it is said he "saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius. But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God". So that the person involved is evidently a marked subject of the Spirit's work, and having moral conditions too, as described in what habitually marked him; that is to say he was pious and feared God with all his house, gave alms to the people, and supplicated God continually.
A.J.G. These features of piety and the fear of God marked him before he received the Spirit. Are you suggesting that they indicate a certain moral foundation to spirituality?
J.T. I thought that, exactly. The facts indicate that though he had not received the Spirit as yet, he was already a subject of the work of the Spirit.
{397}
That is to say the Spirit has to be apprehended as working in us before we receive Him formally, as having believed in the redemptive work of Christ.
Rem. This would be the evidence that the Spirit had already worked in him.
J.T. That is what I thought. He is presented in this way before he is said to have the Spirit, because the fact that he received the Spirit is not stated until we come to verse 44. But we get these characteristics, that he was pious, and fearing God with all his house, and giving much alms to the people; and then the visitor to him is an angel. It is not the direct visitation of the Spirit, but an angel; and then as the narrative proceeds we are told that Peter went up to the house-top and became in an ecstasy and saw certain things, which are recorded in verses 11 to 16, and then it is said, in verse 19, that as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because I have sent them". So the Spirit of God is Himself engaged in the transaction not simply as sent, but Himself, as a divine Person, is engaged in the transaction.
S.C. Is it in your mind to draw attention to the objective side in regard of the Spirit?
J.T. That is just what I was thinking. It is the objective side. The Spirit is to be regarded in the book of Acts as a divine Person acting.
J.C-S. So that what the various actors in this chapter do is all co-ordinated to the great end of bringing in the gentiles in a spiritual way?
J.T. In a spiritual way, and giving full place to the Holy Spirit as leading in the transaction, as also indicated in chapter 13 in regard of Paul and Barnabas.
A.J.C. Is it the same with us as we invite divine intervention?
{398}
J.T. Well, I am not sure why you say that.
A.J.C. You were referring to Cornelius as being continuous in prayer and Peter pondering, so that I thought in this way they invited divine intervention.
J.T. Well, you can hardly say that according to the facts. Cornelius is said to have had the qualities which are the fruit of the Spirit's working in a man before he receives the Spirit, and then he is directed what to do by an angel. Cornelius said, "What is it, Lord?" and the answer is, "Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God". What is stressed is his prayers and his alms. The actual intervention is *direct* from God, I would say. It is direct divine intervention. Peter is the instrumentality of it eventually according to what is indicated earlier. He had the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. He had opened to the Jews earlier, and now he opens to the gentiles.
Rem. It is not the Spirit that speaks to Cornelius, but an angel.
J.T. That is right. The angel is one who is sent out to minister. "Are they not all ministering spirits?" @Hebrews 1: 14. They are not divine Persons, they are not men, they are spirits, and they are ministering.
F.W. Does that emphasise that the movement is now from heaven entirely?
J.T. I thought that was important, especially because of our brother's question as to whether the intervention was invited.
J.C-S. Do you take it that the conditions, commended in Cornelius, were the product of the Spirit Himself in him?
J.T. Yes, only recognising clearly what God had done in the man. The things that are mentioned are the fruit of the Spirit's work before the Spirit is received; that is to say, it is a question of new birth. As the scripture says, already he was a pious
{399}
man, and fearing God with all his house. He had his house under control, and then moreover he gave much alms to the people and supplicated God continually, but we are not told what the thing was that he asked for from the Lord. I say that, for it is right to keep the facts in mind, in that the facts indicate divine intervention among the gentiles, as Paul said later, "this salvation of God has been sent to the nations; *they* also will hear it", @Acts 28: 28.
J.C-S. So it is merely an extension of the work of God on earth, an extension to the gentiles?
J.T. Yes. And we being gentiles here today, I suppose all of us, the question is whether we are taking on these spiritual features, including recognition of angels; first of all recognising what the new birth means, what it implies, but then what angelic service means, and then what the direct service of the Spirit Himself, the Spirit of God, implies, because He speaks of Himself as sending the men to Peter. He says to Peter, "Because I have sent them"; so that the Spirit of God Himself sent those men to Peter.
J.C-S. So that the Spirit in that way was really assuming charge of matters here, was He?
J.T. That is the thing to see, the place He has in the economy, which perhaps is more or less obscure in our way of thinking.
R.R.T. Chapter 13 has a similar thought. The Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". "They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit". Is that a similar thought?
J.T. It is a fuller thought really, I think, a fuller thought as to ministry, but attention is called to the Spirit, both as to His intervention in the case of Cornelius, and then the ministry that flows out from such as Paul and Barnabas, because they are sent
{400}
out by the Spirit. Therefore what is called missionary work, through missionary organisations in the world, is hardly in keeping with these facts, because the true missionaries, the servants who go out in the gospel, are sent by the Spirit, directly sent by the Holy Spirit, not by men, but by the Spirit.
F.W. Does that mean that in these arrangements which men make the fact of new birth is really ignored?
J.T. And I think the fact of the Spirit being in the position of sending is ignored also, because in the human organisations called churches, men assume the place of the Spirit, in that men, such as bishops ordain others who thus enter nominally into the service of God, whereas it is a question of the Holy Spirit doing these things.
E.B. Then would it be right to say that the assembly, and its completion by the incorporation of the gentiles into it, was distinctly in the mind of the Spirit?
J.T. I should say so, nothing is more plainly taught in the chapter than that.
J.C-S. Do you regard this chapter as preparing the way for the unification of the work of God under Paul?
J.T. Well, it is. All that has been effected first in Peter and the other eleven apostles is taken account of in this chapter, so that it is not really a separate work, it is all one work, the work of the Holy Spirit.
A.T.S. Is the reference in verse 5 to Peter's surname intended to draw attention to the divine work in him?
J.T. I am sure that is so. Peter is the spiritual name that he receives; it is given in two languages, Greek and Aramaic. It is a spiritual thought; it means material for the assembly.
{401}
J.C-S. Does it suggest that what is going to be introduced from among the gentiles is not to be on a lower level than that?
J.T. Quite so. That is clearly the case; the epistle to the Ephesians contemplates Jew and gentile brought together, but Romans contemplates the Jew first, which is to be observed too; but at the end of this book Paul announces that the salvation of God was sent to the gentiles. Now the particular place that the Jew has or had is dropped, for we hardly have any Jews now, yet we have the assembly; in fact the assembly is more stressed than ever.
J.C-S. We cannot have any right conception of the assembly apart from the Spirit and apprehending the spiritual nature of it, do you think?
J.T. So the spiritual nature of it applies to the one body. "There is one body and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all", @Ephesians 4: 4 - 6. Great stress is laid on the unity of the Spirit.
Ques. Is this something that we should seek to have, the definite direction of the angel, and then greater still the definite direction of the Spirit?
J.T. That is very good. I am very glad you brought that out, because angelic service is not thought of very much, and yet we are sharing in it every day. It is a question of the governmental service of God.
A.J.G. Do you mean that we need to be spiritual to discern it?
J.T. I think so. Why not discern it in our prayers, because the angels are sent out to minister on account of those who shall be heirs of salvation.
R.G.C. If we are under the direction of the Spirit our attention will be drawn to the treasure hid in the field?
{402}
J.T. Well, we see more particularly governmental action, keeping us free from the enemy's power which would interfere with the work of God; governmental action controlling things for us such as trade unionism and all that. In these southern countries in which we are, trade unionism has acquired more power than anywhere else, and why should it be? These countries are almost entirely of British descent. Why should it be that such a condition of things should prevail in these parts? All that is peculiarly advantageous to the British nation is thrown to the winds in trade unionism. I am not raising the question of *what* precisely we may count on in that sense, but we are entitled to count on the provisional actings of God because of the nation of which we are, and the advantages the nation has had all these centuries in the ways of God.
A.J.G. So that the ministering spirits are sent forth from God to keep the way open, so to speak, for the development of His work at the present time.
J.T. To keep the way open. That is what I would say. They are not the agents directly of spiritual service as the Spirit is, or the gifts of the Spirit are, but the angels are the direct agents of God in the government of this world. Because it is "One God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all", and the angels are His ministers to this end.
J.C-S. So that they often place limitations upon a certain procedure, and indeed remove obstacles, do you think?
J.T. Quite so, such as the cessation of the war; it was a miracle really, but a miracle in this sense, that so much happened in such a short time, which looked to be the very opposite to what might have been expected. It was God acting. And now we are faced with the conditions arising from combinations
{403}
of men, dating back to @Genesis 11; that is to say, to Babel. These conditions have arisen, and they have taken more root in these countries than they have anywhere. Why should it be? It is a question for us who are living here, who are residing here, to find out why it is so.
A.J.G. And to imitate Cornelius¬ example in supplicating God continually?
J.T. Very good. Continually.
Ques. Do you think that the enemy had in mind to attack the expression of the assembly in these parts?
J.T. He certainly had, because God is working, and Satan wants to defeat what God is doing; and we have to take it to heart as to what can be done in testifying to what is right in these conditions. Why should men and women be disallowed to earn their living in the ordinary sense, because of these arbitrary conditions that have arisen? The master takes the place of the servant and the servant takes the place of the master according to these conditions. Is it because we are neglecting this idea of piety, of bringing God into these things, because God may frustrate them, and is doing it too, in measure. He is doing it in other countries, especially in America. We should have these characteristics peculiarly, but this intervention of God is seen there, and it was seen too, in the recent war. Well then, the question is whether we are supplicating God about these things.
J.C-S. It may be that we have taken them as a matter of course without really seeing that there are facilities at the disposal of God to check it.
J.T. That is just the point. Our point would be to supplicate God night and day continually.
G.G. Would the thought of suffering be needed? We must be ready to suffer.
{404}
J.T. That is it. That is a good point too, because God has appointed that we are to suffer. It is given to us on behalf of Christ not only to believe on Him but to suffer for His sake.
A.J.G. Then would the testing conditions that these matters bring in be used to develop in the saints the piety that is necessary, as an underlying basis for spirituality?
J.T. Quite so. So that we pray; we can tell as we go back to the very beginning of Acts how God came in governmentally. In @Acts 12 He came in in a most remarkable way in the case of Peter himself, opening the door of the prison for him, and there are other instances of that kind.
R.R.T. It was an angel that smote Herod so that he was eaten of worms in that same chapter.
J.T. Very good.
E.H.B. Is it interesting in regard to Cornelius that God took up a man that was a servant of what was set up of God in the way of government?
J.T. Quite so. The Roman Empire was used of God. God took it up instead of Israel, and hid His face from the house of Jacob. God took up the government that He had ordained in this world, and always the leading one. First it was the Babylonians, and then the Persians, and then the Grecians, and then Rome. These were all ordained of God, and this man Cornelius was an agent of the Roman power.
E.B. Are you suggesting that, while we would seek to be preserved from any political entanglements, the saints are under obligation to what is of God and to men generally, to utilise their place of intercession with God as having the Spirit?
J.T. Just so. So that @Romans 13 tells us that "the powers that be are ordained of God". They are agents of God for good. The authority "is God's minister *to thee* for good", and of course we continue
{405}
to pray for authorities, but carefully avoid being political in that sense, for we belong to heaven. Our politics are in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour.
A.McK.H. In @Daniel 10: 13, it says that "the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me".
J.T. That is a good word. We have already alluded to Michael. He was an archangel, and he contended with the devil in regard to the body of Moses, showing that even our bodies come under angelic service.
H.H. Daniel had been praying three weeks. Do you think the three weeks of Daniel's prayers fitted in with the time this angel was detained? I was thinking of what you were saying as to prayer. Daniel in answer to his prayers, is given understanding by an angel as to the whole course of God's ways with His people down to the end.
J.T. That is right. All these things are most instructive, and come down to our every-day service as to our prayers. God is available to us, and how great indeed that these great beings, angels, sometimes called men, are available for that kind of service!
S.C. Could you help us in regard to Peter's prayer here? "On the morrow, as these were journeying and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the house to pray, about the sixth hour" (verse 9).
J.T. We are not told what he prayed about, but he went up on the house to pray, showing that if we have an hour to spare, we can have recourse to prayer in that hour. It would appear that they were preparing the meal. It says, verse 10, "and he became hungry and desired to eat. But as they were making ready an ecstasy came upon him: and he beholds the heaven opened"; that is, they
{406}
were making ready for the meal, I would think. He had time on his hands, and he went and used that time in prayer, but we are not told what he prayed for.
J.C-S. There seems a kind of affinity between what Peter was doing and what Cornelius had been doing.
J.T. Quite so. Well, as we proceed now we come to a very important incident. Peter himself was ready for the persons who had been sent to him. It says in verses 21 and 22, "Peter going down to the men said, Behold *I* am he whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye come? And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man", and so on. They give an account of what happened to Cornelius and then it says, "having therefore invited them in, he lodged them". Another thing that comes to our notice, worth speaking of, is that a servant like Peter had liberty where he was staying, to invite into that house, showing the place that the servants of Christ ought to have in houses in the service. "He invited them in", it says. He did not go to Simon, the occupant of the house, to invite them in; *he* invited them in and lodged them.
J.C-S. That would suggest that the house was sympathetic with Peter, in what he was doing.
J.T. Quite so. Such houses are part of the system that God is going on with, the economy, in which God is operating, Christian households like Lydia's and like this one. Peter was staying there, and it was just part of the system so that it could be used, as it says in verse 23, "having therefore invited them in, he lodged them". Notice that, Peter did it.
S.C. Paul and Silas instinctively went to the house of Lydia after their release from prison, did they not?
{407}
J.T. Quite so. They knew that the house was open to them. Such houses belong to the system, the economy, that God has brought in. So it is a question, if we are inviting and entertaining the brethren in the Lord's service, is the house available to them as part of the divine system?
A.J.G. Are not the persons and houses in the system very important as practical support to what is spiritual in the presence of what is hostile?
J.T. Quite so, and how important that is, when you think of all these organisations that men have built up, especially the place they have in these countries down here in the south. Yet I do not know where God's work is more prospered than it is in these very parts, showing us the real conflict that is on, and the conflict must be centring in prayer. The prayer-system is a system too, because it is a question of what God has set up in Christ in heaven, the great High Priest.
H.H. Is it not remarkable that the Lord has sent so many of His servants here to Australasia at the present time? Do you think that has a link with Peter himself as to heavenly truth in the testimony?
J.T. We need to be sure that we are sent, of course, each of us, so the word is, "Here am I; send me". It certainly is encouraging to think of the number that there are available at the present time to visit the saints in different parts of the world.
F.W. Is all this heavenly intervention needed to make room for the activity of the Spirit?
J.T. Well, I think it well to keep in mind the part that heaven has in these matters. It struck me today, and it has never struck me more than this very minute, the power that the angels have in the service of God, and how much place they should have in our prayers. Even the Lord Himself was ministered to by angels. He speaks of them, saying
{408}
that He could call upon His Father, and He would furnish Him more than twelve legions of angels; (@Matthew 26: 53).
F.W. So that our prayer would hardly be for the alleviation of difficult circumstances, but that the work of God might go on, there being room made for the Spirit.
J.T. That would mean that angelic service enters into it, making way for the Spirit. Angelic service has entered into the wars which have been fought; there have been two wars which have greatly affected the testimony of God, extending back to 1914. The effect of these wars is still current, and intended by the devil to interfere with the work of God; but angelic service is a great matter to have in mind, because certain men have been used by God to bring the war to an end. God does that, but He does it, I am sure, at the solicitation of His people.
Rem. So that He might make a way through for us by angelic intervention.
J.T. Well, that is the point.
J.C-S. Perhaps in our minds we have made much of the spiritual character of the assembly, and have overlooked the fact that this runs alongside of it.
J.T. I certainly think we have overlooked the great service of angels. They existed before men, they were there at the creation of the earth: "The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy", @@Job 38: 7. And their service has continued ever since.
A.J.G. And does not the fact that they are all sent forth to minister to the heirs of salvation, only emphasise the importance of what God is doing at the present time?
J.T. Just so. We cannot tell how many there are, they are innumerable. One angel, we have
{409}
often remarked, destroyed 185,000 men at once in the early days (@2 Kings 19: 35).
V.N.P. It is reassuring to take account of angelic power, and then the power of the Holy Spirit.
J.T. The two ministries are to be kept in mind. I believe what the Lord is directing us to today is the ministry of angels, whether we are keeping it in mind or not. Of course, we never think of obscuring the ministry of the Holy Spirit, but I am certain we have obscured in our minds the ministry of angels.
J.C-S. Probably our circumstances in the Southern Hemisphere in relation to the matters you mentioned might have been different if we had given place to it.
J.T. Well, that is just the question. I believe it is so, too.
E.L. Is the ministry of angels connected with God's indirect dealings?
J.T. That is correct, although what we have before us now is *direct*, because the Spirit of God says, "I have sent them". "But as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because I have sent them" (verses 19 and 20). Well now, the three men were sent by the angel. Cornelius says to the angel (verse 4), "What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa". That is to say, Cornelius is directed by the angel to send men to Joppa, and the Spirit takes it up saying He had sent them, showing how the two ministries are inter-related.
A.J.G. And the men, in speaking to Peter, combined them; they say, "Cornelius ... has been divinely instructed by a holy angel" (verse 22).
{410}
J.T. Very good, I am glad you mention that, it shows the respect for the holy angel. The second epistle to the Thessalonians stresses the idea of the Lord coming with the angels of His power. And then again we read in Jude of the holy myriads. The book of Revelation needs only be alluded to in this respect because angels are so active in it.
R.R.T. Cornelius had been divinely instructed by an angel, but it would seem as though the angel could not complete the instruction; it was necessary that Peter should be sent for, so that they might hear words and instruction from him beyond what the angel could give.
J.T. Very good. So the angels do not go so far as apostles do, or ministers of Christ who have gift. Angels are not said to have gift as men have. The law was given by Moses, ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator. They have part in the giving of the law, but they are not said to have direct part in the introduction of Christianity. It is a question of the apostles whom the Lord had chosen.
Ques. So Paul's ministry is in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. That is right. The Lord Jesus has given gifts to men, and they are used in the inauguration of Christianity, but angels are not, they are ministering spirits, however, to all those who are heirs of salvation.
V.N.P. Why does it refer to joy in the presence of the angels of God, over one repenting sinner?
J.T. Well, that shows they are sympathetic attendants, and so they desire to look into these things, as we are told in the first epistle of Peter. Angels desire to look into things, showing how sympathetic they are.
J.C-S. So that the service of angels makes way for the spiritual ministry that comes along, and, as
{411}
it were, it subsides then, though it still continues merging in the other, so to speak.
J.T. Just so. The merging is seen in verse 44; I mean the direct merging and action of the Spirit. "While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were *hearing* the word". Notice the two words used there, one is plural, "these words", and then, "those who were hearing the word", which refers to what is in the mind of God. And then it says further, "And the faithful of the circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that upon the nations also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out: for they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God", so that the direct work of the Spirit is now in mind. Then in verse 47 we read, "Then Peter answered, Can any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as *we* also did?" "And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord".
J.C-S. That is, they were not coming in on any lower ground, were they?
J.T. Very good.
E.B. Would it be right to think of those who have come to this place from distances, some very great distances, that the angels have served in bringing us together, some from overseas, and many from distances by land? Could all that enter into our prayers thankfully to God?
J.T. Quite so. How important that is, because in view of the meetings that have been held during the past years the brethren have travelled through all parts of the earth to attend them, and we are bound to count on angelic service in such movements, whether it be by ships or planes or trains or whatever it be. The angels have attended to these matters, in the order that is kept in some sense in the world, so that we can travel about without being
{412}
molested. We have to give thanks to God that through angelic ministry He protects us.
F.D.A. There is perfect timing here. We have often proved that in brethren moving about, the perfect timing in their arriving at their destinations.
J.T. Yes, very good. Some of us will be waiting now weeks before we can get a ship to go back to our places where we live. That has happened often in these parts, but if we keep on praying God helps us. There is nothing really more comforting than that, in all these details.
A.J.G. Would you say that the fact that the present dispensation is characterised by the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit means that God Himself has entered into the dispensation feelingly?
J.T. Just so. These angels too, are feeling. They were in existence before men, of course, and they are called sons of God. It is a comforting thing, because it implies the dignity that belongs to them.
R.F. They were also in activity at the birth of Christ.
J.T. Just so.
Rem. Two angels were active in taking Lot out of Sodom.
J.T. Very good.
J.C-S. The gift of the Holy Spirit was *poured out*.
J.T. That is what Paul says in his epistle to Titus; Paul's ministry to Titus is that very thing. "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour", @Titus 3: 4 - 6. It shows the liberality of the love behind it all, its pouring out, plenty of it. Why should we be without the Spirit therefore?
{413}
A.J.G. Would you say a word as to why, when the Spirit itself was given on the day of Pentecost, Peter said of the Lord, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear". Why is it put in that way? He received the Spirit of the Father and then poured it out?
J.T. It would be an administrative thought, the Lord being the Administrator of everything directly, so that in the giving, the Spirit is poured out.
A.J.G. And the Father being recognised in the supreme place in the economy?
J.T. That is what I thought.
H.H. Would this chapter 10 take into account that the Holy Spirit is already on the earth?
J.T. Quite so. He has already been given, poured out. So that as has already been remarked, there is no inferiority in those coming in now in this chapter. The Spirit is here. It is the same Spirit. It is the Spirit that is here on earth that is given in that sense. The Lord Jesus gave Him at the first, and He is here ever since.
E.B. Would the fact that the Holy Spirit is mentioned here so plainly prevent us from being satisfied with the benefits of angelic service? We might be very well satisfied to settle down with the providential care of God, but we do not rightly take it up unless it frees us for what is spiritual, would you say?
J.T. I am sure. So that Ephesians gives us the full thought. We are said to be "fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone, in whom all the building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord; in whom *ye* also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit". These
{414}
are the most exalted thoughts, I think, that we get as to what we are brought into. It is no question of angelic service now, but the Spirit and the habitation of God *in* Spirit.
F.W. So you remarked earlier that @Acts 10 gives us the bringing of the gentiles into this.
J.T. That is right.
J.C-S. So that Ephesians would give us the full development of the mystery.
J.T. Yes. The angels do not come into that, they are just ministering servants, whereas we are sons in the house, Christ being Son over it.
E.B-s. And the Spirit's voice is being heard in the assemblies.
J.T. Quite so. "The Spirit speaks expressly", for instance; He speaks in the house.
{415}
THE PROMOTION OF SPIRITUALITY
@John 20: 19; @Mark 5: 22 - 24, 35 - 43; @Acts 9: 36 - 42
One is encouraged and thankful for the kind sympathy that one is conscious of in the hearts of the brethren, and one counts on God to enable him to serve them. With this in mind I have read these three scriptures. What they convey to one's mind is the promotion of spirituality, and in view of the conditions in which we are, this will apply to what is negative as well as to what is positive. The negative side is expressed in the first scripture in that the doors were shut for fear of the Jews. In the second, that is in @Mark 5, we have another example of this. The subject in mind there is the child of twelve years old who was healed by the Lord Jesus; and it is said that certain who were in the house where she was, were put out by the Lord. He put them all out; that is, those that derided Him. Not that He acted in violence, far otherwise. What He intended was the promotion of what was of God in those that were there; that is, to promote spirituality. The third scripture has the same thought in it. Dorcas was dead, as indeed the child was dead. According to the scripture read Dorcas was dead, and Peter was sent for in view of her being raised up; and he put all the widows out; he put out those who were weeping and wailing as if they would by their presence and ways, prevent spirituality. I do not go so far as to say they would prevent salvation, or the work of the gospel. I am just confining my remarks to the prevention of spirituality, and the promotion of spirituality.
Well, now coming to the first scripture it is a question of the assembly. You will understand, dear brethren, that I have a peculiar feeling of joy when I mention the word assembly. It is a word that
{416}
as used in Scripture properly belongs to Christians. It is a word that is used in the world, but as used in Scripture it is the property of Christians. We have, as Christians, peculiar title to the use of the word, and I refer to verse 19 of @John 20 to show how what is presented there affords opportunity for the working out of assembly operations, of assembly results, particularly of spirituality. The worker, the operator, as it has often been mentioned, was a woman. I do not say that the Lord was not operating, for He was, but the person in mind particularly now, and who was in the Lord's mind, too, at that time, is Mary Magdalene. She is a sister out of whom the Lord had cast seven demons; she had been in bad company, in bad service and doing bad work, serving sin; but now she is rescued, and in the Lord's service in a peculiar way. She had been much affected by the Lord's disappearance from view; it was fully in her mind that He had died and now she is recovered, she is secured, according to the verses preceding verse 19, for the Lord in His service. Hers was an extraordinary service, one rarely done by a woman; that is, the service in the assembly. Of course you will understand that all the sisters here are afforded the opportunity of serving in the assembly, because it is the proper sphere for us. Whether we are brothers or sisters we are to serve, and there is much to be done; but I speak of what she did in the sense of an industrious woman. Not that she had yet shown much of this, but she did eventually I am sure, and already was doing so; that is to say, she had already begun and was now occupied industriously in the Lord's service and for the assembly, for the benefit of the assembly.
The type that I would bring forward as to her for the moment, dear brethren, is in the last chapter of the book of Proverbs. It is what is called an
{417}
alphabetical chapter because the section referring to the virtuous woman is written on the principle of making the first letter of each verse follow in the order of the Hebrew alphabet. The woman in that chapter became a model of industry in the service of the Lord. She is called a virtuous woman. "Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies". We have a description of her from verse 10 to the end, and it aptly illustrates, dear brethren, what is needed in assembly service, not service by persons who have gift specially, but by persons who love the Lord Jesus. That is what really marked Mary. She loved the Lord; and I need hardly remark on this that it is a matter of primary importance that we should love the Lord. You may say, Well, that is very general. It is, but what is less general is loving His appearing. And I would challenge everybody as to whether he loves the Lord, but also as to whether he loves the Lord's appearing. There is a special tribute paid to all those who love the Lord's appearing.
Now, coming down to Mary I would regard her in this sense as marked by industry, by industriously serving the saints. Not simply serving one of them, but serving them as such characteristically; because she was one of them, and the Lord knew she was of them, and as of them she called the Lord by the name of "Rabboni". She gave Him that name, and it had a meaning, and her use of it implied that she had learned from Him. He was her Instructor, and that is what she meant to say; that is what He was, He was her Instructor. The question for everyone here tonight to answer is, Who is our instructor in the things of God? It is no question of the things of this world, or the sciences of this world, but the things of God. Who is instructing you in the things of God? Mary had decided as to who should instruct her, so she called the Lord Jesus by a
{418}
name that indicated that *He* was her Instructor. So you see what a place she has, beloved brethren, and how important and how right that the consideration of her should enter into a meeting of this kind, so that we should be learners and quick learners, because the time is short. We should learn to do things, but learn them well, and learn quickly, because they *are* to be learned quickly, and they *may* be learned quickly. If we are not quick learners there is something lacking with us, because the matter that we are engaged in is so necessary and urgent, so profound, so wonderful. Mary was one of these learners and she had to do with the disciples, and she was effective. She was sent indeed to them with a message, and I would venture to say that she in measure gave character to them as they were together at that particular time. The Lord had given her a message for them, and that message was intended to characterise them, and it did; but she was the instrument of the message. She thus affords an example for every one of us, specially sisters, at such a time as this.
Well, now I come down to the point before us in the passage; that is, promotion of spirituality. If this is to be the result in our services, we are to learn to shut the doors; not simply the door, but the doors, the word is in the plural. It is, of course, easy enough to convey the idea of shutting a door, but to shut doors is more general, and sometimes more laborious, and would involve more care, more work, where the number is not mentioned; and the number is not mentioned here. The doors were shut and we are told why, it was for fear of the Jews, meaning that the Jews would influence the meeting. It was a meeting of the Lord's people, of those who believed on Him. It was a meeting of such persons and the Lord came because they were there. He did not come to an empty room, He came because they
{419}
were there. It says "where the disciples were". And so the doors were shut. Whether she had anything to do with the shutting of the doors I am not saying, but I am saying that somebody had to do with it. It was evidently part of the needed service to be rendered, in view of the meeting in prospect, that there should be no Jews there. They were not simply men called Jews, but persons of a peculiar religious character and characteristics, such as would spoil such a meeting for which the disciples had come. Then the Lord was come too, not indeed that they had expected Him formally, but He had in His mind to come, and He did come. I am not saying that Mary had in mind that the doors should be shut, or that she had done it, or that she had indicated that it should be done; but anyway it was done, and she had given the message, she brought the message to the disciples; and these are the facts.
What I am saying now has to be used for instruction by each of us, if indeed he is at all interested, because it is a most interesting matter. That is, how to assemble where the Lord Jesus is about to come, and if there be anything to be attended to negatively, it is not left unattended to, it is attended to, that is the point. And hence there were results, because it is quite obvious that the brethren there were promoted in their spiritual thoughts, and I hope that what I am saying tonight will help each one here in this fairly large number of brethren, that there will be some promotion of spiritual thoughts in every one of us. And so it says "The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord". It was not a mere curious gladness: but it was real gladness, because they loved Him, and they were glad to see Him. And He said to them "Peace be to you". That was His thought for them. Their thought was that they were glad to see Him, and they were. His thought was that they should have peace, and He
{420}
said it twice. "Peace be to you". There were, of course, many other things that He did, He breathed into them which was a portentous matter, a very great matter, a matter that would have effective results ultimately. "He breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit". It was not simply that He would give them the Holy Spirit, but that they should actually receive the Holy Spirit. This is a very great matter, and one has to challenge the brethren as to whether he or she has, whether all of us have received the Holy Spirit because we cannot be in the assembly aside from receiving the Holy Spirit. Well, now I need not say much more on this passage because the whole matter is simple; most here know all about what I am saying and therefore everyone, I believe, is capable of taking it in, and perhaps enjoying it. And so the meeting starts; it is the inauguration, I might say, from John's point of view, of the assembly. John, however, speaks rather of those who form it, and there is quite a difference to be understood between the assembly itself and those who form it. I do not say that John speaks of it as formed, he does not speak formally of it at all, he does not even use the word in his gospel, but he does speak of the persons who form it being together. There were very few of them, of course, but they were there, and they were glad they were there, and it is said that they were glad when they saw the Lord, and they got the word from Him, "Peace be to you".
Well, now I want to go on to the second scripture read which is not an assembly matter, not exactly even a household matter, although it is recorded of a household. It is a matter for gift, a matter in which gifted men are to serve; hence in the facts mentioned it is said that Jairus, who is the subject of the narrative, had his little daughter very ill, at extremity, he said. She was about to die, and he begged the Lord
{421}
to come to her and lay His hands on her, and the Lord immediately went with him, but He took Peter and James and John with Him. That is why I said it was a matter of gift, of men who as having gift can serve the Lord on that principle. Gift is a wonderful matter; it is a question of what the Lord Jesus, having gone into heaven, has received from the Father. He has gone in and He has received gifts for men. It is a question of the means of working out what God has in mind in view of the assembly, but I am not now speaking of the assembly as such. I am speaking of what came out in this household. There is a girl in it who is dead, who may be part of the assembly in time; but she is dead, and she comes in for this line of teaching that is now in mind. I want to enlarge on it so that the brethren might profit. These gifted men must go with Him, the Lord would have them to go, He takes them on first. He takes on the mother and the father of the child afterwards, but He takes on these three men first. It is a question of gifted men, of men who can be used, as having gift which the Lord gives from heaven. He gives gifts to men, and that is why I am stressing the point of gifted men, and how they are to be used. Their gifts are not to be used as toys, or as making much of themselves, they are to be used for the promotion of spiritual power and spirituality, and too for the help of persons who have fallen under the power of sin or death; in this case the child had fallen under the power of death. The father said that she had actually died, but then the Lord said "the child has not died, but sleeps".
Now I want to remark on the importance of gift, and how the Lord selects gift, and how when He comes to the house He selects these men. After He heard about the child being dead He comes to the house, it was not far away, apparently, and then we have a selection of these men, as if they were needed
{422}
at this particular time. So the matter proceeds and we are told that certain ones derided the Lord. A terrible thing that there should be a condition of derision when we are dealing with the things of God, the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, His death, His burial, His resurrection, and His ascension to heaven, and all else that enters into the truth of the gospel. It is a terrible thing that there should be found derision in a city like this, but it is so, and it is actually in the house in this chapter, but the Lord put the deriders out. That is my point in this passage. The doors were shut in the first, and these deriding people are put out here. The Lord did it. If we look into the gospels, we find that Matthew says they were put out, without saying who did it; but Mark says that the Lord did it. Then the Lord selected the father and mother of the child and He said to her, "Talitha koumi, which is, interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, Arise". The Lord used those words and she arose and walked. You may say, Why do you say that she walked? Well, because she did, and she was old enough to be regarded in the light of being able to walk. She was not simply a babe or a little child, she was a girl and therefore the question arises as to whether she was fit for fellowship; because what I am dealing with, dear brethren, is spirituality, and we must have intelligence before spirituality, and now this girl is evidently ready for fellowship. She is able to walk. She can go to the meeting herself. She could be trusted to walk. I want to make the thing simple and practical; she points to a person who is at the age of suitability for the fellowship, for fellowship in the things of God, if you will understand me. I do not want to be misunderstood. It is a question of the things of God. There may be fellowship in other things but I am speaking of the things of God, and that there may be fellowship in them, and this little girl is
{423}
clearly one that can be viewed as in fellowship. She walks. It says, "for she was twelve years old". That word *for* means something. It means that something grows out of it, that she is one of those who can go to the meeting and participate in what is of God, "for she was twelve years old".
Finally, the Lord took care of the other side of the matter; He commanded that something should be given her to eat. That is another point of great importance, especially to mothers, as to young girls and what they read, what they are living on in that sense. Sometimes one has ventured to refer to Elisha who had to do with a dead boy in the Old Testament. Elijah did too, but Elisha had to do with a dead boy and he wondered why he had died, what caused his death. He wondered, he walked up and down the house as if he were saying to himself, Why has this happened? What caused this, why should this child have died? Well, what is the cause? So, as I have said, you can understand how Elisha walked up and down in the house. Would he not look around to see if someone had any books that would be damaging to that young boy? Certainly he would, and other things like that, because these are the things that hinder fellowship, that hinder the growth of meetings. Youths are damaged by what they eat; that is, in the moral sense of reading and the like. Then, besides that, the Lord commanded that something should be given her to eat. What is the something? Something surely that is not stale, not something that has been used before, but something that is fresh. She is a girl just raised from the dead and surely we would do the very best for her, and would select what is fresh and good and nourishing, but above all what is spiritual; what would promote spirituality in that child.
Now the third thought I had in mind is in @Acts 9. Again, it is a woman. Mary in @John 20 was not
{424}
dead, she was living. She had been morally dead, but now she is living. She has come into touch with Christ. John would say she is living. She belongs to the living. When we come to Dorcas, she was a woman. We often say, Well, she is a woman. But why should we say that? Why should we use the word *woman* in any sense except the true sense? Dorcas was not only a woman; but, as ordinary people would say, she was a useful woman, a woman making garments for the poor, and how useful these are at the present time, but then she died. She grew sick and died. She lived at Joppa, but she grew sick and died, and the widows and the persons around were no doubt interested, they were concerned; not that they were said to be relatives, but they were in close relation to her clearly, and they sent for Peter. A very great matter that Peter should be sent for, for he was shortly to be sent for to do something very wonderful; that is, to help Cornelius; but now he has been sent for to raise the dead woman. It is another matter altogether, but he is ready to be sent for, and he goes with them. The Lord went with Jairus, and Peter goes with those sent from Joppa, and what he found was that she was dead. She was taken care of too, she was washed, she was in the upper chamber, she was not left carelessly, although dead, she was left with respect. The passage tells us what happened. "And Peter rising up went with them, whom, when arrived, they brought up into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing him the body-coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them". But Peter put them all out. Now, I am pointing this out, because it refers to what has to be put forth from our associations, and our affiliations, if we are to progress spiritually. We are not to make everyone our companions. We are to select our companions. We belong to heaven. We are called
{425}
by God, called out first, and then called up. We are called of God, partakers of the heavenly calling. That is what we are, and as soon as we lay hold of that fact we begin to look around as to the associations we have been keeping, whether they are suitable, whether they are clean and holy, fit for Christian association, Christian fellowship, and companionship. These are very searching questions and we should all pay attention, especially young people here.
Now in the third case in my address, the third feature of my subject, it is a question of finding out what has to be learned in this woman. She is dead. Well, what about Peter? What can be learned from Peter? See what he did. Peter put them all forth without any discrimination, clearly. That is to say, they were not fit for these surroundings. They would, if left there, only hinder what he had come for to Joppa; and yet they had washed the woman and laid her in the upper chamber, but Peter has these exercises about them, and he prays. He was a praying man. I have already referred to Peter and James and John as gifted men; that is the point as regards them. Peter is an apostle of course, but more than that he is, according to Matthew, the first apostle. There is that fact mentioned, that Peter is first, and clearly there is involved in that the sense of responsibility. The great matter if we have gift at all, or if we have anything from God, is to have a sense of responsibility as to it, and make whatever we can of it in the power that God gives to us, and that power is in the Holy Spirit. There is no other power for the work of God today, and if anybody is attempting to work in the Lord's service, do not think of it unless you can see that you have the Holy Spirit and that you have learned how to use Him, and that He is free to use you too, and He will be free as you are free to be used. So Peter is a true
{426}
servant here, for it says in verse 39, "Peter rising up went with them, whom, when arrived, they brought up into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing him the body-coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them". All these persons are there. You say they were a fine lot, they are interested people, interested in this woman. They had been before, and had attended to what she needed done for her, and why should we not praise them, why should we not think them most worthy people? Peter did not, and I am in line with Peter. God has given such men as Peter to guide us, and we do well to be guided by them. Peter is an apostle, but he is a servant now, and he kneeled down here. It says in verse 40, "Peter, putting them all out, and kneeling down, prayed. And, turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up". He is worthy to be looked at. Peter had said to a man earlier, "Look on us" not 'Look on *me*', but "Look on us". He was with John, and he would have John looked at too. He did not want to make much of himself, any more than John. He said "Look on us", but there is no "us" here. The widows are all put out. They are not worthy of being looked at, even although they may be well-dressed, women of society. In this light they are not worth looking at. Do not think I am rude in saying that, beloved, but they are not. Peter put them all out, that is what he did. But then he wanted Dorcas to look at him, and she did look on him. That is the fact stated that she looked at Peter, and Peter gives her his hand, for he would help. That is the idea, because that is what is needed in the fellowship and the service of God -- help. If we can help, do it. Peter could do it. He had been long in the service, and he knew what to do in this case. He knew exactly and he did it. It
{427}
says "having given her his hand, he raised her up, and having called the saints and the widows, presented her living".
Now notice, the words "saints and widows" are included here, showing that they were not all widows, meaning people who would be in evidence at such a time as this; they were saints, and that gives the character of the whole matter, that they were saints. We are saints, we are called saints. If there is anyone here tonight who is a believer, but does not know that he is a saint, then I would say he should awake to the fact that he is a saint, and belongs to the saints. They are to be your companions. So that he called the saints, they have the first place here, then the widows, and he presented her living. That was the result. I need not say more; you can see what I have said in a very broken way because there is a real impediment to one's efforts because of certain conditions; but at the same time the word of God is coming forth and that is enough. We have much to be thankful for if we have power to convey the word of God. It is a question of the word of God, and the priesthood of Christ. We have had it today already. These are the two things that have been before us today, and they are before me now, and they were before Peter. He was a priest himself. He was not only an apostle but a priest, because the idea of a priest is that he prays. He kneeled down and prayed. He knew how to pray. He knew all that is necessary as a true saint of God in the service of Christ. Results are seen here and they are to affect us, and that is why I am stressing this now. I commend the whole matter to you of these three cases so that we may all be concerned as to the promotion of spirituality. There is great need for it, especially for the young people, that we may learn to be spiritual, to think spiritually, to walk spiritually. That is what the
{428}
young woman did, "for she was twelve years old" and that *for* may apply to many here tonight. Young men and women are to see whether they are suitable for the fellowship of God's people, the saints of God, for that is the idea. May God bless the word to us all on these lines.
{429}
THE DIVINE APPOINTMENTS AS SEEN IN THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS
@Hebrews 1: 1 - 6; @Hebrews 4: 14 - 16; @Hebrews 13: 10 - 15
J.T. If I may use a title for the subject, it would be the divine appointments as seen in the epistle to the Hebrews. The thoughts centre in the truth of sonship and priesthood from the divine side and the service of the saints as entering into the divine appointments in the assembly. Our subject covers the whole epistle if we wish to extend it, but at one reading it is thought that, whilst perhaps touching on the different features of each thought mentioned, we might seek to restrict ourselves so that each part of a subject should be taken in. Sonship is the first and the greatest and it has various branches, or extensions. It is hoped that we may touch on the leading thoughts even though they are not included in the passages read; we should not forget the appointments of the saints, the appointments of God as covering the saints themselves in the divine service. Chapter 13 will cover that side; but sonship, as we said, is the greatest of the features of the subject before us and it is thought we should touch on the first chapter in itself; that the speaking is by the Son. God has spoken unto us in Son; spoken as God but in the character or relation of Son. Chapter 3 speaks of the house over which Christ is Son. Chapter I deals almost entirely with the thought of sonship, and, as we said, it is the greatest, not so much because it involves deity, but because of the need for it as affording liberty in the service of God, dignity too, but especially liberty.
C.A.M. This would be the greatest presentation of sonship in that it is applied to the Christ'?
{430}
J.T. Well, it is, I suppose. It is applied in this epistle according to the tenor of the epistle; not exactly according to the tenor of Galatians. It is evidently Paul's service and he is carrying his doctrine and his ministry into the Jewish side of the position then. This accounts for much that is said here that is not found elsewhere, because the writer intends to affect the Jewish believers who were in danger of turning aside. So the idea of speaking has a great place. We have, therefore, in chapter 2: 1 - 4, "For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things we have heard, lest in any way we should slip away. For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution, how shall we escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken of by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard; God bearing, besides, witness with them to it, both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will?". This passage is, I think, one of the most important as to the practical side, because of the threatened danger and warning where there may be a tendency with us to slip away, growing cold through worldliness and the like. This paragraph shows the great pains that God had taken to save His earthly people, that is to say, those who had come into Christianity; and the warning is held out because of what was said. That is, the reference would be to the ministry of the twelve, which had been widespread, and now Paul evidently had in mind to apply certain features that he was accustomed to, only giving them a Jewish turn, so that he should be more intelligible to the Jewish Christians, and above all, that there were the various distributions of the Holy Spirit according to God's will.
{431}
J.T.Jr. How far back would the thought of speaking in the prophets go'? Would it go back into Genesis?
J.T. I suppose so. For instance, Enoch spoke. Is that what you thought?
J.T.Jr. I thought there must be allusion to what was before Exodus. Would the word spoken by angels allude especially to what came out in Exodus in chapter 2?
J.T. The allusion would be to the ministry, the giving of the law by the disposition of angels (@Acts 7: 53).
R.W.S. Is there a link in "the end" in chapter 1 verse 2, "At the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son"? The note says 'The end of the period of the law, when Messiah was to be introduced'. Would there be some link with that and the end of the dispensation at which we have arrived, and the truth of sonship coming to light with all the great liberty, as you say, that is introduced? Hence should we not see the seriousness of leaving such a glorious system?
J.T. You mean as an analogy in our own times to what is alluded to here. The previous dispensation will be covered in the end of verse 1: "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son". So that the epistle clearly is taken on that ground, that Christianity came in at the end of a certain period. We might just allude to a passage in @Acts 3 where we have an allusion to what is said to be the end of the prophets: verses 20 and 21 say, "and he may send Jesus Christ, who was foreordained for you, whom heaven indeed must receive till the times of the restoring of all things, of which God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since time began". That would be covering just what we have spoken
{432}
of as to how far back the idea of the prophets will extend. The note says, "Since time began" refers to 'holy prophets': lit. 'his holy since-time-began prophets'. So that as to the question that was raised a moment ago as to how far back this speaking extended, it would clearly extend to the very beginning: "since time began". And now we have come to the end of that period covered by, we might say, the expression "time began". We come to the end of a period in the words, "at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son". So that it is treated as the end of a period beginning with time and now taken on by the apostle Paul, clearly by him, linking on with the twelve who are alluded to at the end of chapter 1. The apostle Paul, I would say, makes application of his own line of thought only in a Jewish setting. What had been spoken is made applicable and now the question is what has been spoken to us. We are not dealing with what has been spoken at the Reformation three hundred years ago or so. What really comes to us close at hand is a more recent ministry, we are accustomed to say one hundred and thirty years ago; it seems to be intended to close this dispensation, and, therefore, we are under obligation to answer to what is being said. The allusion in the first paragraph of chapter 2 to what has been furnished is very striking: "For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution, how shall we escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken of by the Lord ...", so that it is now treated as a new dispensation, really. The commencement of it is by the Lord and it "has been confirmed to us by those who heard; God bearing, besides, witness with them to it, both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions
{433}
of the Holy Spirit, according to his will". So that there was very much given, and if we apply it to our own times there has been a wonderful supply. Now is there not a movement or a tendency for many to turn aside, and is it not needful that we should be warned? It is not simply a turning away from a few brethren, but turning away from a dispensation, turning away from the whole truth of the current dispensation.
W.W.M. As regards the divine speaking it says in chapter 11, "By faith, Noah, oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house", and then it says, "By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance". Those two thoughts would apply in the speaking: one as being warned and the other as receiving the divine call.
J.T. And moved with fear, too. I am glad you brought that up, because we observe here that now and again brethren say, 'We are not going to walk with you any more', without any fear as to what the word means; and it is constant. Persons think nothing of it, as if they were just leaving a neighbour and had said goodbye to him, whereas the whole dispensation of the truth of God is involved in those who are turning away from it in this dispensation. The whole matter, the danger of turning away, is dealt with in this epistle.
A.R. They are treated as apostates, are they not?
J.T. That is really what is meant. Sin is apostasy. There is no forgiveness for the sin of turning away.
A.Pf. Could Orpah be looked upon as apostate?
J.T. Well, she had married a Jewish husband, and whether her committal in marriage implied she was turning away back to Moabitish idolatry would be a question to be considered.
{434}
T.E.H. It took three deaths and two marriages in the family before one of the family got recovered, as though God would speak three times to Naomi in order to recover her. Three deaths and two marriages took place before she woke up. She must have been in that place a long time.
J.T. It would seem as if we should take those events that you have named as disciplinary, because Naomi was the object of the discipline. She had gone away into Moab but she now returned with a change of name; feelings of bitterness, as if she was being restored. And, of course, that is what we are aiming at, because there are so many taking it into their minds that they can get along without truth. And some are coming back. Just recently there have been refreshing recoveries, but many have gone and have not come back. And I think Naomi would be a sample of persons who are restored, and of course that is the end we have in mind in bringing up this subject now.
A.A.T. In chapter 12 it says, "For ye have not come to the mount that might be touched", and "See that ye refuse not him that speaks". Is that the Speaker in chapter 1?
J.T. That is right; the Speaker is in heaven. Even if the Lord were on earth, in principle He was speaking from heaven; the voice is from heaven in Christianity because the testimony really came out with the Spirit. The Spirit speaks from heaven. He has come down from heaven, but the principle is that He is speaking from heaven.
A.R. There are a large number of the children of the saints going out into the world. How would you view that?
J.T. That is what I am thinking of. It has come into mind more and more since we began: it was not so much in mind at first, but certainly it has
{435}
come up now and I think the Lord has something to say.
C.A.M. Would it be right to say there is nothing greater expressed in manhood than the fact of the Son here; there is nothing more glorious?
J.T. Quite so. The speaking is final. It is, so to say, a last word, having the character of a last word with all the warnings that attach to it.
J.T.Jr. It is remarkable that in chapter 10 it speaks of the Son of God in the sense that we are looking at it: those who trod under foot the Son of God and those who insulted the Spirit of grace, which would seem to allude to what is here in the saints. It speaks very drastically of the thing and the kind of judgment that will be meted out to persons who do that.
J.T. The word in chapter 6 comes into this in a very peculiar way because it is a question of the Speaker, and the Son is the Speaker; at the same time the Spirit also is recognized and mentioned here already twice. Verse 4 of chapter 2 has been read: "both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will". All this is another matter as to the speaking, and chapter 6 is peculiarly solemn, saying in verse 4, "For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves as they do the Son of God, and making a show of him". The Son of God is touched on here as spoken of in chapter 10. The Spirit of grace is also touched on here so that both divine Persons are touched on as entering into the warning and terribleness of turning away from the truth.
{436}
F.S.C. It seems to make recovery so very difficult. How does it come about in view of a scripture like this?
J.T. I am thankful for the reference to the book of Ruth, because I have no doubt that what has been said about Orpah might suggest one who has turned away definitely. She went away back to her own people, whereas Ruth remained with Naomi. That is, she clung to the person who represented the testimony. That is really what is included in Naomi's position. She represented the testimony, and Ruth clung to her. Where Naomi died, Ruth would die, and there she would be buried. She is an out-and-out case of reality, and a good model for anyone who may be in any way beginning to get cold.
R.W.S. Be at the meetings and be with the saints.
J.T. You mean that is one of the remedies?
R.W.S. If one has lost his way and seeks his way back, one evidence of that would be that he loves to be with the saints.
J.T. Wherever coldness is setting in, you may be sure the meetings will be lacking, and the rain, the weather, will help out in that.
A.R. The man in @Acts 3 would be a model. He held on to Peter and John.
J.T. He represents a real case in Christianity, one of the distinguished examples. There were three thousand, of course, in chapter 2, and there is no doubt that what was said of them would imply they were genuine. I think they were; as if God would say at the start, I can have numbers too. It is not good to make little of numbers, because numbers are good if they are genuine, but God can take on one. That is chapter 3; the man at the gate of the temple called Beautiful. The idea was, "Look on us", which would be the idea of the reality of Christianity in the ministering class, Peter and John. It is a Peter and John chapter, and I suppose this man
{437}
that was converted through them would be representative of the whole dispensation.
S.F. Would you say the writer of this epistle seeks to hold their attention by presenting the glory of the Speaker?
J.T. That is the idea. The first chapter is filled with glories; the personal glories of Jesus; and, mark you, it is what the people of God, even from ancient days, have had to say about the Lord Jesus, because it is almost entirely quoted from the Psalms.
C.A.M. Had there not been a sort of preparation of thought in the Old Testament and in all that had been said - but is not this transcendingly greater in itself?
A.Pf. I suppose at the end of @Acts 2 it would be really our guidance. It says they persevered.
J.T. That is a good word. The three thousand are particularly in mind, the recent additions; those that were added persevered in the apostles¬ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayers. I believe that is to remind us of what Christianity really meant at the beginning: how real it was.
E.A.L. It says in the first verse of chapter 2: "for this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things we have heard, lest in any way we should slip away"; this means that we will become in the condition in chapter 6, "and have fallen away". The slipping away would be that, if we do not attend the meetings, we will have some other association, and that is the danger.
J.T. So that the word "slip away" is not quite so strong as "fallen away", but that is really the result, for those who are slipping away are almost sure to fall.
D.A.P. How do you view Barzillai? He requested to die by the grave of his father.
{438}
J.T. He was held by natural feelings although a genuine, real and true man; another thing, he was a very old man and therefore some consideration was deserved, but at the same time he did not go the whole way. He is not a model of a believer who is genuine and who goes the whole way to Jerusalem. Jerusalem above is the great end in mind. What is your own thought?
D.A.P. What you have said is very helpful. I thought he being a Gileadite might not have enjoyed the truth of sonship and hence it was not in his constitution.
J.T. The matter of sonship is the greatest part of our subject; but then the priesthood is the power of Christ in sonship. "God ... has spoken to us in the person of the Son" meaning that it is God speaking Himself (only "in Son": "the person of the" is interpolated, but the literal thought is that God has spoken Himself, only in the attractive relation of Son). That is the point in chapter 1, and, therefore, how serious it is to slip away, to turn away from that attractive speaking; no less than that of God Himself. But then when we come to the next part of our subject, we see that the priesthood is intended not only to influence us but to do it in the skill of the priest. The priest's lips involve the skill of a priest, that he would lay himself out to present everything that would be calculated to save you.
A.P.T. Is sonship the understanding of the Lord in that wonderful way: what He is as Himself, from Himself? What He is Himself holds you, and then the priesthood involves what He can do for us?
J.T. What He is Himself, because it is no less than God Himself; but then what He can do for you brings up the question of skill; skill in the dispensation, and the priesthood represents skill, I think. The priest's lips should keep knowledge, we are
{439}
told. "They should seek the law at his mouth". It is not simply the reading of the law by anybody, but at his mouth. That is the next thing to think of, so that if any of our brethren are getting cold, let them be visited by the priest. He has the skill of dealing with the brethren.
R.W.S. What is the difference between the Lord's advocacy and priesthood?
J.T. Both thoughts, I believe, enter into priesthood. You are alluding to the first epistle of John. Perhaps you would read it, please.
R.W.S. It says in @1 John 2, "My children, these things I write to you in order that ye may not sin; and if any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (verse 1).
J.T. That is good. The word 'patron' there or 'advocate' is akin to priesthood. I believe the idea of priesthood includes it, only that the idea is that the Person who is the Advocate has complete latitude to look after your case. He has a right to look after your case. He is divinely appointed; it comes under the heading of appointment because the appointment is as of one who has full latitude, as a solicitor would have in presenting your case before the court. So that it may vary from the idea of priesthood, but I believe in general it is included in the thought of priesthood, only it is that side of it that implies complete latitude in having to say to us. If you are in trouble and you have to be set up again, the advocate, I would say, has complete latitude to deal with your case; and, of course, that ought to impress you. I mean I would like to apply it to myself. Here is a divine Person-no less; but He is an appointed Person. It is a question of a system with offices, and He is an appointed Person to look after the case of one who is in trouble, who needs to be cared for and set up again.
{440}
R.W.S. That is very illuminating.
T.E.H. Would you help me a little further on that subject? Does priesthood towards God generally relate to God, and this matter of advocacy to the Father? Is there some feature of sonship behind that?
J.T. Yes; the latitude that He has officially will have influence. Now what we were saying about the priest should be repeated. The sympathies of a man enter into priesthood. "Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession. For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart. Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help", @Hebrews 4: 14 - 16. I think the priesthood is bound up in those words. It is a question of Christ's sympathies as Man, and He will go a long way with us. The Advocate has full latitude to look after your case and He is with the Father, but the sympathies of Christ as Man enter into what we have in this passage. There is not time to read all the passage, because the next chapter is full of the thing and many other passages are taken up with priesthood including the great idea of Melchisedec, who is a divine Person only as he is presented here. The priesthood involves all these things; so we can see how well off we are and what sympathies we have to save us from being carried away by the influences of the world.
A.R. What about the priesthood here? What about their service? You are not limiting priesthood to the Lord, of course?
J.T. There is not much said about our priesthood in this epistle. Peter tells us that we are a holy priesthood. Here it is more Christ's priesthood.
{441}
What we have in mind in chapter 13 is the service of God. The altar that we have has fittings whereby we can carry on as in the service of God, only this epistle does not go very far with the saints in their functions. It is just barely touched, I might say, in chapter 13. You get it in Peter, and of course, we get it in Paul. That is where I would say we have to go if we want to get the full thing, but I think chapter 13 furnishes enough for our subject. What have you in mind in bringing up the question of the priest?
A.R. You spoke one night in the care meeting of persons who visit those out of fellowship or who are in darkness. You suggested that the priest should go.
J.T. As in @Leviticus 13 and 14; quite so. They are the ones to go; the priests arc the ones. The priests are always supposed to be there according to Leviticus, and it is not everybody that should go to a person who is growing cold. You want a priest. Skill is bound up with the priest.
A.B.P. Would @Romans 14 fit into what is being said? It speaks about the weak in the faith and then it says, "And he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand". Would that involve the priesthood of Christ as we are speaking of it?
J.T. The Lord is able to make him stand. Just so. It is a question of skill, therefore the priest is the one who should go, but the advocate is included in that. The advocate is suggestive of the latitude that the priest has.
J.T.Jr. It takes time, and that involves a certain amount of loss. If the Lord has to be occupied in going after people in a certain way there is lost time.
J.T. Please tell us why you bring in the question of loss.
{442}
J.T.Jr. I was thinking that the service of God is positive, and if persons get away it involves the Lord having to turn aside to that.
J.T. Quite so. That would enter into the subject; the overhead or loss involved; but then it is needed. If we are to keep the brethren we must count on loss, and love would enable us to do that; we must save time if we can. In all these phases, whether it be skill or latitude or the like, the system is intended to cover the whole matter so that the person should not get away at all. If he does he is hopeless.
A.R. The early chapters of Leviticus have to do with the service of God; later on it deals with caring for persons.
J.T. Quite so. That is why when we come here to the worst case of sin, which typically is leprosy, the priest is always said to be there, and he is on the alert too. He is fully in the matter in his skill; he is not negligent. It is not, 'if he can go'; he is there. It is a great idea, I am sure, as entering into our subject as to the system that God has provided to guard us and keep us so that we should not slip away.
S.F. Is the Lord's priestly care and skill seen in @Luke 24 in saving the two who went away?
J.T. Just so; how He went after them in that very busy day. The Lord intended to have a very important day on the day of His resurrection. He intended really to go to heaven as far as we can see from the facts, showing how much He had in mind. He did not miss anything. He devoted all the time that was needed to those two, and even went into the house with them and stayed long enough to let them cook a meal, all of which is most touching. John says it was late in the day, and Luke says the same thing. @John 20 is the finish in that sense.
{443}
A.P.T. In @Luke 22 it says the Lord turned around and looked at Peter. Is there a priestly service there?
J.T. I would think so, the tender feelings of the Lord as He looked at him. He knew well enough what was going on in Peter's heart, and that look brought about recovery.
A.P.T. The Lord knew that there was that in Peter which would not let him go away. He had said, "Lord, to whom shall we go?"
J.T. I think so; the Lord would have followed him up, because He could follow him up into his whole history. "When thou wast young", He says. He touches on that, but He runs on into the entire history of Peter, meaning he would be entirely resigned. "But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire", meaning he would go the whole road to martyrdom.
A.P.T. Do you think our derelictions are due to the disregard of these two divine appointments -- sonship and priesthood?
J.T. These two appointments are the important ones and I think the Lord is helping us to go into them a little, and to consider this matter of the tender sympathies of the Lord Jesus with all the skill He would command to restore a person. So He followed those two up. How many hours it took the Lord, I cannot say, but the pace would be theirs. Jacob touches on the pace of the journey in speaking to Esau; he said the little ones would fall out on the way if the pace was too swift. So that we cannot just know what the pace of the two may have been, but the Lord would keep up with it. I would say it took at least two hours; it was about seven or eight miles. The Lord was patient enough to go all that way to secure those two. Allusion has been made to the loss of time and all that, the overhead.
{444}
The Lord took account of all that. 'Time is money' as we say; time is reckoned in heaven as of value.
F.S.C. It says He took on Himself the seed of Abraham. Does that refer to His feelings as Man?
J.T. Just so. An angel could never follow or enter into our make-up. An angel would do as he is told; angels would do whatever they are told to do, and they have wonderful knowledge, too, but they cannot really fully understand our constitution; they are of a different order of being from ourselves, whereas the Lord Jesus is not of a different order of being. He is a Man, the Man Christ Jesus and, therefore, qualified to be Priest.
A.A.T. I notice it says, "Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help". Is that approach only when we are in trouble or can the approaching be at our family reading in the morning?
J.T. It can be at any time; it is a question of the system we are in. We have full liberty and latitude, but it is boldness in the sense of respect, I would think, and reverence, so that we can come freely. If we are in need, of course, the word would be that you can come boldly, but it applies to us at all times.
F.H.L. Would you say a word about the difference between the high priest here and the great priest in chapter 10?
J.T. I do not think there is much difference. The great priest is a moral thought; the high priest is to bring out His distinction, which would be one that He has relative to others; He is greater than others. The word 'high' would mean there are others that are in that.
F.H.L. It would be more official?
{445}
J.T. It would be; but the great priest is what He is morally. He will go all the way. What we have been saying as to @Luke 24 would cover it. How great the Lord was morally to secure those two and He did secure them. They came back the same night showing they were entirely recovered.
R.W.S. What is the confession? It says, "let us hold fast the confession".
J.T. It is not simply profession but confession. That is to say, it is what we confess, meaning that Christianity is the confession of certain truths and the Lord is the High Priest of that. He has that place. It is so important to heaven that the confession should be maintained; not simply the profession but the confession, what is confessed. The Lord made a good confession, and so each of us is to make a good confession; if it be a child going to school, he should confess the Lord to his teacher or fellow-pupils, not so much to his mother or father, but to persons who are not in near relation to him. The confession is what you say as to the truth to other people.
F.S.C. Is there any reference in verse 1 of chapter 3, "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus"?
J.T. "The Apostle and High Priest of our confession". What we confess. Heaven is providing for us as confessors; that is what makes us important in heaven. We are confessors, confessing the truth.
R.W.S. Confession implies there has been a challenge.
J.T. Just so; you are standing up to the thing; you are not ashamed. The Lord Himself is not ashamed to call us brethren, and we should not be ashamed of each other. So it was that Moses confessed his relation with his Jewish brethren in
{446}
the presence of the Egyptians. And the Jews, the brethren of Joseph were cattle-keepers. That was their confession. They had to say that. Pharaoh brought that out. If anything, they were an abomination to the Egyptians. That had to bring out a confession. You say, well, what is your confession? I am this, that, and the other thing, but are you caring for the brethren? That is the point. You would go anywhere to care for the brethren and do something for them.
J.T.Jr. Esther had finally to make her confession. I mean, her birth was not made known right away but she had to confess it.
J.T. Quite so; she had to do it, and Mordecai saw to that. He says, 'You will not escape any more than the rest of us; you had better do it; you had better make a confession', and she did.
F.H.L. is confessing His name, as in the last chapter, the same thing?
J.T. That would be the same idea.
F.H.L. It is a public matter.
J.T. It is publicly acknowledged that you belong to the brethren, the people of the Lord Jesus.
A.A.T. In @Romans 10: 10 salvation is connected with the confession.
J.T. Confessing the name of the Lord; that is a particular thing for salvation, but that is not quite as far on as what we have been saying. Joseph confessed publicly that he belonged to the Hebrews, the despised Hebrews, and so identified himself with the despised sons of Jacob.
T.E.H. The confession in chapter 13 would involve the idea of something for God-the sacrifice of praise continually to God.
J.T. That is what we are, poor and despised people. We may as well accept it; poor and afflicted people, but we trust in the Lord and all
{447}
these that we have been speaking of, Moses and Joseph and the Lord Himself, who, it says, witnessed a good confession, all run together. 'I dwell among my own people', the great woman said.
Well now, chapter 13 should not be forgotten although we have touched on it already. "We have an altar of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle". We have rights. The Lord's people are not asserting their natural right, but we have rights and we have an altar that others cannot serve at, so that we are exclusive. And then it goes on to say, "for of those beasts whose blood is carried as sacrifices for sin into the holy of holies by the high priest, of these the bodies are burned outside the camp. Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate: therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach". That is of great importance here; bearing the reproach that is attached to our position. The world does not care for us at all. Therefore it goes on, "for we have not here an abiding city, but we seek the coming one. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of the lips confessing his name". So that our services are carried on on those lines.
A.R. Is that how the tribe of Levi comes forward in Exodus?
J.T. Just so. You can see how the whole position enters into what we are saying in our little meetings. There is nothing at all to us that can measure up with the great congregations around. There is nothing at all; it is not worth mentioning, but then heaven knows the difference and we have to accept the reproach and the confession that goes with it; the confession of the name of the Lord Jesus; no other name. We do not claim any other name than that.
{448}
C.A.M. The blood was brought into the holy of holies; would the reproach in the outside place be commensurate with the entrance that we have into the holy things and into the inmost meaning of the sanctuary?
J.T. Yes; so that outside the camp, inside the veil: the two things balance in heaven; our position is balanced in heaven in that sense, so that heaven is not ashamed of us.
W.W.M. The confession that we had already is more what we do outwardly, but this confessing His name here is what we confess to God about Christ?
J.T. Well, the allusion here is in verse 15: "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of the lips confessing his name". Your point is that you are confessing to God?
W.W.M. I was thinking that. You can speak to God about Him.
J.T. Quite so; but the word is, "let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God". That is one thing. And, "the fruit of the lips confessing his name". The confession of His name God would be pleased with. It is a service we are carrying on; the sacrifice of praise, and the fruit of the lips confessing His name. God would be pleased with that surely, but at the same time it is a testimony, too.
T.N.W. Is this praise referred to here in line with what you spoke of in connection with chapter 1, Christ's sonship and liberty? Would you say a word more about that in connection with His sonship?
J.T. It is the first thing we are dealing with. It is a great liberating thought; not simply that He is Son as subject to the Father, but that He is Son as God Himself. He is in that relation; He is in the Deity in speaking. It is God that is speaking, but He is speaking in the relation of Son. That imparts
{449}
great latitude, so that the Lord says Himself, "if therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free", @John 8: 36. I believe that is the way it works out.
R.W.S. You alluded to the altar; we have an altar; you spoke of the settings, all the settings. Would you enlarge on that?
J.T. Take a meeting-room. There are chairs and there is a table and there is a fire, it may be, and there is water. These are just preparatory thoughts. The word that was addressed to the Lord by the disciples was, "Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?" @Matthew 26: 17. Well, the preparation, of course, was essential and the altar would be essential here, only that we have to discern that it is not simply a physical matter. It is a moral thought here, "We have an altar". The altar in Exodus, of course, was made of brass, but this is a moral thought, and what I was remarking as to the settings there fits. The moral side of the thing is what is so difficult to bring with us. What we bring with us will be greatly enlarged if we are godly when we leave our houses and draw near. The physical side will gradually disappear in importance; it is what we are morally that will make the occasion. "We have an altar of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle". Then he goes on to speak about the bodies of the offerings and "let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach". There is that sort of thing that enters into the matter. It is not physical. It is a question of what is going on in your household, and what you indicate to others if they are spiritual. There is something in the person if he is spiritual. So, that the whole thing becomes spiritual; even the confessing of the name will take that character. The confession of the name before God would be within the hearing of any that might
{450}
be there. We show forth the death of the Lord Jesus; we do that. It is the attitude of our souls, so that others discern there is something going on.
R.S. Must we attain some measurement in order to have part in the altar? It says in @Revelation 11: 1, "Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it".
J.T. That is taken from the Old Testament circumstances which would be, so far as words go, a physical matter, but we are dealing, as Revelation does too, with moral things when we talk about an altar. It is not a physical thing. It is what is in yourself in the sense of sacrifice. The altar is there; we have it. If it were physical others might have it, but only certain ones have it. Therefore, it is a moral question that we are dealing with in this chapter.
C.A.M. "No right to eat who serve the tabernacle" would stress that. There are those who are incapacitated to understand any moral ideas or spiritual things.
J.T. They can hardly get beyond the natural; so we have had the place where the bread should be placed on the table, but it is a question of what is in the soul of the persons that are eating.
A.B.P. This book shows that what is physical is only a shadow of the real moral thing.
J.T. Quite so; so that Revelation is laid in Old Testament thoughts, only it is Christianity we are dealing with.
A.P.T. Do the "we have" and the "let us" refer to the ones that understand the spiritual side?
J.T. "Let us" is what we are doing; what "we have" God supplies. This altar is God-supplied only it is a question of what we are. You can see we are sufferers. Moses was a sufferer; it was he that made the altar in the wilderness and it was made of brass; but the brass was only a symbol. All these
{451}
things were left to the saints themselves in the book of Genesis, but when we come to Exodus God says, I want measurement; I want accuracy; I want things as they are, and that is why there is so much of accuracy and pattern in Exodus.
{452}
PERSONAL LIBERTY
@Mark 11: 11, 27; @Psalm 48: 12 - 14
I want to speak about personal liberty. I have selected the Lord Himself as my subject. It is suitable to connect the subject with the gospel of Mark for it is the minister's gospel. In using the word 'minister' I am referring to service in ministry such as the Levites used to be engaged in typically. Now more accurately it would be those who serve in the word of God, although the service of the Levites included more. But the service of the word of God remains as belonging to the subject, the levitical subject, because it entailed toil or labour, real toil; and hence the word 'labourer' is the word to use if we are to be accurate. Mark is the section of Scripture that especially unfolds the truth to us as to ministry; and so when I spoke about personal liberty, I should have added particularly as to those persons who minister. But the Lord leads in this for us, as He does, indeed, in all the gospels. Recently we have spoken of the gospels extending beyond the present dispensation and have used a well-known phrase, the gospels go over the wall; that is, the wall of holy discrimination and separation in truth. Hence, we may speak of cutting in a straight line the word of truth. That expression is intelligible according to what I have said. The person who is dealing in the truth treats of the assembly in what belongs to it. That is, he does not mix things; he does not confuse things. The idea of a straight line means I am not confusing the truth by misapplication. And so in Mark He is introduced to us very abruptly. It speaks of the Lord as "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God". It is very abrupt, but clearly it is a personal matter that the theme before us is
{453}
Jesus Christ, referring to Him as a Man, but as Son of God. Personally He is Jesus Christ in His service, and of course, the term 'Son of God' might be left out and the matter would be perfectly intelligible to us, but 'Son of God' is added because it is a question of the levitical work, or the labourer's work, the teacher's work, the preacher's work. And so the gospel provides not only for the Lord but for every preacher and every teacher; everyone engaged in the work, as it is called; nothing is omitted that the labourer needs. Above all, he needs encouragement. So we find in the record of the Lord's baptism that the heavens were opened to Him and the voice was not, 'This is the Son of God', but, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight". That is a word for the labourer; a labourer needs to know that God is well pleased with him. You understand I am not at all detracting from the terms applied to the Lord personally, but it is clear that the labourer needs to be assured that God is well pleased with him, not simply that the brethren are well pleased with him or that he can preach well or teach well, but that personally God is well pleased with him. So the word was to the Lord Himself, and it would set Him on His glorious way as the gospel here presents Him, and what a way! What a way of glory! The Spirit came upon Him, fitting Him, if I may use that expression, for the service ahead. He is appointed, for it is a question of appointment as we had it already today. It is a question of God's appointments and it is clear that the appointment of Jesus, whom God has made both Lord and Christ, should be clear. There should be every reason for it, every ground for it. He is appointed in heaven. "God has made him, this Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ", @Acts 2: 36. God has made Him that; the appointment is right. So it should be with everyone
{454}
who is ministering. Heaven has to say to it; or, perhaps I might say as to everyone of us here who is doing it in some sense, heaven has had to say to it, and how we are doing it proves that or disproves it. It is one or the other.
So it is that chapter 1 is set in these beautiful words: "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God", meaning that He is in the ministry but He is the Son of God, as if who He is must be known at every turn. So it is that one who is concerned, according to Luke, not according to Mark, that is, Zacchaeus, went ahead of the Lord and climbed up into a tree. I am not going to discredit him for that although some might, because it says, "And he sought to see Jesus who he was", @Luke 19: 3. So the Lord Jesus Himself in conversing with His disciples enquired what men were saying of Him. "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" Peter answered that question; it is important that questions of that kind should be answered. Questions were asked of the Lord that were not answered, because they were not honestly asked, and the Lord is not going to support dishonesty even if it be a question of supporting a point of truth. The Lord would not support dishonesty even in a question, so He was silent.
Well, as I was saying, the first chapter is the great Worker, the great Operator in heaven, Jesus Christ. He is the great Operator because operational services belong to Him; He leads in them; and so He is set down in heaven, and He is known there as Lord and Christ, but the Spirit of Christ in the book of Mark prefers to present Him as Jesus Christ, Son of God. And as I said, He proceeds to fortify Him, speaking reverently, so as to fit Him for the great service before Him, and so that He should bring out that the whole environment of the service would be clothed with sonship, with the idea of liberty. I
{455}
need not say this but it is important that we should see that there is nothing small at all about the Lord Jesus. Everything is in the greatness of sonship. There are to be no efforts to exalt ourselves in any sense at all. The Lord frowns on all that. He wishes, as the gospel of Mark sets out, that the holy liberty and dignity of sonship should clothe the services, whether His own or of those who are called into service. That is another thing you get in Mark. He went up into a mountain and called to Him whom He would and appointed them to preach. They must be preachers as He was; they must learn from Him. They must be teachers, or whatever it might be, as He was; they must get guidance from the Lord and that guidance is in the liberty and relation of sonship, so that we may learn it properly and be it, be marked as sons, "because ye are sons". What a great phrase that is! "But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father", @Galatians 4: 6. So that the whole environment of the service is to be marked by this relation, and hence there is liberty.
Well now, as I said, I have in mind personal liberty and therefore I read verse 11: "And he entered into Jerusalem and into the temple; and having looked round on all things, the hour being already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve". Certain people were craning their necks when they saw the Lord going out of Jerusalem over the mount of Olives, down to Bethany; doubtless there were those that were interested; maybe not affectionately interested but doubtless there were many that watched Him. He was watched and with vicious eyes, too. With murderous eyes He was watched, but He went out to Bethany without any question as to what might be thought of Him. Before He went out to Bethany, you will observe, "he entered into Jerusalem and into the temple; and having looked
{456}
round on all things", that is to say, He is observing. You may say, Such-and-such is very questioning, very critical. That may be necessary for a worker. The Lord was critical; He looked around on all things; not on al! persons but on all things. Why do I say that? Because it is a question of things. That is the meaning of the passage. Christianity involves things as well as persons. So the man who had his eyes opened in Bethsaida saw all things clearly. It is very important, as we come together as we are now, that we see things as well as persons, and the Lord here looked around on all things. This is a challenging matter. We have often spoken of it, because every one of us has things attached to him. You have clothes, you have houses, maybe, you have possessions and all these things as well as ourselves, must come under the Lord's review. Hence here He had come into Jerusalem and He entered into the temple and He looked around upon all things. But the word 'when' is there, meaning He is going to do something afterwards. He is in holy dignity; He is not inquiring as to what the people may think; He is going somewhere afterwards; I should say in a few minutes, maybe in half an hour He is going to go somewhere in liberty and dignity; in the liberty and dignity of His relations with God, of what He was Himself too. We have already spoken of Him as Son, God speaking by Him; God Himself speaking as God but speaking as Son. We have already had that today, but now it is not a question of His speaking: it is a question of His entrance into Jerusalem, and what a moment it was! What were they thinking about this great Person? In Matthew we have an inquiry about Him, which I do not need to turn to now. Who is this? The prophet from Nazareth? From Galilee? That is what they thought. He was more than that; He was the Son, perfected for ever, and He is in Jerusalem.
{457}
He has just come in. I can well visualize myself if I were in Jerusalem then, but knowing what I do now, I should not be at home if the Lord were coming into Jerusalem. I do not know anything that would keep me away. I hardly know what could keep me away, any more than what could keep me from a meeting like this. Of course, I could give you certain reasons that would keep me away, but I am pondering on this matter of the Lord of glory coming into Jerusalem. He had been there before; very little was made about Him. His father and mother had left without the Lord; they had gone up to the feast and left without Him. Such are our mothers and fathers; there is the possibility of fathers and mothers being neglectful of their children. Mary herself and Joseph were neglectful of the Lord; so neglectful that they went some days on the way to Nazareth, or wherever it was, and they left the Lord in the town. But He was there, and as I said, He asserted His sonship. His mother came back into the town and she questioned Him severely as if she had a right to do it, whereas she had not. He says to her, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" "My Father", what does that refer to? Mary says: "Thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing". She referred to Joseph; but the Lord did not refer to Joseph; He referred to His own Father in heaven; the Father who opened the heavens on Him and looked on Him and said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". Well now, that was what happened. Mary and Joseph left without Him and they had to come back and search for Him in Jerusalem. They did not have far to go because He was in the temple; He was found there. It was His Father's temple. It was where His Father's business was and that is where He was. What a word for all you young people here, as to what interests you have in the
{458}
business of God, in the Father's business. Well, I speak thus because it is now here a question of personality in the Lord and He is coming into Jerusalem, and He has entered into the temple. You might ask how He knew. He did know; He knew everything. He sent the blind man into Jerusalem at another time to go to Siloam and he went, though blind; he went and found Siloam and washed in it. He did what he was told to do. So the Lord is under command; He was yet a minor; He was twelve years of age when He was in Jerusalem at this time that I am referring to. But now He has been baptised -- when He was about thirty years of age we are told; He was in Jerusalem at another time. Eighteen years elapsed and it is important to think of the days and the hours of that holy life; heaven does. The world itself, John says, could not contain the books that should be written if everything was written about the Lord, all that He did. So this is eighteen years afterwards and He is now in Jerusalem, and in the temple; the same temple where He spoke to His mother about His Father's business. He looked round upon everything; the position is different, the circumstances are different, the persons are different, the people there are different. Eighteen years make a great difference in a person of the Lord's age. You will remember that I am seeking to speak in a holy way, a reverential way; but it was eighteen years, and now He is in Jerusalem and He is in the temple and He is looking around on everything. And, as I said before, everyone of us may come under that surveillance. What an eye the Lord may cast on some of you here, bringing up into your minds the secret history that no one knows but yourself and God. He is God. He looks around on everything; He would survey the clothes we are wearing, and so on. It was not the persons, but the things; and then He
{459}
went out to Bethany with the twelve. That is to say, the Lord is not now alone. He is in company; not that He could not be alone, because we are told elsewhere that at night He went to the mount of Olives. With whom was He there? We are not told. I would say without any hesitation He was with His Father. Yes, dear brethren, He was with His Father. That was the company He would have on the mount of Olives; but now He has other company. He is in an administrative environment; twelve men are his companions. He is going out to Bethany with them. What would they say on the way? What would they talk of? What would be their theme? What does the number twelve mean, attached to them? Why were there not thirteen? Why were there just twelve? The word 'twelve' means something in Scripture, and the Lord knew it well, and so did the twelve. "Have not I chosen you twelve?" And so in chapter 3 of this gospel He called them up into the mountain and selected them that they should be with Him and He sent them forth to preach. Hence, what would they be talking about save that they were to preach? There are young men here that have never preached, but the Lord may have you in His mind that you are to preach; and, though you may not know it, I would advise you to be ready for whatever the Lord would have you do; whatever the contingency may be, whatever there is that you can do, be ready to do it. So I would say these twelve men and the Lord would be saying something about what should be done. What are they to do? Well, we are not told, as I said, but they went to Bethany. We are not told where, but I have not a doubt as to where they went; they went to the house of Mary and Martha and Lazarus, and hence that leads me to speak of companionship and what is within the range of a man who is in liberty. It is not fair to criticize a man who is serving, on whom the Lord
{460}
has put an obligation to serve. We should be very careful about our criticism of him. He has to do with the Lord; he has to do with God; he has to do with the assembly. He needs all the support we can give him. Hence, the Lord went up with the twelve. He did not ask any questions or raise any thoughts at all as to what people may have thought of His being in such company - some of them fishermen and tax-gatherers. That was no matter to the Lord. "Have not I chosen you twelve?" What a thing it is to be chosen by the Lord of glory; not simply chosen for heaven but chosen for service here below! The greatest possible honour is to be chosen by Christ for service here below. And see that you fulfil the mission you have. Do not treat it lightly; it is serious. When the Lord appointed the twelve He prayed all night about it. We will suppose it was a long winter's night. How He would go over every one of them and go over them again, each one by name, and if any had a wife, her name; if any had a mother and father, their names. The Lord would think of their fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers, because God takes account of the past as well as the future. Paul speaks about being set apart from his infancy before he began to serve at all. He had been selected in heaven, and in due time the Lord says of him, "This man is an elect vessel to me", a chosen vessel unto the Lord. There are things that belong to such an occasion; so, if the Lord is in Jerusalem and He has looked around on things and He moves out immediately in the direction of Bethany what is there in it? What is there likely to be in it? What are they likely to be saying? Well, He is there in holy dignity. He is doing what He knows to be right and He is not concerned about what others are thinking. He is under His Father's eye and His Father is well pleased with Him. He was well
{461}
pleased with His selection too, I am sure, so that they are to go on the way from Jerusalem to Bethany, fifteen furlongs away. It was not very far; a couple of miles. But they traversed that journey and the question is what they did when they got to Bethany. I cannot say. I have already conjectured they were in the house of Mary and Martha and Lazarus. That is all I can say; but the Lord went to Bethany. He came back again, we are told in verse 27: "And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he walked about in the temple", He is not now looking around on everything but walking. That is another matter. John the apostle says that John the baptist looked at Jesus as He walked. That is another thought. But now He is walking in the temple. Earlier He was walking around the Jordan before He was baptised. That is what @John 1 speaks of; He was walking there; but now He is in the temple and that is another thing. Every one of us here who go to the meetings should consider our walk, our movements in the assembly, the movements of the brethren. The attire and attitude and walk or whatever it may be is under the surveillance of heaven, and it is under the surveillance of spiritual people in the meeting too, and it is very important that young people should learn to behave themselves in the meetings, in the assembly. The Lord was in the temple when He was twelve and He was about His Father's business, and so it is now that every one of us who is young should know how to behave in the house of God, where the saints are assembled, where the Spirit of God is.
Well now, the Lord is walking in the temple and I just had a few words to say about that, because He is not now looking around on all things, criticizing them or whatever it may be, but walking. He would be there for everyone who had eyes capable of appreciating the great and the glorious, for everyone
{462}
who had eyes that could appreciate such a walk. He was there to be appreciated. It was for those who were in the temple to appreciate Him. I am speaking now, dear brethren, of the Lord's walk in the temple; not what is seen in @John 1 which would be around the Jordan before He was baptised or after, but in the temple; the kind of walk that is proper to the temple. What is to be seen? We might think of the ark of the covenant covered over so as not to be gazed upon under certain circumstances, but the Lord is in the temple; He is in the open. If He is walking now He is walking in the assembly or in the assemblies. So we have in @Revelation 1 that John hears a voice behind him and he turns back to see the voice; remarkable phrase. He turned back to see the voice, and what he saw was seven golden lamps. You say, Did he see the Lord first? No. He saw the seven golden lamps first, showing we are not dealing with another dispensation; the lamps are seen before we see the Lord. You will understand that I am not in any way detracting from the Lord of glory but He has an assembly and He loves that assembly. He gave Himself for it. There is nothing He loves more, except His Father, than the assembly, and so He walks in the midst of them. He is first seen in the midst of them in chapter 1, and in chapter 2 He is said to be walking in the midst of the seven gold lamps, showing that the Lord in this dispensation is now walking in the midst of the assemblies. I would say without any hesitation that He comes into meetings like these and walks around. You will all remember how Samuel made a circuit every year; it does not say for just how many years, but it was a good many for he lived a long time and he made his circuits too in the same period. We are told, too, the towns that he visited. They would fear when Samuel came; not that the Lord would cause us to fear, because if we
{463}
are here as we are, thank God, submissive to the Lord, He would indicate that He is pleased with us. I am sure He is. He comes to all places like this. And so Samuel went to these places every year in a circuit and judged Israel in a circuit, an important matter. So the Lord is judging His people too because it says He is girt at the breasts with a golden girdle and clothed in a robe down to the feet. You cannot see His beauty; He is covered over because things have to be judged. I am not dealing with that now; I only wish to point out that the Lord walks in the midst of the seven golden lamps. He is looking for the gold; the gold of that land is good, it says in @Genesis 2, and that gold comes down in the golden lamps in the midst of which the Lord walks. It means more than literal gold; it is the beauty of the saints, the workmanship in the saints, that we are all taught of God. We are all the workmanship of God and the material is gold, but the gold is good. It means something spiritual; it is the finest of metals, and those who are spiritual understand the meaning of the word 'gold'. It is the very best. David speaks of the very best gold; the finest gold: of his own affection he said he provided it for the house, three thousand talents of it; it was the best kind of gold, so is the assembly the best kind of gold. In the book of Revelation it is contemplated as if the Lord were in the midst of it and would value it in so far as He could. He would certainly value the gold. So it says in verse 27, "And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he walked about in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders come to him"; that is, He is there and He is walking and they are there too to question Him. They raise questions about certain things and the Lord did not answer those questions. The Lord would say, Who is John the baptist? and the enemies would say, Now if we say he is from
{464}
heaven this Man will say, Why do you not believe on him then? And they did not answer. They were not honest men. The Lord did not answer their questions: "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things". The Lord has the right of sonship to deny answers to men who are dishonest. Why should He not deny answers to men who are dishonest? Why should He encourage dishonesty? He would not.
But now I am speaking of walking and I go on now just for a moment to my scripture in the Psalms to encourage all of us here to walk about Zion. In verse 12 it says, "Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof". Do not let me stand here to criticise sisters who go into these big towns and look in the windows; pay big prices too. Let me not take any liberty like that. I do not wish to; but I do say, dear brethren, that it is a question of walking about Zion. "Walk about Zion ... count the towers thereof". Well, you say, what does that mean? Is that literal? No. It is what is here before me now, the brethren that are here, because I believe you are nearly all Christians. I thank God for it too. That is one of the greatest encouragements, that there are so many that one can call brethren that have not left us. Some have, and many have not. There are persons coming along all the time. We rejoice in this; they belong to heaven; they are pilgrims and strangers; they are going to heaven, travelling home to heaven. That is where we are going. We are on the way tonight. We get encouragement here. So it is, "Walk about Zion". In any day or week the brethren have opportunity to walk about Zion and tell the towers. Look at the brethren; go into the town of Plainfield, Westfield, Cranford -- what shall I see? What will a spiritual eye see? I am challenging myself. The Lord would encourage us to do it, to walk about Zion; walk
{465}
around not only to the front door, but the back door too. See what you can see; see what God has in the place. "Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof; mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces: that ye may tell it to the generation following". That is the thing to carry with you, for the coming generation needs to be told about what you are accustomed to. Tell the brethren of what the earlier days were. I often do that. Some of us are older than others and sonship entitles us to speak about what we have seen. Why not? I have seen a good many brethren, sons of God. They have been going around the world; one of them especially travelled to the east and west of this country, travelled through the Pacific to New Zealand; travelled about this country again, and went to England and Ireland and Scotland and all the countries of Europe. What could he tell? He loved to tell of those he saw; they are heavenly. They are just as heavenly as if you went up and saw Gabriel. "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones", @1 Corinthians 15: 48. That is what we are, dear brethren. Let us take it in, and go around and see them; count the towers, those with special strength - and bulwarks, and palaces meaning where adornments are; spiritual adornments in the sense of house or palace. Take notice of it. So that we are doing what the Lord did. I am stressing the thought of sonship: it belongs to every one of the saints: "such as the heavenly one". Let the dear brethren take that in: "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones". God has constituted us heavenly. Why not? It is the dignity that belongs to us; the best robe, for instance. The prodigal had it put on him; it was brought forth and put on him. I can imagine he always kept it. That is the idea. The Christian is always himself. He is not one thing on Monday and another on Sunday, not at
{466}
all. The Christian is ever himself. The Lord Jesus was always Himself. "It is I myself". And so it is one can always say it is oneself, and that oneself is the work of God. If one is a Christian he is the work of God and one is entitled to go around and see what there is of the work of God and to be what he is as the work of God. May God grant it to us.
{467}
THINGS THAT ARE TO BE FOLLOWED
@1 Corinthians 12:31; @1 Corinthians 13: 1 - 13; @1 Corinthians 14:1
In what I have read I am thinking of what is to be followed in the sense of qualities or things; not exactly of persons. Much is said of things in almost a personal sense, and even love, of which I have read, is spoken of thus. God has furnished many things that are to be followed. We read of inanimate things too and how nature itself speaks to us and teaches us. We had it already today, and my mind came across the realm of truth and I decided that I would speak about things that are to be followed. We have in the second epistle to Timothy a peculiar group of things in this sense; the setting or arrangement of them is evidently according to the need as seen at that time in the assembly. We have a similar arrangement of things in the Corinthian epistle. 2 Timothy as addressed to a man is more personal, and obviously the list of things which begins with righteousness has in mind a condition that had to be met and remedied at that time. God has His own way; we might say a medical way, for God has placed all the medicines that are used; He has created them and placed them for use. And so 2 Timothy, which is the one I am touching on for the moment, contains this most important group that might well be made the subject of a discourse; one item after the other. But clearly the object would be to furnish believers with what they needed in 2 Timothy days. We often use those words, and we have spoken today, some of us, of Jeshurun. It refers to uprightness and covers the idea of righteousness. It covers more in a sense, but it certainly covers the idea of righteousness. And so it is that Moses sets out this idea. He is said to have been the meekest man in
{468}
all the earth; that was a remarkable tribute paid to him by Jehovah. But it was not simply meekness. He had meekness in a peculiar way, but he had righteousness, and I hardly know of anything more important, only the discernment of the minister, whoever he may be; and of one it is said. "Blessed be thy discernment", meaning that such a one would have discernment as to the knowledge of things and as to the application of them.
And so Timothy is a young man representative of the many that are now in the field of service. There are a good many both in this continent and elsewhere, especially in the British Isles and in Australia. I will come to that presently, because it is what I have in mind; but there are a great number of ministers, qualified ministers, and the epistle to the Corinthians has them in mind, but the epistle to Timothy has them in mind particularly, because of young men. In one of the chapters allusion is made to kindling things; kindling gift. It evidently already had become dormant and it was a sorrowful thing that a man like Timothy should have to be told to stir up his gift. Of course, we all like gift; we all like the thought of it and the use of it too, but 1 Corinthians rather arranges the matter differently. This epistle contemplates the great use of gifts; so much so that persons who know have been sometimes obliged to think that the dear brethren at Corinth were making toys of their gifts, just as children would make toys of certain things. Persons at Corinth seemed to so regard their abilities. In fact, the chapter contemplates from the use of words that that was just the case. "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; when l became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child", @1 Corinthians 13: 11. You can see how sometimes young people gather up their toys they have on their beds and
{469}
put them away. One would be glad to see them put away for ever. You will understand I am not endeavouring to whip the young people here or the children, but only that God has in mind in this epistle and the next one that the saints at Corinth should be no longer babes. Time was when it was quite right and legitimate to be a babe, but to continue as such is wrong and has to be remedied; and the best remedy to use is the one Paul describes. You cannot improve on his methods. They are the methods of the Spirit of God.
So if we want to get young people to come into manhood, we have to teach them to put away childish things. I have not time really, but I should not mind at all if I were asked to give a list of the things that I would call childish things, but I forbear. I can allude to Timothy as a model young man who would serve an elder and serve him well and have no idea of displacing him or replacing him, but serving with him as Elisha served with his master Elijah. He served well and Elijah served well, and Elisha learned from Elijah. He was not slow and did not hesitate to use the very phrases, the very figures that Elijah used: we ought to be ready to do that. Language is of God. Man makes it to some extent but it is of God, and of course it is for all. The use of language is a most important ability. We can hardly serve in the Lord's work unless we know something of it. So Timothy was taught by Paul and was rebuked by him: "Stir up the gift" Paul says. He also says in his letter to the Colossians, "Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it", @Colossians 4: 17. So that if people are still on their knees or take their case in the services, when something is needed, then the Spirit of God will rebuke it because a gift is not given for nothing. It is given to be used. So
{470}
it was that Timothy was taught in what was said to him in the second letter, particularly how to correct himself. Maybe you think me a little harsh to refer to a great servant, because he was that, but it is that he needed to be stirred up and to be corrected. So it is that the many of us who are now in the field in the service need correction, and we should not hesitate if we get it, if it comes as needed. It is a matter to be thankful for, because we are to correct each other; we are told to admonish one another.
Well now, the letters to Corinth afford a fine field for my subject, because of the use which the saints there were making of gifts. Paul has recourse to beautiful language in this last verse of chapter 12: "But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence". It is one of the best phrases in the epistle; you could hardly get a better anywhere: "a way of more surpassing excellence". If anyone has a gift or is usable in the Lord's service, he does well to study it, and see if he has part in this way. The apostle stops then and takes up the way he has in his mind, which is chapter 13. It is there he unfolds this way of surpassing excellence. He comes down to the last verse of chapter 13 and comes on to chapter 14 and he says, "Follow after love". He had been suggesting that they might be following after other things, but he had the one thing particularly in his mind, that the servant is to learn how to follow after this great commodity which I may call love. The Lord speaks of it in that same way. He says, "if ye have love amongst yourselves" (@John 13: 35); that is to say, it is to be in yourself. It belongs to the saints; it cannot be carved out into quantities or squares, or held in vessels in that sense. It is to be among us; it is in heaven. It is among the angels, I believe. It will be among all
{471}
of us in full measure. There will be nothing else in a way, because love is the very life of heaven, and the most remarkable thing is that God is love. It never says that love is God. Some would say that, but it is not so. God is more than love. Years ago certain were saying that eternal life was Christ, but the truth is that Christ was eternal life. Christ is more than eternal life. God is more than eternal life. You cannot make a quality cover everything that is God. But still, God is love.
And so this chapter is taken up by the apostle and made the theme for the moment. I may say the apostle segregates the truth in the most skilful way - most wonderful are the verses running through this epistle - especially when it comes to the direct teaching of the assembly. Chapter 12 is worked out from chapter 11; but chapter 12 is worked out as the great matter of the assembly and the body of Christ. The assembly is the great theme of it, and in speaking of it the apostle seems to have stopped at the end of chapter 12, as if to say, I must make full room for this way of more surpassing excellence. I love that verse. I have already alluded to it. It is a way of more surpassing excellence. It is a most wonderful phrase and worthy of being left for the moment to shine in its glory, for that is what it is. We can look at it, go around it, and see how it does shine. And so he leaves it; and yet he does not leave it because he begins to delineate the thing in chapter 13, and it begins thus: "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels"; you can see how he changes his thoughts from chapter 12 to chapter 13. He says, "if I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal". Now I might say he is becoming contemptuous because he is alluding to persons who are not Christians and who would make toys of the truth, as
{472}
I was saying. I venture to say it is contempt. The person endeavouring to show himself and speak with tongues of men and of angels and who has not love is become as sounding brass and a clanging cymbal. You can see the depth of the fall from that glorious verse in the end of the previous chapter, and how it may apply even to a person, maybe, in the ministry. Let us, for instance, suggest Judas, because he was in the ministry; he was numbered among the apostles. He was regarded as a gift and was a gift, such as is spoken of here. Hence the contempt: "I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal". I am sure there is not a person here who would like to be classified in that way. I am certain there is not. And yet there arc those who are no better. The so-called ministry is dumped in that way abroad in the sects. Men go to school and college and take the highest orders and yet you find them shining up their classics; shining them up to make what they have got shine. I do not mean shining the books or making much of the books, but 'I know something about those books'. Well, that is what Paul means here. The very designation he uses earlier alludes to this. You may have ten thousand instructors and not many fathers. You may say, 'well, were there ever as many as that?' Are there not now? In the three hundred millions of Protestants how many ministers there are, how many of the clergy; and then the other sects. How numerous they are! It is a regular trade. So that the apostle says they make a trade of the word of God. I am not doing that, but how easily we can do it. I am not saying anyone here is doing that; I am just parading the truth, as it were, before us just for a moment so that we may see how Paul - as someone has said -shows a picture on the wall, if you can understand that figure; it means that in the Corinthians love was not there. It was there really, but it
{473}
was not shining; it was covered over by other things. There was rivalry. Love was vanishing. That was the situation, and that was how the whole structure was laid in these two epistles, to reinstate everything so that the brethren in Corinth should be really the assembly of God in Christ Jesus. Abstractly they were that too, but the point was to get them to be that really. And hence he touches this chapter in that remarkable way. And so he goes on to say, "And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing". One has said you could hardly be less than nothing. That is what the most instructed Greek scholar or the most renowned cleric is if he is not converted. That is what Paul means. I am nothing; if I am converted I am something. But I can have these things that he describes here and be nothing. And then he goes on, "And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I profit nothing". I need not comment on these 'nothings', these negative thoughts, because they are there. They are here before our eyes and we have read them and I am speaking of them now from my own soul to get a touch as to these things and to seek to discern if in any way I am defective in the service, because the service is entitled to the very best there is, heaven's best, and heaven is ready to give us its very best in view of the ministry.
And so: "And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I profit nothing". And then we get the positive side: "Love has long patience". Now you see the glory shining. You say, It is a mere abstract thing you are dealing with. No, I am dealing with things that can only be in persons. It is not in dogs nor in cows, properly speaking,
{474}
nor in stones nor in clay, nor in anything of that kind. It is in persons. It is the most precious of things. It can only be housed, as it were, in converted persons. I believe that is what is meant by the Samaritan woman we have so often spoken of. She had a conversation with the Lord and she was very ignorant at first, but she gradually grew and grew, and she says of the Lord, 'He is a prophet'. She would say that over and over again if people did not understand her. 'He is a prophet'; she had come to that, and moreover, she says. "Is not he the Christ?" She had grown into the thing and she was the vessel of it. That is what I wanted to just touch on. She was a vessel. We have spoken of it elsewhere. This very epistle enlarges on this idea of vessels. I have spoken before of Belshazzar's feast; he used one thousand cups of gold; they were called vessels. They were desecrated; they were profaned. That is what we have to be on our guard against, as we had today; so this epistle or rather the second epistle treats of vessels. In the Lord's supper we have vessels. We have carrying vessels such as the pitcher of water. There was undoubtedly the man who carried it figuratively. He must be a valuable man. He was carrying a pitcher of water and the brethren were to follow him and go into the house that he went into. What he did with the water is not stated here, but there can be no doubt it was used. It was carried by that man for a purpose. And so, later on as the Lord introduces His supper -in fact, before-others laid out the vessels that were needed for the passover. There were vessels and I believe it can be shown that they were used. In those days when the Lord was here on the earth there were certain vessels used and certain wine poured into them. The passover, you understand, was the feast that was before them as the Lord was about to institute His supper. The passover was
{475}
first and it had certain vessels. Then the Lord's supper came and it had a vessel that is called a cup. I am just touching on the idea of vessels.
And so it is that the woman of Samaria had touched on things. The Lord touched on things in speaking to her. He touched on drinking. She says, 'The well is deep and you have nothing to draw with'. But then the Lord was not speaking of that well. He had some other things in His mind, and that is what I have in my mind. We are all vessels. If we are converted we are constituted vessels for the Lord's use; sanctified and meet for the Lord's use and prepared unto every good work. That is the idea. This epistle has that in mind, as I said. It touches on the Lord's supper and it touches on these vessels; but now I am speaking of the woman of Samaria, how her mind turned around from the waterpot which she had. She had a waterpot; she carried it from that city to the place where the well was. Her mind was changed even while He was conversing with her, and she got into her mind the idea that her own body was the vessel. That was the idea. It shows us how we are here to learn; we learn from another. Every one of us ought to be a teacher, and I might say, every one of us a learner. The very oldest of us has to learn something. In a person's last breath, perhaps, something is learned as the Lord takes him. We all have to keep on learning or we will get rusty and forget what we have learned; forget that we have been purged from our former sins. Forgetfulness is a terrible thing if it is allowed to wear into us.
So the woman's mind was changed in that sense and she said, "Is not he the Christ?" She had left her waterpot. We have often spoken of that; she left it, meaning it was not usable for living water. I wonder if the brethren here, listening to me, have understanding. Pardon me for suggesting that you
{476}
have not; but it is possible that you have not. The living water is a usable thing and it is to be held in vessels and you are to be one of them. You are to drink it first and then use it for others. It springs up into everlasting life. "The water which I shall give him shall become in him", not in the waterpot, but in herself, in her own person, "a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life". She goes off to the men and is ready to preach to them. That is the kind of a preacher; she is the one; not that I would say she had a gift although women have gifts. They have now, no doubt, and they had in the beginning. She went to the men; that has often been commented upon too. She had to do with them before, but now she approaches them in a legitimate and holy way. She can converse with, and talk to, and even reason with the men. If there is any one here who is not a Christian, then I am saying to you, 'That is the idea you want to get into your soul, that you should be a converted person and be a vessel, and God will be ready to use you and will use you eternally'. In fact, all the vessels the Lord has are hung upon Christ. You and myself, if we are not thrown in promiscuously or kept in cupboards, are ourselves the vessels, living persons. That is what Paul is here. He now comes down to the positive side of the matter in verse 4: "Love has long patience, is kind". How easy it is to drink from a person who is ready to give you to drink with a spirit like this. "Love is not emulous of others; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up, does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil, does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth". With it; even if another has more of it than you, you are with it. The truth is the truth; you rejoice with it: "Bears all things". A young man came to me last night and was very difficult to deal with;
{477}
he was not ready to suffer. No; he was not ready to suffer even from his father. No, he was not at all. He would do something else. It says here, "Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things". That is this thing, this wonderful thing called love, for charity is not a fit word for it; it is not equal for it. The word 'love' is the thing. Love is of God and God is love, and so it is that the Christian as converted, as born again and having the Spirit has part in it. The Holy Spirit sheds abroad the love of God in your heart and in my heart. That is one of His particular offices in His lowly way of serving us down here, to pour out the love of God into our hearts, shed it abroad; 'abroad' is the word; to shed abroad the love of God in our hearts. I have already described a person who is not subject in his father's house, not subject among the brethren. He is not ready to bear anything. No, he is not. But this quality is seen here abstractly, and it says, "does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil, does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things", that means that all things arc to be believed. We are not suspicious. We are ready for testimony from honest people, and so we believe all things in that sense and hope all things, and we endure all things. What a time for endurance it is! "Love never fails". Never. One has often said that, and I feel it to be right to say it now. It never fails.
I go on now to the verse in chapter 14. "Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual manifestations, but rather that ye may prophesy". The apostle is able to say this word in chapter 14 because of the last verse of chapter 12. Now I am free to say what I have in my mind. I have gone
{478}
through chapter 13, and I want you all to go through it too. Get the thing into your souls. That is what Paul would say, and when you do you will be glad to listen to me saying about the gift you have, because I do not want to enlarge on the gift you have until you get this wonderful thing called love. I would say just for a moment that in the types, that is to say, in Exodus, we have the allusion to love in chapter 21. A certain man there called a Hebrew servant appears and Jehovah speaks of him through Moses, and when the man says, "I love my master" -- the word was that the man could go out free under certain circumstances. But he says, I have a master; I have a wife and I have children. "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free". I am going to stay and exercise this wonderful thing called love. My master will get the benefit of it; my children will get the benefit of it, and my wife will get the benefit of it. And then what you find is that in the book of Exodus, when that is attested, when that man has said, I love ... I love ... I love ... , the idea permeates the whole book. He has so said it and the Spirit of God has put it into his heart, so that it permeates the whole book, and hence the Spirit of God comes back again to the idea of priesthood. It had been already mentioned. Aaron was a prophet. There was need for priests, but there were young men that are just called priests. They are just youths, young people. They were to do the work of priests; but Aaron and his sons were not called priests yet. But this young man, this man called a servant, a Hebrew servant, meaning a slave, had learned the word 'love'. He had learned how to use it; he enjoyed it. He had good times with his master and with his wife and with his children, and he says, I am not going to give up these good times. I am going to continue in love.
{479}
I love my master and wife and children and I am not going to give up the enjoyment I have had all this time. And so it is that God said, Well, if that be so, if someone can say all this, then I can call my servants 'priests' because they are going to serve me and I expect them to serve me in love. God does not expect us to serve merely to preach on the platform. He has come back now to the idea of the service of the gifts, whatever they be. They are to be used; heaven has given them, but this wonderful word 'love' is now become current. It is a current word and well understood, and Jehovah says, Now I have priests. Aaron is Moses¬ brother; "Aaron, thy brother"; the idea of brother implies love. Aaron has four sons, and they also are priests, and they all are to serve Jehovah in the service of priests; not simply in the service but in the service of priests. The word 'priests' must be used, and that word can be used. The man can be adorned because of what it is. It is expressive of service, but service in love. That is my message now. It is that, as I said, we may learn, all of us, to look at this wonderful word and this lesson in @1 Corinthians 13, and see how the operations began. It is after we get this lesson that we get the full thought of operation. In chapter 14 the apostle comes back to his thought of the gift. Desire it, he says. Get the very best you can get. Be sure and get prophecy if you can. Work it; operate it. Therefore he describes a meeting in Corinth and a certain one comes in, he says, and he is a simple person; he has no pretension to be anything and perhaps he is not converted, but he comes into the Christian assembly, and they have been learning. They are not tinkling cymbals any more. They are real gifts and gifts exercised in power, and Paul says, Now I will give you an example of the operation of love. If a man comes into your assembly
{480}
and you are having a meeting and the gifts are all operating; they know what scriptures to use; they know how to look at the brethren; their countenances shine, and there is ministry. There are addresses given and are all edifying. And this man that comes in falls down and worships God. Paul says, That is what I mean. But the gift that you are to follow is to be exercised in love. When you are on the platform it is to be used in love, not in rivalry. All is love. The idea, I believe, of these two epistles, especially of this one, is that the saints are together in love. "By love serve one another". So every man is to be presented perfect in Christ Jesus and love is the bond of perfectness. May God grant it to us.
{481}
THE SOIL INTO WHICH THE TRUTH HAS BEEN INTRODUCED
@Acts 9: 1, 2; @Acts 19: 9, 10; @Acts 17:16 -34
J.T. The last scripture read has in mind the nature of the soil into which the truth has been introduced; not only the truth of Christianity but the truth of God from the outset. The scripture in @Acts 17 deals with the scope of the truth extending back to the creation, but looking into the truth of Christianity, linking it on with the concrete conditions in which Christianity is found. The few gathered as a result of Paul's ministry at the time in Athens were small but are intended, doubtless, to remind us of the hardness of the soil of educated society. Corinth, which was nearby, yielded much more. There are allusions to heathen conditions in the passage read in chapter 17. It is thought that it will help us as to the truth to bear in mind what these heathen conditions are and were, and how in the course of the history of humanity terrible elements arose, springing up directly from the devil, and, we might say, descending down from angelic heights to corrupt humanity as in @Genesis 6. It is, I believe, right that the brethren should be somewhat conversant with the terrible depths of wickedness that had to be faced and have to be faced; and in facing the wickedness that has arisen, or that had arisen, and that is now engaged in combating Christianity, the gospel, the idea of "the way", comes in or arises. It is a well-chosen expression involving that those who are in it are moving. They are not stationary or stagnant. The way implies there is movement, as it is said, indeed, in the Lord's own time: "He ... followed him in the way". One who had been blind followed Him in the way and the expression has become current to imply the truth of
{482}
Christianity and that it is moveable, moving on to a testimony.
R.W.S. Would you distinguish between the soil of Athens and the soil of Corinth?
J.T. That is a good question. The soil of Athens certainly was less fruitful; although the soil at Corinth was confused and darkened, yet the Lord said He had much people in that city and He was determined to secure them and that no hostile power should interfere. The Lord was determined to have them on His own terms, and those terms are the gospel and the assembly. Both features are stressed in the ministry at Corinth whereas at Athens, as the facts recorded in the passage read indicate, the educated or learned class dominated the soil. The results show that it was a very barren soil, but not wholly barren, for it was intended that the power of God should be seen in dealing with the indifference and callousness in the city of Athens. Undoubtedly God intended that the learning should be exposed, and directed His servant to go there and to bear testimony actually at Mars¬ Hill, famed as a place of instruction or education or information.
C.A.M. You had it in your mind to stress the power of Satan working. Do you not think that we are likely to underestimate his power?
J.T. I think we are very slow to recognise it. Of course, we are familiar with the thought of Satan. We are somewhat familiar with it, I suppose, but we need to inquire into what the real depths are. The depths of Satan are alluded to in the book of Revelation as over against the depths of God; in the power of the truth we are enabled to face the depths of Satan and overcome.
L.E.S. Do you think that the end in view would link on with the timely result in that a man and a woman are secured in such soil?
{483}
J.T. This seems to be a note of subdued triumph in that there was a result. It says, "Thus Paul went out of their midst. But some men joining themselves to him believed". That is to be noted. It is not as it was at Philippi where the women were in the lead; in fact there were only women there at first, although it was a man of Macedonia that had called out for help. That is not said of Athens; here it is, "But some men joining themselves to him believed". It is a real matter in spite of the darkness; "among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them". There can be no doubt that the fact that these two names are mentioned would mean that each had a subsequent history well known to the saints. We have a similar condition in this country particularly; places where the testimony has not prospered. Boston is especially a place of that kind on account of assumed learning and historical links, and New York on account of its great industrial prosperity making much of man, and Philadelphia. These are three cities that are well known in the American mind on these lines and we have to understand and have in mind to be true to the testimony in these places.
R.W.S. The cultured soil is harder than the commercial soil?
J.T. That is what I was thinking and those of us who have had anything to do with such education as leads to the higher levels of society know how it militates against the truth.
L.E.S. Do you think that the scripture in @Isaiah 40 would link on with this? It says there, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make straight in the desert a highway for our God! Every valley shall be raised up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and
{484}
the rough places a plain. And the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken" (verses 3 - 5).
J.T. Very good. We can see how that great cry in Isaiah bears on what we are saying and how John the baptist came into that. That great voice was lifted up: "The voice of one crying in the wilderness". What a testimony he was! How he introduced the Lord Jesus Himself in the opening of John's gospel.
L.E.S. The axe being laid at the root would involve the social side as well as the commercial side.
J.T. You can see they go together; the great phases of society rest in these things: money or wealth, education, and corresponding with these, intellect.
C.A.M. Would you say that the great vessel that is taken up by God in @Acts 9 is expressly designed of God to nullify the working of Satan in these ways?
J.T. You can see as John the baptist was taken up, so Paul was. Paul's ministry following on John the baptist's is found in chapter 19 of the Acts. But we can see that in chapter 17 he met the power of Satan and in chapter 19 it is seen working in Ephesus. The results of the ministry are most remarkable, leading to the conversion of almost all Asia. At least that is what is spoken of (verse 26). It shows that in Athens there was little or nothing, but in Ephesus a great deal and in Corinth a great deal; but it was a question of the men God raised up. That raises the whole question as to gift, for the gift was co-extensive with the power of Satan, the depths of Satan. The gifts are from above. The Lord Jesus went above all the heavens and gave gifts to men, so that the power was in men. The
{485}
power of Satan was in men, but the power of the gifts was seen in men, especially in Paul.
F.H.L. Saul the great intellectual would never forget he was struck down by a heavenly light so much greater than any light that he had in his mind.
J.T. Quite so.
A.A.T. What connection is there with philosophy and vain deceit as in Colossians?
J.T. That all enters into what we are saying as to the mind, the Greek wisdom; but what is said about Colosse is that an attempt was being made to adapt Greek wisdom to Christianity, to introduce it into Christianity. That is what is exposed and refuted in the epistle. But there are things behind all that, which we cannot find time to go into on an occasion like this, but certainly the brethren ought to be aroused as to what wickedness really is, what the present phase of the world is and how it can be met, because it can be met and is being met. The working of the devil in @Genesis 6, for instance, is an awful thing: angels coming down and linking up with humanity in the sexes. That preceded the flood, led up to the flood, and made the flood imperative, showing how seriously God took the matter at that time and brought in the flood. The Lord describes what was going on and says, "the flood came and destroyed all of them", @Luke 17: 27.
A.B.P. Is there any link between @Genesis 6 and the ministry of John to the Pharisees? He called them a generation of vipers.
J.T. You get a man there able to deal with the wickedness. "Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee ... ?", @Luke 3: 7. Of course, if they were judging themselves John would not say that. The question is whether they were, and so he begins to name the things that were influencing
{486}
men at that time. Take the early chapters of Luke. It is said in chapter 3: 8, "We have Abraham for our father", but John says, "Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce therefore fruits worthy of repentance". John is aiming at something positive. "Begin not to say in yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. And already also the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. And the crowds asked him saying, What should we do then? And he answering says to them, He that has two body-coats, let him give to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise. And tax-gatherers came also to be baptised, and they said to him, Teacher, what should we do? And he said to them, Take no more money than what is appointed to you. And persons engaged in military service also asked him saying, And we, what should we do? And he said to them, Oppress no one, nor accuse falsely, and be satisfied with your pay". Well, I think it is how the matter is met, but only in a comparatively superficial way, for more was needed than John's word here. The death of Christ was needed and was in view, but still there was the idea of reforming things and making them better, and at the same time, dealing with wickedness. There is little that can be said. There is no attempt to enlarge on the thing because there is not time, but certainly it is a thing we should all think of, the character of wickedness now and the features that are arising in society to develop this wickedness, and how they bear on the truth and how we are able to go through in the power of the Spirit of God.
{487}
A.R. There are quite a number of the brethren sending their children to colleges. Would this meet that?
J.T. Well, there is a danger in that and in all these things that are arising because the combinations that are being formed in human societies to combat certain difficulties are throwing the saints into them. The saints are being thrust into them and, therefore, trade-unionism has a great power because the success in these trades or professions depends on associations, and of course we set to work to defend the associations and therefore the leavening begins; whereas the matter has to be dealt with suffering-wise. Instead of putting ourselves and our children into these things and promoting them, the wisdom would be to be content with less, and to keep our children out of the societies.
C.A.M. Really the whole matter of Babel depended on their hanging together. It was a society business.
J.T. That helps in what we are saying because they say, "Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth", @Genesis 11: 4. These trade-unions and all that pursue that line, are holding together for mercenary purposes.
L.E.S. The high level of the ministry is over against the inroads of evil, the enemy coming like a flood would be met by the truth being held and maintained.
J.T. That is Paul's line of things in Ephesus. The highest levels were reached there and he came there from the upper quarters. Apollos was at Corinth at the same time, as if he was holding the ground on the lower level, which is the safe level. It avoids associations. The higher level, however,
{488}
is safe in so far as we hold to the spiritual side. What is high is spiritual.
Ques. Was there a trade union in Ephesus? It speaks of the artisans being gathered together in @Acts 19: 25.
J.T. Just so. There are other things like that.
A.N.W. There were books to be burned.
J.T. That enters into the position at Ephesus, showing how successful the testimony was. We are told the value of the books, and it must have been very great relatively, but they were burned.
A.P.T. In a way was Apollos a little behind in helping?
J.T. The brother and sister that met him saw to it that he was brought into the way of God. That was the thing that was unfolded. That is the point that is before us now, the way of God and the way of God more exactly. Apollos was amenable to the truth on those lines; he had a great place in Paul's mind too, as we learn.
A.N.W. The school of Tyrannus was the school to go to.
J.T. That is the idea. It was a separated school. There is not a college on earth on the principle of separation. That of Tyrannus was evidently, because that is where Paul taught. It is said, "And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly during three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way ...", @Acts 19: 8, 9. Now we have already spoken of Apollos and he also had been instructed in the idea of the way by Aquila and Priscilla, the way of God more exactly. The fulness of the truth is used in meeting these things so that the school of Tyrannus evidently must have been a severe, exacting school as to the truth, with no slipshod allowances for mixed marriages that bring in leaven. I
{489}
believe the school of Tyrannus is intended to show the severity of Paul's ministry which was needed at that time to establish the truth in Ephesus.
A.B.P. Do you refer to the significance of the name Tyrannus?
J.T. I think so. It was not that for nothing. The word is, "he left them and separated the disciples". That is what I was thinking about particularly: separation in that school. "He left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus". It does not say 'one called Tyrannus' as if you did not know who he was. He is seemingly mentioned as if you would know, as if he had a significance.
R.W.S. Does the time factor enter into what is accomplished at Athens and Corinth and Ephesus, or did Paul get the impression that his work at Athens was done? Apparently he stayed just a few days at Athens. I am wondering if he had spent a longer time at Athens would he have got more material; or did he move under such direction from the Lord that he knew his work was done at Athens and went on? You alluded to the long time at Ephesus and Corinth.
J.T. It is important to bring that in because the time at Paul's disposal must have been a matter of great consequence in heaven because his life was not very long. I would say that he was not more than seventy when the Lord took him. He spent a total of four or five years in prison, two at Caesarea and probably rather more at Rome. His service at Corinth and at Ephesus accounted for four and a half years so that about nine years of his life is accounted for. We can thus understand that his imprisonment was intended in the mind of heaven to enrich his ministry, and to bring out the very best in a spiritual sense. I believe the very best is to be found in the letters to Ephesus, Philippi, and
{490}
Colosse. All this reflects on the importance and the value of these epistles and indicates what a place they should have with us as we look into the truth.
A.N.W. No ordinary miracles were wrought by God by Paul's hands. They were extraordinary miracles.
J.T. Do you mean at Ephesus?
A.N.W. There were napkins taken from his body that effected healing.
J.T. There is no attempt, as I said, to exhaust this great subject because you cannot do it, but it certainly requires attention. And then in @Acts 9 we have the way; not that Paul mentions it but it is said, as the brethren will notice, "But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest and asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem" (verses 1, 2). The idea of the way enters into the very front door, as we might say, of Saul's history. What he did was an effort to refute and set aside Christianity. He is converted at that particular time as if to meet that great danger.
C.A.M. Do you think that encourages us in regard to what the Lord is doing today? Heavenly light has been shone on the way, and it shows the way Paul was to go, city-wise.
J.T. How suggestive all that is if the brethren are turning aside or tending to do so as they have been of late! Light has been shed on the way; not simply the truth but the way, showing how things should be done.
A.N.W. Would it not be fair to say that the current divine movement at any given time is what is attacked? Is that what is vital?
J.T. The word 'movement' is good; it is remarkable that we have here, "as he was journeying,
{491}
it came to pass", because the word 'journeying' is a good word that enters into his history peculiarly. "But as he was journeying, it came to pass that he drew near to Damascus; and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven, and falling on the earth he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?". Surely that is significant at such a time as this. The light of God was caused to shine so that our paths are illuminated. Those of us who belong to the assembly, as walking in it, have our paths illuminated. Light is shed upon us.
C.A.M. There would be a point in the fact that it was Damascus and not Jerusalem.
J.T. Quite so.
A.R. If our position is attacked today do you expect the Lord to come in and defend it in some way like this, showing Himself among us?
J.T. He has been doing it for a long time and maybe there is a little more light now coming in.
C.A.M. Do you think that it is remarkable that the truth of the Son of God was preached in Damascus? It was not at Jerusalem that this great truth came out; it was from some unexpected quarter.
J.T. He was preached as that; quite so.
R.H.S. Is this the way that seemeth right unto a man, who does not enquire of God, and the end of it is destruction? I was thinking of Paul and his movements prior to his conversion. At Athens, also, they worshipped the unknown God without any inquiry as to what they were worshipping.
J.T. The light came in on Paul's part.
F.H.L. Referring to Athens, would you say why the apostle said he thought it good to be left alone there? I thought it might throw light on @1 Thessalonians 3.
{492}
J.T. The facts were, as far as I can learn, that he was waiting for Silas and Timotheus. It says in @Acts 18: 1 - 7, "And after these things, having left Athens, he came to Corinth; and finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome), came to them, and because they were of the same trade abode with them, and wrought. For they were tent-makers by trade. And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks. And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head: I am pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations. And departing thence he came to the house of a certain man, by name Justus". I read that so that it would come out clearly that Paul was dependent on these men who were about to come when he was at Athens. It says, "But in Athens, while Paul was waiting for them, his spirit was painfully excited in him seeing the city given up to idolatry". The apostle, in his own self, was affected by the darkness at Athens, and the men that he was relying upon to help him in the work had not arrived. I refer to all this because it shows how the work of God proceeds and how important it is that we should have associations and work together.
Well now, Paul went on by himself and we have the results. It would look as if real work according to the mind of God was to take place at Corinth. The Lord had already said that He had much people in that city, but He does not say that about Athens; yet the apostle remained there and his spirit was stirred up because of the darkness, and hence this remarkable word that we have, which is applicable
{493}
to the present time as to what is to be presented in the gospel in view of current conditions.
A.P.T. It says in 2 Corinthians that the three of them preached Jesus the Son of God. Is there something to that?
J.T. Exactly; there was a united effort. "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)", @2 Corinthians 1: 19. That is a remarkable thing, and shows how the work of God proceeded at Corinth.
A.R. These five persons, Silvanus and Timotheus, and Aquila and Priscilla and Paul were engaged in the work.
J.T. They were the personnel that the Lord had at that juncture, and it shows how important it is for brethren to be united and to be working together; not in any kind of isolated way or isolated line, but united in the service, because the testimony is one and they are helpers in it.
L.E.S. Would you say another word as to the bearing and importance and character of the gospel in such a section as this?
J.T. What is brought out is the importance of brethren working together, not being isolated in any sense, or having special lines, but being held by the truth. I think that comes out in this section, and what we get at Thessalonica in chapter 17 is the opening and laying down of the truth on three Sabbath days. I think the principle of brethren proceeding together, moving about, interchanging services, and all that, is of the Lord. We should be united in the service. Athens follows Thessalonica, being just an isolated service of Paul's and successful only to a limited degree; and then there is the great work at Corinth, the workers including Paul himself, and Silvanus and Timotheus, besides those two that were there already. The work was very
{494}
great and much time was spent on it; and that there was much in mind too for all the ages, for the whole period of Christianity, is seen in the great importance of those used, the apostle and those serving with him.
L.E.S. I was wondering what you had in mind further as to the importance of the preaching and what is to be stressed under such circumstances as existed at Athens, and to the particular distinctive features of the preaching that might come forward at any given moment.
J.T. Of course we have read the passage and I think we will do well to get it into our minds a little. It says, "But in Athens, while Paul was waiting for them, his spirit was painfully excited in him seeing the city given up to idolatry. He reasoned therefore in the synagogue with the Jews, and those who worshipped", meaning the Jewish proselytes and the like, "and in the market-place every day with those he met with. But some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers attacked him. And some said, What would this chatterer say? and some, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons, because he announced the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection to them. And having taken hold on him they brought him to Areopagus, saying, Might we know what this new doctrine which is spoken by thee is? For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We wish therefore to know what these things may mean. Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news". You can see what that results in. "And Paul standing in the midst of Areopagus said, Athenians, in every way I see you given up to demon worship". That is what I was thinking of; the terribleness of the wickedness that is in paganism and that is allied with Judaism too here. "For, passing through and beholding your shrines,
{495}
I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God. Whom therefore ye reverence, not knowing him, him I announce to you. The God who has made the world ..." That is what I was thinking of at the beginning. He goes back to the creation; "and all things which are in it, lie, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands, nor is served by men's hands as needing something, himself giving to all life and breath and all things; and has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling, that they may seek God; if indeed they might feel after him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us; for in him we live and move and exist". So that he brings out Christianity and God among the Christians; not far away from them but among them. Surely that is of great importance just now in our meetings and in our services, that God is with us.
C.A.M. He covers a remarkable scope, does he not? He starts with the creation but he goes on until everything is settled in the judgment. The whole chapter of responsibility is covered in this short preaching.
J.T. Just so, it leads up to the day that is fixed, when the millennium will begin.
A.R. Did this combination creep into Christendom? What is pagan and what is Jewish crept into Christianity.
J.T. We are suffering from it every day.
A.A.T. Paul is able to condense his whole sermon to a very few words and it takes very few minutes. I notice our preachers stand up for three-quarters of an hour. Why is it necessary for our brothers to be so long in the preaching when he was so brief and to the point, and got results?
{496}
J.T. The soil is hard. We have to admit that, and I believe God knows it and is with us in our Sunday evening preachings. The Lord is with us and, even though there may be not many conversions, the work is going on; the steady work is going on and is perfecting the saints.
A.P.T. The gift of the evangelist is in Ephesians "for the perfecting of the saints". That is possibly left out a good deal.
A.N.W. That last verse is perhaps our position today. There might not be much outwardly; there may be mockery, etc., "But some men joining themselves to him believed". That is what is going on.
J.T. That is what I was thinking at the very beginning. There were men; some men and then a woman. That fact that there were men in Athens is something to note, and the fact that one here and there is coming into the truth is something to note.
A.N.W. They joined themselves to him. That is an important matter.
J.T. Joining themselves to him was not a partisan matter; it was a question of what he was ostensibly. So at Philippi, the man that Paul saw in his vision was from Macedonia. He was asking for help and Paul went to Philippi and got into prison. He suffered dreadfully, but he got the man. The woman had already been found; the women were there. The Lord had opened the heart of Lydia to attend to the things spoken by Paul, but the man, the jailer, was secured, which was a great triumph. If we keep on with our meetings on Lord's day evening, although there may not be conversions, yet there is the perfecting of the saints, the completion of the assembly, and especially young people coming into the truth.
Ques. Would "Let there be light" (@Genesis 1: 3) and "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine" (@2 Corinthians 4: 6), fit in here?
{497}
J.T. It is an act of God to bring light out of darkness.
V.C.L. Do you think Paul's efficacy in preaching was due to the way in which he felt idolatry? Do you think if we felt more the need of the truth coming in we would have more power?
J.T. Just so; and then the agonizing in prayer that it might come in. I think a man like Elijah is a suggestion for us. He put his face between his knees and the man's hand soon came up. It was what God was going to do: outwardly small but presently very big. What we are doing now is going to assure big things when the assembly goes to heaven and the work of God appears in the millennial day.
R.W.S. The psalmist speaks of those in whose heart are the highways; the highways are in our hearts now but the enemy is behind hindering them and the world being opened, so that we do not have intercourse as we had previously.
J.T. There may be that. Certainly I was conscious of it a few months back but still the way was opened and I think it is going to be opened again. I think the Lord is going to make a way for the brethren to visit each other.
R.W.S. That would mean the international situation would quieten down.
J.T. I think so; and international things that are pending if they come about would mean more interchange internationally. Certain things are pending. I know what they are and I think God is going to bring them about and the way will be opened up presently.
Rem. In @Judges 5, Deborah spoke of the death of Sisera and of the time when the highways were unused.
J.T. "Until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel" (@Judges 5: 7), showing God was
{498}
working. That chapter in Judges is really an opening up of things for the saints in the sense of poetic ministry; there is rebuke to those who lag behind, but praise for those who went forward. That is what is needed now, that the brethren should move, and instead of taking things easily and quietly and comfortably, should go into the front and be tending things, acquiring things, and succeeding in doing things.
A.P.T. The Lord might prosper us if we had these gospel meetings again.
J.T. God is with us in anything of that kind.
F.H.L. In @Isaiah 35: 8, it says, "A highway shall be there and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness". Is this leading on to that?
J.T. Very good. I thought of that connection; a highway shall be there.
F.S.C. Even fools shall not err therein.
A.B.P. Does the street called 'Straight' coming in at Paul's beginning indicate that he was to have a very definite part in the bringing in of this highway?
J.T. Quite so. You can see that much is made of his journeyings. You can see that what we are speaking of is just what is in mind: he says, "From Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ", @Romans 15: 19. That was a great extent of testimony.
C.A.M. The Preacher in @Ecclesiastes 7: 28 said that he had found a man, but that he had not found a woman. Do you think in connection with our preachings the first thing should be to find a man? I mean on the principle of this cry from Macedonia. Sometimes our preachings become a sort of address to Christians. The preachings in the Acts are remarkable for the way they bring out the elementary side, so that every man can understand what is being said.
{499}
J.T. Paul, it seems, is the one to go by. He preached the Lord Jesus that He was the Son of God. That is the first thing he did.
A.N.W. But at Athens he does not use his Bible.
F.H.L. The resurrection seems to be the test here.
J.T. That is the way they took it up. They thought there were two things: Jesus and the resurrection, showing he was stressing two things.
A.R. The preacher is minister of the assembly. Is that not important?
J.T. Yes; he preached that Jesus is the Son of God. That seems to have gone through that section. He and Silvanus and Timotheus preached that Jesus is the Son of God. He says, in Him is Yea and Amen. We are dealing with verities in what we are speaking of, so that one's hope was that we should understand the way and see how it came into Paul's ministry, how his ministry was the idea of it and how it was opposed. He says, The way which they call sect. They called it sect, but it was the gospel and the truth of the assembly as well. So that the two things are in mind in what was read: Paul's gospel and the truth of the assembly. That was all that was in mind and one hopes that what has been before us will lead to something in that sense.
{500}
DIVINE ENERGY RENEWED IN REVIVAL (1)
@Acts 13: 1 - 13, 43 - 52
J.T. I was thinking of the renewal of divine energy in the Lord taking up Paul in his ministry; the renewal of the whole position. The whole dispensation, indeed, takes on the character of revival, evidences of renewed divine energy, going on until the end although in reduced measure, but still retaining the idea of renewal, renewed energy. It is thought that we might look at Paul in this sense.
It is clear that the movement now in view began with the introduction of Cornelius who may be taken as a representative of the gentiles, but certain features were needed to lead up to and introduce the movement in Paul and Barnabas, especially in Paul, for the chapter contemplates Paul coming into the lead in the divine movement. It is thought that it will be a help to us here to review a little of the divine way in revivals. The Lord may be pleased to continue the movement here in this city and enlarge it, and it will be advantageous to the brethren if a new clear apprehension is had of this feature in the economy; that is, the feature of revival.
The chapter read is unmistakable as entering definitely on an inaugural position in the sense of revival, and Antioch, not Jerusalem, is stressed. "Now there were in Antioch", it says. That is how the thing is begun. It was what was there; not simply a revival in the place. The thing was already there, and suitable for the divine movement, and that divine movement is characterized by the place given to God, the service of God. "Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was there, prophets and teachers", and then the list is given. Then the Holy Spirit says in verse 2, "And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which
{501}
I have called them". So that the Spirit of God is stressed too as at Pentecost. He is acting Himself; that is, God acting in the character of the Spirit.
C.A.M. Would you say it is a principle that God acting in the Holy Spirit requires material, spiritual material to operate?
J.T. That is a good point to bring up, because it was so in all revivals. It is hardly suitable to speak of Adam himself, but there was something in the sense of revival in Abel, and then in Seth, and in Enoch. We may see what was there; and so in the great movements in Noah himself and in Abraham; and then in Joseph and Moses and David, divine instruments already there, carried down from previous movements, even inclusive of the creation of Adam and all that flowed out from him and Eve; but the revival was in Abel. I do not know whether I am saying too little, but I am sure the brethren will get the idea at once, that it is a matter of divine energy revived. The energy is always there, for God does not change; Christ does not change, and the Spirit does not change. But in the saints there is change.
And in Antioch there is what is called the assembly; "the assembly which was there"; it is not simply persons or a number of persons, but the assembly which was there.
R.W.S. Was it not a key city such as the city we are in? It says in chapter 11 that those who preached went as far as Antioch "and the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go through as far as Antioch" (verse 22); and then he found Paul and brought him to Antioch, and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. Does that all bear on what you had in mind?
J.T. Very much, it is very helpful too as to the point before us. It is a sort of key position, and so
{502}
is this a key position. The government if God has made it such in comparatively recent years, and God recognizes such circumstances, and His testimony would follow whatever there is in that sense.
A.A.T. I notice it says as they were ministering and fasting that the Holy Spirit spoke. What kind of service is that?
J.T. It is good to bring that up, because it is a question of what they were doing, and it was not any political or social matter. It referred to God. These men were competent; they were qualified men. There were prophets and teachers, and they comprised "Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul". These are the men. The inference plainly is they have already got a reputation from heaven. They are able to take the matter on, and it is as that was happening it says, "And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said", (this was a divine announcement, you might say) "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". So it is to set aside all pretension to human innovations and introductions and the like. It is a question of God and what people are doing towards God, persons qualified to act for God, to carry on the service of God; that is what they were doing.
A.N.W. Does this revival idea develop as an offset to a decline in another place such as Jerusalem, if it is fair to speak of Jerusalem in that way? Is it God offsetting failure in another place with new life in a new place?
J.T. It looks as if that is the case. Antioch is recognised and what was there. That is a word to be noticed: "the assembly which was there". The word 'there' is not really in the original, but it is the idea;
{503}
"which was", only it is in Antioch, but it has an existence.
A.R. In some cities in this country they would not let Niger break bread. I mean there are restrictions in this country in connection with race and the like.
J.T. If we take up the use of the word, I think the southern part of this country (and it is a little bold to use these words in the capital) has lost advantages from God because of restrictions placed on certain people. That brought on the Civil War. These things are to be noted by us and we are to avoid them; not to prolong them but to avoid them.
C.F.E. Is it possible that these revivals are met with opposition?
J.T. Usually; only I think God is not stressing opposition in revivals. He is rather stressing what He is doing, not what men might do against Him. And so you take Abel; it is true that opposition was there, murderous opposition, and God is calling attention to Abel right down in the testimony; "the blood of righteous Abel" speaks; it has a voice, and that is something to be borne in mind, that revival carries something in the sense of a voice from someone; and there was the blood of Abel but then the word is mentioned indeed even including Abel. It is a question of what God is doing that we ought to be occupied with.
-.P. When Enosh was born people began to call on the name of the Lord. Is that in the sense of revival?
J.T. That is a good word to bring in, because it was from a certain time. "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah", @Genesis 4: 26. That was at a certain time and that time was marked by Seth calling his son Enosh, which means a weak sort of person, a person not to be made much of. He makes way for the power of God. "For when I am weak, then I am powerful", @2 Corinthians 12: 10. I think the
{504}
idea is that it is the state we are in; if we are going to do anything here we are to be feeble and make way for God to undertake for us. You may say, We have not got much gift here, but that only makes way for God. God can do things in spite of that, and therefore, "when I am weak, then I am powerful". That is what is meant at that particular juncture. The word appears often as denoting man in a certain condition. That is to say, the human race is continued because God is not taking up any other race; not even angels. It is the human race He is continuing with, but already recognized, however, weak and needing divine power.
V.C.L. Are we thus able to move the divine calendar forward by the state of soul and exercise we may be in by these revivals?
J.T. It may be a question of the state of the crops. The state of the crops indicates what part of the year we are in. The state of the crops indicates not simply decline but divine power, growth in the cereals. I do not know whether that is clear?
V.C.L. I was just thinking it is not just sovereignty, that God comes in completely of Himself, but He is warranted in all that He does because of what is there.
J.T. Quite so; it is not just divine sovereignty. It is that in a sense, but it is what is in the crop; that is to say, what the earth yields, and the crops are indicative of what time of the year we are in. As for instance, in Egypt in the time of the plagues certain crops came up quickly such as flax. The flax was prompt. There was life shown. Wheat is slow. Barley is earlier than wheat, and therefore we can determine the state of things by these matters. Barley therefore is a type of the Lord Jesus as risen from the dead; whereas wheat is the type of what comes in later than that. The saints are the wheat. We are also living, only Christ is before us;
{505}
"the first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming".
C.A.M. There would be no crop from this man that comes under the governmental hand of God; darkness comes upon him as being made blind.
J.T. Just so. We must have the sun and the earth. There may be too much earth sometimes, and too much sun. In Egypt there is too much sun and in the south here sometimes; but you must have the two ideas: the light in the sun and the earth. The earth is a subjective thought where life operates, and that is what is in mind in this particular revival; that is, the idea of eternal life. At the end of the chapter, what is called attention to is eternal life. Verse 48 says, "And those of the nations, hearing it, rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord, and believed, as many as were ordained to eternal life". That is something to think of too as we proceed, this matter of eternal life; but the matter of the crops is, I think, very instructive.
A.R. God says, "The feast of the unleavened bread shalt thou keep ... at the appointed time of the month Abib", @Exodus 34: 18. That month suggests the month of corn ripening.
J.T. That supports what we are saying. It is not simply that you go by the sun. The astronomer goes by the sun, of course, and the mariners do too, but the farmer does not; he goes by the earth. These are all important because God takes them up as instructive among us.
J.E. Are the words of the Lord Jesus in @John 4 helpful? The fields are already white. Does that help in this matter of revival?
J.T. The Lord indicated that life was operating earlier than people thought, because it was there in Him.
J.E.S.Jr. Would you permit some crops from other states to be transferred to Washington?
{506}
J.T. Yes; they are here today.
J.E.S.Jr. I mean so they can grow up here.
J.T. It is the largest number I have ever seen here.
E.A.L. The earlier reference to Cornelius seems to be interesting in this connection. In chapter 10 it says, "But a certain man in Caesarea -- by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic, pious, and fearing God with all his house" (verse 1), and then later on it says, "having called together his kinsmen and his intimate friends" to hear Peter (verse 24). Revival is understood mostly by us in a collective sense, but the revival of necessity must come through the household.
J.T. Very good. You mean that Cornelius was a household man.
E.A.L. Yes; it is noticeable in this city that there are those who have opened their houses to the saints with the idea of supporting the testimony.
J.T. Cornelius was a forerunner; he was a little before the time. He was recognized before he had the Spirit. He was really a subject of the work of God already as mentioned in @Acts 10. He was a subject of the work of God but he needed perfecting. He needed Peter. He needed a person whom God could use. Cornelius was not to be used; Peter was to be used, for God had not given up the primary thought in the dispensation, and that primary thought was in the twelve apostles. He had not given that up, but He took up a man that could be symbolical of the work He was carrying on. It is a question of, "What hath God wrought!" He is now working in gentiles, but He is not giving up the kind of workman; that is to say, the twelve apostles; but now He is coming to others: Paul and Barnabas, but particularly Paul. God had a right to select a man like Paul, and so we have Paul in our chapter. He is mentioned the last of the list, which is remarkable.
{507}
Although he had been working successfully, the Spirit of God holds to the general position as it might have been seen by any observer at that time, that Barnabas was distinguished among the twelve and called the son of consolation. The twelve had called him that, so that the twelve were still in mind.
S.McC. Would the choiceness of assembly formation as now seen be particularly in mind in this revival? Paul is the vessel used particularly to complete the word of God.
J.T. Yes; although God says, I have my ministers, including Barnabas who is distinguished, but he is distinguished by the twelve. The twelve distinguished him directly in that they were permitted to name him. He is thus distinguished and takes the lead in this new movement. The fact that the list begins with Barnabas indicates this.
A.N.W. There is remarkable variety in the few names mentioned. You have Barnabas first, "and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch" (that element is there) "and Saul".
J.T. A sort of representation of nobility. God is no respecter of persons. They are all men and He is working with men, only there are persons of distinction and God has His grades and distinctions, and He is holding to them. He has a right to do that. The blessed God might say, 'Paul is distinguishing himself; I do not need to distinguish him'. But God is saying, 'It is just wholesome to let him stay where he is'. He is Saul; he is the last one to be mentioned. If he were asked to put his name down, he would put it down last too; "less than the least of all saints" he says, because he persecuted the assembly of God.
E.A.L. Is there a significant contrast in verse 9 where he takes up the challenge? He is the first to
{508}
speak there. Is that to bring out that he is taking the spiritual lead there?
J.T. God intended that; let him do things; let him purchase to himself a good degree and much boldness in the faith. God is not pushing him forward.
A.N.W. He is not exactly called Paul; he is that.
J.T. Just so; "who also is Paul", meaning he is a small man. He said he was not worthy to be called an apostle.
C.A.M. I think it is a great consolation to see that God has His hand over the personnel in any city, especially in a place where He is going to work. It prevents looking on one another in a haphazard way or with personal feeling.
J.T. God is putting His finger on the thing that is despised and is showing that He is not despising it.
G.MacPh. Do prophecy and teaching come under the attention of heaven?
J.T. Good; the two sorts of gifts. There were prophets and teachers; prophets are gifts who will bring God to people, and teachers would regulate people, and name the things that they are to be taught, which is very important because a simple man might come in, as we are told in 1 Corinthians; a simple person, or may be an unbeliever, might come in and he recognizes that God is there, not a teacher but God, and he recognizes that through the prophetic word. Then there is teaching; we need teachers, persons who can call things by name.
E.A.L. In verse 20 it says, "And after these things he gave them judges till Samuel the prophet". Does that stress the prophetic side of things?
J.T. It is indicative of God's time of moving in a certain way. The idea of prophecy began, as it were, with Samuel. Abraham is called a prophet but Samuel is given distinction because he is taken up especially to illustrate the bearing of prophetic ministry at a time of decline, and so none of his
{509}
words fell to the ground. That is remarkable, because many of us feel we say many things that do not seem to tell much, but it was not so with Samuel. None of his words fell to the ground. It is meant that they were held in the souls of the saints, and if that characterises our meeting here we will have something.
E.A.L. Recently we had in @1 Corinthians 13 all about love, and then the first verse of chapter 14 says, "Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual manifestations, but rather that ye may prophesy".
J.T. That was to bring out that prophecy was a particular gift and is needed, and that, I think, is so now. That is the reason God has called attention to the very term prophetic ministry. It has acquired a name amongst us.
C.A.M. Recently you mentioned that a lot had been said about eternal life in the last one hundred and forty years; do you think that what has been said about it has not fallen to the ground, but that the meaning of eternal life has become clearer to us so that we will arrive at something?
J.T. No doubt, especially in view of the millennial blessing. "There hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore", @@Psalm 133: 3. That is the characteristic blessing of the millennium -- life.
R.W.S. The wicked world was to develop great men. Could this be looked at as a sort of offensive in view of checking the wicked world, God commencing in this small way with a brother who is content to be small?
J.T. Do you mean an offensive for attack? Quite so. Even in the latter days God raised up a man similar. It was an attack because the whole of Christendom was to be attacked, and so it was. Clericalism got a death blow. The brethren took its place. "All ye are brethren". It is a divinely chosen name.
{510}
A.A.T. At Thessalonica and at Corinth the assemblies were the products of Paul's ministry especially, but at Antioch the work had started there before Paul got there; yet he served there a year. The conditions that were there at the time we are reading about had some relation to his ministry.
J.T. Quite so. Barnabas and Paul, we are told, served in the assembly for a whole year, which is remarkable, because they were really forming the assembly, but they served a great crowd. The idea was that the crowd should be developed into the assembly; the word 'crowd' is to give way to the word 'assembly' and that was the result of their ministry during that whole year. There was a definite period: a whole year was used in the service, and therefore the assembly was there; and not only that but the products are called Christians. That is another thing. The word 'called' is there not simply an accidental thought; it is the idea of divine communication. That is implied in it. It is a divinely given term covering Christianity. They were first called Christians at Antioch. That was after that year. I think it is important that we should all see what Antioch was as a starting-off place; not that it was ever characterised by anything much after that. Cornelius lived in Caesarea, but Antioch was in the north.
Ques. Is there any thought in the laying on of the hands of the apostles? They laid their hands on them and let them go.
J.T. It would not mean they appointed them bishops and the like. It meant they let them go; laying their hands on them would mean that the assembly in Antioch identified themselves with these two men. They were happy to have them go for the sake of the Lord, but they would have been happy to have them stay. We do not want to get rid of
{511}
gifted men. For the Lord's sake we are glad to have them go, but it is a real sacrifice to have them go.
G.MacPh. Is it in your mind to help us in connection with the quality of the work of God in the assembly, and the kind of persons that are suggested?
J.T. That is good. We get their names here. Their names already are known. They are not coming up now as leading brothers; they are already known to be that and the name, therefore, of Barnabas is first. This list implies quality, I would say, because the Holy Spirit is pleased to identify Himself with those men, and He says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". That is to say, the Spirit of God would not take on novices. The book of Numbers implies that the Levites began as novices at twenty-five years of age. They were just journey-men; they were not fully developed workmen. They began at twenty-five. These men are not twenty-five; they are full-fledged levites, and the Spirit of God is saying they are good enough. They were equal to the work He had for them.
P.O. It says, "And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting". The idea of fasting seems to be important.
J.T. It does; it is a question of making way for the power of God, I would say. Fasting is a question of power. "But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting". I believe fasting is to make way for the power of God.
A.A.T. Is fasting individual or collective?
J.T. These two men are just workers. We have often spoken of Solomon's workmen. They are viewed as so many persons. It is not an assembly matter. The assembly is never said to preach or to teach. The persons in it can do both. Therefore, what is in mind here is these two men as preachers or teachers. They are chosen of the Spirit of God
{512}
to remain in this great work of evangelizing the gentile world, and Paul tells us how successful he was, how much he laboured and how much he travelled.
S.McC. When they ministered to the Lord, what Person is in mind there?
J.T. I would say God. What do you think?
S.McC. I had thought so. What character of meeting would correspond to this in our time?
J.T. If we say 'ministering to the Lord' it would be the Lord's supper. The Lord's supper is all a question of the Lord personally, whereas this goes further. It is a question of God under the term 'Lord'; therefore it would be the service of God, not the Lord's supper. Just recently a brother got up and we did not know he was giving thanks for the Lord's supper, but he was, and he spoke as if it were for God and the Father. The thing was so mixed up we could not tell what he was aiming at. This is more than that, more than the Lord's supper; it is the general idea of the service of God, I would say.
S.McC. Does that not help as to the prominence the service of God has acquired in recent years amongst us?
J.T. That is what I thought. The Lord would denote God here.
A.N.W. You will notice that the fasting precedes the prayer in verse 3 but it succeeds the ministering in verse 2. Would the fasting add to the ministering to the Lord?
J.T. I would think so. The whole passage would indicate to us that God is saying that this new revival is marked by the service of God.
G.MacPh. Mr. Darby has a footnote which says, "possibly Jehovah".
J.T. That confirms what we are saying. Jehovah would mean God.
{513}
E.A.L. Mr. Darby has said that the notion of a clergyman is a sin against the Holy Spirit. This is the opposite of that; it is service God-ward.
J.T. It is the Holy Spirit that is in mind here. It is not simply God or the Lord, but the Holy Spirit; what is said is by the Holy Spirit directly. "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". The Holy Spirit is exalted, as it were, in this section.
Ques. When you speak of the service of God, just what meetings do you include under that term?
J.T. Prayer would be that; only we can pray to the Lord and to the Father and God; but what would be particularly in mind is just what we are saying; what we have now through grace and what has been revived: divine service, not on the clerical principle but by the brethren, those who are priests unto God, and that word 'priests' includes all of us. Peter says, "a holy priesthood". We are all constituted priests unto God. It is that kind of service, the service of priests God-ward.
A.N.W. Is that not particularly interesting here in that they are designated prophets and teachers? That is not service to man. Their service would be man-ward but it takes the phase of ministering to the Lord.
J.T. That is just so. The gifts came under the heading of prophets and teachers. That would be service man-ward but at the same time that service man-ward may be turned over God-ward. That would be, I suppose, what we rightly do on the first day of the week. After the Lord's supper we have the service of God as such. Of course, it would be the whole matter of the Lord's supper entering into it, leading up to the service of God, the Father.
V.C.L. When you include the Holy Spirit in the term 'the Lord' here, do you really then imply that the Spirit fills a position on the Lord's Day morning?
{514}
J.T. I think so. We are dealing with mystery there, inscrutability. God is God; thus there is one God. That particularises it; but God includes the three Persons. Therefore the baptismal formula is: "To the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". God in the Trinity is in mind, and God in the Trinity is in mind generally in the service that is alluded to here.
E.A.L. In regard to your remarks about the prayer meetings on the Monday following the unique privileges we have on the Lord's Day, would you say that in the main the responsibility as to the prayer meeting is not truly understood or followed up? If you link the prayer meeting as you do and as is generally understood, so closely with what is service God-ward, why should there be such a sad falling away in the main on the Monday night prayer meetings? We get much fewer numbers relatively at the prayer meetings than at the Lord's supper.
J.T. It is well to bring that up; one does not forget that the sisters usually have wash-day on Monday, but it is really humbling, as you say, that there is a falling off, and that the prayer meeting is not as well attended as the service of God.
A.T.D. Would you say that the Spirit speaks as we are ministering and fasting in this way?
J.T. Well, yes. I think it is remarkable that it is mentioned that God is being ministered to when this appointment is made. "And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now ..." It is remarkable that notice is taken of what they were engaged with, and that is that they were engaged with the service of God.
R.W.S. It would be through some brother, would it not?
J.T. Undoubtedly. The Holy Spirit is not incarnate. He speaks through qualified vessels. He is
{515}
included in the Deity and personally He is deserving of recognition in that sense; only He has taken such a lowly place and He is content to keep it to carry out the divine behests as the blessed Spirit, because He is God: "the work to which I have called them". He is over the levites in the service. He is a divine Person in the Deity as much as the Father is. It is a cardinal fact that the divine Persons are on the same level in the Deity. That is inscrutable. We cannot take that up; we are dealing with revelation.
C.A.M. Would it therefore be right to say that the thought of the Spirit in connection with the well would be that the Spirit is regarded characteristically rather than personally?
J.T. Quite so. The Spirit is a divine Person, of course.
C.A.M. In @John 4 the Spirit is looked at rather characteristically. The idea of the well comes in there.
J.T. "Rise up, well! sing unto it", @Numbers 21: 17. @John 4: 14 is, "The water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life". That is distinctly a subjective thought; at the same time, it is a divine Person that is alluded to, and yet in a lowly way. He is subservient to the general position. He makes the truth of the worship of God real and intelligible and powerful. It is carried on in that subjective way; and the important thing for us is that the Spirit remains with us, so that there is power for the springing up God-ward in our services. When we come to the service of God on the first day of the week the three Persons are there. We assume that They are there; we say that They are there in effect, but we may overlook it. The Spirit is there at the very beginning. When we sit down together in the meeting the Spirit Himself is there; God is there; but the Lord is to be apprehended as coming to us
{516}
and it is important to keep that in mind. The power of the service lies in the permanent presence of the Spirit.
G.W. How does using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit fit in?
J.T. That is just what we are saying. He is there to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.
Rem. I was thinking of @Ephesians 2: 18 where it says, "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father", meaning through Christ. In that instance the Trinity is acknowledged in the service.
J.T. And two of the Persons are instrumental and the Father is the supreme Object of both. "By one Spirit" is instrumental, and "through him" is instrumental, and the Object is the Father.
A.R. Would you say something about love in the Spirit? It says, "But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers for me to God", @Romans 15: 30?
J.T. That is a good word to bring in; and another word is the communion of the Holy Spirit in @2 Corinthians 13. These things are all implied in the service of God that we have here, the service carried on by the Lord.
G.MacPh. The three times that the Spirit is mentioned in this part of the chapter He is referred to as the Holy Spirit. Does that have an allusion to His part in the Deity as a divine Person? In verse 2 it says, "And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said", and in verse 4, "having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit", and in verse 9, "Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit".
J.T. Therefore we are dealing with the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. That is what is stressed, as if to say it is still Pentecost. That is the great beginning,
{517}
the great inaugural thought; but this is a continuation of it in freshness in the sense of a revival. This revival has taken the form of a great ecclesiastical movement among the gentiles.
G.MacPh. The assembly is the habitation of God by the Spirit. Would holiness suggest the conditions in which the Holy Spirit would operate amongst us?
J.T. Just so; because the Spirit is here in a subjective sense, and He is here dispensationally. That is to say, He has come to stay; not to come to us as the Lord does, but to stay; and, therefore, we recognize that the assembly is constituted by the fact of His presence. Therefore, the Spirit is present when we come together in assembly.
R.H.S. Is the selection of those who are to take the lead in recovery a sovereign matter or an outcome of faithfulness to the truth?
J.T. We have already spoken of that. This movement is not only sovereign; it is something that is there already and recognized. The gift of the Spirit primarily is a sovereign matter. The Lord Jesus received of the Father and poured out this which they saw and heard. That was a sovereign matter, which gives character to the whole dispensation, but these revivals are in character the same only they have their own distinctions. Is that what you have in mind?
R.H.S. I was wondering whether recovery comes because of what is faithful in some who take courage and stand against conditions in the meeting.
J.T. The evil condition was on the island, not, of course, in Antioch. We have now entered on what was in the world that the evangelical movement had in mind, and it is very striking that this is what the two men found. It would be calculated to make them discouraged, but I think God knew how capable they were of going through discouragement. "They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit,
{518}
went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed away to Cyprus. And being in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also as their attendant". That is, they are fully equipped and still there is not much being done. Therefore it says, "And having passed through the whole island as far as Paphos", (it is remarkable; the whole island was traversed) "they found a certain man a magician, a false prophet", his name is Bar-jesus, as if he were the antichrist in spirit. They meet this remarkable man, which would be the Jewish system, and that is going to be condemned. God is going to leave it and go to the gentiles. Therefore it goes on to speak of "the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man". This is the kind of man that is needed for this movement, but there are not many of them; he is the only one. That must have been a test to them. So it goes on, "But Elymas the magician (for so his name is by interpretation) opposed them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. But Saul, who also is Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixing his eyes upon him", (let us notice that the man himself, Paul, is brought into view) "said, O full of all deceit and all craft: son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness; wilt thou not cease perverting the right paths of the Lord?". We have already alluded to the word 'Lord' here, that it means 'God'. "And now behold, the Lord's hand is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season". This is a terrible curse on the Jew. "And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and going about he sought persons who should lead him by the hand. Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord". It is a question of teaching, and an intelligent man is taught.
A.A.T. When you say 'intelligent' that is hardly the way we would speak of it today. The word
{519}
'intelligent' means a college-educated man, but was not this intelligence divine in some way?
J.T. It is a word introduced in connection with the Lord's supper. "I speak as to intelligent persons". The revival is in connection with the Lord's supper, and it is a question of intelligence.
A.N.W. He did not want merely to hear Paul; he wanted to hear the word of the Lord.
E.A.L. In regard to the last word you read about the proconsul, his official status is mentioned rather than his name. The attack is on the governmental position.
J.T. It shows the government of God is recognised, the powers that be, the four monarchies. It is stressed that God is with them and therefore the official name of Pilate, the governor, is mentioned in Matthew. God is carrying that thought into Christianity.
A.A.T. I notice it says, "then the proconsul, seeing what had happened".
J.T. He saw what had happened to the Jew. That is really the truth. But God is not giving up the Jews; it is only for a season. The gentiles are not going to have it all the time. The time of the gentiles is running out, and God is going to come back to the Jew again. But Christianity is running along with the powers that be, and therefore we are ready to carry on until the Lord takes us. This man is typical of the Jews coming into the light when that takes place.
A.T.D. When he saw what had happened he believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord. Do they go together in our lives?
J.T. They do in the sense of intelligence. It is very important that we should keep in mind at these Bible readings that we have, generally as well as locally, that the Lord is aiming at making us intelligent. We are so apt to say we had a good meeting
{520}
and to forget what is said. We do not carry it through the whole meeting even, so as to become more intelligent in the truth.
C.A.M. If we pursued this line we would be able to discern as to the ecclesiastical system which is becoming darker and darker, but it may be that even in our own settings some darkening thing is coming in that prevents revival.
J.T. It is a question of getting the gatherings right.
A.A.T. I notice that all Paul's ministry in those days covered a certain area. We could name all the seven churches, but where are they today? They seem to be almost dead and the light seems to be in the west. There is no revival in that area is there?
J.T. Well, the light that you are alluding to has become Mohammedanism, showing how solemn it is that God's judgment enters into the dispensation in that way; it will enter into it wholly because God is going to send a strong delusion that men will believe a lie; for the assembly will be taken to heaven and another dispensation will begin. We are at the close of this great dispensation and the idea is not that it should peter out, but that it should maintain its freshness and be received up into heaven in freshness.
R.W.S. Does intelligence as well as affection indicate that we should address the Lord Jesus not only as to the loaf but also as to the cup?
J.T. Everything should be addressed to the Lord in the Supper. It is the Lord's supper. It is not the Father's supper nor the Spirit's supper, but the Lord's supper.
R.W.S. There are still some who address God in relation to the cup.
J.T. I think there is a missing then of something that the Lord cherished, that it is entirely a question of the Lord in His supper. We begin with that.
{521}
G.MacPh. The apostle speaks in @Romans 6 of the form of teaching being observed from the heart. Is that continued throughout the dispensation? @Acts 2 begins with the apostles¬ teaching, we have here the Lord's teaching, and in @Acts 28 we have the apostles¬ teaching.
J.T. What is being referred to is certain thoughts that we used to have, namely that we addressed God in relation to the cup. I think the teaching that the Lord has furnished would insist that we should address the Lord Jesus in all that refers to the actual celebration of the Lord's supper, because it is His supper, not the Father's nor the Spirit's.
S.McC. Would you think that the addressing of God in relation to the cup proceeds out of overemphasis on the covenant in regard to the Lord's words, "For this is my blood, that of the new covenant", @Matthew 26: 28. Some have emphasized the new covenant to the exclusion of the setting with which the Lord connects it there.
J.T. I would go with that. Many of the brethren here today, perhaps, do not know what we are speaking of, but it is a question of the accuracy of Scripture and the accuracy of Paul and accuracy as to the Persons that should be addressed in the Lord's supper.
Ques. You might refer to the love of God without actually addressing Him.
J.T. But it is more the love of Christ. He loved the assembly and gave Himself for it. I do not think it is just right to say God loved it there. He purchased it with the blood of His own; but it is the Lord's supper and if we accept that we will change our minds in some things. Another thing that enters into that is that it is a memorial of Christ's death. "This do in remembrance of me", @Luke 22: 19. It refers to Christ. The memorial also entirely refers to Christ.
{522}
E.McK. We begin with having the full service in mind, but addressing divine Persons we have a right to address.
J.T. The Lord takes the matter in hand and it is what He leads to then. We have not got a regular ritual, and yet we have certain forms that we should use and that are the only ones proper to use; after that it is a question of the lead that the Lord takes; it opens out to what God is.
P.O. Hence the importance of intelligence entering into it; it would suggest a capacity for taking in spiritual thoughts.
J.T. The word intelligence applies to taking in as well as giving out.
P.O. It also would suggest a disciplined mind, would it not?
{523}
DIVINE ENERGY RENEWED IN REVIVAL (2)
@Acts 14: 1 - 28
J.T. I believe the brethren will discern that these two chapters (@Acts 13 and 14) are distinctive and bear on the revived dispensation coming under the direct influence and direction of Paul; then the effect of Judaism is again noted. There is already enough said about it in the chapter itself, but chapter 15 is to bring out how it was used of the devil to interfere with the course of Christianity. Chapter 13 is more general and leads up to a result of the preaching that is described in the last verse: "And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit". You find such notices as this from time to time in the Acts showing the progress of the truth and the jubilant character of it, all in the Spirit, as if the Spirit would remind us we should stay with Himself; remain with Him, as it were. And then another thing in chapter 13 which should be carried forward in our minds, is the fact that eternal life is noted.
A.P.T. Is the last verse indicative of the enjoyment of the state of eternal life? John says, "that your joy may be full" in his epistle. Is there any suggestion here that they had arrived at some sense of the good of eternal life?
J.T. I think it is to be taken notice of, as already remarked, and that it is the characteristic blessing of the millennium. "There hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore", @Psalm 133: 3. It is the characteristic blessing of the millennium, I would think, as vouchsafed to the gentiles. They are brought into it.
S.McC. How do you understand the expression, "as many as were ordained to eternal life"? How far does that ordaining go? Has it to do with the purpose of God, or is it connected with the ways of God?
{524}
J.T. I think it is the general thought of John; it is John's line, I would think. Eternal life is a question of the purpose of God; the promise of life, we are told, and John's line would confirm it. He quotes the Lord as saying, "I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand. My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father", @John 10: 28, 29. I think it is a stabilizing thought of eternal life as set up here on earth.
A.N.W. And yet judging "yourselves unworthy of eternal life" would indicate a state which would refuse it; not a right kind of sense of unworthiness; "but, since ye thrust it from you" he says in chapter 13: 46. Their action made them unworthy of eternal life. While there is God's side, there is the unworthiness created by my side.
J.T. "It was necessary that the word of God should be first spoken to you; but, since ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the nations". That confirms what one had in mind as entering into John's line of truth, and particularly where the Lord says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand. He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him", @John 3: 35, 36. It is to confirm the idea, not exactly that judgment is a fixed matter with God, but that it is an effect that has to be conformed with. So the refusal of eternal life, the refusal of the Son involving the denying ourselves of eternal life, confirms the divine thought of judgment. In @Isaiah 30 the pile of fire, eternal judgment, is ignited by God Himself, as if it were a necessity. He is forced to it. He desires the blessing of all; He desires mercy for all, but He is obliged to have recourse to judgment;
{525}
and hence He lights the fire with His own breath, showing how it is a decision reached by God which has been rendered necessary because of man's will, the exercise of his will in refusing blessing. For the blessing is a thought of God: eternal life. The blessing is commanded in Zion. And so the Lord in confirmation of that says, "I know that His commandment is life eternal". That is to say, it is the express desire of God that all should be blessed, and it is a fixed thing that those who are blessed have eternal life and they shall never perish. But nevertheless, God is obliged to turn to the curse, to judgment.
S.McC. I was wondering as to this thought of ordaining; whether it is specific or general. When do you apprehend such were ordained?
J.T. Well, it is a question of God's counsels, I should think. In result everything must be according to counsel; at the same time, to make out that judgment is ordained is rather going too far. The ordination of eternal life on the principle of faith is a fixed matter with God, but judgment is an obligation on God's part. It is a moral obligation, because of the outcome of man's will. That has to be taken care of. God is determined to have to do with that and to carry it out. Therefore, in result it becomes a fixed matter.
A.N.W. And so in @Romans 9, while the vessels of mercy are said to be prepared beforehand, the vessels of wrath are not spoken of exactly in that way. They show themselves, but they are not prepared beforehand.
J.T. That is seen in Pharaoh. God had mercy in His mind. Anyone can see in reading through the facts of the plagues that God had mercy in His mind, but Pharaoh hardened his heart. Therefore, God would say, It is fixed; it will be the way you make it.
{526}
C.A.M. The will of man is a very serious matter. It would almost look as if that was the only thing against the counsels of God. It says, "He that will, let him take the water of life freely", @Revelation 22: 17; as if the only ones that miss the thing are those that are against it.
J.T. It has often been remarked how much man's will will accomplish in effect. And if one were to say the lake of fire will be filled, it is the accomplishment of man's will, showing how terrible it is to exercise our wills and let our wills rule us; for God's way is not that; He is not willing that any should perish.
R.H.S. What did the Lord have in mind when He said, "and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die", @John 11: 26?
J.T. It is a statement of fact. It brings out the position now. Saying that he never dies would just mean that those who are alive and remain, for instance, never die in fact. So that the difference is only between those who fall asleep and those who never die. The falling asleep is only a kind feeling on God's part. They have the same footing in result as those who never die. "Every one who lives and believes on me shall never die". That means that the idea of falling asleep is, in a sense, of no consequence.
A.R. Does this word 'ordain' mean that God goes ahead of the preacher? "As many as were ordained to eternal life", it says.
J.T. I do not know what you mean by 'going ahead'.
A.R. The Lord said to Paul "I have much people in this city" in regard to Corinth.
J.T. Quite so. There is the question of ordination, and, as you may say, when you go inside you see it, as it were, ordained before the world was. You look around on all the persons that are there, that were ordained before the world was. But then outside
{527}
you have a different word: whosoever. The word 'whosoever' covers anyone, whereas inside you are marked off as fixed; your position is fixed. Outside it is not yet fixed; it is only in God's mind.
A.P.T. In @Acts 2 it says, "those that were to be saved". Is there something similar in that?
J.T. That pretty much corresponds with ordination unto eternal life only that it covers rather the Jewish position. It is the remnant of the Jews. "The Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved". That is, that number are going to be saved and they are added to the assembly. They are really elevated in the fact that they are added to the assembly. So that our dispensation implies a higher level and it is the level of the gospel.
G.MacPh. Is the assembly the sphere now where eternal life is enjoyed?
J.T. Yes; in the measure in which it is enjoyed now, which is only in a provisional sense.
A.N.W. The way the record puts it is striking, because the thrusting away by the Jews is the opening of the door to the gentiles. It brings to pass this word of their being ordained to eternal life.
J.T. It is remarkable that it is so. It is pretty much like the word in @John 3 that we have just quoted: "He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him". That is a terrible word and it corresponds pretty much with what we have here in Paul.
G.W. What is meant in @Matthew 12: 18, "I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew forth judgment to the nations"? Does that bring in this thought of revival for the nations?
J.T. Just so. Christ is said to have become "a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers;" (that is
{528}
what the Jews were then obtaining), "and that the nations should glorify God for mercy; according as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the nations, and will sing to thy name. And again he says, Rejoice, nations, with his people. And again, Praise the Lord, all ye nations, and let all the peoples laud him. And again, Esaias says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and one that arises, to rule over the nations: in him shall the nations hope", @Romans 15: 8 - 13. This is to bring out Paul's way of confirming the truth of the gospel which he preached. God was fair to the Jews and would do all possible for them, but He was also operating with the gentiles, and Paul was taken up for that purpose. So it says, "Lo, we turn to the nations" (verse 46). He is justifying his work and his way of dealing with the gentiles. All is fixed as a question of sovereignty on the line of blessing, but we cannot just put the line of curse or judgment on it in that way. God is easing it off, as it were, according to His own thoughts and the thoughts entering into this dispensation. It is marvellous that we should be still in it in this year, as it is called the year of grace; that we are still in it. This same gospel is still going on however feebly; the Lord "is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance", @2 Peter 3: 9.
E.A.L. In @Acts 13: 48, it says, "And those of the nations, hearing it, rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord, and believed". Is that a magnification of what we see earlier? After Herod died it says, "But the word of God grew and spread itself", @Acts 12: 24.
J.T. Just so. God is going on and that is one of the greatest comforts. Let us go on. Some may say, We are not going on; but let us say, We are going on. That is the resolve proceeding from the mind of God Himself that we should go on.
{529}
G.V.D. I notice it says in the next verse, "And the word of the Lord was carried through the whole country". There is a suggestion in the word 'carried', perhaps, of the levitical thought in relation to the ark of the testimony?
J.T. Just so; very good. There are some there to do it. Paul had carried it many a long mile from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum. So the word was primarily beginning at Jerusalem. Where it will end is a question. We have just to wait and see.
Well, to keep in our chapter as much as we can, the thought of eternal life has now been before us rightly. It enters into chapter 13; the first of these two great chapters. The end of the first is the Holy Spirit, joy in the Holy Spirit. "The disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit". Well now, we see what the ministers were doing. The result is plain enough there. The Holy Spirit Himself has taken the things up and fixed them. They were filled with the Spirit. But then it says, "And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed". The ministers are in unity; they entered together. The Lord has raised up a good many brethren that are able to minister. It is very encouraging too, but the question is whether we are together. Earlier it is said, "And all that believed were together", @Acts 2: 44. That is true in a general way. In verse 1 of chapter 2 "they were all together in one place"; the assembly was there in principle in one place, but in the end of chapter 2 they are seen as together on general grounds. They have affection one for another; and how they were carrying on indicated that unity was the point. They were all together at the end of the chapter, and the Lord added to that. Now here we have these two great ministers and it is said of them they are still together. They entered together
{530}
into the synagogue of the Jews. That is to say, that is what those who are ministered to will say; that the great ministers were together. They were all of one mind.
C.A.M. That is a very interesting thing. One of them was much more of a speaker than the other, but still they were together.
J.T. Paul had already become that; so that the word is 'so'. That word means that the 'together' was bearing on the results; there were results, and that they were of one mind was bearing on that. The end of the next chapter would show they were not of one mind, but so far they are, and that mind was bearing on the results.
A.A.T. Do you mean when Barnabas left them they were not together?
J.T. They were divided for a while anyway, and John Mark had his part in that; but the work of God went on. Paul went on and Barnabas took his own way, but it says, "And Barnabas taking Mark sailed away to Cyprus; but Paul having chosen Silas went forth, committed by the brethren to the grace of God", @Acts 15: 39, 40. That shows that the work of God is going on and it is a question now of another unity; of persons who are united being together, and the work of God is still going on. God solves the matter by being with us.
G.MacPh. Does the thought of the word 'together' in the light of the Psalms suggest the working out of the principle of eternal life in the ministry, or m the service of the ministers?
J.T. I suppose that is so; more than that. Chapter 16 brings out another chapter in the testimony: what Paul was there, a man that is to be noted, and how he and Silas suffered together. Paul and Barnabas here went together into the synagogue, but suffering together is a great matter. Of course, Barnabas too suffered with Paul, but Silas suffered
{531}
peculiarly with him. Chapter 16 brings that out, and how they sang in their sufferings. They began in prayer and they sang in the prayer.
D.Macd. The levites seem to go out two by two. We do not go on those lines today, do we?
J.T. We may, if we like each other, but it is rare. We are in a day of small things; the Lord sent them out two by two.
A.P.T. Verse 13 of chapter 13 says, "Paul and his company". What would that company involve and who would they be?
J.T. It is to signalise Paul; it is not a partisan company. That is another thing. We may choose each other for our companions in labour or it may be social. But it is not that. Paul and his company is based on what came out in Paul at that particular time. He had done a great work, a solemn work in regard of Elymas and in regard of the deputy; Paul is signalised in respect of the quality that he brought in; the intelligence of this man, only one man, but his intelligence was greater even than what was at Athens. There were only a few at Athens but the quality there was not equal to the quality here. So Paul's companions, although John Mark had left him, were glad to be with him. Why did John leave him? He went back from the work.
A.A.T. Is that what you mean by levitical principles not being carried out?
J.T. Why should John leave him? Levitical principles would work out in John staying there where the work was going on. Think of a man going back from the work, not simply leaving Paul.
R.W.S. They go back when they have fulfilled the work. It says in verse 26, "whence they bad been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled".
J.T. That is the finish of the section. It links up these two chapters in a most remarkable way.
{532}
The levitical side is in them; and another thing we ought to notice and will, I suppose, is that this chapter adds to what we have been already looking at, namely, the stabilisation of the local assembly. It is not now eternal life, which, of course, is a great matter as we have had it, but the stabilisation of the assembly. In verse 23 we will see: "And having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed". That is, before this section is finished, we have the idea of local assemblies being stabilised; able to stand, as it were, each by itself; as here in Washington, the meeting is set up and refreshed and fitted so as to stand by itself and maintain assembly principles by itself.
G.V.D. Would you connect eldership with stabilisation?
J.T. That is what the thing means. Persons who are able to move and hold things together. The principles of the assembly are held in stability. That is one of the greatest things to have before us.
R.B.P. How about Titus establishing elders in each city? Is that the same principle?
J.T. It is the same principle, only that it brings out that one elder in our meeting might have jurisdiction over the whole city although there might be twenty meetings in it; he has jurisdiction over the whole city. He is not simply an elder in his own meeting. Here it is an elder in the assembly.
A.A.T. How does that work out today? These brothers established these elders, but how does that work out today?
J.T. You know. You lived in New York and we carried on these meetings on the principle of the city for many years. It is the principle of the city; this principle is just the local assembly.
A.A.T. There is no such thing as an official elder.
{533}
J.T. It is a question of the thing, you know. What we had already today is what was there; "the assembly which was there"; "the assembly which was" is really better. So, we will say that you are an elder. Well, are you? If you are then the word applies. That is what I would say. There are brethren who are. I am not saying you are not one; I think you are; I have had to do with you in that sense. It is a question of the thing; even although the thing may not be officially stated. If the thing is there we can name it. That is one of the greatest principles that came out in the human race: Adam could name things.
S.McC. Would you say something more about the assembly and the city. Do not the two ideas correspond?
J.T. They do; you work on those lines in Detroit?
S.McC. Yes; but you would not call a subdivision an assembly?
J.T. No; I would not think it is properly. It says here, "And having chosen them elders in each assembly". I would say it would be local, the only assembly in the position in the city. It would not mean a city where there are several subdivisions, because the word 'elder' would cover the city then. I think it is because there is only one assembly that the word 'elder' is put in here.
S.McC. That is very helpful.
A.N.W. Would our brother's reference to Titus suggest perhaps an eldership that would make for assembly material? Establishing elders in every city might be a little different from choosing elders in each assembly.
J.T. There would not be any elders at all if there were no assembly. If the assembly did not exist the elders would not exist. Therefore Titus¬ commission inferred that there were assemblies in Crete, and possibly one or more in a town. Therefore, he
{534}
was to ordain them even although there might be five of them; there would be five persons to rule in them or more; that would be elders in each city instead of each assembly. It is to bring out the city idea which has had a great place amongst us during the last few years, because boundaries enter into that matter.
C.A.M. When you said that eldership would not apply to a local meeting, you were referring to a meeting in a city that had more than one meeting.
J.T. Just so. I think that is important too.
C.A.M. In the ordinary way, I take it, in a great many of our cities we have only one meeting; then eldership would be local, would it not?
J.T. The force of it would be in that meeting.
A.T.D. Verse 23 has reference to three cities.
J.T. Well, it is the word 'assembly'. It is not the word 'city' that governs what is said; what is said is the assembly. It is to bring out, I think, that the metropolitan idea had ceased. The word 'assembly' does not appear really in @Acts 2; it should not be there properly. The metropolitan idea was still in power. The word 'assembly' if it were used without specification, would mean Jerusalem. It is said that Paul went up and saluted the assembly. He went up to the metropolis. That meant he saluted the brethren in Jerusalem; he saluted the whole assembly there. That had continued right on until this chapter, even in chapter 9 where you have the word, 'assemblies'. Some think the plural is not there, but even if it be there we have not got the idea of eldership in it. That is brought in in this chapter. That is the reason I have alluded to it. This is a section and it runs on; Paul's line runs on. It is not the metropolitan line; it is the individual assembly line. That is to say, the assembly has authority locally in its own realm, in its own sphere. It cannot be governed by any other assembly, whereas
{535}
the metropolitan idea means it can. Such an idea means that some assembly has authority universally, and Rome has arrogated that authority to itself, but it is false. The only universal idea now is Jerusalem above, and that is the influence we are said to be under, she is our mother.
A.P.T. Chapter 15 could only be possible then in relation to the apostles.
J.T. Just so; because the matter was settled in Jerusalem. That is, their influence is an occurrence of that. Therefore, Rome is false in the idea of the assertion of universal dominion or universal influence in the assembly sense. Jerusalem above is the only assembly that has universal influence, and that is an abstract idea, because the assembly is not above yet except in a moral sense.
A.P.T. An elder in Washington might be a help in government at the same time.
J.T. Quite so; he might be a help if he had the gift of rule, the gift of government; but the gift of government is not the gift of an elder. The gift of government is another matter, although it runs very close to the idea of eldership, yet eldership is not a gift.
A.P.T. Perhaps help is needed by a good many that a brother who is an elder in Washington or Baltimore might be a help in a local difficulty in either place.
J.T. Only in the sense of having a gift. To exercise eldership in any other place would be going beyond his limit. The gift of government is specified in @1 Corinthians 12. Among the gifts is the gift of government and a man that has the gift of government has a right to interfere or to say something anywhere, but not simply because he is an elder. An elder is more a matter of the man's age and experience and the state of his house, etc.
{536}
S.McC. In the end of the last chapter of 1 Peter, does eldership there have a more extended thought? It is not quite the thought that we are referring to now. Peter speaks of being their fellow-elder. Eldership there alludes to something more than what is local.
J.T. I think it means in that particular case, experience, involving of course, what he was as an apostle. The apostles all could exercise ability in that sense. Even Paul would have liberty anywhere, but it would be because of his, gift and experience.
A.N.W. He seems to emphasize three phases of elderhood in his epistle to Timothy. "Who take the lead" as though there may be some who do not take the lead; and then "those labouring in word and teaching", @1 Timothy 5: 17.
J.T. Very good; but it gives everything its place. With a man who can take the lead it is more the moral power he has that you have to listen to him because of his experience and power in other ways. He is a man who is proved to have moral power, and we cannot ignore him. But then if he has ability to teach that only adds to him. Then, take a man such as Peter, an apostle. If he is there, we must listen to him. He is one of the Lord's apostles. There were only twelve and Paul and Barnabas were added to that.
R.B.P. Does "Paul the aged" suggest experience?
J.T. Just so; "being such an one as Paul the aged".
R.M. If you were in a locality where you felt the need of elderhood, what would you do? Pray about it?
J.T. I would do that and more than that; I have done more than that. In recent times the enemy has had a certain peculiar time among the gatherings. They were being upset some years back about this, that and the other thing; especially about the
{537}
collection, and different views arose. What was needed was experience. That was used. Many were able to say things that were right in this matter of the collection, for instance, and the matter is now settled as far as I know. We have no more difficulty about it. It is because the truth has come out in a measure of authority, and these are all important matters. No matter where a man is, if he has authority he ought to be listened to.
R.W.S. You support those who are in the right.
J.T. Quite so, and maybe give instruction that had not been understood.
R.B.P. Would you say a little more as to the gift of government?
J.T. There it is. In @1 Corinthians 12, it is among the gifts; it is a lower grade, I would say, and I use the word 'grade' rightly. There are grades; and a man that has the gift of government would not be equal to a man who is an evangelist or a prophet or a pastor. So that I would not classify him very much, but still he is to be recognized, that God has given such as that, who has the gift of government. It is not one thing; it is usually in the plural, governments. That would mean persons; more than one person who has that ability.
G.MacPh. It is those who are ordained who are qualified to rule in the assembly. The idea of ordination of the elders in each local assembly is that they are qualified to rule.
J.T. It is choice; it is a question of the apostolic choice. Paul and Barnabas would say, There is a man; we ought to put upon him the thought of responsibility for the stabilisation of the assembly in this town. I remember fifty years ago there was trouble in Baltimore, and there was a man who led publicly in the meetings, and he said, Do you not know that I am an elder; that I have a gift? That was his assertion, and that was the claim he put
{538}
forward that he should rule in the assembly in Baltimore. The truth is he and several others were creating trouble in the meeting. The Lord did not give them the rule of the meeting. That is what we are speaking about. It is the stabilisation of the meetings that is needed, and that comes about from men who are experienced; if you add to the idea of experience ability to rule in the sense of saying what is right, asserting what is right in the way of conduct, and what should be done in any matter.
A.R. It says, "shepherd the assembly of God", @Acts 20: 28.
J.T. Just so.
A.W. "Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart", @@Psalm 97: 11. Would that be eternal life or eldership?
J.T. Light is sown; that is what God does. God is good to us, and a righteous man will get light. Whatever he may need in the way of light, it is sown; as if it were a matter to be sown in the field.
A.A.T. In regard to the gift of government, have we a sample brother in the New Testament who is marked by the gift of government?
J.T. I think all the apostles would be. Their epistles would show they had it. If you examine their epistles you can tell. Take Peter; he had the gift of government; so did Paul and James, I would say.
Ques. Would you say that the apostle recognized in Titus something of that when he said, "For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest go on to set right what remained unordered", @Titus 1: 5?
J.T. Paul selected him for that purpose. Crete was a difficult place. He tells us why: "Cretans are always liars". They were difficult people. These characteristic things are apt to creep in amongst us in the meetings, and we must not overlook that. Certain places are characterised by certain things.
{539}
For instance, coal miners are difficult hard men; people who work down in the bowels of the earth and have to dig coal. They are apt to be hard. They have to earn their living by hard work; and so whatever the characteristic of a community is we have to watch against that. Take this city, for instance; take notice of what characterises the city. So it was in Crete. There were several meetings in Crete. The question is what characterised Crete at Paul's time. Jerusalem would be what the city was, religiously, pretentious, etc.
A.A.T. Do you mean Luke was a physician?
J.T. He might carry the 'doctor' idea too far, and become characterised by it, for it is only one idea; whereas the gift of government is given and God takes account of the communities in which the assemblies are, where the gift has to serve. If anything would protrude in him he has to watch that, that it is not to be relied on too much.
A.N.W. Luke gave way to Paul. Paul was the recoverer.
J.T. These things are all very practical because there are certain features that characterise certain places and we have to watch those.
E.A.L. Would a place like Crete be marked by isolation? It is an island position.
J.T. An island suggests isolation.
R.W.S. An elder in each city for each assembly, the plural idea; I suppose the more elders the better the meetings.
J.T. Just so. You feel how they needed it at Ephesus. Paul called them over to him and put on them the burden of the government of that assembly. We have not much time to say more, but we should keep in mind the features of this particular gathering, and the first one we noticed was the unity of two brothers, and then the distinctive sign that is noted in this place. It says, "And a certain man in
{540}
Lystra, impotent in his feet, sat, being lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked. This man heard Paul speaking" (Notice the reference to Paul's speaking, because we had it already and God is calling attention to it: a man who can speak so that men are helped), "who, fixing his eyes on him", meaning you have to discern persons who are the subjects of the work of God, like Abigail, to whom David said, "Blessed be thy discernment", "and seeing that he had faith to be healed, said with a loud voice, Rise up straight upon thy feet: and he sprang up and walked". That is what the man did. Paul discerned what was the trouble and met it and used his voice, saying, "Rise up straight upon thy feet". It was very urgent. The use of the voice is to be noted in ministry; the way the voice is used. He sprang up and walked. The man in chapter 3 was lame, but here this man had never walked. It would be an allusion to the gentiles; they never knew how to walk according to God.
R.B.P. Peter in chapter 3 invites that man that you were speaking of to look on them. "Look on us", he says.
J.T. Yes; he was to see how the fellowship was to go on; he had been brought into the fellowship. The point was the fellowship. He heard Peter and John. It is the idea of holding together in a band, a bundle of life; but this man never walked.
G.MacPh. Conditions like this in a locality need more than prayer. They need the right kind of speaking.
J.T. And the right kind of voice; the voice has to do with it, showing the idea of a man is in God's mind.
J.E.T. Would spiritual discernment come in here too?
J.T. That is just what we have said. Paul fixed his eyes on this man and he raised his voice accordingly,
{541}
as if to make it urgent. "Rise up straight upon thy feet".
C.A.M. Speaking of this matter of using our voices, sometimes we are able to recognise the feelings in a certain local setting, but we have hardly done much in just calling attention to the defect. The power is in the positive idea. He actually discerned faith and brought power in. That reminds us of the life of Christ.
J.T. The voice of Paul must have carried something to the man's soul. The divine ideal is carried in Paul's voice. I believe that raises the whole question of gift and assembly formation; how we are all to be perfected. Paul says, "to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ", @Colossians 1: 28. We do not want any dwarfs or deformed people. Paul had in mind that this would be a good brother; he would be an elder.
Ques. Does the idea of personality enter into the voice?
J.T. Very much. That word 'personality' traces it back to the Lord where everything begins. What a Person He was!
P.O. There is authority in the voice too.
J.T. Just so; it was an apostolic voice. That is another matter in this book. They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles. That was the beginning of this book.
G.W. Would not the voice of James in the next chapter show authority? "Brethren, listen to me" (verse 13).
J.T. That was authority in the assembly because he had an apostolic place.
Ques. Would you say this idea of speaking and the voice come out in all their blessedness in Christ? "Never man spoke thus, as this man speaks".
J.T. Just so; what a Man He was! So Mark says, "He does all things well", @Mark 7: 37. But
{542}
the speaking is beautiful. Luke touches on that; the words of grace that were coming out of His mouth. That is beautiful. Luke has the ornament, as it were, the ornamentation of the vessel; as they were coming out of His mouth. It is not simply the things that He said, but the words of grace that were coming out of His mouth.
G.MacPh. Is there more emphasis laid on the thought of the voice than on the thought of speaking? I was thinking of @Acts 9, the reference to hearing the voice; not only did he hear the word but he heard the voice.
J.T. Are you speaking of Paul?
G.MacPh. I was wondering if the voice would convey the kind of persons that speak the word.
J.T. Just so; we never fail when we come back to Christ and Paul. If you can get Christ and Paul you have ideals you can go by.
R.W.S. He fixed his eyes on him; that would be a help. We do not preach looking at the ceiling but at the audience.
J.T. Just so; his countenance ought to be seen. It is a matter of the touch of health in it. The beginning of the second book of Psalms brings that in: "the health of my countenance, and my God", @@Psalm 42: 11. God's countenance has salvation in it and it imparts it to your countenance. So the face of a man is made so much of in Ezekiel.
P.O. So Barnabas and Paul would zealously guard what belongs to the Lord too in not accepting sacrifice from the crowd.
J.T. If we are to get on through this chapter we must run on to that. The devil would revive the old pagan empire, and he has revived it; not that we want to name things too much to incite antagonism, but the pagan empire has been revived in a certain system that we do not need to name, and I believe it is in mind here. After Paul's performance
{543}
of this great miracle it says, "But the crowds, who saw what Paul had done, lifted up their voices in Lycaonian, saying, The gods, having made themselves like men, are come down to us". How remarkable that is. I was thinking of "sons of God" who came down in @Genesis 6; that came down and corrupted the earth. "The gods, having made themselves like men, are come down to us. And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury, because he took the lead in speaking". They are just deifying his speaking. The Greeks loved oratory and would make it an extraordinary thing in a man, like Demosthenes. "And the priest of Jupiter who was before the city, having brought bulls and garlands to the gates, would have done sacrifice along with the crowds. But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having heard it, rent their garments, and rushed out to the crowd, crying and saying, Men, why do ye these things?". See how the apostolic voice is there; "Why do ye these things? *We* also are men of like passions with you, preaching to you to turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things in them; who in the past generations suffered all the nations to go in their own ways, though indeed he did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. And saying these things, they with difficulty kept the crowds from sacrificing to them". They would set up the old pagan empire; that is what the devil would do. Then it says, as if God came in to check all this, "But there came Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds and stoned Paul, drew him out of the city". See how they turn; we cannot trust them, politicians and the like. "Having persuaded the crowds and stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing him to have died. But while
{544}
the disciples encircled him". Now we come back to the circle of fellowship which has come into strong vogue amongst us, the word 'circle'. It really originates in Mark. "He rose up and entered into the city". So that the circle of the saints is now the great thought among the brethren; the circle.
P.O. There is power in life there.
J.T. Yes; where the circle is there is a link all around. I suppose there is some allusion to it in the heavens. There are certain things in an astronomical sense that would suggest the idea of a circle, how the brethren move together and how they love one another. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13: 35. That is the word, love amongst yourselves; love is amongst us.
V.C.L. Does it extend the thought of revival from Paul and Barnabas to where the system itself is now able to carry the matter on? I was thinking of the circle of the saints. The saints are now all filled with what was started by Paul and Barnabas.
J.T. So that it says, "And having announced the glad tidings". The word 'circle' is the word one would not like to get away from. "But while the disciples encircled him, he rose up and entered into the city". As you were saying, the idea of life comes in, and I believe the idea of resurrection enters into this chapter; the principle of resurrection, not simply the raising up of the man, the lame man, but the principle of resurrection in the apostle; in the minister. "And having announced the glad tidings to that city, and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch", (this is Antioch in Pisidia) "establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to abide in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God. And having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings,
{545}
they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed". And then the chapter runs on to what we have already alluded to. "And having arrived, and having brought together the assembly, they related to them all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations". The assembly there would be the assembly at Antioch proper (chapter 13: 1). This is a great matter. "And they stayed no little time with the disciples". This is a point that has come up lately, that brethren who have gift to go out to use their gift and exercise it, and perhaps ignore the local conditions in which they may be set; the home front, as we may call it. It has come up in London, and New York, and many places, so that the servants have to be watchful not to forget the home front in exercising their gift; but to stay with the brethren. "And they stayed no little time with the disciples". That is with the disciples in Antioch.
G.V.D. What quality of the apostle is suggested in his desire to return to the points he had previously visited?
J.T. Just to see how they got on. What is alluded to is characteristic of Timothy. He had no one like-minded who cared how the saints got on. I think it would be a general feature of a servant, that he has an eye on how the saints get on; not simply their conversion, but how they get on.
A.A.T. Was Paul local at Antioch?
J.T. Well, I should not like to say that, but he certainly showed something of that kind. He would be concerned about the local conditions at Antioch. As someone said this morning, it was a key city; it was for a time at least, and Paul would be concerned that it should remain that. It would be a power in Syria and no doubt it was. His presence there would make it that. So that he and Barnabas acted as local brothers really, going up as sort of
{546}
delegates to Jerusalem in this matter of circumcision.
A.A.T. Sometimes our brethren have the privilege of going to a distance and ministering and then coming back. We are glad to see them, but should they be encouraged to report something of their visit and the intercourse with the brethren?
J.T. That is too metropolitan. I do not think I would encourage that too much. Let them tell it in an ordinary way; let it come out. Paul says about the Corinthians that he told everywhere in every place how they were getting on; he made much of the Corinthians. I believe that it is a matter that should be casual rather than formal. We are apt to sink down into formalities. I notice in certain parts that I visit, not so much in this country, that they usually have prayer before going to bed, which is nice, but it is apt to be formal; and if a brother is staying there and he is tired he cannot go to bed until that happens. I think we ought to be on our guard against mere formalities. "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", @1 Corinthians 7: 17. He would do certain things and what he would do would have power in it; but we might do it and it would lose its power.
C.A.M. I think that is a very good suggestion. I suppose in a place like that the man would say the same thing every night.

PETER AND JOHN IN @JOHN 21
@John 21: 14 - 25
The chapter which we have read is supplementary to the general field of this gospel, and being thus supplementary, it affords some opportunity for a review of the whole gospel. There is no thought now to review the whole gospel, but simply to consider briefly certain features small enough to be contained in the time available.
What is in mind is mainly the apostles Peter and John. They have a great part in the book, but Peter particularly has a great part in the scope of the truth expressed in the whole four gospels. He therefore, rightly comes into mind as worthy of mention. Not indeed critically, although the Spirit of God is critical of Peter, but He commends him too. He says "first, Simon". He gives him first place in the apostolic service of the twelve. All of them have a great place, even Matthias. They are all seen as the Holy Spirit came down from heaven, or was sent down from heaven, as recorded in the second chapter of the Acts. And the saints were concerned about the apostle's teaching and fellowship, the breaking of bread, and prayers. The converts at the outset were marked in this way; they were subject to apostolic ministry, and were formed by it. And what they were formed by should form us; we should be formed in our minds and affections by apostolic ministry. As I said, Peter had the first place. It is clear that he was worthy of that place. He is mentioned earlier with John, too. After the Lord had become Man, He was at the Sea of Galilee and He saw Peter and Andrew and called them. At the same time He called the sons of Zebedee, John and James. They too were to be included in the apostolic service as fishers of men. These are matters of importance and of
{548}
guidance, especially as showing how Peter and John deserved to be under review at such a time in this chapter. They are found in the gospels of Mark and Luke, as among the twelve. They are not formally named in John as in the other gospels, but John does name Peter and he alludes to himself as that disciple "whom Jesus loved", @John 13: 23. Peter is named too, and distinguished in the fact that he was called Cephas, meaning a stone. He was to be a stone in the divine structure, in the assembly. He is also named in chapter 6, as saying to the Lord, when He had inquired as to whether they would go away, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God", @John 6: 68, 69. Peter had that honour in answering the Lord's question, as well as a similar but greater honour in @Matthew 16: 16, as he conveyed the Father's mind that He was "the Christ, the Son of the living God". The Lord called him "blessed" because he confessed that. These are distinguishing features of Peter, and they are to be understood by us and should enter into what is to be said about Peter and John in the chapter read.
Now it is in order to speak of the occasion of which we have a record in this chapter. Peter led in the matter. He said, "I go to fish", and the others said, "We also come with thee". What is to be remarked is that, although they had been called away from the fishing industry, never to return to it, yet at this particular juncture they returned to it. They were at the sea of Tiberias, far away from the regular services of the twelve, although at the beginning they laboured much there with the Lord. But this occasion is different from all the other occasions, because it was *after* the Lord had died and risen again from among the dead, that these seven apostles undertook to go fishing. I am not going to be critical for the
{549}
reason that the Lord does not criticise them. It is a paragraph of grace. One would love nothing more than to convey to the dear brethren the thought of unmingled grace. The Lord did not criticize; He sees them from the land and says, "Children, have ye anything to eat?". You might say there should have been a severe reprimand. But no, the Lord is saying that it is not the time for reprimand. There may be good cause for it in these parts, but it is not regarded as the time for it; rather it is the time of grace. The Lord would bathe our souls in grace that we might become gracious, and learn to renounce the works of the flesh. Grace reigns and it leads to that in our souls. The Lord loves to surprise us in that way, even when we are worthy of reproof. So He says, "Children, have ye anything to eat?". That is a beautiful touch of grace on the Lord's part, and if anyone is undeserving of it, let it come in anyway! It is intended for you. This is the period when grace reigns through righteousness. The Spirit of God would love nothing better, I would say that of myself, than that the saints should be affected by grace, that the grace of God should lay hold of our souls. God is God, and Christ is Christ, and the Spirit is the Spirit, and They are entitled to do what They wish to do. And They are doing it.
